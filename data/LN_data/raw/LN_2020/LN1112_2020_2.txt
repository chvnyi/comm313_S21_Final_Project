US, China squeeze Brazil by 5G networkCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 27, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 375 wordsBodyBrasilia. Brazil's Vice President Hamilton Mourao said his country's "strategic partnership" with China will be central to the post-pandemic world amid tensions over the 5G network fueled by one of President Jair Bolsonaro's sons."The Brazilian government needs to walk alongside the Chinese government objectively," as the Asian giant has been its largest trading partner "for a decade" and one of the "few countries" with "technological and financial capacity and resources" for the period to follow the end of the coronavirus pandemic, he said.?? Stay informed on our Google News channelMourao participated in the opening of a seminar organized by the Brazilian-China Business Chamber and valued "the clarity" with which that Asian country "identifies the new dynamics of the global economy, with growth and sustainability".Mourao's speech was received by many businessmen as an intention to page a recent unrest with the Chinese government by DEPUTY Eduardo Bolsonaro, one of the sons of the ruler and chairman of the Lower House Foreign Commission.Last Monday, the MP posted on his social media a message in which he celebrated Brazil's accession to the Clean Network initiative, launched by outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump, creating a global alliance "for a safe, un espionage-free 5G from China."He also added a commentary on the "dangerous behaviour" of Chinese company Huawei, which intends to participate in the 5G tender that Brazil will call in 2021, which was immediately answered by the Chinese embassy in Brazil.Also through social media, the diplomatic delegation stated that Mr. Bolsonaro and other "personalities" of Brazil "have produced a series of infamous statements that disrespect Chinese-Brazilian cooperation, the mutual benefit it brings, and break the friendly atmosphere."He added that these positions follow the "rhetoric of the American far right" and that its leaders "will bear the negative consequences and historical responsibility to disturb the normality of the China-Brazil alliance."The Chinese embassy in turn received a response from Brazil's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which criticized the use of social media "to deal with issues of common interest" and warned that this is not a "constructive" practice.Load-Date: November 28, 2020End of Document

CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY MEMBERS WORKED IN FOREIGN CONSULATES: LEAKED LISTStates News ServiceDecember 14, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 894 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:A leaked database of Chinese Communist Party (CCP) members has revealed that Beijing has had loyal potential agents working in consulates, major multinational companies, and sensitive research facilities around the world, according to reports published in The Australian, the Mail on Sunda, and other news organizations.The database reveals details of 1.95 registered CCP members, who must swear an oath of loyalty and secrecy to the party, including a vow to "never betray the party."While the leaked list offers no evidence of covert intelligence operations, it details hundreds of senior employees in potentially sensitive areas around the world, including foreign diplomatic missions, who would be required to comply with any request to deliver intelligence to the Chinese government under the terms of their membership.Some of those on the leaked list are senior employees in foreign embassies, with intelligence operations potentially compromised by their presence.The database, which was handed to the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC) by an anonymous dissident after being leaked on the Telegram messaging app, also contains details of more than 150 lawmakers in parliaments around the world who are CCP members.Pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and AstraZeneca were revealed to have employed 123 CCP members in 2016, the year when the list was generated, the Mail on Sunday reported.HSBC and Standard Chartered had 600 CCP members working at 19 branches internationally in that year, while Airbus, Boeing, and Rolls-Royce had also hired hundreds of the names on the list, the report said.In the U.K., 30 MPs said they would be tabling an urgent question about the issue in the House of Commons, while former ruling Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith said CCP members must not be allowed to work in British consulates."The Government must now move to expel and remove any members of the Communist Party from our Consuls throughout China," Duncan Smith wrote in a commentary in the Mail on Sunday. "They can either serve the U.K. or the Chinese Communist Party. They cannot do both."A senior Whitehall intelligence source told the paper that CCP members could have identified intelligence officers if they were in the same building.The list mostly includes the details of CCP members based in Shanghai, in more than 79,000 branches, or cells. The CCP's total membership currently stands at more than 92 million, with a success rate of around 10 percent for aspiring members.Worldwide operationsIn 2018, RFA revealed that the CCP was expanding its operations far beyond China's borders, setting up branches to control the thinking of students and state employees overseas, to defend its citizens against "bad ideas," and to recruit new members.Party branches, or cells, have long been a feature of political life in mainland China, but are increasingly being used as a vehicle for the expansion of the party's United Front ideological campaign, which seeks to bring specific groups of people into the party's fold, as well as keeping tabs on what they are doing, saying, and even thinking.Party branches on overseas campuses formed by Chinese students aim to attract new members and provide "care and warmth" to patriotic Chinese studying overseas, according to university documents publicly available in 2018.A key driver of the proliferation of CCP activities overseas is the current focus on the political ideology of "core" leader Xi Jinping, who has expanded the ruling party's role in all aspects of domestic life, including the private sector, universities, and the media.Regular party activities are seen as an ideological line of defense against "bad ideas" like democracy, human rights, judicial independence, and the separation of powers, which Xi's leadership has ruled out as foreign imports aimed at overturning CCP rule.The practice also extends to groups of employees of the Chinese state working overseas, according to statements on the websites of state-owned enterprises available online in 2018.'Like a crime family'In his op-ed article, Duncan Smith likened CCP membership to "joining a crime family in the New York Mafia.""The CCP demands secrecy, cunning and utterly ruthless discipline from its millions of members. Notoriously secretive, its authority is absolute," he wrote.Duncan Smith also hit out at HSBC, saying he was unsurprised that the bank had hired so many CCP members, given that it had "rushed to freeze the bank accounts" of exiled former Hong Kong lawmaker and Democratic Party member Ted Hui, who has fled to the U.K. amid a crackdown on peaceful dissent in the city under Beijing's national security law.HSBC was revealed to have employed more than 300 CCP members, according to the leaked list, he said."The conduct of HSBC and other UK financial institutions is not just wrong but immoral," Duncan Smith wrote.The Chinese foreign ministry said the leak could lead to unjust actions against those named on it."There have been many injustices, and this problem runs very deep," the ministry said. "We call on everyone to distinguish fact from fiction, and not to be railroaded by certain forces.""Justice must be protected by relying on facts alone."Reported by RFA's Cantonese and Mandarin Services.

BANGLADESH INSTALLS LAST SPAN OF AMBITIOUS CHINESE-BACKED BRIDGE PROJECTStates News ServiceDecember 10, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 822 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Construction of the Padma Bridge Bangladesh's largest-ever infrastructure endeavor, which started in 2014 reached a milestone toward completion Thursday as workers installed the 41st and last span on the roadway section of the China-backed, 6-km-long project.Large crowds thronged as close as they could to the banks of the wide Padma River to witness a crane installing the bridge's last 150-meter span. The vehicular and railway portions of the double-decker bridge are slated to be finished in 2022 and 2024, respectively, officials said.Once completed, the bridge that connects Munshiganj district to Shariatpur and Madaripur districts is expected to reduce travel time sharply between the capital Dhaka and southern and southwestern Bangladesh.At 12:02 Thursday, the 41st and the last span was installed to complete the physical structure of the Padma Bridge. The bridge has connected the two sides of the Padma River, Dewan Muhammad Abdul Kader, an executive engineer working on the project, told BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service.But the two-level bridge is not yet fit for vehicular movement: we have yet to complete the approach roads and viaducts, set up railway slabs and other necessary physical works, he said.The railway portion is now on target for completion in June 2024 after construction ran two years behind schedule.The bridge will likely be opened for road traffic in a year's time, said Obaidul Quader, the Minister for Road Transport and Bridges.By the time the roadway level is completed, the history of ferrying residents between the 21 districts of southern Bangladesh and the capital Dhaka will end for good, the Chinese Embassy in Dhaka said in a statement. The original seven-to-eight hours of crossing the river will be shortened to 10 minutes.The bridge's road section, which costs U.S. $3.87 billion, is being funded by Bangladesh's government and being built by China Railway Major Bridge Engineering, a state-run company.The Chinese government agreed to finance 85 percent of the cost of the $4.8 billion rail portion through a loan to Bangladesh.The bridge would provide four lanes for road traffic on the top deck and a broad-gauge single railway track on the bottom deck.When fully built, economists forecast, the Padma Bridge could increase Bangladesh's gross domestic products (GDP) by 1.2 percent, because it will open investment in the south and southwestern regions that host two seaports Mongla and Payra.The bridge will also connect Bangladesh's premier Chittagong seaport directly with the main land port, Benapole, in Jashore district.Upon completion of the bridge, movement of people and goods will increase manifold, Fahmida Khatun, executive director of think-tank Center for Policy Dialogue, told BenarNews.The time and cost of transport will come down, contributing to the economy through creation of employment opportunities. The bridge will facilitate industrialization in the southwestern region.Delays in rail linkSince Bangladesh attained nationhood in 1971, successive governments had negotiated with various donor agencies to build a bridge over the Padma River.When the Sheikh Hasina government came to power in 2009, the prime minister sought funds for the bridge's construction from the World Bank, but the international financial institution turned down her request.The government then decided to build and fund the 6.15-km (3.82-mile) road bridge on its own. For the rail link, the government signed a loan agreement in 2016 with the Export-Import Bank of China.China Railway Engineering Corporation was contracted to build the rail link, which has been beset by delays since the project began in January 2016. China Railway Major Bridge Engineering is a unit of CREC.The rail link project was originally scheduled to be finished in June 2022. In January this year, the deadline was extended to June 2024.The outbreak of the coronavirus disease, which appears to have originated in Wuhan, China, led to additional delays earlier this year, as many Chinese engineers and employees who had gone home on visits were stuck there because of travel restrictions.Then in August, Shafiqul Islam, project director of the Padma Bridge, flagged concerns about CREC having altered the design of both the road and rail links.Islam said that CREC had reduced the height and width of both the rail and the road tiers. The bridge was not wide enough to handle the expected volume of traffic and there was not enough distance between the tiers for train traffic, he had said.That flaw has now been fixed, Islam told BenarNews on Thursday.The flaws detected in the rail link project have been corrected. Now, we do not see any problem in executing the whole project, Islam said.As of this month, the rail link is still scheduled to be completed in mid-2024.Reported by BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service.Load-Date: December 11, 2020End of Document

4 years in prison for Chinese journalist covering the epidemic in WuhanCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 28, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 651 wordsBodyMEXICO CITYA citizen journalist covering the covid-19 epidemic in Wuhan was sentenced to four years in prison on Monday, as long as the Chinese government boasts of its successes in the fight against the disease that has spread across the globe in a year.Zhang Zhan "She seemed very despondent when the ruling was announced," one of her lawyers, Ren Quanniu, declared he "very concerned" about her psychological condition, told the AFP.Documentary '76 Days' portrays quarantine in WuhanJournalists and foreign diplomats who traveled to the Shanghai court where this 37-year-old ex-abortion was tried were unable to enter the courtroom.Some of his supporters were repelled by security forces during the opening of the process, AFP journalists noted.Zhang Zhan could be convicted of up to five years in prison.A native of Shanghai, she traveled in February to Wuhan, at the time prey to the epidemic, and disseminated on social media reports, most of them about the chaotic situation in hospitals.According to the official balance sheet, nearly 4,000 covid-19 deaths were recorded in the metropolis of 11 million inhabitants, almost all of the 4,634 deaths counted across China between January and May.China's initial response to the epidemic has been criticized, as Beijing did not quarantine Wuhan and its region until 23 January, even though there had been cases since early December 2019.Nearly a year ago, on 31 December 2019, the first case was reported to the World Health Organization (WHO).But at the same time, doctors who mentioned the appearance of a mysterious virus were interrogated by police, who accused them of "spreading rumors."One of them, Dr. Li Wenliang, died of covid-19 in early February, which caused outrage on social media.- "Extraordinary" success -As for Zhang, she was arrested in May on charges of "riot provocation,"a terminology often used against opponents of President Xi Jinping's regime.Specifically, the court accuses her of having disseminated false information online, another lawyer of hers, Zhang Keke, told the AFP.The office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a tweet to be "deeply concerned" about Zhang Zhan's conviction.We mentioned the case to the authorities throughout 2020 to illustrate the excessive crackdown on press freedom linked to #covid-19 and continue to call for their release," he said.Zhang began a hunger strike in June to protest against her detention, but has been forced by nasal intubation, according to her lawyers.When I saw her last week, she said, 'If I get a strong sentence, I'll reject any food to the end.'

The US-China rivalry in tech and trade won't end because Joe Biden is presidentCNN WireNovember 9, 2020 Monday 10:43 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1149 wordsDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  President Donald Trump spent much of his term setting up Beijing as Washington's greatest political and economic adversary. Don't expect drastic changes when Joe Biden takes the helm, even if he eschews the bluster and unpredictability of his predecessor. Economists and trade experts believe that the United States and China will move further apart on trade and technology as Washington continues to scrutinize virtually every aspect of its relationship with the world's second-largest economy."We have a fundamental, systematic rivalry between these two systems," said Alex Capri, research fellow at the Hinrich Foundation and senior fellow and lecturer at the National University of Singapore. "In many ways, that rivalry is going to intensify."Fundamental tensionsThis year highlighted major tensions and a lack of trust between the world's two most powerful nations. Despite reaching a trade agreement in January, the United States and China still have yet to resolve several points of economic conflict, including US allegations that Beijing steals American tech and gives too much preferential treatment to state-owned corporations at the expense of foreign companies.Meanwhile, Washington has become increasingly wary of Chinese-made technology and whether it could be used to spy on Americans. That fear has caused lawmakers --- Republican and Democrat --- to view China as a major threat to US national security. Just look at the support for sanctions that Washington has slapped on tech firm Huawei and the steps US politicians are pushing to make it tougher for Chinese firms to trade on US exchanges, for example.The coronavirus has only compounded those differences as China and the United States trade accusations over starting and mishandling the pandemic. And clashes over Hong Kong and alleged human rights abuses in China's Xinjiang region have widened a political divide that will likely continue to grow in the years to come. "Biden has been pretty clear about how he wants to proceed, and there has been bipartisan support for a tough line," said William Reinsch, a trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who served for 15 years as president of the National Foreign Trade Council. He pointed out that the Senate could very well remain under Republican control in the new year. The best the Democrats can hope for is the narrowest of Senate majorities. The president-elect "will be under constant critical pressure from Republican China hawks in the Congress to be more aggressive," Reinsch told CNN Business late last week. "There's not a lot they can do about that in the short term besides complain, but it will make the atmosphere worse than it already is."A shift in toneThere will almost certainly be a change in style with the Biden administration. Trump isn't known for mincing words: He once said that the United States could not "continue to allow China to rape our country," and referred repeatedly to Covid-19 as the "China virus.""Biden's tone will be different, it will be much more diplomatic," said Capri of the Heinrich Foundation. He expects the new regime to more closely follow long-established procedure before slapping China with further tariffs or sanctions. He pointed out that thousands of American companies have sued the United States for imposing tariffs on Chinese goods, a decision they argue seriously harms their business. "There was just chaos in the Department of Commerce, frankly, during the Trump administration," Capri added. "Historically, the process is they consult with US industry." (The Trump administration has defended its hardline approach to China as necessary to right an imbalanced relationship, and the president told reporters in January that his "phase one" trade deal would create "economic justice" for Americans.)China appears to be preparing for less fiery rhetoric, too. Sidestepping questions about Beijing's stance on the US election outcome, the Chinese government said Monday it "noted" that Biden has declared victory, while acknowledging the election would be determined according to US laws and procedures."China and the United States should strengthen communication and dialogue," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters Monday, adding that such a desire extends to promoting "healthy and stable" relations.Chinese bureaucrats and diplomats are divided over whether Biden would be a better US figurehead to deal with than Trump, according to Ian Bremmer, president and founder of the consultancy Eurasia Group. China's "wolf warriors," the diplomats who aggressively defend Beijing and fiercely counter criticism about the country, would probably prefer Trump, since his leadership undermines America's traditional alliance partners and provides grounds for moral equivalence in terms of human rights and unilateralism, Bremmer said last week.On the whole though, "the Chinese don't want to see the US model implode," he added. "[They] realize they do benefit from a stable US that continues to play a large role in the global order."An inevitable untanglingNo matter how Biden talks about US-China relations, the two countries will likely continue trying to disentangle their economies.Analysts at JP Morgan wrote last month that a Biden victory would leave the two countries fighting over 5G networks, quantum computing, artificial intelligence and biotechnology. "In vying for dominance in these areas, the US and China have set about decoupling, reducing cooperation, restricting technology sharing, even shutting ... down trade in some cases," they wrote. Capri said that China has been preparing for a bigger rupture between the world's top two economies. "If you're China, you're not doing anything differently. You're in fact doubling down," he said, adding that he expects the country to further reduce its reliance on American products. Beijing has made boosting its technological capabilities and self-sufficiency a core part of its next Five-Year Plan, underscoring the policy's importance. "It's a massive problem for the Chinese Communist Party to be reliant on American technology," Capri said. "It's as simple as that."Beijing may also find that a Biden administration is much more effective in building an international coalition to challenge China over state subsidies, rights for foreign firms or intellectual property protection. US-EU relations have been fraught under Trump as the two allies tussle over trade."The absence of a common position among developed countries in recent years is largely because of the current US government's inclination to 'go it alone'," wrote Louis Kuijs, head of Asia Economics at Oxford Economics, in a research note on Monday. --- CNN's Beijing bureau and Hanna Ziady contributed to this report.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

REPORT: Chinese Tech Giant Tested Facial Recognition Software To Alert Authorities To UighursThe Daily CallerDecember 8, 2020 Tuesday 10:34 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICSLength: 523 wordsByline: Brianna Lyman, Reporter, brianna@dailycaller.comBodyLink to ImageChinese tech giant Huawei reportedly tested a facial recognition software that could send automated “Uighur alarms” to government authorities if a camera identified a Uighur in a crowd.The company began working with facial recognition start-up Megvii in 2018 to test the artificial intelligence software that could scan faces in a crowd and give estimates regarding their ethnicity, age and sex, according a document exclusively obtained by The Washington Post.However, if the software detected a Uighur, it could trigger an alarm that would then be sent to local authorities, according to the report.The system uses a number of facial photos to detect any patterns that would differentiate Uighurs from the Han majority, The Washington Post reported.Founder of IPVM, a Pennsylvania based company that reviews video-surveillance equipment said the documents showed a frightening reality. (RELATED: REPORT: China Forcing Uighur Muslims To Eat Pork On Holy Days, Will Turn Xinjiang Into 'Pig-Raising Hub')“This is not one isolated company,” he said, according to The Washington Post. “A lot of thought went into making sure this 'Uighur alarm' works.”Link to ImageThis photo taken on June 2, 2019 shows buildings at the Artux City Vocational Skills Education Training Service Center, believed to be a re-education camp where mostly Muslim ethnic minorities are detained, north of Kashgar in China's northwestern Xinjiang region.

Huawei only supplies general-purpose products for this kind of testing. We do not provide custom algorithms or applications,” according to the report.Republican Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse said the U.S. needs to send a clear message to Huawei in an official statement.“The Chinese Community Party's ugly techno-authoritarianism is depriving Uyghurs of their human rights. While Huawei sells contracts with fancy talk about connecting people around the world, they're working to send Uyghurs to torture camps in China.”“The United States should send a clear signal to the rest of the world: Doing business with Huawei has real costs. If you get into bed with these genocidal maniacs, every aspect of our relationship is up for reconsideration,” Sasse continued.China has been escalating their attacks on the Uighur's, a minority Muslim group in China. In July it was revealed that hackers linked to the Chinese government had been spying on Uighurs since 2013 by hacking cell phone apps.Uighur's are also forced into detention camps where they are forced to undergo abortions and other sterilization processes, according to the Associated Press. China, which is suspected of keeping more than 1 million Uighurs in detention camps in Xinjiang, uses the minority population for forced labor.Graphic TURPAN, CHINA - SEPTEMBER 12: (CHINA OUT) A Uyghur family pray at the grave of a loved one on the morning of the Corban Festival on September 12, 2016 at a local shrine and cemetery in Turpan County, in the far western Xinjiang province, China.The Corban festival, known to Muslims worldwide as Eid al-Adha or 'feast of the sacrifice', is celebrated by ethnic Uyghurs across Xinjiang, the far-western region of China bordering Central Asia that is home to roughly half of the country's 23 million Muslims. The festival, considered the most important of the year, involves religious rites and visits to the graves of relatives, as well as sharing meals with family. Although Islam is a 'recognized' religion in the constitution of officially atheist China, ethnic Uyghurs are subjected to restrictions on religious and cultural practices that are imposed by China's Communist Party. Ethnic tensions have fueled violence that Chinese authorities point to as justification for the restrictions. (Photo by Kevin Frayer/Getty Images)Load-Date: December 8, 2020End of Document

FCC Chairman Pai Issues Statement on China Telecom Corp.Targeted News ServiceDecember 16, 2020 Wednesday 7:50 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 715 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Federal Communications Commission issued the following statement on Dec. 15 by Chairman Ajit Pai on China Telecom Corp. (GN Docket Nos. 20-109, ITC-214-20010613-00346, ITC-214-20020716-00371, ITC-T/C-20070725-00285):* * *Today, we initiate a proceeding to end China Telecom (Americas) Corporation's authority to provide domestic interstate and international telecommunications services within the United States. And for good reason.Earlier this year, several Executive Branch agencies recommended that we revoke and terminate China Telecom Americas' international section 214 authorizations. Among other troubling allegations, the Executive Branch agencies maintain that China Telecom Americas has failed to comply not only with prior commitments it made in order to retain access to the U.S. market but also with federal and state cybersecurity and privacy laws. The Executive Branch agencies further contend that China Telecom Americas' operations "provide opportunities for increased Chinese state-sponsored cyber activities, including economic espionage and the disruption and misrouting of U.S. communications traffic." China Telecom Americas is ultimately owned and controlled by the government of the People's Republic of China, which is of course dominated by the Chinese Communist Party. And in January 2018, China Telecom Americas' parent company amended its Articles of Association to give the Chinese Communist Party greater control over its management and operations. These changes, combined with recently enacted Chinese laws, "raise significant concerns that [China Telecom Americas] will be forced to comply with Chinese government requests, including requests for communications intercepts, without the ability to challenge such requests," according to the Executive Branch agencies.Moreover, China Telecom Americas' international section 214 authority is conditioned upon it abiding by the commitments it made in a 2007 letter of assurances to the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Department of Homeland Security. But there are troubling indications that China Telecom Americas has not done so. For example, China Telecom Americas purportedly made inaccurate statements to U.S. authorities about where it stored U.S. records. And it failed to notify Executive Branch agencies when it filed applications with the FCC for International Signaling Point Code assignments--a requirement of its mitigation agreement with the Executive Branch. China Telecom Americas has also allegedly failed to respond promptly to requests for information made by the federal government.Taken together, these allegations raise serious doubts about whether China Telecom Americas should be allowed to continue operating in the United States. And to date, the company has not provided the FCC with a satisfactory response to the concerns raised by the Executive Branch agencies. We are therefore compelled to act to protect the integrity of our telecommunications networks and our national security. Specifically, we institute proceedings to revoke and terminate China Telecom Americas' authority to operate in the United States while ensuring that the company is afforded a full and fair opportunity to explain itself. This decision, along with many others we have made since 2017, demonstrates that this FCC is determined to protect the security of America's communications networks.I want to thank the FCC staff who have worked on this important item: From the International Bureau: Denise Coca, Kate Collins, Francis Gutierrez, Jocelyn Jezierny, Gabrielle Kim, Tom Sullivan, and Troy Tanner; from the Wireline Competition Bureau: Pamela Arluk, Dennis Johnson, Jodie May, Kris Monteith, Ramesh Nagarajan, and Terri Natoli; from the Enforcement Bureau: Michael Engel, Jeffrey Gee, Rosemary Harold, and Pamela Kane; from the Office of Economics and Analytics: Robert Cannon, Wayne Leighton, Giulia McHenry, Virginia Metallo, and Emily Talaga; from the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau: Kenneth Carlberg, Jeffery Goldthorp, and Debra Jordan; and from the Office of General Counsel: Michael Carlson, Tom Johnson, Doug Klein, David Konczal, Joel Rabinovitz, Bill Richardson, and Royce Sherlock.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7326893 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: December 16, 2020End of Document

THE FIRST AMENDMENT FIGHT AGAINST THE WECHAT BANStates News ServiceDecember 7, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 988 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, NY BodyThe following information was released by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU):Imagine waking up one day, unlocking your phone, and realizing that you could no longer send or receive messages through your favorite app. Or make or receive calls. Or scroll through your social media feed. Imagine that all of these functions were rolled into one essential app that you and your friends, family, and co-workers depended on, and that the U.S. government had decided to ban it.That's exactly what the Trump administration is attempting to do with WeChat, a communications app that millions of people in the United States depend on to connect with friends, family, and business contacts across the world.On Friday, we and the ACLU of Northern California asked the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to block the Trump administration's autocratic effort to ban WeChat. Our friend-of-the-court brief, filed in support of a group of WeChat users who have challenged the ban, explains why the administration's actions violate the First Amendment.The First Amendment protects our freedom of speech. It applies here because WeChat users depend on the app for a wide variety of speech and expression. Nineteen million Americans, primarily Chinese Americans, rely on WeChat daily to call and message with friends, family, and colleagues. The app is no ordinary communications tool: It's also a platform for social media, news, money transfers, and e-commerce. It hosts an enormous community more than one billion users worldwide that simply can't be replicated. For many of WeChat's users, the app is their primary or only source of communication with friends and family in China, where the government blocks popular messaging platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram.In August 2020, the Trump administration issued an executive order declaring WeChat a threat to national security. As we explained at the time, WeChat, like many U.S.-owned social media and messaging apps, including Facebook and Instagram, does collect broad categories of user data. Concern about how this data is used and protected is warranted. In the case of WeChat, there is also some legitimate concern about whether user data is accessible by the Chinese government. But the Trump administration made no attempt to address this concern in a way that would minimize interference with WeChat users' speech, as the First Amendment requires. Instead, the administration's stated goal is to make it impossible to use WeChat in its entirety.After the coalition of WeChat users challenged the ban in court, the district court found that there were substantial questions about the constitutionality of the ban, and the court issued a preliminary order that prevented it from going into effect. The government then appealed that decision to the Ninth Circuit.Our brief in support of the WeChat users makes two key arguments about why the government's ban violates the First Amendment.First, the ban prohibits people from speaking or expressing themselves before they can even do so. It's what the Supreme Court has called a "prior restraint" on expression one of the most serious and least tolerable infringements on First Amendment rights. Prior restraints are a greater threat to our rights than laws that prohibit or criminalize certain speech after it's uttered. That's because they prevent speech from happening at all. Here, by banning WeChat, the government is preventing all of the communications that 19 million Americans are having each day on the app.It is a dangerous thing for any government to decide what people can or can't say before they even say it. Governments can use that power against people whose opinions it does not like and wants to suppress. Or it could use a power like this in discriminatory ways, based on bias a serious concern here.Given these dangers, courts require the government to meet an exceptionally high burden when it seeks to justify this type of restriction on speech. The government must be able to point to immediate, irreparable harm from the banned speech, and its restriction on the speech must be as narrow as possible to prevent that harm from occurring.The government's sweeping ban on WeChat plainly fails that test.In court, the government argues that its ban doesn't implicate the First Amendment at all, because its actions were technically directed toward WeChat's infrastructure, not the First Amendment-protected speech of WeChat's users. But the government has acknowledged that its prohibitions will make the app unusable. And its legal argument ignores Supreme Court precedent, which makes clear that even when the government restricts speech indirectly, those restrictions can be prior restraints.Second, even if the ban isn't viewed as a prior restraint, it's plainly a "total ban" another kind of government action that, under the First Amendment, demands close scrutiny by courts. Where the government bans a medium of expression that is "unique" and "important," courts require the government to meet a very high bar to justify the ban: It cannot suppress more speech than necessary to address the harm. In practice, broad bans like this one never pass that test.Here, the government has banned an undeniably unique and valuable platform for users to express themselves. As the district court found, "WeChat is irreplaceable for its users in the U.S., particularly in the Chinese-speaking and Chinese-American community." Because the government's actions against WeChat suppress more speech than necessary, they violate the First Amendment.With inauguration on the horizon, there may be reason to hope that the Biden-Harris administration will withdraw the WeChat ban. President-elect Biden hasn't yet taken a public position on it, but given the high First Amendment stakes, withdrawal should be a no-brainer. In the meantime, we're pressing for the First Amendment rights of WeChat users in court.Load-Date: December 7, 2020End of Document

DF Connection to China Chile on the Digital Silk RoadCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 9, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 493 wordsBodyLucas Marinovic and Felipe BarrientosChinese investment in Chile continues to grow rapidly. The recent announcement on the acquisition of CGE power and the participation of Chinese state-owned enterprises in infrastructure concessions seems to have opened their eyes to many about what is already a reality in other parts of the world. However, one sector where we could see a growing activity of Chinese capital is in technology.The form of Chinese foreign investment in technology depends to a large extent on the level of technological development of the destination country. Much has been said about attempts by powers such as the United States, Europe and India to block strategic Chinese investments to accelerate the development of their native technology. What many are unaware of, however, is that much of China's investment in technology has been based outside the world's major powers, in Asian and African countries that are part of the Belt and Road Initiative. In these areas, Chinese investments have focused on building enabling digital infrastructure and acquiring local digital services companies.What has been referred to by the Chinese government as the Digital Silk Road, brings together a number of initiatives related to the construction of enabling technological infrastructure in Asian and African developing countries, those that do not have the resources or government initiative to carry out these projects on their own and have also been forgotten by Western powers. Thus, we see that technological giants such as Huawei, ZTE, Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent, have made significant investments in the construction of submarine fiber optic cables, 5G technology, data centers, smart cities and "technological villas" in countries as diverse as Egypt, South Africa, Pakistan, Malaysia and the Philippines.In addition, Chinese private capital has begun to take a relevant position in investing in digital services companies in these regions by acquiring local startups with high scaling potential at the regional level. Unlike investment in digital infrastructure, this type of Chinese investment is born organically from venture capital funds and Chinese technology companies, which see an opportunity to reach a large base of new users. Chinese experience in developing innovative business models and the great capacity of their companies to adapt to local markets have enabled them to lead investment rounds over $100 million in e-commerce and fintech in regional hubs such as Kenya, Nigeria and Singapore.Latin America shares many of the features that have attracted the attention of Chinese technology capitals to Asia and Africa, such as the need for financing for the construction of digital infrastructure and a large user base to add to the digital economy. We should not be surprised, then, by the arrival of a new wave of Chinese capital in the country, which could be decisive in Chile's positioningas a regional technology hub.Load-Date: December 10, 2020End of Document

Chinese regulation of big tech companies alerts more entrepreneursCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 10, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 885 wordsBody(Bloomberg) -- Xi Jinping's Communist Party is stepping up its efforts to curb some of China's most powerful companies, shaking investors and slamming the country's wealthiest entrepreneurs.Beijing unveiled regulations on Tuesday to eradicate monopoly practices in the Internet industry, seeking to reduce the growing influence of corporations such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. The rules, which caused the fall of both shares and led to a massive sale in Chinese stocks, come about a week after the new restrictions in the financial sector that triggered ant Group Co.'s sudden suspension of the initial $35 billion public offering.While Xi's government has been constantly strengthening its control over the world's second-largest economy, it had until recently remained relatively far removed from companies that dominate China's burgeoning Internet, e-commerce and digital finance industries. The authorities are concerned that companies have become too powerful, according to Ma Chen, a partner in The Beijing-based Han Kun law offices."This is a turning point," said Ma, who specializes in antitrust law.Only Alibaba, Ant and Tencent had a combined market capitalization of nearly US$2 trillion before last week, easily outperduing state giants such as Bank of China Ltd. as the country's most valuable companies. Tuesday's mass sale caused Alibaba's shares to fall 5.1% to their lowest level since September 29 in Hong Kong, while analysts have estimated that Ant's $280 billion valuation could be halved due to stricter regulations. Both companies were co-founded by billionaire Jack Ma, China's most celebrated entrepreneur.Tencent, the gaming and payout giant whose rise made his co-founder Pony Ma the richest man in China, fell 4.4% on Tuesday. It was the second largest contributor to the 0.4% drop in the Hang Seng Chinese business index. Meituan, the home food startup that has since expanded to hotel bookings and cinema tickets, recorded the biggest losses, with a drop of 10.5%. The company declined to comment, while representatives of Alibaba and Tencent did not respond immediately to inquiries.China's antitrust control body is seeking feedback on a number of regulations that establish a framework for curbing anti-competitive behavior, such as collusion to share sensitive consumer data, alliances that squeeze smaller rivals, and below-cost subsidy services to eliminate competitors. They may also require companies operating the so-called Variable Interest Entity, a vehicle through which virtually all major Chinese Internet companies attract foreign investment and trade abroad, to seek specific operational approval.The latest proposal follows increased scrutiny from technology companies around the world, as regulators investigate the extent to which Internet giants from Facebook Inc. to Alphabet Inc. Google can take advantage of their dominance. Consumers in China, home to some of the world's largest corporations from e-commerce giant Alibaba to weChat operator Tencent, have protested in recent years against the gradual erosion of their privacy through technology, from facial recognition to big data analysis.Beijing is increasingly seeking to lessen the influence that a handful of its technology corporations wieldover vast sectors of the economy. Last year, he investigated Tencent's music subsidiary's exclusive agreements with publishers and, more recently, modified regulations to control risk in fast-growing microcredit entities such as Ant Group. The most recent move last week derailed Ant's planned IPO, before completing what would have been the world's largest offering."There seems to be a broader perception by the Chinese government that Internet platforms are becoming too powerful," said Hoi Tak Leung, a Hong Kong-based lawyer who specializes in Chinese Internet companies at Ashurst LLP. "This would also be consistent with global events."The new rules were proposed in accordance with China's Antitrust Act and were based on it, which in January included for the first time a broad section governing Internet companies. They restrict targeting specific customers through their online behavior, a common practice adopted by companies both in China and abroad. According to regulations disclosed by the State Market Regulation Administration, violators may be forced to deinvest assets, intellectual property or technologies, open their infrastructure and adjust their algorithms. The supervisory body will seek feedback from the public on regulations until November 30.Representatives of Alibaba, Tencent, ByteDance Ltd., owner of TikTok, and 24 other tech giants attended a meeting with regulators from the antitrust and cyberspace authorities earlier this month to discuss issues ranging from unfair competition to counterfeiting. "Internet platforms are not outside the scope of antitrust laws, nor are they the breeding ground for unfair competition," regulators said in a later statement.Further measures to strengthen supervision of technology companies may be introduced soon. Regulators plan to publish new rules governing Internet transactions in June 2021, according to a statement issued Tuesday by the State Council.Original Note:China Clampdown on Big Tech Puts More Billionaires on Notice (1)©2020 Bloomberg L.P.Load-Date: November 11, 2020End of Document

Trump is targeting China's national champions on his way out the doorCNN WireDecember 4, 2020 Friday 9:35 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 967 wordsDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  The Trump administration is continuing to inflict damage on China's prized businesses in its final weeks, with actions that could make it harder for President-elect Joe Biden to rebuild relations once he takes office. The latest move came Thursday when the US Department of Defense added China's top chipmaker SMIC, oil giant CNOOC and several other firms to a list of companies that the department claims are owned or controlled by the Chinese military. That means they're now subject to restrictions, including a ban on Americans investing in them. Analysts had been expecting the current US administration to keep lashing out at China until the very end of its term with the aim of entrenching President Donald Trump's approach to Beijing and making it harder for Biden to reverse course. "The rush by China hardliners to push out actions against China by January 20 has short-circuited an already disorganized policy process," said Michael Hirson, practice head of China and Northeast Asia at Eurasia Group. January 20 is Biden's inauguration date. There are no clear criteria for a military-linked company, Hirson said, but the Trump administration appears to be interpreting it broadly to mean companies that directly or indirectly support China's military modernization."That is a particularly broad net for China's state-owned enterprises," he said. Beijing on Friday protested against CNOOC, SMIC and other companies being added to the Defense Department's list, and called on the United States to stop abusing the concept of national security. "China firmly rejects the United States' unwarranted oppression against Chinese companies," China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Hua Chunying told reporters.SMIC said in a filing to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange that there "there is no major impact" on its operation after being added to the Defense Department's list. The company added that its semiconductors are for civilian and commercial use, and that it has no relationship with the Chinese military. The US government has had SMIC in its cross hairs for months. Earlier this year, it warned companies against doing business with the Chinese company because of its perceived ties to the military. Targeting SMIC strikes at the heart of Beijing's tech ambitions. China is playing catchup to the West when it comes to chipmaking, and has plowed billions of dollars into the industry hoping to build a homegrown company capable of manufacturing leading edge chips.CNOOC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An executive order that Trump signed last month barring US firms from investing in companies on the Defense Department's list, meanwhile, has now grown to include 35 Chinese businesses.Smartphone maker Huawei and Hikvision, one of the world's largest manufacturers and suppliers of video surveillance equipment, are on the list. Some of the other companies listed, including China Telecom, China Mobile and now CNOOC, trade on the New York Stock Exchange. US investors are banned from owning or trading any securities that originate or are exposed to those firms. Investors will have until November 2021 to divest from the companies.And Trump still has more ammunition he could fire at Chinese companies. Earlier this week, the US House of Representatives passed a bill that could kick several Chinese firms off Wall Street. The bill, which would prevent companies that refuse to open their books to US accounting regulators from trading on US stock exchanges, won unanimous backing in the Senate earlier this year. It only needs Trump's signature to become law.Trump will, "with near certainty," sign off on the bill before his term comes to an end, according to Shirley Yu, visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and founder of a company that assesses strategy, business, and political risk for companies working in China.Backed "with unanimous congressional support, this decision will be extremely hard to reverse by the next administration," she added. The president could also revive the US-China trade war. China has not fulfilled its commitments to buy $200 billion worth of US products, which was part of the "phase one" trade deal signed earlier this year, according to Yu.Which means that "Trump can unilaterally raise tariffs on Chinese goods again ... [and] impose higher punitive tariffs," she said. Washington's China hawks are also eyeing major Chinese tech brands, such as Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu, according to Hirson. Trump has already tried to go after Tencent, signing an executive order in August to ban its WeChat app from operating in the United States. A US judge temporarily blocked the order in late September. And a US appeals court in October rejected the US government's request to immediately ban WeChat from app stores in the country.The Chinese tech giants could still be added to a list which bars American companies from exporting goods to them without first obtaining a license to do so, according to Hirson."Some in the administration have been pushing to add one or more of these firms to the Commerce Department's entity list or take other executive actions towards these firms," he said. Companies added to the entity list --- which is separate from the Defense Department's list --- are essentially cut off from US supplies and technologies. Washington added Huawei to the list last year, citing national security risks. Huawei, which has long denied that any of its products pose national security risks, has since seen its global business crippled by the US restrictions.

Chairman Neal Calls for Re-Commitment to Securing U.S. Trade Deal With EuropeTargeted News ServiceDecember 12, 2020 Saturday 8:30 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 815 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyRep. Richard E. Neal, D-Massachusetts, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, issued the following statement on Dec. 11:* * *Today, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard E. Neal (D-MA) released the following statement calling for the United States to prioritize resuming trade cooperation and negotiations with Europe:"The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement - which House Democrats vastly improved - provides a new standard for trade deals that our nation can use as the framework on which to build a revitalized partnership with Europe. For both economic and geopolitical reasons, prioritizing the pursuit of such an agreement is a strategically sound choice at this consequential moment for our country."The year 2020 has upended the lives of millions of Americans struggling to sustain themselves and their families through crises in public health, economic security, and racial inequity. Over the coming months and years, we will need to rebuild our economy, renew our infrastructure, reinvigorate our manufacturing and industrial capabilities, and uplift our workers and citizens. The Trump Administration's years of haphazard economic policies and bungling of the COVID crisis will make this work even more difficult."Meanwhile, China is on track to overtake the United States as the world's largest economy as soon as 2024, according to the World Economic Forum. From infrastructure development and modernization, to manufacturing expansion, to the creation of a state-issued cryptocurrency, the Chinese Government has spent much of the last decade taking unparalleled actions to strengthen the country's economic might and exert its influence in the global marketplace."The Trump Administration's unsophisticated response to these economic and industrial ambitions was limited to laying down tariffs on nearly $400 billion in Chinese imports. Unbothered, China has advanced other troubling initiatives. It's forcibly assimilated Uyghur and other Muslim and religious minority populations, including through the use of concentration camps and forced labor. Just this year the government has brazenly taken steps to snuff out democratic institutions and practices in Hong Kong. And now, China is menacing Taiwan with threats of invasion."President Trump and his advisers' narrow fixation on tariffs and exclusions missed the forest for the trees. With a new administration on the horizon, now is the time for a full recalibration in how we counterbalance China. We need to think big and act bigger. This is the 21st century's Sputnik moment - on steroids."We must work across disciplines to formulate a strategic, far-reaching, forward-looking, robust package of programs and investments to defend against anti-competitive, anti-democratic influences of China's policies. Doing so will allow us to propel American workers, manufacturers, industries, farmers, and innovators into a vibrant future where our prosperity and our values - freedom, equality, and justice - are inclusive."It is essential we engage with allies to accomplish these goals, even though finding common cause and interests is not always easy. Strengthening and recommitting to our alliances with the European Union, our neighbors on the American continent, in Asia, and in Africa will be key to our success. If our earlier trade and economic policies led us to four years of the Trump Administration, the four years of the Trump Administration must lead us somewhere new and better. We cannot afford to pursue strategies that recreate the tired and fragile dynamics of the past."One particularly detrimental blunder of President Trump's was his abandonment of serious trade talks with Europe. Not only did the Trump Administration put Europe on the backburner, it took active measures to provoke and alienate our European counterparts, to the delight of countries like China and Russia."Our partners across the Atlantic have shown a willingness to embark on a new, substantial trade relationship with the United States, and we should embrace this opportunity. A new U.S.-European trade arrangement will only enhance our ability to moderate China's intensifying pursuit of growth and prosperity, which threatens to subject the rest of the world to its economic and political dominance."Some in Congress like to talk tough but then take every chance to water down strong China bills. Others make hawkish speeches, then do nothing, claiming that plans and investments cost too much. There is no more time for lip service. It is 2020, and China is unapologetically ambitious and unembarrassed by its authoritarian stripes. Concrete, bold action - like achieving a new trade deal with Europe - is necessary for our nation's and people's future economic success. Otherwise, the fault for America's decline and loss of relevance will be no one's but our own."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7324260 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: December 12, 2020End of Document

Shanghai airport momentarily descends into chaos after workers test positive for Covid-19CNN WireNovember 23, 2020 Monday 9:33 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 985 wordsDateline: (CNN) Body (CNN) --  Shanghai's biggest international airport momentarily descended into chaos Sunday night, after authorities ordered a mass testing drive in response to a small outbreak of Covid-19 linked to several cargo handlers.Since the beginning of November, seven cargo workers and their close contacts at the Shanghai Pudong International Airport have been diagnosed as confirmed coronavirus cases, including two reported on Sunday.In a bid to contain the cluster, authorities ordered all cargo staff at the airport to undergo coronavirus tests overnight and set up a temporary testing site on the second floor of a parking garage, according to a statement from the Shanghai government.Photos and videos circulating on Chinese social media show hundreds of people packed closely together inside the garage -- the opposite of social distancing -- with a line of people in hazmat suits trying to hold back crowds pushing forward.But the chaos appeared to have calmed before midnight, when the airport police posted photos on Weibo showing workers lining up orderly for the tests.As of Monday morning, 17,719 samples had been collected. Of the 11,544 samples that have been tested, all received negative results, officials said at a news conference.While the initial chaos has drawn criticism on Chinese social media, the swift, drastic response over just a few cases highlights the length the Chinese government is willing to go to in order to stamp out any resurgence of the virus.China's zero-tolerance approach is in stark contrast to the United States, which is struggling to cope with its largest wave of infections since the pandemic began. Contact tracing seems almost impossible, with daily new cases above 100,000 for three straight weeks.On Saturday, the US caseload surpassed 12 million -- an increase of more than 1 million cases in less than a week. On the same day, US President Donald Trump skipped a special side-conference focused on the pandemic during his final Group of 20 summit. Trump was spotted at his golf course outside of Washington, DC, while world leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and South Korean President Moon Jae-in discussed global responses to the virus and how to improve pandemic preparedness.Zero-tolerance approachIn China, several cities have reported new coronavirus cases over the past week -- and all have been met with immediate action from authorities, from extensive testing and contact tracing to partial lockdowns. In the port city of Tianjin, some 600 miles (965 kilometers) from Shanghai, authorities are testing 2.6 million residents in one district after reporting five locally transmitted cases on Friday, the Tianjin Health Commission said in a statement. The mass testing, which started on Saturday, will cover all residents living in the Binhai New Area district, and is expected to be completed in three days.As of Sunday evening, Tianjin has received more than 2.25 million test samples, of which over 1 million have come back negative, the health commission said. The more targeted approach -- focusing on one district instead of the entire city of 15 million people -- differs from the city-wide testing drives adopted by large cities such as Wuhan and Qingdao during earlier local outbreaks. Smaller cities, however, appear intent on testing every resident. Manzhouli, a major land port on the Chinese border with Russia, announced plans to test the whole city in three days after two local infections were reported Saturday. According to the Global Times, a state-run tabloid, a total of 300,000 residents will be tested.Manzhouli's main train station has suspended operations, while its airport has halted all transfer flights to the regional capital of Hohhot. Schools are suspended, mass gatherings are banned, and non-essential businesses are closed, according to the city government.While these measures have become a standard response to new outbreaks in China, other governments have so far appeared reluctant to introduce similar measures.In Hong Kong, the local government tried to roll out city-wide testing for its 7 million residents during its third wave of infections in September. In the end, only 1.7 million people showed up for the two-week testing drive.As the city faces another surge in coronavirus cases, Health Secretary Sophia Chan said on Sunday the government will give a HK$5,000 ($645) handout to anyone in the city who tests positive to encourage people to undergo testing.Second waveAs the winter approaches, countries in Asia have also faced a second wave of coronavirus. While most will be unlikely to adopt China's zero-tolerance approach, many have tightened restrictions to slow its spread.In Japan, daily coronavirus cases have surpassed 2,000 for five days in a row. Amid surging cases, the country's Prime Minster Yoshihide Suga announced last week that the government's travel and dining promotion program will be halted in coronavirus hotspots to curb further infections.On Monday, South Korea declared an "emergency period" in the capital city of Seoul until the end of the year, due to a spike in Covid-19 cases, according to the city's acting mayor Seo Jung-hyup.Under the announcement, public transportation will reduce capacity by 20% after 10 p.m. and gatherings of more than 10 people will be banned. The city will also conduct regular coronavirus tests on some 40,000 workers and users of nursing hospitals and daycare centers.The measures come after a series of new restrictions were announced for Seoul on Sunday, including mandatory mask wearing indoors and closures of entertainment facilities such as clubs. Restaurants are only allowed to do deliveries and takeout after 9 p.m., gatherings will be limited to 100 people, and schools must operate at one-third capacity.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Jake Sullivan Trashed Trump's Israel Policy In Interview With Chinese Propaganda OutletThe Daily CallerNovember 25, 2020 Wednesday 01:31 AM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: DAILY-CALLER-NEWS-FOUNDATION; politicsLength: 511 wordsByline: Chuck Ross, Investigative Reporter, chuck@dailycaller.comChuck Ross is a reporter at The Daily Caller.Author ImageBodyLink to ImageJake Sullivan, the incoming national security adviser, criticized President Donald Trump's policies related to the Middle East during an interview in late 2017 with CGTN, a Beijing-based media outlet controlled by the Chinese government.Sullivan appeared on the network to discuss Trump's announcement that he would begin the process to relocate the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem and recognize the city as Israel's capital.“This was a political decision, not a foreign policy decision. This was about Trump and his supporters. It was not about moving the peace process forward,” Sullivan said in the interview, which aired Dec. 9, 2017.Sullivan asserted that Trump's decision “created turbulence and turmoil” in negotiations for a peace deal between Israel, Palestine and other nations in the Middle East.“It's hard to find a good argument for this decision with respect to advancing the cause of peace in the Middle East,” said Sullivan, who was a top adviser to Hillary Clinton at the State Department and to Joe Biden when he was vice president. (RELATED: Report: Economist Being Floated For Biden Cabinet Position Appeared On Chinese Propaganda Outlets)Biden announced on Tuesday that Sullivan would be his White House national security adviser.“I don't believe that we were near a peace agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians,” Sullivan said in the CGTN interview.The Justice Department requires CGTN, formerly known as CCTV, to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) because it is controlled by the Chinese government.WATCH:Link to VideoSullivan appeared for the CGTN interview in his capacity as a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a top foreign policy think tank.Carnegie has received between $500,000 and $1 million in funding from Zhang Yichen, the CEO of CITIC Group, one of China's largest state-owned investment companies.According to Carnegie's website, Zhang, who is a trustee at the think tank, is a member of the Eleventh and Twelfth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, an advisory group to the Chinese communist party.While at the State Department, Sullivan sent and received hundreds of classified emails that were stored on the private email server Clinton used while she was secretary of state.In 2016, as a senior foreign policy adviser on the Clinton campaign, Sullivan pushed allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian government that have since been proven inaccurate.In an interview in 2018, Sullivan defended the Clinton campaign's role in funding the Steele dossier, which included false allegations of a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Kremlin to influence the 2016 election.The Biden transition team did not respond to a request for comment.Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The Spectator explains: the rifirrafe between Australia and China by a manipulated photoCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 2, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 638 wordsBodyThe Chinese government accused the Australian of wanting to divert attention from his alleged war crimes in Afghanistan because of his reaction to the manipulated photo published by a Beijing foreign affairs spokesman showing an Australian soldier slitting an Afghan child's throat.A manipulated photo, showing an Australian soldier slitting an Afghan child's throat, sparked a diplomatic rifirrafe between Australia and China. In fact, it was a Beijing foreign secretary who posted the photo on Twitter, sparking the Australian government's anger, described as "exaggerated" by Beijing."The anger and roars of some Australian politicians and media reflect a misinterpretation and overreaction to Mr. Zhao's tweet (Lijian)," according to a statement on the Chinese Embassy website.The tweet released Monday by one of China's Foreign Ministry spokesmen shows the manipulated image of an Australian soldier wielding a bloody knife against the neck of a barefoot child with a veiled face clinging to a white sheep.See more: Why does the world distrust China (and them from the world)?Hours after its publication, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison demanded that China apologize for the publication of a "repugnate" "fake image" for which Beijing should "feel totally embarrassed," while asking Twitter to remove this message, but neither has occurred."The accusations made are simply to serve two purposes: divert public attention from the horrific atrocities of certain Australian soldiers and blame China for the worsening bilateral ties. There may be another attempt to stoke domestic nationalism," adds the text of the Chinese embassy in Australia.The statement also notes that an Australian foreign official on Monday called Ambassador Cheng Jingye to complain about the tweet, but the Chinese diplomat rejected these "unwarranted accusations" as "absolutely unacceptable."The Twitter post came after Australia admitted on 19 November that its Army allegedly murdered 39 Afghan civilians and prisoners between 2005 and 2016 during its deployment in Afghanistan and promised to sanction those responsible.Politicians and media from various sectors of the oceanic country criticized the tweet, although Australian Labour Party senator Penny Wong told local ABC that Australia must "respond calmly and strategically" to what it considered "a deliberate provocation."The senator of Chinese descent felt that Australia needs to work with the international community to strengthen "the standards of conduct required in the region and around the world," by suggesting that U.S. President-elect Joe Biden could help improve relations with the Asian giant.You may be interested: China's social control strategy during the coronavirusFor her part, Natasha Kassam, a political scientist at the Australian Lowy Institute, told ABC public broadcaster that this publication is part of a campaign by Chinese diplomats on social media to attack Western countries."There are hundreds of them who spend a lot of time fighting with Western officials, promotingconspiracies over the new coronavirus and often drawing attention to what they consider human rights abuses in other countries," Kassan said.New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern also expressed concern directly to Beijing about the use of a false image to criticize Australia published yesterday by a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.The representative, in statements to the press, explained that contact with China is due to the fact that they have used an image that is "not correct based on the facts and is not genuine. We have raised this directly with the Chinese authorities.""It's a fact-based message and of course we're worried about this," added Ardern, who said he hasn't talked about this dispute with his Australian counterpart, Scott Morrison.Load-Date: December 3, 2020End of Document

China, the European Union and an ambitious investment pactCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 31, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 648 wordsBodyBrusselsThe European Union (EU) and China concluded yesterday "in principle" the negotiations for ambitious investment pact that would open up the Chinese market to European companies, despite international concern, especially from the US, about Beijing's civil and labour rights record.Political understanding was sealed in a video conference involving Chinese President Xi Jinping and top EU leaders Ursula von der Leyen (European Commission) and Charles Michel (European Council).The videoconference also included the heads of government of Germany and France, Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron.In an official note, Von der Leyen and Michel indicated that under this agreement, China undertook to "work towards ratification" of international standards relating to forced labour, a critical point of negotiation.According to Von der Leyen and Michel, this pact will give European companies "unprecedented" access to the Chinese market, while at the same time delivering "security and predictability" to these companies in their operations. This understanding "unersies the parties to value-based investment relationships, supported by principles of sustainable development," the note noted. It will also "improve" the area of competition for European investors by eliminating forced transfer of technology and "other dystorsive practices".Geopolitical spinThe agreement is a milestone in relations between the two economic powers and a strategic movement on the global geopolitical board in the midst of a transition period in the United States between donald Trump's administration and Joe Biden's.Both blocs were very interested in closing seven years of negotiation before the end of this year, especially the Chinese, who have led to the final push with concessions on social aspects that Europe has welcomed, as a icing on Angela Merkel's six-monthly Council of Germany presidency.The pact, as China wanted above all, arrives before Biden assumes the presidency, predictably on January 20.Beijing struggled in 2020 - especially since last spring, when Trump began blaming China for the COVID pandemic and redoubled sanctions on its tech giants - in improving its relations with Europe and seeking an ally in the face of what might happen in the NOVEMBER US election.If Trump revalidated the presidency, the continuation of the confrontation in every field with the U.S., which was already talking about "new cold war," was inevitable.But also if Biden won, as it finally happened, the danger of the Democrat trying to form an "anti-China" alliance with Europe, something clearly unworkable with the Republican, was of great concern in Zhongnanhai, the seat of the Chinese government.AN AWKWARD FRIEND For the European Union, China is a partner with which to collaborate and negotiate, an economic competitor and a systemic rival. It is the literal definition that appears in a 2019 strategic communication from the EU External Action Service, and which the investment agreement agreed by Brussels and Beijing once again highlights.For Brussels, it is uncomfortable to strengthen ties with a country that departs from the democratic values that the EU uses as a diplomatic banner and at the same time a state that disputes its areas of influence.Eu High Representative for Foreign Policy Josep Borrell recently noted that China is threatening to displace the EU in Latin America. But at the same time, Brussels finds it impossible to live with its back to the great emerging power, the second largest economy on the planet, with a population of almost 1.4 billion and around 15 per% of global GDP.Between the United States, China and the European Union add up to more than half of the planet's economy.And since Washington, Biden's transition team has publicly affrated Brussels for a lack of "early consultations" about "common concerns about China's economic practices."

Chinese probe lands on Moon to collect lunar soil samplesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 2, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 567 wordsBodyA Chinese probe successfully landed on the Moon on Tuesday, at a new milestone in Beijing's space program that, in this case, seeks to bring lunar soil samples back to Earth.This mission is a new stage of China's ambitious space program, which brought a remote-controlled robot to the hidden face of the Moon in early 2019, a global scoop.China has invested billions of dollars in its program, hoping to have a manned space station by 2022 and eventually send humans to the Moon.The goal of this new mission is to bring dust samples and lunar rocks, to help scientists better understand the moon's origins, its formation and volcanic activity on its surface.The Chang'e-5 probe "landed on the visible face of the Moon on Tuesday afternoon," the state Xinhua news agency said, citing the Chinese National Space Administration.If successful, China will be the third country to have extracted samples from the satellite, after the United States and the former Soviet Union in the 1960s and 1970s.The Chang'e-5 probe, named after a moon goddess in Chinese mythology, entered the moon's orbit on Saturday after a 112-hour journey from Earth, Xinhua said, after taking off from Hainan Province (south) last week.- "Space Dream" -The Chang'e-5 probe will collect two kilos of material from the surface in an unexplored area known as Oceanus Procellarum ("Ocean of Storms"), which consists of a vast lava plain, according to the journal Nature.The ship is expected to collect the material on a lunar day, the equivalent of about 14 days on Earth.Samples will be sent to Earth in a capsule to land in China's Inner Mongolia region (north) in early or mid-December, according to NASA.Public CCTV broadcast a sequence in which the 8.2-ton space module perches on the lunar floor. Mission managers, with their faces covered with a mask, clapped in front of the monitoring screens.The Chang'e 5 module consists of four parts: an orbiter (which will remain in lunar orbit), a lander (which landed on the Moon), an ascent module (from the ground to the lunar orbit), and a capsule back (to Earth).This mission is the first attempt to recover lunar rocks since the uninhabited Luna 24 mission, successfully carried out by the former Soviet Union in 1976.But unlike the Soviet program, where the probe made the journey between the Moon and Earth directly after collecting samples, China will use a much more complicated method.The rocks will be placed first in the ascent module (which will have to reach lunar orbit) before being moved to the capsule back to Earth.This ambitious operation will also enable the Asian giant to test new technologies, crucial for sending astronauts to the lunar star by 2030.Plans for China's "space dream," as President Xi Jinping calls it, have been launched under his rule.The goal is to equate with Europe, Russia and the United States in space milestones.This is not the first time China has sent a probe to the Moon under the Chang'e program. A Chinese remote-controlled robot landed on the hidden side of the moon in January 2019.Ambitious targets set by the Chinese government include the creation of a super-powerful rocket capable of delivering heavier loads than NASA and the private SpaceX company, a lunar base and a manned permanent space station.Chinese astronauts and scientists have also addressed thepossibility of sending manned missions to Mars.burs-gle/st/mb-bc/erl/dgaLoad-Date: December 3, 2020End of Document

Marco Rubio, R-Florida, issued the following news release:U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) released a statement after Twitter labeled a falsified image posted by a Chinese Communist Party bureaucrat as "potentially sensitive content." The inadequate action came after Rubio wrote to Jack Dorsey, Chief Executive Officer of Twitter, after the company initially failed to remove or label a falsified image posted by a Chinese Communist Party bureaucrat."It's outrageous that when the President of the United States tweets about sending in the national guard to protect cities from rioters, Twitter immediately jumps to silence him for 'violating terms,' but when a Chinese government official or Ayatollah Khamenei make threats, it takes a U.S. Senator and a public pressure campaign for them to do anything," Rubio said."Labeling this falsified image posted by a Chinese Communist Party bureaucrat as 'potentially sensitive content' is absurd. Either Twitter has a double standard for conservatives or they are scared of the Chinese government and Communist Party. In reality, it is probably both. Twitter's Section 230 lifeline is running on fumes."Rubio is Cochair of the bipartisan and bicameral Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations' Subcommittee that oversees human rights, and is a member of the Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and International Cybersecurity Policy.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7310709 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: December 2, 2020End of Document

He said that as part of Beijing's “aggressive plan to make China the world's foremost military power,” the Chinese government has “conducted human testing on members of the People's Liberation Army in hope of developing soldiers with biologically enhanced capabilities.”“There are no ethical boundaries to Beijing's pursuit of power.”Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

CHINA BIG DATA PROGRAM IDENTIFIES UYGHURS FOR 'ARBITRARY' DETENTION-HRW REPORTStates News ServiceDecember 8, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 504 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:By Paul EckertAuthorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) of China use a big data program that arbitrarily selects Turkic Muslims for possible detention in internment camps based on behavior that is legal, Human Rights Watch said in a report published on Thursday.In the report, China: Big Data Program Targets Xinjiang's Muslims, the New York-based watchdog group analyzes a leaked list of over 2,000 detainees from Aksu prefecture provided in late 2018 by RFA's Uyghur Service.The big data program, the Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP), apparently flagged the people on the Aksu List, whom officials then evaluated and sent to political education' camps in Xinjiang, HRW saidThe Aksu List provides further insights into how China's brutal repression of Xinjiang's Turkic Muslims is being turbocharged by technology, said Maya Wang, China researcher at Human Rights Watch.The Chinese government owes answers to the families of those on the list: why were they detained, and where are they now? she said in a statement ahead of the release of the report on Thursday.The IJOP policing program aggregates data about people in Xinjiang, and flags to officials those it deems potentially threatening, the report said.Officials then evaluate these individuals' general performance' together with other sources of information, and send some to political education camps and other facilities. it said.Human Rights Watch spent nearly two years analyzing the Aksu List, an Excel spread sheet with the 2,000 names, consulting with Uyghur exiles from that region and checking ID numbers against those on an official website of people who have been blacklisted under China's social credit system, it said.The analysis of the Aksu List strongly suggests that the vast majority of the people flagged by the IJOP system are detained for everyday lawful, non-violent behavior, it said.Among the activities that to detention were studying the Quran without state permission, allowing one's children to study the Quran, reciting the Quran, wearing religious clothing or having a long beard, or going on the annual pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia without state permission, it said.Uyghurs were also sent away to camps for sensitive countries, including Turkey, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, and Kyrgyzstan -- as well as elsewhere in Xinjiang such as Urumqi and Kashgar, without notifying local officials, HRW added.Predictive policing' platforms are really just a pseudo-scientific fig leaf for the Chinese government to justify vast repression of Turkic Muslims, Wang said.The Chinese government should immediately shut down the IJOP, delete all the data it has collected, and release everyone arbitrarily detained in Xinjiang.Authorities are believed to have held up to 1.8 million Uyghurs about one in six adults -- and other Muslim minorities in a vast network of internment camps in the XUAR since April 2017, often for acts they label signs of extremism.Load-Date: December 9, 2020End of Document

Our aim is to develop a safe and effective vaccine to contribute to bringing this pandemic to an end.The impact of Thursday's order wasn't immediately clear but it could add to pressure on companies including telecom equipment giant Huawei and video surveillance provider Hikvision that already face USA export bans and other sanctions.He said Beijing will "firmly safeguard" the rights of Chinese companies, a statement Beijing often makes following unwelcome US policy changes but that often results in no action. It said Beijing "exploits United States investors" to finance military development by selling securities in American and foreign financial markets.O'brien said Trump's action serves to protect American investors from unintentionally providing capital that goes to enhancing the capabilities of the People's Liberation Army and People's Republic of China intelligence services, which routinely target American citizens and businesses through cyber operations, and directly threaten the critical infrastructure, economy, and military of America and its allies and partners around the world.The Chinese Communist Party's exploitation of USA capital markets is a clear and ongoing risk to USA economic and national security and today's action by the Trump administration is a welcome start to protecting our markets and investors, Rubio said. It applies to shares owned directly or indirectly in 31 firms identified by the U.S. earlier this year as backed by the Chinese military, a list that includes tech firms and large state-owned construction companies among others. Many are military contractors or state-owned companies such as phone carrier China Telecom Ltd.He said those companies, though remaining ostensibly private and civilian, directly support the Chinese military, intelligence, and security apparatuses and aid in their development and modernisation.The efforts come as U.S. exposure to companies listed on Chinese stock exchanges has grown. "These punitive actions against the company do not make America, or the world, any safer".Load-Date: November 14, 2020End of Document

Investing In the Electric Car IndustryUSNEWS.comDecember 7, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 U.S. News & World Report All Rights ReservedSection: INVESTING; Stock Market News; Vol.; No.Length: 1702 wordsByline: Paulina LikosHighlight: The success of the electric car industry has been years in the making, and there's much more to come.BodyThe electric car industry has been expanding for years, and stakeholders continue to invest billions into this burgeoning market. While this is still a budding industry filled with opportunity, it's one that also faces tough challenges, which leaves room for costly mistakes that could have other ramifications. Electric vehicle (EV) stocks rallying all year may have left some investors distracted from market challenges. The EV market has quickly grown in a short period of time, creating a bullish market attitude; although, investors may want to balance this enthusiasm given the EV investment risks. As new players emerge, the industry has all the ingredients necessary for continued innovation. Here is what investors need to know about the electric car industry if they are considering EV investments: -- Electric car global growth.-- Factors driving electric car sales.-- Market challenges ahead.-- EV stocks and investment risks.[Sign up for stock news with our Invested newsletter.]Electric Car Global GrowthThe electric car industry in China has seen considerable growth within the last decade. By promoting EV usage through public policy initiatives and fiscal support, China has spurred EV innovation. China has seen a rise in its EV stocks such as Nio (ticker: NIO), XPeng ( XPEV), Li Auto ( LI) and Kandi ( KNDI). A July report from McKinsey & Co. found that Europe EV sales increased by 44%, marking the highest growth rate since 2016. Europe has seen the strongest growth in EVs, according to McKinsey's analysis. Its research also found that China saw a 57% decrease in EV sales and a 33% decrease in U.S. EV sales, while Europe saw a 25% increase in its market share -- a stark contrast in Europe's EV growth relative to other regions. In the U.S., Tesla ( TSLA) comes to mind as an electric car winner, but Mike Juran, CEO of Altia, says it's the traditional original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) that will advance EV growth, "General Motors ( GM), Volkswagen, Hyundai and Toyota ( TM), will be the real drivers of EV growth," he says. "These OEMs have decided that the future is EV," Juran, explains. "They have the financial position, a firmly established ecosystem of suppliers, the clout to enable the necessary infrastructure and an army of visionaries on staff to make their electric vehicle programs not only feasible but successful." [SEE:7 Top-Performing Dow Jones Stocks This Year.]Drivers of EV SalesChina has put public policies in place to address the concern of growing carbon emissions and air pollution. To regulate and reduce emissions, which in part come from traditional vehicles, China has dedicated public policy and fiscal support to grow its electric car market. China has created incentives for EV use, which will aim at improving air health while expanding its market share. The Chinese government offers subsidies or tax breaks for electric cars that meet the government's requirements. For example, these tax incentives cannot be used on luxury cars like Tesla or BMW. Rather, the EV cannot cost more than about $42,000 to qualify for the subsidy. Since China's government rolled out the subsidy initiative in 2009, the production and sale of EVs have been growing. While EV sales have lagged in 2019 and 2020 due to the pandemic, the secretary-general of the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers says he expects the number of new EVs to grow to five million by the end of the year. A news release says optimism of further growth despite the economic slowdown caused by the health crisis comes from China's government extending subsidies into 2022. Environmental consciousness has been a major investing theme in recent decades, one that has further been accelerated by the pandemic. A growing number of investors are making environmental, social and corporate governance, or ESG, investing a priority when shaping their portfolio. In the same light, Laurence Montanari, vice president of transportation and mobility industry at Dassault Systemes in Paris, says sustainability and controlling population levels are of top concern for consumers. "Consumers all over the world are looking to purchase vehicles that are, simply put, more respectful of the environment and more personalized for their unique needs," she says. "By 2030, we expect the mobility market, including alternative powertrain (such as EV, plug-in EV and hydrogen fuel-cell and autonomous vehicles and mobility-as-a-service providers), to pass $1 trillion," Montanari says. Europe also has an ambitious climate and energy framework to push down carbon emissions in the region by reducing emission targets to foster cleaner transportation. Increasing environmental standards for passenger cars has led to higher sales of EVs in the region. As the manufacturing of EVs has steadily become mainstream, the cost of EVs has been falling. Tesla shaved down the cost of purchasing its Model 3, which starts at $37,900. The Model S starts at $69,420 and the Model X starts at $79,990. A big factor of falling EV prices has been the declining cost of lithium-ion batteries. TSLA plans to mine its lithium, which will further drive down the cost to manufacture EVs and bring them to market at a lower cost. But the fall in lithium prices isn't unique to Tesla. Montanari says. One key reason for EV growth can be attributed to the falling price and increased efficiency of batteries. The price per kilowatt-hour for lithium-ion battery packs has dropped from $1,183 in 2010 to $156 in 2019, according to BloombergNEF data. Experts say we can anticipate a further drop in prices in the future. [See:The 8 Most Active Stocks Investors Need to Watch]Market Challenges AheadIn the earlier stages of EV development, there were concerns about the cost of the car. This has been addressed as the costs to manufacture EVs have declined but price remains a challenge since the average consumer may not be able to afford the price tag despite tax incentives that some countries provide. Players in the EV industry may need to put investment toward the widespread adoption and application of EVs. As the EV market continues to grow globally, the demand for charging stations will grow. At present, there are concerns over developing charging stations and more broadly a framework around standardizing charging facilities for EVs. To create a charging infrastructure for the public to easily adopt, there may need to be some sort of coalition to design, build and finance the stations for ease of public and private use. EV Stocks and Investment RisksWhile EV stocks are currently hot on the market, making them seem like an absolute buying opportunity, investors must keep the risks and challenges top of mind. These high-flying stocks hold record valuations, which may have some investors thinking they're in a bubble. Tesla stock has grown more than 600% year to date and the company has a market capitalization of more than $600 billion. Investors continue to have faith in TSLA despite its high market value. While second-quarter revenues were flat, Tesla's first and third-quarter revenues were up 32% and 39%, respectively. For its annual battery day, Tesla unveiled a breakthrough battery design, outlined goals of reducing the cost of electric cars and released new self-driving vehicles. Many investors are enamored by CEO Elon Musk's creative vision and the innovation that the company has displayed over the years, which is reflected in its products. Nio, the Chinese premium electric car startup company, based in Shanghai, has also seen explosive growth in 2020. The stock is up more than 1,100% this year, standing at a market cap of $61 billion, right in line with General Motors' ( GM) market cap of $63 billion. While starting the year on shaky ground in the first quarter, Nio made up for losses in the second quarter, with a 146.5% increase in EV sales from last year's quarter and another 146% increase in sales in the third quarter. While the market may put the brakes on the stock's momentum, Nio is a serious competitor in developing and manufacturing electric cars in China. Nikola ( NKLA) is an example of an EV stock that soared earlier in the year before taking a nosedive. After a short selling report called out NKLA for deceiving investors about the performance of its electric truck and the technology behind it, stakeholders quickly backed out and the stock fell up to 13% on the news and is down almost 47% over a three-month period. Even though there are mixed market sentiments on whether NKLA can make a comeback, this is a case of how a high-flying EV stock can quickly lose. Investors who want a stake in this industry without taking on too much risk should think about turning to an EV exchange-traded fund, such as the iShares Self-Driving EV and Tech ETF ( IDRV). The fund has exposure to EV companies as well as the information technology and auto sectors, giving it elements of diversification. Some of IDRV's top holdings include Tesla, Apple ( AAPL) and Toyota. IDRV's market value is about $42 per share, with an expense ratio of 0.47%. It's up more than 50% since March's market sell-off. This EV ETF can be suited for an investor who wants a share of the EV market competition but might feel skittish about owning individual EV stocks. Takeaway When it comes to investing in EV assets, investors should weigh the advantages and drawbacks. To keep taking revolutionary steps in becoming a mainstream product that captures consumer confidence, the electric car industry will likely continue investing in itself to improve ease of use and ultimately overcome industry challenges. That comes with a heavy lift and price tag, but it may be worthwhile. Paulina Likos is an investing reporter at U.S. News & World Report, covering investing and asset management.

According to Reuters, the well-known Asian drone company is now part of the Entity List, so the United States prohibits the sale of DJI products in the country.Commerce justifies its decision by alluding to citizen security (as it did with other blocked companies such as Huawei), as it "claims to be concerned about human rights based on DJI's involvement in providing drones to the Chinese government to monitor Uighurs in Xinjiang Province in 2017," according to DroneDJ.As Reuters points out, the United States has decided to incorporate DJI along with three other Chinese companies because it "allowedlarge-scale human rights abuses within China through abusive genetic collection and analysis or high-tech surveillance."Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross explained in an interview Friday morning that Commerce will add about 80 companies, mostly Chinese, to the list for national defense reasons, including semiconductor manufacturer Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMI).There are nearly 700 companies on the list, Ross said, 296 of which are Chinese and 150 of which are huawei-related.Load-Date: December 19, 2020End of Document

"We are continuing to do everything we can to support her while we seek more information."China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Friday that Fan was detained "on suspicion of engaging in criminal activities that jeopardize national security," adding that the case is under investigation and her "legitimate rights have been fully ensured."The Foreign Correspondents' Club of China said it was "very concerned" to learn about Fan's detention."Chinese nationals offer critical research and linguistic support for foreign reporting in China. Without their support, it would be difficult for foreign media to operate in China," the club said in a statement. Chinese nationals are only permitted to work for foreign news outlets in "auxiliary" roles and must be hired through a Foreign Ministry-affiliated agency.An Australian TV host at China's state broadcaster was detained in Beijing earlier this year also for allegedly engaging in activities that endangered China's national security. Cheng Lei was a business anchor on CGTN, the international arm of China's state-owned broadcaster CCTV, which has since scrubbed all reference to her from its website and social media.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

US adds chip company, Chinese oil company blacklistedCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 4, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 326 wordsBodyBEIJING (AP) — The U.S. government has intensified its security dispute with Beijing by including China's largest processor chip manufacturer and a blacklisted state oil giant that limits its access to U.S. technology and investment.Thursday's announcement adds to Donald Trump's actions against China since his defeat in the November 3 presidential election. Political analysts have said Trump is likely to take more initiatives before President-elect Joe Biden takes office on January 20.The Pentagon included four new companies, including Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. and China National Offshore Oil Corp., in a blacklist of entities deemed to be part of efforts to modernize the military wing of the ruling Communist Party, the People's Liberation Army. With these, the list contains 35 signatures.SMIC plays an important role in Beijing's efforts to reduce its reliance on U.S. and foreign technology by creating Chinese suppliers of processor chips and other components.The Chinese government has called these restrictions an abuse of national security arguments to harm China's fledgling competitors in technology and other fields.This has gained greater urgency since Washington blocked access to U.S. chips and other technologies to telecom giants Huawei Technologies Ltd. and imposed restrictions on other Chinese buyers. The White House has also blocked the use of U.S. technology by global suppliers producing chips for Huawei.CNOOC, for its part, is the smallest of China's three largest state oil companies.Political analysts expect little change with Biden as president over widespread frustration over China's trade and human rights background, and accusations of espionage and technology theft.The Chinese army, with 2.3 million members, is one of the largest and best armed in the world, and is making a big investment to develop nuclear submarines, undetectable aircraft, ballistic missiles and other advanced weapons.Load-Date: December 5, 2020End of Document

U.S. blacklists China's largest chip producerCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 18, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 484 wordsBodyThe United States ctoday stated that it included SMIC, thelargest chip producer in China,among the more than 60 Chinese companies to be added to its commercial blacklist. Less than a month after Joe Biden'sassumption, the move comes as a ratification of the Trump Administration's 'hard-handed' policy on China,particularly on the technology issue.Commerce assured that the decision "responds to China's doctrine of military-civilian fusion and evidence of activities between SMIC and concerned entities in the military industrial complex." In this regard, the head of the portfolio, Wilbur Ross, said the department "will not allow advanced American technology to help improve the army of an increasingly belligerent adversary."What is the Chinese military-civilian integration strategy that concerns...SMIC – which provides supplies to Qualcommand Boradcom,among others – is a key cog in the Chinese government's 5-year strategy to create a strong semiconductor industry that allows it to reduce its dependence on the U.S.,and continue its plan to decouple from American technology.Ross explained that the government will cautiously deny licenses in order to prevent SMIC from accessing technology to produce semiconductors at advanced levels of 10 nanometers or less. Those of 10 nanometers or more will be analyzed on a case-by-case basis.USA: Trump bans investments in affiliated companies...Companies exporting components to SMIC outside the U.S. may also experience restrictions, depending on the percentage of U.S. technology in those parts. A senior Commerce Department official told Bloomberg that Washington was talking to like-minded governments to form a unified approach to SMIC, although he gave no details about what those countries would be.As noted by the department, the 60 selected Chinese companies (out of a total of 77 foreign companies) include "entities that allow human rights abuses; entities that supported militarization and illegal claims about the South China Sea,entities that acquired products of U.S. origin to support The People's Liberation Army programs entities and individuals who participated in the theft of U.S. trade secrets."China accuses the United States of sending 'spy planes' to...China's Foreign Ministry said that, if true, the decision would demonstrate U.S. oppression over Chinese companies,so Beijing will continue to take the "necessary measures" to protect its rights. "We urge the United States to cease its misbehaviorby unwarranted oppression of foreign companies," ministerial spokesmanWang Wenbin said at the conference.The companies join a list already made up of other giants such as Huawei, ZTE and surveillance camera manufacturer Hikvision (accused of being involved in the repression of the Uighur minority). Blacklisted companies have access to U.S. technology for granted in a wide range of products ranging from software to circuits.Load-Date: December 19, 2020End of Document

China imposes new visa limits in back-and-forth with USAssociated Press InternationalDecember 22, 2020 Tuesday 9:53 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 461 wordsDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) — China hit back with reciprocal actions Tuesday against unnamed American officials in the latest back-and-forth, following a U.S. announcement of new visa restrictions on Chinese officials.The Foreign Ministry also called on President Donald Trump not to sign into law legislation approved by Congress on Tibet.The visa action came in response to a State Department announcement Monday that said the U.S. will deny visas to Chinese Communist Party officials whose policies or actions are aimed at repressing religious groups, ethnic minorities, dissidents or others.“China has taken reciprocal countermeasures against the U.S. individuals and their family members who are primarily responsible for recent interference in China’s internal affairs," Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said.He did not say who or how many people were affected.Wang also said China opposed the Tibetan Policy and Support Act, which calls for the establishment of a U.S. consulate in Tibet as well as support for Tibetans to choose the next Dalai Lama, their spiritual leader, on their own.Congress approved the bill Monday as part of a $900 billion coronavirus relief package that also included other unrelated year-end legislation.The U.S. has placed an escalating series of sanctions, visa bans and financial restrictions on Chinese government officials and Communist Party members this year. The U.S.-China relationship has become increasingly fraught as the two countries battle over issues from human rights to the coronavirus and trade.Previous visa restrictions and financial sanctions applied to officials "involved in the horrific abuses taking place in Xinjiang, restrictions on access to Tibet, and the destruction of Hong Kong’s promised autonomy,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in Monday's statement.“Today’s action creates additional restrictions applicable to all (Communist Party) officials engaged in such repressive activities, no matter their location,” he said.Wang criticized the U.S. for having "weaponized“ visa policy.“The issues of Tibet, Taiwan and Hong Kong concerning Chinese sovereignty and territorial integrity are purely internal affairs of China, and no foreign forces should interfere,” he said.Earlier in December, the U.S. announced plans to limits visas for members of the Chinese Communist Party and their families to one month, instead of 10 years. The State Department also said it would deny visas to Chinese citizens linked to overseas influence operations involving violence and other means of intimidation.The U.S. side has also put economic restrictions on Chinese companies. Chinese tech giant Huawei has been shut out of the U.S. market and the U.S. has lobbied other countries to follow suit, with mixed results.Load-Date: December 22, 2020End of Document

Trump bans doing business with Chinese companies linked to military activitiesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 12, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 490 wordsBodyU.S. President Donald Trump signed a new executive order prohibiting Americans from negotiating with Chinese companies linked to military activities.In this way, the country strikes a new blow against terrorism and illicit activities, as it did with Iran, sanctioning 18 banks that would be related to the financing of illegal groups, missile development and nuclear weapons.The measure reaches 31 Chinese companies that will no longer be able to have ties to the United States because they are collaborators of the People's Liberation Army, the White House says. In the list are telecommunications companies such as China Telecom and China Mobile.The measure will take effect on January 11, 2021, so that it initiates the countdown so that such companies no longer have U.S. stocks and other financial interests."The president's order serves to protect U.S. investors from unintendedly offering capital that will strengthen the capacity of China's Army or intelligence services, which are commonly used to attack U.S. citizens and businesses through computer operations," said Robert O'Brien, White House National Security Adviser , in a statement cited by EFE.According to Infobae, the Chinese government forces private companies to support their military and security activities, and through capital markets, it "exploits U.S. investors to finance the development and modernization of their military."China's intentionsChina's interference in the United States is not new, Xi Jinping's regime has tried to influence the United States by all means.It was recently made known that China seeks to create a deep ideological rift thanks to 600 groups linked to china's Communist Party.This number includes companies, universities, expert, social and cultural groups, Chinese diaspora organizations and Chinese media.They have also sought to sow division on social media. Both Twitter and Facebook have created groups inclined to Democratic and Republican interests to spread messages that increasingly divide citizens, even sharing authentic content from news sources.Counter-terrorism fencePresident Donald Trump has developed alliances to prevent Chinese advances in the rest of the world, so he signed an agreement with India to curb the Asian communist regime.Defense Secretary Mark Esper said India is "the world's largest democracy, a very competent country, with talented people who face Chinese aggression in the Himalayas every day."His argument was about the war that unfolds between the two nations in the Himalayan region as a result of bordering interests.A few months ago, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said China practices a "new tyranny" so it asked US allies to work to "change their behavior.""Because President (Donald) Trump has made it very clear, we need a strategy that protects the U.S. economy and our way of life. The free world must triumph over this new tyranny," Pompeo said in statements quoted by Europapress. Load-Date: November 14, 2020End of Document

Young man was sentenced to prison who revealed uncomfortable secrets of the Chinese regime in the pandemicCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 28, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 570 wordsBody A citizen journalist covering the covid-19 epidemic in Wuhan was sentenced to four years in prison on Monday, as long as the Chinese government boasts of its successes in the fight against the disease that in a year spread across the globe. The young woman "seemed very despondent when the ruling was announced," according to one of her lawyers, who became "very concerned" about her psychological state.Zhang Zhan traveled to Wuhan in February and broadcast live his experiences on social media. He also wrote essays criticizing the government's response, including the strict confinement of millions of people, just as the Chinese regime began to be accused of covering up the initial outbreak and silencing early informants.Zhang was arrested in May and is accused of "inciting fights and causing trouble," according to a court notice that he was able to consult the AFP, a charge commonly used to crack down on dissidents, with a maximum prison sentence of five years.Zhang's lawyers, 37, received a notice earlier this week that the hearing will be held in a Shanghai court on December 28.As a result, Zhang began a hunger strike in June, his legal representatives said, and had to be forced by force through a nasal tube.Zhang is the first to be tried by the four citizen journalists arrested or forced to "forced quarantines" in places only known to the Chinese authorities, after reporting from Wuhan. It is, in addition to Zhang, Chen Qiushi, Fang Bin and Li Zehua.Zhang criticized the initial response in Wuhan, and wrote in a February essay that the government "did not give people enough information and then simply shut down the city." "It's a big violation of human rights."The former lawyer was among a large group of journalists, professionals and amateurs, who flocked to Wuhan after the closure was imposed in late January. The authorities were concerned about trying to manage the chaos of the outbreak and, for a brief period, China's strict censorship regime relaxed. Reporters seized that window to share the harsh tales of terror and fury of the residents.In the first few weeks, Zhang visited, cell phone in hand, a crematorium, a crowded hospital corridor and the city's desert train station. Hence the videos look unstable. The durations of the un edited videos were variables could be from a few seconds to almost 30 minutes.Chen Quishi and Fang Bin, two freelance journalists like Zhang, are considered missing by Western information and organizations such as Amnesty International or Reporters Without BordersWhile he published some filmed material and essays on WeChat, a popular messaging service in China, he often encountered censorship, he said. She largely trusted YouTube and Twitter, which are blocked in China but can be accessed through virtual private networks.As reported by the American newspaper "The New York Times," in his penultimate video before his arrest, Zhang was walking down a street in a neighborhood where cases had recently been reported. While filming the closed tents, a man in a neon vest adorned with the words "on duty" confronted her and asked her where she lived and if she was a journalist. When the woman turned him down, he shouted, "If you post this online, you'll have to take responsibility.""I take responsibility for all my actions",retruded Zhang.

S&P; and Dow Jones indexes withdraw 21 Chinese companies from their quotesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 10, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 297 wordsBodyThe firm that handles the S&P; and Dow Jones financial indices withdrew 21 Chinese companies from their quotes after U.S. citizens were banned from investing in Asian companies as part of a U.S.-China dispute over technological security.The Chinese government criticized the measure, calling it a political maneuver.Among the Chinese companies affected are HikvisionDigital Technology Co.; SMIC microprocessor manufacturer and several state-owned companies related to nuclear power and construction.The announcement comes after U.S. President Donald Trump issued an order on November 13 prohibiting the country's citizens from investing in stocks or bonds issued by companies that Washington considers controlled by the Chinese armed forces.The S&P; COMPANY DJI Indices measure does not directly affect Chinese companies,but investment funds that follow stock market trends will have to sell their stocks and bonds,which could depress their prices, at least temporarily."Westrongly oppose these practices on the American side,"said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokestor Hua Chunying."Ithink the American practice of making up lies and rumors and prosecuting and curbing Chinese companies without any foundation will in the end be contrary to the interests of the United States itself,"he added.U.S. authorities say the Chinese Communist Party takes advantage ofU.S. technology and investment to expand its military forces, which are already one of the largest and best navies in the world.Washington also imposed export bans on Hikvision and other Chinese companies, including telecommunications equipment manufacturer Huawei Technologies Ltd.HikVision and Huawei insist that they have no nexus to the Chinese armed forces and have never undertaken research for Chinese military agencies.Load-Date: December 11, 2020End of Document

China hits Australian wine with tariffs of up to 200 per centStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeNovember 28, 2020 SaturdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: MARKETS; Pg. 1Length: 507 wordsByline: Jean GarciaBodyAustralia is the world's most China-dependent developed economy.After a months-long investigation, China announced the decision to impose anti-dumping deposits on Australian wine as a temporary measure, according to a statement from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce released on Friday.China is the top market for Australian wine exports and is also Australia's largest trading partner, with two-way trade worth A$235 billion ($170 billion) previous year.About 37% of Australian exports worth as much as AU$1 billion are sent to China, while Treasury Wine Estates - the producer of Penfolds - recoups about 40% of its total earnings from the country and has been singled out in the past for making suppliers take on large amounts of cheaper wine in order to secure allocations of its top labels."We don't see it's justified and we're obviously deeply concerned about what it does", Mr Battaglene said of the tariff move.Australia's biggest wine company, Treasury Wine Estates, a major exporter to China, was among the companies that participated in the investigation. "And clearly, we think it's unjustified, and without evidence to back it up".Relations between the two countries have soured in recent years, with China - Australia's biggest trade partner - threatening economic retaliation since Canberra called for an inquiry into the COVID-19 pandemic.Trade Minister Simon Birmingham said the accumulation of Chinese sanctions suggested they were due to "other factors" but gave no details. "In light of the recent comments by China, it gives the perception this decision is predicated on something other than any wrongdoing by the wine industry".Media Claims North Korea Launched a Cyberattack Against Covid Vaccine Developer AstraZenecaPfizer and Moderna are the furthest in that process and both use a new technology, with manufacturing based in other countries."This latest hit by the Chinese government shows Beijing is determined to teach Australia a lesson that can reverberate globally", said John Blaxland, a former intelligence officer who's now a professor in worldwide security at the Australian National University."If that is the case, that would be in contravention of the trading rules Australia undertakes with all nations we have free trade agreements with", he told reporters.The Australian government was holding meetings with winemakers on Friday.Australia's exports to China have boomed in the past few years, with the country rising to become the biggest importer of Australian wines in the world.China launched the anti-dumping probe into Australian wine imports in August at the request of the Chinese Alcoholic Drink Association.China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said on Friday that the measures were in line with Chinese laws and regulations and urged Australia to do more to enhance mutual trust between the countries.The Australian government denied the allegations and described them as "perplexing". "We're a sovereign nation, we expect to be treated with the respect of a sovereign nation", he said.Load-Date: November 28, 2020End of Document

CHINA'S LANDMARK SEXUAL HARASSMENT LAWSUIT MIRED IN POWER, POLITICSStates News ServiceDecember 4, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1030 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:A landmark sexual harassment case involving a top Chinese state-run TV personality and a former intern that was inspired by the #MeToo hashtag campaign and the victims of Harvey Weinstein is mired in uncertainty amid an ongoing crackdown on the feminist movement in China.The lawsuit brought by former TV intern Zhou Xiaoxuan against former TV host Zhu Jun has stalled after the defendant failed to show up, the Financial Times reported.Zhou, who is now 27, went viral on Chinese social media in 2018 after she wrote a long account of her alleged sexual harassment by Zhu in a dressing room during her internship at state-run CCTV in 2014.The case finally came to court in Beijing's Haidian district on Wednesday, with crowds of supporters, many of them young women, showing up to support Zhou, who goes by the nickname Xianzi.Zhou accused Zhu, who presented the CCTV New Year TV gala for two decades until the allegations surfaced, of groping her and forcibly kissing her during a conversation about a potential career at the state broadcaster. She said in her online account that the assault only ended because a guest came into the room.Zhu has denied the allegations, and has filed a defamation lawsuit against Zhou over the allegations.However, the Financial Times reported that the hearing dragged on for 10 hours before adjourning with no verdict after Zhu failed to show up.Zhou told reporters after the hearing that she was "very tired," but had earlier said the fact that the case came to court at all was meaningful for women's rights in China."We have to believe that even if history repeats itself, things will definitely progress," she said before going into the court building.However, it was unclear after Wednesday's hearing how the case would now progress, the Financial Times reported.When she posted her account to social media platform Sina Weibo in 2018, Zhou cited the #MeToo hashtag campaign as her "guiding light."She reported the incident to the police, who began looking at security footage, but later dropped the case amid concerns that it would "harm the positive image" of the TV personality and CCTV in the eyes of the public.The post was later deleted.'Not optimistic'Zhang Jing, New York-based founder of Women's Rights in China, said she wasn't optimistic about the outcome of the case."It's particularly hard, given the current situation in mainland China, to have a feminist movement," Zhang told RFA. "I'm not optimistic about the outcome of the court case.""It's pretty impossible to prosecute powerful people, whether it be for financial reasons, or because of sexual harassment and domestic violence," she said."Unless the person has powerful backing, they will be regarded as politically suspect, as disloyal to the [ruling Chinese Communist] Party and to Xi Jinping, and will be dispensed with," she said.There were signs on Sina Weibo on Friday that such a process had already begun."The only way this [case] will be meaningful is if the evidence is heard from both sides in court," user @zhaohaoyao-Moonfans wrote on Friday."So why is the discussion now focusing around the woman's politics?"Zhang said that anyone standing up for women's rights in China is remarkable, because the price paid for such activism is far higher than their counterparts in liberal democracies.Patriarchal powerXia Ming, a professor of political science at New York's City University, appeared to agree."The Chinese government is basically a patriarchal power structure, and the entire political system is highly repressive of women and feminism," Xia said."It is not surprising that this power structure and the entire establishment's reaction to the #MeToo movement is to suppress it," he said."The most important thing in all sexual assault and harassment cases is the need to define power relations," Xia said."The biggest problem in China is that there is now a powerful elite that combines power and money," he said. "Lots of women are wary of that [combination]."He said changes to China's Civil Code that take effect next year expanding the definition of sexual harassment still aren't enough to protect women.But he said Zhao's lawsuit had started a global conversation."Public pressure is probably the most important factor that can promote progress in China," Xia said.Women face reprisalsWomen who campaign for human rights in China face reprisals from the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) that can include enforced disappearances, arbitrary detention, sexual abuse, and torture, the Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD) network said in a 2019 report.The CCP has targeted civil organizations including the Beijing Yirenping Center, a public health and anti-discrimination NGO, the Weizhiming Women's Center in Hangzhou, which had run campaigns against gender discrimination, violence against women and sexual harassment, and the Beijing Zhongze Women's Legal Counseling Service Center.While the #MeToo movement sparked a conversation in 2018, mainly online, about sexual harassment in China, it also led to some backlash and widespread censorship, including the closure of the Sina Weibo and Tencent WeChat accounts of the group Feminist Voices, the report said.The wives, sisters and mothers of detained prisoners of conscience have faced harsh retaliation, CHRD said, while the authorities have also hit back at campaigning women and their children with detention, abduction, housing eviction, restricted movement, travel bans, and constant surveillance and monitoring.The detention of five Chinese feminists detained ahead of International Women's Day 2015 as they planned a public campaign against sexual harassment on public transport prompted an international outcry.Wu Rongrong, Li Tingting, Wei Tingting, Wang Man, and Zheng Churan were released "on bail" in 2015 after being detained for several weeks on suspicion of "picking quarrels and stirring up trouble," and have faced restrictions on their freedom of movement since.Reported by Xiao Yibing for RFA's Mandarin Service, and by Malik Wang and Hoi Man Wu for the Cantonese Service.

Four-year Jail Term for Citizen Journalist's COVID Reporting in China ASEAN TribuneDecember 28, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 ASEAN Tribune All Rights ReservedLength: 664 wordsBody 28 December 2020 (Voice of America) TAIPEI - A court in Shanghai, China on Monday sentenced former lawyer and citizen journalist Zhang Zhan to four years in prison for her reporting on the coronavirus outbreak, a harsh sentence that legal scholars say is aimed at having a chilling effect on Chinese rights activists.Zhang, 37, was one of several citizen journalists who covered the initial outbreak in China's central city of Wuhan. Their coverage painted a far more serious picture of conditions than the government's official narrative of the spreading infection. Her reports included examples of the harassment of families of victims who were seeking accountability, according to human rights advocates.Zhang was detained by authorities in May and accused of spreading false information, giving interviews to foreign media, disrupting public order and "maliciously manipulating" the outbreak. She went missing in Wuhan on May 14, according to media reports, and a day later turned up under arrest in Shanghai, more than 640 kilometers away. In court, she was formally charged with 'picking quarrels and provoking trouble,' an accusation frequently used against Chinese activists.Zhang's lawyer, Zhang Keke, told VOA that Zhang Zhan has been on a hunger strike for nearly five months. She appeared in court in a wheelchair, all but refusing to speak - apparently using silence as a form of protest.'The only thing she said is that citizens have the right to freedom of speech, and they have no right to question her,' Zhang Keke said.According to the defense lawyer, the prosecutor during the trial accused Zhang of publishing so-called "problematic remarks" on China's social media platforms including Weibo and WeChat. Yet the prosecution failed to provide any posts or videos as evidence.'She didn't fabricate any reports, nor has she created any harm to the society,' Zhang Keke said, adding that Zhang will likely appeal the verdict.A Chinese human rights lawyer who asked to remain anonymous told VOA that the four-year sentence is extremely harsh. 'Picking quarrels and provoking trouble usually leads to a fixed-term imprisonment of no more than five years. For first time offense, the sentence is usually one year,' he said, adding that Zhang's harsh sentence was aimed at instilling fear among citizen journalists and civil rights lawyers.Rights groups also condemned the ruling. Cédric Alviani, East Asia bureau head of the Paris-based media freedom group Reporters Without Borders, (RSF), called on the international community to increase pressure on the Chinese government until Beijing releases Zhang and other detained press freedom activists in China.'Zhang Zhan was only serving the public interest by reporting on the COVID-19 outbreak, so, she should never have been detained, not to mention, received a four-year prison sentence. This trial is actually a parody of justice,' Alviani told VOA.The United Nations' human rights office said in a tweet on Monday that it was troubled by the four-year sentence. 'We raised her case with the authorities throughout 2020 as an example of the excessive clampdown on freedom of expression linked to #COVID19  and  continue to call for her release,' the office said.China has been accused of covering up the initial outbreak of the coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 disease and silencing whistleblowers, including the late Dr. Li Wenliang, and citizen journalists Fang Bing, Chen Qiushi, Li Zehua and Zhang Zhan, for exposing information that authorities did not approve for release. Dr. Li died of COVID-19 after Beijing silenced his attempts to warn the world about the coronavirus.China has fiercely denied these accusations and said the country has been highly successful in containing the virus, compared to Western countries including the United States.According to a survey by the Committee to Protect Journalists, China was the world's leading jailer of journalists in 2020, with at least 47 people behind bars.Load-Date: December 29, 2020End of Document

What is doxing and why will the U.S. restrict visas to Chinese who do so?CE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 5, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 324 wordsBodyMike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State, said he will not let Chinese officials who publish personal data of Ougures citizens in the country as a form of intimidation.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Friday that the United States will refuse entry by members of the Chinese Communist Party and others engaged in doxing, i.e. spreading personal data on the internet as a form of intimidation."I will continue to apply these visa restrictions to make it clear that those responsible for actions that contravene international standards are not welcome in the United States," Pompeo said.The official nodded to the United Front Department of Labor, a body governing the rights of minorities, religion and Chinese communities abroad, which is often accused of persecuing dissidents and activists from the Uighur and Tibetan communities.See more: China defends its detention program for MuslimsChina has imprisoned more than a million Uighurs and other Turkish-speaking Muslims as part of an aggressive effort to forcover integrate them, according to human rights groups.An online campaign, which supports Beijing's policies, attacks the Facebook pages of Uighur activists on behalf of the Diba Central Army, whose ties to the Chinese government are unclear but which has been praised by the official media.President Donald Trump's administration has increased pressure on China in recent months, a country that was rated Thursday by National Intelligence Director John Ratcliffe as "the greatest threat to democracy and freedom worldwide since World War II."Earlier this week, the State Department had said it would limit visas to members of the Chinese Communist Party to only one month and a single entry.The party had 92 million members in 2019, and many Chinese believe they must join it to advance their careers, meaning that new U.S. visa restrictions, which also target direct relatives, are likely to affect several hundred million people.Load-Date: December 6, 2020End of Document

Chinese Communist Regime Blames Other Countries for COVID-19 OutbreakCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 8, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 568 wordsBodySpanish – The communist regime in China desperately seeks to remove responsibility for the origin of the COVID-19 from its shoulders. The negligence with which they handled the issue seems to have burdened Xi Jinping.Now he is using his media to spread a new theory that the COVID-19 did not originate in the Wuhan market, but on the other side of the world, in Western countries, such as Brazil and Canada, through imported frozen foods.Through conjecture, the communist newspaper Global Times claims that the virus arrived in China through these imports, while those interviewed only insist on the need for further investigation.The news portal belongs in turn to People’s Daily, the official newspaper of the Communist Party of China, which is why the new investigation is another strategy to generate opinion matrixes as other communist regimes such as those of Cuba and Venezuela often do.Baseless conjectures“Although it might be too early to jump to conclusions, the possibility that the coronavirus was passed on from cold-chain products into Wuhan cannot be ruled out,” the alleged report admits.It adds that the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) detected and isolated the live coronavirus in a positive sample from the outer packaging of frozen cod.Based on the alleged “clues,” the communist website states that seafood imported from several countries -such as Argentina and Ecuador- was contaminated with the novel coronavirus. It also mentions the United States, Brazil, Chile, Germany, and Canada regarding meat and fruit imports.The Chinese regime is hiding behind its own studies, forgetting that it prohibited access to the Wuhan market for experts from the World Health Organization (WHO), in complicity with the international organization’s own leadership.An “anonymous expert” who testified to the Global Times indicated that the infections caused by imports from the cold chain could be due to other countries being seriously affected by the virus.“We cannot conclude so far if the coronavirus existed in other countries before the early cases showed in Wuhan,” he says.He also blames Italy for indicating that the virus was circulating in that country since September 2019.Hiding the truthThe Xi Jinping government dismissed the scope of the virus from the beginning and silenced experts’ warnings. Now it seeks to silence the true origin of the virus.At least a week before they first announced it in January, the Chinese government knew that the new coronavirus could spread among humans, said Yuen Kwok-Yung, a researcher at the University of Hong Kong.The expert claims to have alerted the government on January 12 to the suspected human transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which caused COVID-19, but his warnings were not made public until January 19, according to the BBC.Physician Li Wenliang also tried to alert his colleagues in early December; no one heeded his warning. Months later, he died while treating infected patients.China’s intention to rewrite this story began a few months ago when it advised people not to eat imported salmon because it was linked to a resurgence in Beijing. The product came from Denmark, Norway, and Australia.Since then, a series of events related to imports have occurred, and they demonstrate the regime’s eagerness to annul its responsibility regarding a virus that has left more than 1.5 million people dead around the world.Load-Date: December 9, 2020End of Document

Australia demands China apologize for 'repugnant' Twitter postUPINovember 30, 2020 Monday 1:12 AM ESTCopyright 2020 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 586 wordsByline: DARRYL COOTEDateline: Nov. 30 BodyAs tensions between the two countries further strain, Australia on Monday demanded China apologize for posting a "repugnant" and "offensive" doctored image on Twitter of an Australian soldier threatening the life of an Afghan child.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in a strongly worded televised address that they have asked China's foreign affairs ministry to apologize for the post published a few hours earlier to the account of its deputy director and spokesman, Zhao Lijian."The Chinese government should be totally ashamed of this post," Morrison said in the address. "It diminishes them in the world's eyes."The doctored image of the smiling solider holding a bloody knife to the throat of a small Afghan child with a lamb his arms was published two weeks after the Australian government announced findings of a report that said Australian soldiers unlawfully killed 39 Afghans between 2005 and 2016 during war in the Middle Eastern country."Shocked by murder of Afghan civilians &amp; prisoners by Australian soldiers," Zhao said in the tweet that accompanied the image. "We strongly condemn such acts &amp; call for holding them accountable."Morrison called the post "truly repugnant" and that they have asked both China and Twitter to remove it."It is deeply offensive to every Australian, every Australian who has served in that uniform, every Australian who serves in that uniform today, everyone who has pulled on a uniform and served with Australians overseas from whatever nation, that they have done that," he said. "It is utterly outrageous and it cannot be justified on any basis whatsoever."Relations between the two countries have been fraying as Canberra has repeatedly sided against Beijing in the last year concerning its human rights abuses, the widely condemned national security law it imposed on Hong Kong and the coronavirus pandemic.China has responded by blaming Australia for the strained relations and imposing tariff penalties that are seen as retaliatory, with the most recent measure occurring on Friday when it increased import taxes of between 107% and 212% on wine from the Oceania nation while accusing it of price dumping.Australia's trade chief, Simon Birmingham, rejected the accusation and suggested they may have been retaliatory.Zhao told China state-run Global Times earlier this month the downturn in their relationship was due to Australia's "Cold War mentality and ideological prejudice" and its sense of feeling threatened by its development.In the past year, Australia has banned China's electronics company Huawei from developing its 5G Internet infrastructure due to national security concerns and has joined the United States in endorsing an independent investigation into the origins of the coronavirus in China. It also canceled its extradition treaty with Hong Kong in reaction to China's imposition of a national security law on the former British colony.Morrison said there are tensions between the two countries but said addressing them through this "slur on our great defense forces" is not the way to deal with their issues."I would hope this rather awful event hopefully may lead to the type of reset where this type of dialogue can be restarted," he said, adding, "You don't engage in in disinformation and the ugliness that we've seen in this post of the Chinese government Twitter account today."Australia last week announced the the suspension of 10 members of the military and has promised to prosecute war crimes alleged in the report.Load-Date: November 30, 2020End of Document

China sentences journalist who reported in Wuhan to 4 years in prisonCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 28, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 493 wordsBodyShanghai, China, Dec 28 (EFE) - Chinese citizen journalist Zhang Zhan was sentenced to four years in prison today for "causing altercations and seeking trouble" because of her information on the first coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, central China, Hong Kong daily Apple Daily reported today.That revolving, citing one of his lawyers, points out that Zhang refused to accept the charges on the view that his information - published through Chinese platforms such as WeChat and others banned in the country such as Twitter or YouTube - should not be censored.According to Amnesty International (AI), his work in Wuhan focused on reporting arrests of other independent reporters and harassment of relatives of coronavirus victims during the first global outbreak of the covid-19 pandemic.The Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD) noted in September that the woman had been arrested for publishing that Wuhan citizens had received rotten food during the eleven-week confinement of the city or that they were forced to pay fees in order to be tested for the coronavirus.The trial was held today in a court in the eastern city of Shanghai - where the defendant has his residence fixed - with a strong police presence and with the assistance of only his relatives.Zhang, who was arrested at the end of May, initiated a hunger strike in September that has caused her fitness to be "very weak," according to her defense, which states that authorities forcibly feed her through a tube and force her to carry shackles.Another of his lawyers revealed Zhang's 37-year-old intention to continue that hunger strike "even if he dies in prison" if the conviction was severe.The Prosecutor's Office had asked for a sentence of between four and five years in prison for "repeatedly publishing a large number of false information" and accepting interviews with foreign media to "maliciously exaggerate" the coronavirus situation in Wuhan.Human rights organizations protested the ruling: "Anyone who praises the 'success' of the Chinese government in containing the virus should take this into account. This is an integral part of the Chinese Communist Party pandemic control model," Human Rights Watch (HRW) researcher Yaqiu Wang lamented on Twitter.In this regard, AI recently stated that "citizen journalists were the primary, if not the only, source of first-hand, uncensored information about the covid-19 outbreak in China," recalling that these independent reporters "face harassment and repression for publishing news and disseminating government-censored information."Other citizens who also narrated Wuhan's current affairs disappeared or were arrested this year, such as businessman Fan Bing, lawyer Chen Qiushi or young reporter Li Zehua, although Wuhan was released in April.In Wuhan, local authorities took some of the information available about the outbreak, due, according to the then mayor, Zhou Xianwang, that they needed approval from higher instances to do so.Load-Date: December 29, 2020End of Document

HRW: China increased arrests against covid-19 reportersCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 26, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 344 wordsBodyThe Human Rights Watch (HRW) this Saturday, December 26, accused the Chinese authorities of intensifying the arrests of journalists and activists reporting "on the covid-19 pandemic or other issues or criticize the government."According to an HRW statement issued in New York, Chinese authorities have carried out further arrests of journalists and activists "without providing credible information suggesting that these individuals have committed legally recognizable crimes.""Stopping journalists and activists won't make China's real problems go away," HRW's researcher for the Asian country, Yaqiu Wang, quoted in the note, said.For Wang, "the Chinese government seems to have learned nothing from its crackdown on information after the covid-19 outbreak."The human rights organization said that "the Chinese authorities have sought to control the narrative of the coronavirus pandemic by silencing independent reporters, along with the use of specialized software, 'trolls' and Internet censors."                        HRW collects in his note the detention of three people, activist Ou Biaofeng and journalists Hze Fan, who works for Bloomberg agency, and Du Bin, a contributing photographer for The New York TImes newspaper."Since the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan in late 2019, Chinese authorities have also arrested a number of activists and citizen journalists for independently reporting on the pandemic," the NGO said, which said that while some have been released, others remain under arrest or their situation has not been made public.On 28 December, Chinese journalist Zhang Zhan will face a court that could sentence her to up to five years in prison for reporting the outbreak of coronavirus in Wuhan city on charges of "causing altercations and creating problems."Zhan was arrested in May, having traveled to Wuhan in February to report on the coronavirus outbreak.Zhang's lawyer told the media that officials have been foresaw by force since she started a hunger strike shortly after her arrest and that her health is deteriorating, as HRW collects.Load-Date: December 27, 2020End of Document

I'm Cheryl Casone in for Maria Bartiromo.It is Friday, it's November 27th. Your top stories at 8:00 a.m. Eastern time.President Trump sounds off. The commander in chief taking reporter questions for the first time since the election. Saying he would, of course, leave the White House if the electoral college shows that Joe Biden won.This is on the heels of a presidential pardon. Former national security advisor General Michael Flynn given a pardon just in time for Thanksgiving.We're going to get insight on all of this this morning.We're going to from House Minority Whip Steve Scalise in just a few minutes, and Florida congressman Greg Steube will be here later in the hour.We're also watching markets all morning long for you. Futures right now after the markets were closed for the holiday are higher. And Wall Street will be seeing a half trading day today, markets closing at 1:00 pm Eastern time.As for the week, good news, the markets should be closing out the week to the positive. The NASDAQ in record territory as the Dow looks to crack 30,000 once more today after crossing that milestone earlier this week.Vaccine skepticism. AstraZeneca is on the defense this morning after critics say it failed to give enough data on patient dosing in its late stage trials. And the reported 95 percent effectiveness rate needs another look.Ruling on religious restrictions. The supreme court telling New York Governor Andrew Cuomo he cannot put a capacity limit on houses of worship. We are on that story.And it is Black Friday, but it's going to look different. Retailers going with the shift to online sales as brick-and-mortar stores rethink foot traffic this year.And "Good Game," the best-selling video game for the past two decades making a buzz this morning.And MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live right now.We've had a mixed story in Europe all morning long, as you can see. The FTSE is under pressure, the CAC 40 in Paris, the DAX in Germany are higher. And then in Asia overnight, we've got great [ph] across the board, Shanghai composite the best performer overnight from Asia.Well, some of the top stories we're watching for you this morning. President Trump takes questions from reporters in his first extended public event since the election saying he would concede if he had to. But emphasizing the reports of massive election fraud still are on the table.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: If the electoral college votes for Joe Biden, will you concede?DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Certainly, I will. And you know that. But I think that there will be a lot of things happening between now and the 20th of January, a lot of things. Massive fraud has been found.It's going to be a very hard thing to concede.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: The president also announcing plans to visit Georgia Saturday December 5th to campaign for the Republican senate candidates there. The senate balance of power hinging on the January 5th runoff races.Well, COVID-19 cases are still on the rise. Hospitalizations related to the pandemic reaching a new record high for the 16th straight day while more than 181,000 people tested positive on Wednesday.And then on the same day, the TSA reporting over one million people were screened making it the busiest travel day since March, despite CDC warnings for people to stay at home.AstraZeneca defending its COVID-19 vaccine amid reports of dosing errors in its clinical trial. The company says that, despite the errors, the data shows the vaccine is effective though some are questioning the accuracy of the 90 percent rate.The company says its rate is still well above the 50 percent mandate issued by the United States. The company has reported recent hacking attempts, by the way, suspected to be the work of North Korea who has denied those allegations.Take a look at AstraZeneca. And the premarket stock is down more than two percent. We'll see if news breaks from that story today.President Trump pardons his former national security advisor, General Michael Flynn, just in time for Thanksgiving. This after a long legal battle.Remember, 2017 Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contact with a Russian official before President Trump's inauguration. Well, he later withdrew that plea saying the FBI set him up. The justice department agreed and they moved to drop that case earlier this year.Well, willing to step down. President Trump taking reporter questions for the first time since the election.He said he is prepared to honor the electoral college if it votes for Joe Biden but that it won't be easy to leave his post.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: If the electoral college votes for Joe Biden, will you concede?TRUMP: Certainly, I will. And you know that. But I think that there will be a lot of things happening between now and the 20th of January. A lot of things. Massive fraud has been found.It's going to be a very hard thing to concede.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Well, the Biden Administration could endanger oil industry powerhouses. In particular, look at the state of Louisiana. Remember, Biden is aiming for net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.I want to bring in Louisiana Congressman and House Minority Whip Steve Scalise.Congressman, it's good to see you this morning.SEN. STEVE SCALISE (R-LA): Cheryl, great to see you. Hope you had a great Thanksgiving.CASONE: I did. I'm a girl from Texas, I've been to Louisiana up and down most of my life. And I got to tell you, the oil and gas industry in your state is so dependent on what's happens with, I think, the global story. In particular with China.How nervous are you about -- let's first about John Kerry in his climate czar position and then how President Elect Biden would handle the Chinese?SCALISE: Well, you know when you look at what President Trump's done to bring the energy industry back, we're literally not only a dominant energy producer so that we can create our own energy, we're now sending our oil and natural gas to our friends all around the world.It's helped us geopolitically, it's helped our friends reduce dependence their dependence on Russian energy, the Saudi oil that they used to be so dependent on. It's weakened OPEC.So why anybody would want to go away from that boggles the mind. As you know from Texas, Louisiana but so many other states are part of the energy business now. Look at Pennsylvania.And this was a knew topic during the debate where Joe Biden went back and forth on the issue of banning fracking, who knows where he's going to fall on it.But the fact that he would want to bring someone like John Kerry who had one of the most failed foreign policies -- John Kerry went and helped get the deal to give Iran a nuclear weapon, undermine our biggest ally in the region, Israel, as well as so many other countries there.So I hope we don't go back to those kind of policies.As you can see, the president still pursuing his legal challenges and got a win just over the last few days in Pennsylvania where the court said they can't certify the election there. So still game to be played there.But I think it's telling when you look at some of the people that Joe Biden would surround himself with including John Kerry as a global warming czar.Look, the Paris Accord has been a failure. No country in Europe is even in compliance with it. And they exempted China. China would take so many country's manufacturing jobs and we don't want that to help to America, we're bringing manufacturing back. We need to strengthen our economy and focus on helping hard-working families become part of the middle class.And not give China the gains that we've made over the Trump first term that we've had.CASONE: Right. And again, having the United States become more and more energy dependent on itself which has been amazing, obviously, for jobs and the economy. Not just for Texas and Louisiana but also for the Dakotas region as well and the issue of fracking.Which at this point, the president-elect says he won't ban -- we shall see.But I want to pick up on something you mentioned about who Joe Biden's going to surround himself with. And in particular, Antony Blinken who has been chosen as the new secretary of state.This this goes back to Chin. Because if you don't have the Chinese -- or India, in particular, adhering to any type of energy standards or climate change standards whatsoever, it's like a zero-sum game for the U.S.We can't win -- if you're talking about global climate change, you can't have China continue to pollute the skies even if we do try to not do so under a Biden Administration.SCALISE: Right, Cheryl. And this is why it was such a smart move for President Trump to get out of the Paris Accord in the first place.Because think about this. We were losing manufacturing under the Obama and Biden years. Those are years we saw our middle class evaporate, we saw manufacturing leave America in droves, great companies were leaving America.And stuff was still getting made, it wasn't like we weren't making steel, they just weren't making steel in Pennsylvania. They were making it in countries like China and India where they don't have the kind of standards that we already have.A lot of these people like -- these globalists, warming alarmists that love beating up on America, they fail to recognize that we actually have really good standards that are unrivaled anywhere in the world.And so when you exempt China, for example, from these kind of standards, the steel will still get made, it'll just get made in a country where they emit four or five times more carbon than if we make it here in America.So if you're concerned about carbon emissions, getting into the Paris Accord will actually lead to an increase in global carbon emissions because those things that are made in America in a smart way, in an environmentally safe way --CASONE: Yes.SCALISE: -- will instead be made in other places where they emit more carbon --CASONE: Exactly. Exactly.SCALISE: -- and we lose the jobs.CASONE: Yes, I know. I agree with you one hundred percent.I want to bring in James Freeman from the "Wall Street Journal." He also has been following, obviously, the impact on the oil and gas industry. James.JAMES FREEMAN, WALL STREET JOURNAL ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR: Yes, thanks Cheryl.Congressman, I'm thinking even if -- even before there is any new Biden regulation or Biden law, some of your Democratic colleagues in the congress have been pretty successful pressuring big banks not to fund fossil fuel projects. There's been a big issue in Alaska.And I'm wondering if this is an issue in the Gulf region as well where oil and gas producers have trouble getting financing from the largest banks.SCALISE: James, we've seen that. And it's been a problem all across the United States the last few years.Where the folks that just -- and, by the way, when they say that they're against fossil fuels, you watch them, they fly around on jets and they drive cars -- you've got to plug your Prius into something, you don't plug it into a tree -- you've got to get energy from somewhere.A lot of times it's natural gas, coal, nuclear power. They want to get rid of all that. And yet, they're going to try to wreck your lifestyle but there's a lot of hypocrisy built into that.But in the meantime, you look at what energy has done, to save lives and improve our way of life. We're able to get low-cost energy in America.That not only helps us manufacture which has rebuilt our middle class -- all these people the hardworking families all these states that you've talked about, they're making good income, their wages were rising before COVID. And we're going to get back to those days.But if you were to get rid of the energy industry in America and think that just wind and solar panels are going to make up the difference, you wouldn't even be able to get 20 percent of your household electricity grid --CASONE: Yes.SCALISE: -- with that kind of energy. So why would you want to wreck America's economy? Again, that stuff's going to get made, it's just going to get made in countries like Brazil, China, India where they emit more carbon.CASONE: Yes. Again, it goes back to being a job story. Before I let you go, really quick, Congressman, I do want to ask you about Georgia.Senator Kelly Loeffler says that she is the firewall, that she and David Perdue are the firewall here. Your thoughts on the runoff in Georgia because this will affect how you do business in Washington.SCALISE: Right. I think, look, everybody that looks at all of these plans, shifts to the left, the socialists that are fighting in the House to say that they're going to go back to open borders -- even Joe Biden's talking about stopping the building of the wall and literally just letting anybody into this country regardless of what a legal process is -- ought to recognize that the only way to stop any of this is in the United States Senate right now.And those two seats are everything, it's all on the line.I know I've already hosted events, we've raised over 200,000 dollars and I hope everybody stays engaged in those races. I hope the people of Georgia vote for both Senator Perdue and Senator Loeffler. Everything's on the line.CASONE: It certainly is. Congressman Steve Scalise, it's great to have you here. Hope you had a great Thanksgiving.SCALISE: Great being back with you. And hope you all had a great Thanksgiving as well.CASONE: All right. We'll see you very soon, sir.We've got a lot more coming up. Pardoning Michael Flynn. House judiciary committee member, Greg Steube, is going to weigh in on the president's move to pardon his former national security adviser.Plus we're focusing on retail this morning, how strong online presence is changing the holiday shopping season for some companies.You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA, live on FOX BUSINESS.CASONE: Black Friday shopping like we've never seen before, to be honest with you.Although, a rise in COVID case may scare some shoppers away from brick-and- mortar stores.The National Retail Federation remains pretty optimistic about holiday spending. They're forecasting a range increase of 3.6 percent to 5.2 percent this season.I want to bring Mark Tepper into this because we've talking about retail since the six o'clock hour with you, Mark.And I think it's fascinating that we don't know how people are going to shop but we know that they will shop. And NRF is pretty positive.MARK TEPPER, PRESIDENT & CEO, STRATEGIC WEALTH PARTNERS: Yes, I think you hit the nail on the head there. We don't know how they're going to shop. We are assuming -- and I think rightfully assuming -- that most of the shopping's going to be done via e-commerce, I do believe that to be true.Cheryl, you mentioned brick-and-mortar retailers. You look at Walmart, Target, those companies are doing very well. But a lot of the mall-based retailers like I mentioned earlier in the show, the mall based brick-and- mortar retailers like Nordstrom, Macy's, Kohl's, I'm not sure how well those companies are going to do.And from an investment standpoint, those stocks are already up 60 to 130 percent this month. So the question becomes do they deserve that kind of price hike, right?CASONE: Yes, agree.TEPPER: I think probably not. I think out of all three of those that I just mentioned, Nordstrom would probably be the most effective because they have done everything they could to evolve towards this new digital economy.They've have rolled out some of their local Nordstrom stores which is like 3,000 square feet instead of 100,000 so I like what they've done.CASONE: And you know what, James, what's interesting is that if you look at those top three names that we were just showing on our screen, Walmart, Target, even Amazon -- these are now essential businesses, these aren't just brick-and-mortar stores. They're not going to shut down, right? Kohl's and Macy's, different story here.But Walmart and Target sell groceries, they sell pharmaceutical products, they've got drugstores now particularly in Walmart. So if we do go back into lockdowns, further lockdowns, in the next month or two, these are your winners.FREEMAN: They're clearly winning. And as we heard, there are some brick- and-mortar winners as well -- we were talking earlier in the hour. if we want to think about the positives, we got good October data on consumer spending, the initial jobless claims lately not so good.But generally, we have a rebounding economy. If we want to look at the glass is half full, the lockdowns in many places are not as harsh, as broad as the ones in the spring but clearly, it is putting big pressure on those local brick-and-mortar focused retailers.And I think both customers, you don't want to see them go away, but also those retailers just have to get very creative on how even with this -- with the rules and the distancing, finding ways to bring people into the stores and to continue selling.CASONE: And you hope that they've got their shipping ready to go --FREEMAN: Yes, that's a good point.CASONE: -- because not just do we have a pandemic and a lockdown now, we've got the holidays. Mark, what about Cyber Monday?TEPPER: Cyber Monday's going to be huge as always. But I want to hit on your point you just made about shipping.Let's not forget that there are other ways to play this trade as well, right? There's derivative ways to play this trade such as UPS because they would be the logistic solution for a lot of the e-commerce that's happening.Or, Cheryl, we talked about small businesses earlier in the show. One of the names that we like is stamps.com, they basically supply the shipping and the warehousing for small businesses to deliver on their e-commerce promises.CASONE: Yes, all right. We're going to pick up on this conversation after a quick short break. Guys, thank you. Stay right there, you stay right there at home.MORNINGS WITH MARIA will be right back.CASONE: TikTok survives, for now. The U.S. granting ByteDance an extension for the sale of a popular app moving the date to December 4th while a potential sale to Walmart and Oracle is still in the works.Meanwhile, TikTok got some help from a group of its stars who joined a lawsuit objecting to the Trump Administration's order to ban the app.James, do you think that a Biden Administration would stay tough on China and if so, if you say yes, would they still continue to push for TikTok to be sold?FREEMAN: I would think they might want this issue resolved before they come in.I think it's been interesting -- the president, I think is raising a legitimate question on what happens to all of this data from tens of millions of users in the United States, how is that data used or abused by China or entities in China? This is not a country and a regime that respects individual liberty, obviously. So.But what we've seen here is kind of the opposite of what a lot of people kind of predicted with the sort of over-heated media claims about Trump as an authoritarian. We've kind of seen this system is working as it should.The president raises an issue but the courts, including Trump appointed judges, saying wait a minute, government doesn't necessarily have the authority to simply order a business to close or be sold.So you've seen a number of court fights including ones involving these people who have been able to use the platform very efficiently to reach millions of people.And so I still would expect some kind of deal where it looks like Oracle and Walmart will buy it. But I think you've seen basically the process working as it should.CASONE: Yes. What --FREEMAN: Executive branch raises a national security concern but the courts say the owners have rights too.CASONE: Yes. And you're right, it is going to be probably decided in the courts.At the same time, what I love about this TikTok story, Mark, is that consumers and these stars on TikTok are banding together because, frankly - - I don't have TikTok but I know everybody under the age of 30 probably does. And they love it, consumers are obsessed with it.TEPPER: My kids are obsessed with it.CASONE: Yes.TEPPER: And it bugs me. So. Look, I can understand the frustration from the TikTok stars, my kids have their favorite TikTok stars they follow. Some of these stars have millions of followers and they're making a ton of money off this app.Now, Cheryl, the interesting thing about this lawsuit is that it really looked like a grassroots effort that was led by these big-time TikTok stars but it turns out it was actually TikTok and ByteDance who set them up with some all-star attorneys, kind of as pawns and one heck of a legal strategy.So I thought that was kind of interesting and a bit strange.But look, I think at this point it seems like an outright ban of TikTok is off the table. I think it's more about, at this point, how does TikTok play nice with U.S. and not share this information with the Chinese government.CASONE: Well, then maybe the Walmart Oracle partnership with TikTok could be a good thing for everybody. Because it just seems like nobody wants TikTok to go away.Even though I barely just figured out Instagram -- but that's another story. Anyway -- it's true.Guys, we'll see you in just a few moments. We've got a lot more coming on the show this morning.Pardoning Michael Flynn. House judiciary committee member, Greg Steube weighs in on the president's move to pardon his former national security advisor.Plus heading home. The Rockefeller Center Christmas tree owl that tugged at our heartstrings going back to the wild. That's making a buzz this morning.CHERYL CASONE, HOST: And welcome back, I'm Cheryl Casone. I'm in for Maria Bartiromo. It is Friday, it's November 27th. We are an hour away from the opening bell this Friday. Let's take a look at markets 8:30 am Eastern Time.As you can see, great numbers across the board, Futures are higher. Markets were closed, of course, for the Thanksgiving holiday.

Well, a bit of a mixed story here. A lot of questions about Britain and its trade relationship with the EU as Brexit approaches. As you can see, there's pressure there CAC 40 and the DAX are higher. And then looking at Asia overnight in green across the board, the best performer there, the Shanghai Composite at more than 1%.And some of the top stories we're following for you this morning. Vandals taking the opportunity to deface and topple statues on Thanksgiving. Four statues including a war memorial and likenesses of Washington Lincoln and McKinley were targeted throughout the country. Many appear to be done in the name of the LANDBACK campaign, that's a movement claiming to be against white supremacy. And for indigenous food sovereignty, housing and clean air and water.Monitors are urging Deutsche Bank to drop expansion plans in Russia, and shut down its business there instead. The Monitors appointed by New York Department of Financial Services have been in place since 2017 after the German lender was caught in a $10 billion Russian money laundering scheme that involved its Moscow, New York and London branches. Well, the Monitors say efforts to improve its operations aren't enough to make up for the large risk of doing business with Russian clients.Well, Amazon's celebrating its workers this holiday season. Full time employees who work between December 1st and 31st will qualify for a $300 bonus, while part time employees will receive a $150 bonus. This is on top of a separate round of $500 million in payments given to its frontline workers back in June. Amazon has seen a major uptick in orders since the start of the pandemic.Let's take a look at the stock in the pre-market. It is up pushing 1% higher right now.The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has opened an investigation into 115,000 Tesla vehicles over from suspicion safety issues. The agency says it's received more than 40 complaints that linkages near the ball joints can fail that would allow contact between the tire and the wheel liner. The investigation evolves 2015 to 2017 Model S and 2016 to 2017 Model X vehicles.Tesla's CEO Elon Musk announced Tesla's new battery technology could deliver a semi truck that can go 621 miles per charge. The new battery uses cells that are structural members of the pack which helps reduce the overall weight of the entire system. That's been a big issue for them. Stock is up almost 1.5% right now.Well, the fight continues. President Trump telling reporters yesterday that he will leave office if the electoral college votes for Joe Biden, but says there's still voter fraud claims to look at. He took questions in his first major public event since the election and vowed to continue his legal fight saying, "a lot of things are happening between now and January 20th."I want to bring in Florida Congressman, member of the House Judiciary Committee, Greg Steube. Congressman, it's great to see you here, sir.REP. GREG STEUBE (R), FLORIDA: Yes, good to see you.CASONE: Your reaction to the President's comments yesterday.STEUBE: Well, he absolutely should stay in this fight as long as we have legal options available for him in some of these states where there is affidavits of fraud that have occurred. So, I support him in continuing these legal fights for as long as he can. And I know more of these states should be like Florida and not allow absentee ballots or write in ballots coming from people who you don't know who they are and not verified you would solve all these problems.CASONE: All right, let's move on to the other big piece of news that crossed over the last 24 hours. That's President Trump, he announced that full presidential pardon for his former National Security Adviser General Michael Flynn.He tweeted on Wednesday, I want to show our viewers. This is my great honor to announce that General Michael T. Flynn has been granted a full pardon. Congratulations to General Flynn and his wonderful family. I know you will now have a truly fantastic Thanksgiving.But now the big question is, who else do you think he will pardon?STEUBE: Well, I certainly -- I thank President Trump for doing that. I wish he would have pardoned General Flynn a long time ago. What happened to General Flynn was an absolute national travesty, and I hope the individuals that were involved in the attack on him and conjuring up evidence against him, all things that happen are being investigated, and that will come to fruition here very soon.But anybody that was involved in this, that was investigated and charged with crimes, that the DOJ at the time, in this activist political DOJ was trying to take down members of the Trump campaign, and the Trump team should actually absolutely be held accountable for that.CASONE: And those questions about Paul Manafort and also George Papadopoulos.STEUBE: Yes, absolutely. We have evidence that the DOJ misappropriated their ability to have justice against these individuals, and were conjuring up evidence like they did against General Flynn. They should be held accountable for those decisions.CASONE: All right. Why don't we move on to some legislation that you're working on? Of course, we're going to have to go back to work pretty soon here. You recently introduced the Chinese Communist Party Visa Disclosure Act.I think this is really interesting. It requires people that apply for visas here to disclose if they get money from the Chinese government or the party. I mean, tell us more about this, because I think the question now with President-elect Joe Biden, is how tough he's going to be on China. Obviously, you're saying we need to make sure that we are tougher on China.STEUBE: Yes. Obviously, Biden's not going to be tough on China if his family received millions and hundreds of millions of dollars from the Chinese Communist Party. And we all know that anybody that is paid for by the Chinese Communist Party or a citizen of the Chinese Communist Party, is part of their apparatus and is spying in the United States, and is legally obligated to give them informationSo, if we have students here in the United States who are here on a student visa, and they're receiving money from the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese Communist Party is paying for their tuition or paying for them to be there. That information should be disclosed to us as a country so that our security, national security advisors and folks in the national security realm can know who these people are and who they're getting money from.CASONE: Let me push back, though, because, you know, Antony Blinken, we know that that is Biden's pick for Secretary of State. We were looking back at some comments he made in July. And he actually said, this is where I'm wondering if President-elect Biden's going to pick up on the push against China. Antony Blinken said that the Chinese, they are competition.And then, of course, Xi Jinping congratulated, you know, Joe Biden, we know that. But what the Chinese want and what I think Biden is going to give them I think that's going to be a little bit different.STEUBE: Well, I hope that Biden comes back from the person he was during the Obama administration. I mean, look how hard Trump's been on the Chinese Communist Party on the trade deals. I hope Biden, if he is becomes president, doesn't set aside all these trade deals that the Trump administration has negotiated with the Chinese Communist Party.But the bottom line is, if we have people in this country who are being paid for by the Communist Chinese Party, we as a country need to know about it, and our national security folks need to know about it as well.CASONE: All right. I want to bring in my colleague, James Freeman from the Journal because he and Maria actually wrote a book, and a lot of it was about China. James, go ahead.JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL: Yes. I'm wondering if you see an opportunity on a bipartisan basis here where maybe you kind of have a broad coalition of saying, OK, we're going to continue the effort against China but have lower tariffs with trading partners with the rest of the world. Basically, putting pressure on China if companies not only have the opportunity to manufacture in the US, but also maybe a better relative opportunity in India, Vietnam, Mexico, wherever it is.I'm just wondering, as we kind of try to forecast the Biden agenda, if you think you might end up with tariffs stay on China, but they get lower in other places.STEUBE: Well, there absolutely will be bipartisanship if we hold the Senate and Mitch McConnell is in-charge of the Senate because Nancy Pelosi would be forced to work with Mitch McConnell in the Senate to get things done. Obviously, Biden can do things in foreign relations through the presidency, that he doesn't necessarily need the options from Congress or the approval from Congress for. But hopefully, we hold the Senate and you will see some bipartisan agreements on some of these -- on some of our foreign adversaries as it relates to tariffs.CASONE: And let me ask you about that, let's pick up on Georgia. Because, obviously, I don't know if you heard it yet, well, I know you heard. Yesterday, President Trump said he's going to go to Georgia, December 5th. That's a Saturday. So he is going to go campaign for Kelly Loeffler and for Purdue.Obviously, this really will dictate what our country looks like after January 20th. How are you feeling about Georgia right now?STEUBE: Well, I feel good because I feel like, you know, both of those individuals were ahead in their races when they called the vote so they had more votes than the other people in the race. If you would add what Doug Collins had and Kelly Loeffler had together, it was way more than her opponent, so I feel good about it.There's obviously a ton of money being dumped all across the country from both sides. And again, I have real concerns about these mail-in ballots that there's no verification form.In Florida, you can't do that. You have to be a registered voter. You have to request the ballot. And then that information from that person that submits that ballot is verified to ensure that it's Greg Steube in Sarasota County, Florida that's turning in his absentee ballot. That's not happening in some of these states like Georgia, and that greatly concerns me.So I hope that the Georgia legislature and their governor and secretary of state will clamp down and require verification on these mail-in ballots.CASONE: Well, and the big thing about Georgia is going to be turnout. I mean, a lot of people that came out during the presidential election that also voted in the Senate races came out in supportive of Joe Biden. But at the same time, if those Democrats don't come back in January, and the Republicans are energized, because they know what's at stake now in Georgia, that could be the tipping point that would keep the Senate red.STEUBE: Well, that's why Trump's going down there because one of the concerns is Trump voters just turn out for Trump and vote for a Republican while they're there. So the President's going there to rally his troops and ensure that his supporters go out and vote, regardless of the fact that he's not on the ticket for the two Republican candidates in Georgia because his voter, Trump voters are very important to the outcome of that election.CASONE: Well, markets love gridlock, congressman, you know that. Congressman Greg Steube, it's great to see you. Thank you, sir, for being here.STEUBE: OK.Cheryl Casone: All right. We've got a lot more coming up. It's Black Friday, remember that? We're going to take you live to one major retail outlet with the holiday shopping season. Here we go, we finally have picture of people lining up to shop. I'm very happy to say this. I'm loving this. We're going to go there, next.Plus, Super Mario is lasting impact. The Nintendo star staying power in the video game world is making a buzz this morning. You are watching "Mornings with Maria" live on Fox Business.CASONE: Black Friday may be looking a little different this year. But that doesn't mean people are not out shopping for deals and discounts. Kristina Partsinevelos is at the Tanger Outlets in Deer Park, New York covering where the stores are. I'm so happy, Kristina, to see crowds and people out this morning.KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, CORRESPONDENT: Yes. There are definitely crowds here because Black Friday is known as the busiest shopping day of the year. I'm sitting in front of Adidas. There is a line but a lot of the lines are due to the restrictions, the capacity restrictions in the stores. You have people manning the fronts. There's usually like an occupancy number written on the door.But just to show, foot traffic ease down dramatically. Just on my other shoulder, you can see Nike. There was a little bit of a line but there's nobody standing outside of there and the stores not even full. I walked in right before this live shot.What we're seeing here at this location is anchor tenants like the movie theater is closed. And the fact that door buster deals have started days ago, even weeks ago as early as mid-October when Amazon Prime came into play. But these discounts, if you're wondering how deep they are, they're actually pretty good this year compared to last year. I'd say the average discount on apparel, bags, shoes, 22%, versus last year at 16%, so a little bit better.And if people are watching at home right now, maybe you're thinking hey, I'm just going to shop on my phone or shop online. Overall, though, it seems like there's going to be more people buying goods, the expectation from the National Retail Federation is an increase this year from anywhere between 3% and 5%. So that would potentially bring in $750 billion on Black Friday.This is stronger year and the federation says that part of that has to do with we're just not spending on travel. We're not spending on entertainment. Therefore, we have a little bit extra maybe to spend on some items for ourselves.But the big trend, Cheryl, is right now will this continue? Will we be shopping online, Refinitiv survey said 67% of respondents said they would continue to buy their Black Friday deals online even if there was a vaccine. So this trend could be permanent, back to you.CASONE: Kristina, stay with me because Mark Tepper and I were talking about this earlier. He thinks there's going to be a lot of guilt shopping out there, because people aren't going home to see their families. And they're going to overspend and ship them more gifts than they would have normally. What do you say?PARTSINEVELOS: I would say I noticed that in the Nike Store. So I just went in, I noticed several people buying at least six to seven pairs. One man walked out with at least 15. So I'm not sure if he's just trying to resell them or he is trying to send them back to family.But, I'm sure, a lot of people were using their phones and snapping pictures, and doing FaceTime in the stores. The same thing with J. Crew. So, maybe they're just sending one poor family member to go out and bear with the crowd so everybody can just stay home and stay safe.CASONE: I think we should bring in Mark Tepper for a victory lap. Mark, what do you say? You're right.Mark: Absolutely. Kristina, that's a lot of shoes, 15 pairs is crazy. Oh, look, I think it's --PARTSINEVELOS: Well, it's the discount. Nike is 7%, sorry. The discounts are really cheap, but you can get a pair of Nikes for $70,Mark: Yes, that's a good deal. So look, everybody likes to win. And when you can find $100 shirt for 30 bucks, that's a big win Skipping with a pair of Nikes for $70. So that's this whole off price segment of this sector, right? And when I think off price, one of the leaders in my opinion is TJ Maxx, off price is an area of retail that in my opinion is absolutely insulated from e commerce, right? Because you actually have to go into the physical store so that you can have that treasure hunt experience, which consumers love.CASONE: Final word, Kristina.PARTSINEVELOS: Well, I was going to agree with that because there is a Neiman, last call Neiman Marcus and an off Saks Fifth. And I would say yes, I went in there but it was dead. There was nobody in either location.CASONE: Well, it's such a different Black Friday but I'm glad you're out there for us. Kristina. And they are going to be out there all morning for Fox Business, so thank you for that.And Mark Tepper, we will see you on the other side of the commercial break. All right, we're going to take a quick break. But, oh, my favorite story of the day heading home, the owl tugging at our heartstrings going back to the wild where she was released. You're watching "Mornings with Maria" live on Fox Business.CASONE: Time for the morning buzz. For Seth (ph), good game The Wall Street Journal take a look at some of the best selling video games over the past 25 years. Mo surprise Super Mario took the top spot. Nintendo games accounting for more than a third of the top 20 games between 95 and 99 call of duty seeing a big surge. Their titles, the first or second best selling games every year since 2010, Mark this category is huge.MARK TEPPER, PRESIDENT AND CEO, STRATEGIC WEALTH PARTNERS: And it's not going anywhere. And video games have come a long way from Mario all the way to Call of Duty. That was more of a Mario guy and myself.Look, I got to tell you, I've been checking eBay daily to try and find the new PlayStation four my nine-year-old son. There's a lot of price gouging going on out there because the new PS5 and Xbox are sold out. But video game demand is not going anywhere.You mentioned Call of Duty, popularity of Call of Duty is one of the main reasons we own Activision stock. I mean, it is one of the best selling video game franchises in history. Just a little too complicated for me, I'll stick to Mario.CASONE: Well, I'm going to stick to animal stories because the tiny owl that was found hiding in this year's Rockefeller Center Christmas tree has been released back into the wild. Rocky (ph) flew into our hearts. She took a trip from Upstate New York in the New York City. She was cleaning the branches of the tree. She got a clean bill health and now James, she's been released. Can we just have a-ha moment for the owl? I love this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FREEMAN: Yes, you know why? I'm happy to see (Rocky) going to her home in the woods. But I wondered if she was a little ambivalent. She kind of hung with the handler for a while before flying off into the wilderness. So I'm wondering if she had maybe a few second thoughts about leaving New York City at Christmas, which is magical as we know.CASONE: She was living large in that tree. That's for sure. Guys, thank you very much. A little bit story. All right, we've got a lot more coming up. It is Black Friday, find out how you can score a discount on some new Fox Business gear that is coming up next. You're watching "Mornings more Maria" live on Fox Business.CASONE: It is Black Friday and just in time for the holidays. We're introducing official Fox Business gear. It is on sale. You can visit shop.foxbusiness.com. You will get 20% off during our Black Friday sale. You're going to find socks, vest, jackets, hats. By the way, remember shops.foxbusiness.com for all those deals.I love stuff. I love this best by the way. All right, let's bring in James Freeman. Mark Tepper for your final thoughts, and do you want some stuff because I can send you some.(Inaudible)FREEMAN: Right, yes.TEPPER: Looks good. And also, just, you know, we're in week of counting blessings, so I really appreciate family and friends and a wonderful neighbor who's been teaching me the art of Turkey frying which is fantastic.FREEMAN: We got to be careful with frying a turkey though. I hope you were.TEPPER: Yes, always, safety first. Always, distance follow that but what it takes to have flavorful, amazing.CASONE: Yes. I've seen that frying go wrong just saying and some of the Casone family. All right, Mark Tepper, final thoughts, Black Friday?,FREEMAN: Support your small businesses this week and your local small businesses, whether it's a restaurant like James mentioned, go and get a gift card from your local candy shop, buy some boxes of chocolate, do anything you can to support small businesses because they've been hammered throughout the pandemic.CASONE: Yes. No, you're point about -- I got to go jobs issue too. I mean, if you go out and support small businesses tomorrow, you're supporting your fellow Americans. And those jobs that are so dependent on those small businesses as we go back into these lockdowns, unfortunately, parts of the country. James, final word, it really does matter. It does.FREEMAN: Yes. This is definitely weak to appreciate those people in your community. You don't want those businesses, those restaurants you love to go away.CASONE: Yes. Well, I tell you what, there's somebody that loves the same restaurants I do. And he's hosts in the next three hours. James, Mark, guys, thank you so much. Bringing in David Asman because, well, I've got my gear. I got my cap.Load-Date: November 28, 2020End of Document

The Chinese regime sentenced four years in prison to the citizen journalist who covered the coronavirus epidemic in WuhanCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 28, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 592 wordsBodyA citizen journalist covering the covid-19 epidemic in Wuhan was sentenced to four years in prison on Monday, as long as the Chinese regime boasts of its successes in the fight against the disease that has spread across the globe in a year.Zhang Zhan "seemed very despondent when the ruling was announced," one of his lawyers, Ren Quanniu, declared himself "very concerned" about his psychological status, told the AFP.Journalists and foreign diplomats who traveled to the Shanghai court where this 37-year-old former lawyer was tried were unable to enter the courtroom.Some of his supporters were repelled by security forces during the opening of the process, AFP journalists noted.Zhang Zhan could be convicted of up to five years in prison.A native of Shanghai, she traveled in February to Wuhan, at the time prey to the epidemic, and disseminated on social media reports, most of them about the chaotic situation in hospitals.According to the official balance sheet, nearly 4,000 covid-19 deaths were recorded in the metropolis of 11 million inhabitants, or nearly all of the 4,634 deaths counted across China between January and May.China's initial response to the epidemic has been criticized, as Beijing did not quarantine Wuhan and its region until 23 January, even though there had been cases since early December 2019.Nearly a year ago, on 31 December 2019, the first case was reported to the World Health Organization (WHO).But at the same time, doctors who mentioned the appearance of a mysterious virus were interrogated by police, who accused them of "spreading rumors."One of them, Dr. Li Wenliang, died of covid-19 in early February, which caused outrage on social media."Extraordinary" successAs for Zhang, she was arrested in May on charges of "riot provocation," a terminology often used against opponents of President Xi Jinping's regime.Specifically, the court accuses her of having disseminated false information online, another lawyer of hers, Zhang Keke, said.Zhang began a hunger strike in June to protest against her detention, but has been forced by nasal intubation, according to her lawyers."When I saw her last week, she said, 'If I'm sentenced hard, I'll reject any food to the end.' She believes she will die in prison," Explained Zhang Keke.In the articles he disseminated online, Zhang denounced the confinement imposed in Wuhan and referred to a "serious violation of human rights".Three other citizen journalists, Chen Qiushi, Fang Bin and Li Zehua, were also arrested after completing these events. The AFP failed to contact its lawyers.Zhang's process took place shortly before a WHO mission arrives in China in January to investigate the origins of the epidemic.The leaders of the ruling Chinese Communist Party (PCC) expressed satisfaction with their "extremely extraordinary" success in the face of the pandemic, Xinhua agency reported Friday following a meeting of the PCC's political bureau.The Chinese government often condemns opponents during the New Year's Eve festivities, when the attention of the rest of the world diminishes.On Monday, the process of a group of Hong Kong activists who were arrested last August while trying to flee by boat from former British colony bound for Taiwan was also due to open in Shenzhen, south.MORE ON THIS TOPIC:A journalist missing for reporting the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan could be under strict surveillanceChinese regimeBloomberg journalist was arrested by Chinese regime in BeijingHuman Rights Watch reported that China increased arrests of covid-19 reportersLoad-Date: December 29, 2020End of Document

S&P DJ removing Chinese companies from index after US orderAssociated Press Financial WireDecember 10, 2020 Thursday 11:48 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; INTERNATIONAL NEWS; POLITICAL NEWSLength: 376 wordsDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) — S&P DJ Indices is removing 21 Chinese companies from its indexes, or groups of stocks and bonds used to track financial market movements, after Americans were barred from investing in them as part of a feud with Beijing over technology and security.The Chinese government criticized Wednesday's move as politically motivated.The companies affected include surveillance technology provider Hikvision Digital Technology Co.; China's biggest processor chip manufacturer, SMIC, and state-owned nuclear power and construction companies.The announcement follows President Donald Trump’s Nov. 13 order barring Americans from buying stocks or bonds issued by companies that U.S. officials say are owned or controlled by the Chinese military.The move by S&P DJI Indices has no direct impact on the companies but investment funds that are designed to track market movements will have to sell their stocks and bonds, which might at least temporarily depress prices.“We firmly oppose the relevant practices of the U.S. side,” said a foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying. “I believe that the U.S. practice of fabricating lies and rumors and hunting and containing Chinese enterprises without a bottom line will eventually be proven not in the interests of the U.S. itself.”U.S. officials complain China’s ruling Communist Party takes advantage of access to American technology and investment to expand its military, already one of the world’s biggest and most heavily armed.Washington also has imposed export bans and other sanctions on Hikvision and other Chinese companies including telecom equipment maker Huawei Technologies Ltd.HikVision and Huawei say they have no connection to the military and never have conducted military-related research and development.The Pentagon has cited 31 companies since June as being military-linked.The securities order was Trump’s first major action toward China since he lost his reelection bid to challenger Joe Biden. Economists and political analysts say Trump is likely to take more actions before leaving office on Jan. 20.Political analysts expect little change in policy under Biden due to widespread frustration with China’s trade and human rights records and accusations of spying and technology theft.Load-Date: December 10, 2020End of Document

AMP.- China.- Sentenced to four years in prison for her briefing coverage of Wuhan's coronavirus outbreakCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 28, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 440 wordsBodyUN expresses concern about this case and restrictions on freedom of expression in China   MADRID, 28 (EUROPA PRESS)   A Shanghai court has on Monday sentenced Zhang Zhan, a 37-year-old lawyer guilty of "rising problems and fights" with her reports of the coronavirus outbreak that emerged in late 2019 in the Chinese city of Wuhan, on Monday.   On hunger strike since June, a month after her arrest, Zhang has been convicted by the New Pudong People's Court in Shanghai, Hong Kong Free Press reportedly quoting her lawyer, although she has not given further details of what happened.   Zhang was among the many Chinese citizens who worked as makeshift journalists during the outbreak of the pandemic in Wuhan. She was arrested for "spreading lies" after showing images of crowded hospitals and launching criticism of Beijing government management through her social media.   Zhang's defense has already moved forward before the trial was held that her intention was to "reject food to the end" in the event of a "severe sentence."   The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has been "deeply concerned" about the conviction against this "citizen journalist." "We treated your case with the authorities in 2020 as an example of the excessive restrictions on freedom of expression linked to COVID-19 and continued to call for your release," michelle Bachelet's office has claimed on Twitter.   Since the start of the pandemic at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China has arrested several activists trying to report what was happening in 'ground zero' and although some have been liberators, others are unaware of their whereabouts, the NGO Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported last week.   One of the detainees unknown to his whereabouts is Fang Bin, a Wuhan businessman who was arrested for posting videos of the city's hospitals in February.   HRW has noted that since the beginning of December this year, the arrests of journalists have intensified, after China had expelled twelve foreign correspondents earlier.   Among the cases mentioned are that of activist Ou Biaofeng, arrested in Hunán Province, based on article 23 of the Chinese penal code: "seeking fights and causing conflict", a crime for which he could have a sentence of up to 5 years in prison. Ou had given voice to Chinese government detractors.   Another case cited is that of Bloomberg Haze Fan journalist who was arrested on December 7 for "endangering national security," while on the 16th the same thing happened to Du Bin, a journalist who had worked as a contributing photographer with 'The New York Times' and who according to his friends worked on a government-critical book.Load-Date: December 29, 2020End of Document

Japan to review drone security in check against China, report saysUPINovember 19, 2020 Thursday 12:37 PM ESTCopyright 2020 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 398 wordsByline: ELIZABETH SHIMDateline: Nov. 19 BodyJapan could soon step up drone security, possibly eliminating China-made vehicles from its fleet.Tokyo plans to strengthen security measures for drones used to monitor dams, ports and power plants. Ministries and government agencies could be required to comply with new rules for drones nationwide, starting next year, the Nikkei reported Thursday.The policy could rule out purchases of drones from certain countries. Drone-manufacturing countries and foreign companies were not named specifically, but it would be "virtually impossible" for agencies to purchase drones made in China, according to the report.China and Japan have been at odds over issues of security. Japan has fended off Chinese boats from its claimed waters in the East China Sea, while drawing closer to allies in the region, including Australia.Drone security measures are to apply to all Japanese ministries and other entities that must comply with the country's Basic Act on Cybersecurity. Operations affected include territorial security, criminal investigations and inspection of "critical infrastructure," where drones are used to collect data domestically.The Japanese report comes more than a year after the United States warned Chinese-made drones could pose data theft threats. The drones could send data to Chinese firms, which could then be accessed by the Chinese government, the U.S. government had said.Japan remains guarded against possible Chinese security threats as the ruling conservatives, the Liberal Democratic Party, maintains strong support across age groups.The Mainichi Shimbun reported Thursday a November survey it conducted jointly shows overwhelming support for Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, with more than 80% of those aged 18 to 29 saying they approve of his performance.Masao Matsumoto of the Social Survey Research Center said Japan's youth prefer the "stability" the conservatives represent, while Kanto Gakuin University's Shintaro Nakanishi, a sociologist, said the younger generations remain less than optimistic about Japan's future and are wary of change, according to the report.In October the Asahi Shimbun reported Suga was aware of a "blacklist" of Japanese scientists who were denied membership to the Science Council of Japan. The candidates had expressed critical views of government policies. The allegations led to lower approval ratings for the prime minister last month.Load-Date: November 19, 2020End of Document

"It diminishes them in the world's eyes", Morrison told media at a press briefing.Mr Morrison said the government had contacted Twitter asking them to take the post down.Australia vs India: Indian fan proposes to Australian girlfriendSmith continued from where he left the innings in the last match as he scored boundaries at will and kept the Indian bowlers under vast pressure.Zhao, who has more than 175,000 followers on the social network banned in China, has a reputation for stirring diplomatic disputes with provocative Twitter posts.Despite China blocking Twitter and other US social media platforms within the county, Chinese diplomats and state media have established a strong presence on them.Morrison's calls for an apology further ramps up tensions between the nations, following China's decision to impose crippling anti-dumping duties on its wine over the weekend.Zhao was criticized by the U.S.in March after tweeting a conspiracy theory that USA soldiers may have brought the coronavirus to China.The text beneath the photo reads: "Don't be afraid, we are coming to bring you peace!" "Australia has patiently sought to seek to address the tensions that exist in our relationship in a mature way, in a responsible way, by seeking engagement at both leader and ministerial level".China has introduced a string of economic sanctions on Australian goods and state-controlled news outlets have repeatedly attacked Australia over a range of issues.The heightened tensions come following Australia's call for an independent global investigation into the origins and spread of the coronavirus outbreak.Load-Date: November 30, 2020End of Document

5G in 2020: Highlights from IDTechExPR NewswireDecember 8, 2020 Tuesday 8:51 AM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 798 wordsDateline: BOSTON, Dec. 8, 2020 BodyPR NewswireWith profitable business models and killer applications starting to emerge, 5G is expected to be one of the largest and fastest-growing markets. By the end of 2020, 125 operators in 52 countries/territories have launched commercial 5G services, and 5G subscriptions are likely to be over 200 million globally. However, the unexpected COVID-19 pandemic has slowed down the rollout of the 5G network globally. Also, the uncertainty of global economics and the on-going China–United States trade war might delay the adaption of 5G technology.IDTechEx focuses on the technology challenges and innovations in5G, especially forthermal managementandlow-loss materials. This article summarizes and highlights some of the critical developments and news in 2020.5G infrastructure and deploymentThe COVID-19 pandemic is the black swan to disrupt the rollout of 5G. Although the pandemic has had little adverse impact on Telecoms so far, the resulting global economic crisis is likely to reduce the telecoms' investment in 5G infrastructure and harm the willingness of customers to adapt to 5G devices and applications. The deployment of sub-6GHz 5G base station might be 20% lower than the expectation, and the rollout of 5G mobile networks will be delayed by 9-18 months in many countries.However, the 5G deployment in China has been accelerated with back up from the Chinese government. The Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) put 5G network construction into the government strategy to reduce the influence of COVID-19 on economics. More than 600,000 5G base stations have been built in China by Oct. 2020.Meanwhile, whether to ban Huawei, the largest vendor for 5G infrastructure, from the national 5G network is another continuous debate for many countries. The U.K. government banned the installation of new Huawei 5G equipment from September 2021 and ordered the complete removal of Huawei kits from the entire 5G network by 2027.5G smartphones5G has been featured in many flagship phones, including brands from Huawei, Samsung, and more. Until Nov. 2020, Samsung had the largest market share of 5G smartphones. Due to the pressure from the U.S. government, Huawei sold off Honor to a Chinese company in Nov. 2020 in order to free the brand from the U.S. sanctions.In 2020, Apple finally entered the competition by integrating 5G into all iPhone12 modules. The entrance of Apple into the 5G competition is likely to boost the investment from telecoms and encourage faster adoption of new materials and technologies to tackle the remaining challenges. Meanwhile, a large amount of low-cost 5G mobiles are available to the market. As a result, the market share of 5G handsets starts to surge in 2020. Note that most of the 5G phones can only support sub-6GHz 5G.5G thermal managementRecent years have seen an increasing application of vapor chambers within smartphones to improve heat spreading. However, their future is far from set, with several high-end models still using graphite heat spreaders for their reduced complexity, cost, and weight. In the new Note20 smartphone, Samsung has used a graphite heat spreader or a copper vapor chamber; Apple's first 5G phones all use graphite heat spreaders and have not adopted vapor chambers. Several new thermal materials for 5G applications were released in 2020. Some highlights include: DOW introduced the DOWSIL TC-3065 Thermal Gel with thermal conductivity of 6.5 W/mK; Henkel also announced their portfolio of TIMs for 5G infrastructure; W.L. Gore's Thermal Insulation material for smartphones can reduce hot spots on the device surface and is compatible with the new mmWave 5G antenna.IDTechEx have produced a number of reports on 5G, including the overview report "5G Technology, Market and Forecasts 2020-2030" and further in-depth analysis on "Low-loss Materials for 5G 2021-2031" and "Thermal Management for 5G".

AUSTRALIA BRACES FOR COAL EXPORT BAN AS RELATIONS WITH CHINA PLUMMETStates News ServiceDecember 15, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 486 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: SYDNEY BodyThe following information was released by the Voice of America (VOA):By Phil MercerDecember 15, 2020 08:42 AMSYDNEY - Australia is calling for China to clarify reports in a state-owned media outlet that it has banned imports of Australian coal. Rising political disagreements between the two trading partners coincide with a range of tariffs and restrictions Beijing has imposed on Australian agricultural exports.A ban on coal exports to China would cost Australia billions of dollars and further inflame tensions between the two countries.The Global Times newspaper said a new policy would shut Australia out of China's lucrative trade in coal. The publication, which is considered to be sanctioned by the Chinese government, reported the move would stabilize coal prices.China has unofficially banned Australian coal imports since October because shipments have allegedly been of inferior quality, and officials in Canberra are scrambling to establish if the Global Times reports are accurate.Last year, China bought $10.5 billion worth of Australian coal.There has been no formal announcement from Beijing about any ban, but Australian Trade Minister Simon Birmingham is calling on China to uphold its trading obligations."We see these reports and obviously are again deeply troubled by them. They, if true, would indicate discriminatory trade practices being deployed by Chinese authorities and we would urge them to rule that out swiftly, and demonstrate that they are continuing to operate in a manner consistent with the type of market principles they committed to as part of their membership of the World Trade Organization and through their free trade agreement," Birmingham said.China is by far Australia's most important trading partner, buying about 40 percent of the goods it exports.Political disagreements in recent years have turned a cordial relationship increasingly bitter. Australia's decision to ban Chinese tech giant Huawei from its 5G telecommunications network because of national security concerns prompted anger in China, as did Canberra's allegations of political interference and cyber-espionage.Australia's criticism of China's handling of COVID-19 also infuriated the Chinese leadership, and there have been disagreements about Beijing's human rights record, its military expansion in the South China Sea and democracy in Hong Kong. Experts believe Australia is being pressured by China to alter its foreign policy.Diplomatic unease has coincided with a range of tariffs and restrictions on Australian agricultural exports worth billions of dollars.China has accused Australia of dumping grain and wine on the Chinese market and unfairly subsidizing its farmers. Canberra is considering taking its grievances to the World Trade Organization.The Global Times also published an opinion piece that labelled Australia an "anti-China pioneer" with a "sense of anxiety" about being invaded.Load-Date: December 16, 2020End of Document

Rep. Malinowski Challenges Senate GOP Removal of Bipartisan China Amendment From NDAATargeted News ServiceDecember 2, 2020 Wednesday 8:20 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 303 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyRep. Tomaz Malinowski, D-New Jersey, issued the following news release:Bowing to objections from key Senate Republicans, conferees on the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) are considering removing from the bill a provision sponsored by Representative Malinowski mandating strong export controls on goods that contribute to the repression and abuse of Chinese citizens by their government. Introduced with 16 bipartisan members of Congress and mirrored by a Cornyn-Warner bill in the Senate, this provision would require the Commerce Department to restrict the export by American companies of goods and services that could contribute to the Chinese government's surveillance of its people (eg. location-monitoring, biometric indicators, restricting internet access, surveillance of communications...etc.).The provision had already passed the House of Representatives 407-1 in response to reports indicating that US-origin exports have inadvertently contributed to the surveillance networks enabling the persecution of the Uyghur people in China.For example, American companies are alleged to have provided DNA sequencers and facial recognition technology that ended up in the hands of authorities in Xinjiang."We're seeing a lot of tough-on-China posturing from leading Senate Republicans, but here we have a bipartisan bill that simply says American companies shouldn't help the Chinese government track down the people it's putting in concentration camps, and the opposition is coming not from Democrats or the incoming Biden Administration, but from inside the Republican caucus in the Senate," Representative Malinowski said."I urge the Senate conferees to join with an overwhelming bipartisan majority of the House to include this provision in the NDAA."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7310931 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: December 2, 2020End of Document

Technology that helps produce the most advanced chips—those 10 nanometers or less—faces the "presumption of denial," Commerce said. Other articles will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.President-elect Joe Biden's oath to swear less than a month to go.

BANGLADESH APPROVES CHINESE-LED WIND POWER PROJECTStates News ServiceDecember 9, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1072 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Bangladesh will pay U.S. $240 million over 20 years to buy electricity from a private Sino-Bangladeshi wind energy project, according to a proposal approved by a government committee here Wednesday, cabinet and power-ministry officials said.The wind plant in southwestern Bangladesh will generate 55 megawatts of electricity daily once it goes into production, said Abu Saleh Mostafa Kamal, an additional secretary in the cabinet division. Under the approved deal, the government will pay 10.56 taka, or 13 U.S. cents, per kilowatt hour of electricity generated by the plant.The Cabinet Committee on Government Purchase at today's meeting approved the project to set up a 55-megawatt wind-power plant in Mongla, Mostafa Kamal told reporters.The plant will be set up by a consortium made up of Envision Energy (Jiangsu) Co Ltd, a Chinese firm, Envision Renewable Energy Ltd, a Hong Kong firm, and SQ Trading and Engineering, a Bangladeshi firm, he said.The government's expenditure will be 2,035.12 crore taka ($240 million). The tariff is fixed at 13.2 U.S. cents or 10.56 taka for per kilo watt per hour electricity, the cabinet official said.He was referring to how much the government would pay for power from the plant, which will be set up in Bagerhat district.At present, Bangladeshi consumers pay about 7 cents for a unit of electricity.The consortium's companies will set up the plant at their own expense, and the Bangladesh Power Development Board will buy electricity from it, Habibur Rahman, secretary of the Power Division of the Ministry of Power, told BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service.The companies will set up the wind power plant and the government will procure the electricity once they go into production, Rahman said. We have not set any time frame for this project.Renewable energy sourcesThe potential of wind power has yet to be exploited, Rahman said, adding that when the wind project is built it would be the first such commercial plant in Bangladesh.Bangladesh wants to migrate to renewable sources of electricity, like wind and solar energy, Saiful Hasan Chowdhury, a spokesman of Bangladesh Power Development Board, told BenarNews.In 2009, the government set a target of producing 10 percent of the total power production from renewable sources by 2020. Currently, the contribution of renewable energy is 382 megawatts, Chowdhury said.Last month, the cabinet accepted a bid from a Chinese state-owned company to build the country's first waste-to-electricity plant, which energy officials said would generate 42 MW daily while helping clean Dhaka's rivers and tackle its waste-management problems.So the government has been trying to increase the contribution of renewable sources, Chowdhury said.As with the wind-power plant, the cost of building and running the waste-to-energy plant would be fully covered by the developer, state-owned China Machinery Engineering Corp. (CMEC). But Bangladesh will pay almost $2 billion for the power it generates over 25 years, government officials said.Still, Bangladesh in September approved the construction of a $2.06 billion coal-fired power plant with majority Chinese funding, despite a government commitment to reduce reliance on the carbon-based energy source because of environmental concerns.The coal-fired plant is being built in Payra in coastal Patuakhali district, about 334 km (207 miles) south of the capital, Dhaka. The Bangladesh government and Chinese investors are also constructing homes, roads, and a deep sea port in Payra.Bangladesh would not build any more coal-fired plants because of environmental and cost reasons, but the Payra plant would continue operations as planned, Nasrul Hamid, Bangladesh's state minister for power, told BenarNews at that time.Meanwhile, the current capacity for electricity generation in Bangladesh is at nearly 21,000 MW per day, higher than the maximum demand of 13,000 MW per day, Chowdhury said.Despite the overcapacity, the government approved the Bangladeshi-Chinese wind project so the country would have a 25 percent reserve of electricity, Mohammad Hossain, director general of a government cell that plans electricity generation, told BenarNews.So, we have been keeping a reserve of power with the expectation that there will be an increase in power demand once the COVID-19 crisis is over, Hossain said.Rate is too high'One energy expert told BenarNews that the wind power project isn't viable despite what power secretary Rahman believes.Different studies show that Bangladesh has no viable potential for wind electricity generation because wind speed fluctuates in a single day or even within hours, said Mohammad Tamim, a former energy adviser to the government.He said sustained strong winds generate more electricity, which lowers the price of electricity per unit. Lower wind speeds generate very little power and push up the cost per unit.The power development board earlier set up two small wind-electricity generation projects as a pilot one in Feni and the other in Chittagong. But the projects failed for this reason, Tamim said.I do not know why the Chinese are investing in a wind power project in Bangladesh.Tamim also has a problem with the rate at which Bangladesh will buy electricity from the Bangladeshi-Chinese wind project.The procurement rate of 13 U.S. cents per kilo watt hour is too high for wind power. It is generally accepted that one unit of wind electricity should cost a maximum of 8 U.S. cents per kilo watt hour. If the price goes higher than eight cents, it turns economically unviable, Tamim said.Rahman, the power secretary, told BenarNews that it wasn't a high price to pay for wind energy.The process of approval for this wind power plant and other electricity projects needs to be more open, according to Anu Muhammad, a member of a civil society movement called the National Committee to Protect Oil, Gas, Mineral Resources, Power and Ports.The Bangladeshi-Chinese consortium was the sole participant in the tender process for the project, local media reported, citing a power development board official who wasn't named. BenarNews could not confirm the accuracy of this statement.There is no transparency in Bangladesh's power sector. The power ministry or any of its agencies are not accountable to anyone, he told BenarNews.Reported by BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service.Load-Date: December 10, 2020End of Document

CHINESE REGULATORS OPEN ANTI-MONOPOLY PROBE INTO E-COMMERCE GIANT ALIBABAStates News ServiceDecember 24, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 260 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the Voice of America (VOA):By VOA NewsDecember 24, 2020 07:48 AMThe Chinese government is opening an anti-monopoly investigation into online retail giant Alibaba, a move that signifies Beijing's increasing efforts to tighten control over the country's dominant technology sector.The State Administration for Market Regulation said Thursday the probe will look into the company's practice of forcing its business partners to choose either Alibaba or a rival competitor, instead of allowing them to sell their merchandise through both outlets.Alibaba was founded in 1999 by Jack Ma, who has become the richest businessman in China with an estimated net worth of $59 billion. The company is the world's biggest online retail company and expanded into financial services and other fields.In a separate announcement, regulators with the People's Bank of China said Thursday it will meet with officials with the Ant Group, Alibaba's affiliated financial services company, to discuss issues related to operating in a method that protects the legitimate rights and interests of consumers.The government surprised the financial world last month when it suspended the Ant Group's debut as a publicly traded company on Hong Kong and Shanghai exchanges. The initial public offering would have brought in a record-setting $37 billion.Analysts say Chinese leaders may be targeting Ma because he complained about China's regulatory system at a business conference in October, accusing it of stifling innovation and blocking opportunities.Load-Date: December 24, 2020End of Document

The prosecutors also asked for information about contact between Zoom employees and representatives of the Chinese government, as well as if a foreign government had ever tried to or succeeded in influencing the company's policies, practices or actions relating to U.S. -based users."The FBI agents and I had many conversations about this, both over the phone and face-to-face interviews", said Zhou. Papers filed in federal court in Brooklyn said Jin's employer is based in San Jose, California, where Zoom is headquartered.In a lengthy criminal complaint, the DOJ details how the employee, Xinjiang Jin, worked to spy on and censor Zoom users across the globe.At the direction of Chinese intelligence, Jin allegedly participated in a scheme to disrupt several video meetings, which were organized and hosted by Americans, held in May and June of this year to honor the event."Jin's co-conspirators created fake email accounts and Company-1 accounts in the names of others, including [People's Republic of China] political dissidents, to fabricate evidence that the hosts of and participants in the meetings to commemorate the Tiananmen Square massacre were supporting terrorist organizations, inciting violence or distributing child pornography", reads the DOJ press release.Xinjiang Jin, 39, faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted of conspiring since January 2019 to use his company's systems to censor speech, the US Department of Justice said. Another Zoom statement in June that was updated on Friday said that "going forward, Zoom will not allow requests from the Chinese government to impact anyone outside of mainland China".LPGA to allocate record $76M in prize money for 2021 seasonSecond-place Kang was tied for 42nd at even par after a 70. I'm very looking forward this weekend. I like to play against great players.Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers said in a statement that the Chinese government will continue to interfere with American businesses operating in China.Zoom said that it did not go ahead with this measure, but did shut down "certain types of political, religious, and sexually explicit meetings".In July, Zoom received subpoenas from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California and the SEC.The videoconferencing provider also said it had received a grand jury subpoena in June from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of NY, requesting information about interactions with foreign governments and political parties, including the Chinese government.Zoom said it "terminated" the employee for violating company policies and has "placed other employees on administrative leave pending the completion of our investigation".Zoom's popularity has exploded during the coronavirus pandemic with millions of people forced to remain at home to help prevent the spread of Covid-19. Workers, students and families count on the video-meeting service to keep them connected to colleagues, teachers and loved ones.Zoom settled a case in November with the US Federal Trade Commission, which accused the software maker of deceiving customers about its platform's level of security.Load-Date: December 21, 2020End of Document

Apple rolls out lower App Store fees for 'Small Business' developersStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeDecember 26, 2020 SaturdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: HI TECH; Pg. 1Length: 612 wordsByline: Sandy MccarthyBodyApple Inc.is booting thousands of videogame apps from its platform in China as the government clamps down harder on such content, illustrating the tech giant's vulnerability to state pressure on its business.Several app developers posted on Twitter that Apple started accepting enrolees for the programme earlier this week.Apple today announced an industry-leading new developer program to accelerate innovation and help small businesses and independent developers propel their businesses forward with the next generation of groundbreaking apps on the App Store. Some other developers have also reported an identical change. Despite estimates that the program could benefit 98% of developers it has been met with strong criticism from big developers like Spotify and Epic Games, who claim the move was simply created to divide App Store developers by making the marketplace fairer for the vast majority of its users. For other prominent developers, the commission remains at 30 percent. Tripadvisor declined to comment.Foreign developers have raised concerns regarding this as it's has been hard for them to secure approvals in China for their games.In China, the scrutiny of Apple's app store highlights the delicate balance the Cupertino, Calif. -based company must strike as it works to reach Chinese consumers while also navigating official demands. The company announced in November that it would cut App Store development costs by half to 15% from January 1, 2021, as part of the App Store Small Business program.Yang takes steps to run for mayor of NYCThe New York City mayor warned that travelers under quarantine will be fined $1,000 for each day they are found disobeying orders. There will also be a follow-up door knock by the sheriff's Travel Unit to make sure people are complying, according to the mayor.Recently, China has started eradicating unlicensed games from the country.Apple on Thursday began to roll out a new App Store commission structure through its Small Business Program, lowering fees to 15% for developers who earn less than $1 million a year. But growth is less and less important: the turnover of iOS games had increased by 21% in 2019 and 26% in 2018. It is facing accusations by rivals of anticompetitive behavior - which Apple has disputed - and regulatory scrutiny in the USA and Europe. The group, whose major backers include David Magerman, George Soros's Open Society Foundations and Craig Newmark Philanthropies, has campaigned against big tech firms such as Google and Apple. A third of them are related to sensitive issues with the Chinese government, such as the demonstrations in Hong Kong, the rights of gay and transgender communities, Buddhism, Tibet ... Another large chunk were games. In 2020, Apple recalled 94,000 games from its store in China, almost three times more than past year, according to Sensor Tower figures. The company has said it was complying with local laws. " Apple carefully studies requests every time we receive them "Explains a spokesperson".Apple said the map app violated guidelines and local laws, and Mr. Cook defended the company's actions in a memo to staff, noting the difficulties involved. In fact, we can expect more deletions in the coming weeks. "We believe this decision best protects our users". Apple has been considering this process for more than a month. In order to keep your paid game or game with in-app purchases available on the App Store in China mainland, enter your approval number and supporting documentation in the App Information section of your game's page in App Store Connect and submit an update to App Review by December 31.-Yoko Kubota contributed to this article.Load-Date: December 28, 2020End of Document

Fact-checking Trump's conspiracy theory connecting Georgia's secretary of state to ChinaCNN WireDecember 30, 2020 Wednesday 10:21 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 550 wordsDateline: (CNN) Body (CNN) --  In the waning days of his presidency, Donald Trump continues to spread nonsense conspiracies over the 2020 election and the officials who oversaw it, attacking Georgia's governor and secretary of state on Twitter Tuesday. Following Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger's announcement that a ballot signature match audit found no evidence of absentee voter fraud in Cobb County, Georgia, Trump tweeted a conspiracy theory linking Raffensperger to the Chinese government. Trump tweeted that Raffensperger has a brother who "works for China," insinuating some nefarious, pro-China plot to have Trump lose the race in Georgia. "Now it turns out that Brad R's brother works for China, and they definitely don't want 'Trump'. So disgusting!" the President tweeted after attacking Georgia's Republican Gov. Brian Kemp. Facts First: This is false. A spokesperson for Raffensperger told CNN that the secretary of state has no siblings who work for China, as Trump baselessly alleged. "There are no relatives who work for China or are affiliated with China," said Georgia Deputy Secretary of State Jordan Fuchs.Though it's unclear exactly where Trump is getting the idea that Raffensperger's brother works for China, it's possible he is picking up on a false conspiracy theory spread by former political consultant Dick Morris, who made the allegation during an interview on Newsmax Tuesday evening and on his personal website.In the interview, Morris leveled several false or misleading accusations against Raffensberger, including that Raffensperger is related to Ron Raffensperger, the chief technology officer of the Chinese company Huawei Enterprise Storage Solutions. Fuchs said that the secretary of state does not have a sibling named Ron.Georgia Public Broadcasting reported Wednesday "public documents and records [show] that Raffensperger does have four siblings, including a brother, but none of them are named Ron, none work for Chinese technology companies."Morris also falsely accused Raffensperger of standing in the way of recounts and refusing to verify signatures. Georgia conducted a statewide audit, hand-counting about 5 million ballots and Raffensperger oversaw an additional recount. And in addition to the state's existing signature verification process that occurs twice in the case of absentee ballots requested by mail, Raffensberger announced his office would help conduct a signature match audit statewide to further verify signatures on absentee ballots. In a statement, Newsmax told CNN:"Newsmax has never made any claim of impropriety by Georgia Sec. of State Brad Raffensperger or any member of his family. On Tuesday night, while appearing on the network, commentator Dick Morris claimed he was reporting on Dickmorris.com an allegation that Raffensperger had a brother who worked at a Chinese company. This claim was apparently inaccurate. During the segment the Newsmax host was highly skeptical of Mr. Morris' claims and suggested there was no evidence behind Mr. Morris' assertion, and specifically asked Mr. Morris to provide evidence of his claim."CNN has attempted to reach Morris for comment but has yet to receive a response. CNN's Jason Morris contributed to this article.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

House Passes China Stocks Delisting Bill; Threat Grows For Alibaba, JD.com, NioInvestor's Business DailyDecember 2, 2020Copyright 2020 Investor's Business Daily, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: NEWSLength: 940 wordsByline: JED GRAHAMBodyhttps://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Stock-ChinaFlagChart-01-adobe.jpgA bill that threatens to delist Alibaba stock, JD.com, Nio and other China stocks from U.S. exchanges within three years cleared the House with a unanimous voice vote Wednesday evening. President Donald Trump, who has no desire to make nice with China in his final weeks, is expected to sign the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, which cleared the Senate in May.China stocks have been under a cloud since Monday. Alibaba fell 1% in Wednesday's stock market trading, bringing its loss to 5.5% for the week. E-commerce rival JD.com stock is down 5.6% this week, but Pinduoduo is now even, after rallying 5.5% on Wednesday. Nio stock is down 11.2% this week, despite rebounding 5.8% Wednesday amid strong November EV sales numbers in China. But Nio has been on a huge tear for months.The biggest loser, by far, is electric-vehicle maker Kandi Technologies, which has tumbled 38.6% since getting hit by fraud allegations on Monday.Those allegations come at an especially sensitive time, as the U.S. decides how firm of a stand to take on Chinese accounting transparency. Wall Street stands to lose billions in investment banking and trading revenue if China stocks are sent packing.Under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable bill, China stocks would face delisting within three years, unless their auditors come under supervision of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.Yet Beijing has made it illegal for Chinese auditors to submit to such scrutiny from an overseas regulator, seeing it as an impingement of national sovereignty. China's hard line would seem to doom the U.S. listings of China stocks with a combined value of more than $2 trillion.However, Congress may not have the last word, says Derrick Scissors, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. "Treasury controls implementing regulations for whatever Congress passes," Scissors told IBD.China Stocks Delisting: What Will Yellen Do?In August, a policy group led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin offered a more lenient approach. To get around Beijing's refusal to let the PCAOB review the work of Chinese auditors, Mnuchin would permit Chinese firms to engage a U.S. accounting firm to do the job.Critics of Mnuchin's approach argue that U.S. accounting firms couldn't vouch for the accuracy of the secondhand data they would get to review.In coming weeks, Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Jay Clayton may bring Mnuchin's more flexible approach up for a commission vote.But the big question is what Janet Yellen, the incoming Treasury secretary, and President-elect Joe Biden think.Mnuchin "would have attempted to strike a 2021 deal with China" to avoid the scheduled delisting, according to Scissors. "I don't know how Yellen and Biden view this," he said.Join IBD experts as they analyze actionable stocks in the stock market rally on IBD Live.Fraud Allegations Hit Another China StockTo the extent that Yellen and Biden are still weighing the issue, Kandi fraud allegations may help make a case against half measures.On Monday, Hindenburg Research published a detailed report on alleged self-dealing by the EV company: Kandi: How This China-based Nasdaq-Listed Company Used Fake Sales, EV Hype to Nab $160 Million From U.S. Investors.Investors took the allegations seriously. Kandi stock tumbled 28% in Monday stock market action.Exposure of fraudulent financial reports by Luckin Coffee in April helped push the Senate to take up the Chinese stock listing legislation, first proposed in 2019. Now the once-hot Chinese stock has been delisted.The China stock accountability legislation also would require Chinese companies to provide assurance that they are neither owned nor controlled by a foreign government.Chinese Stocks Era May 'TikTok' Down For American Investors As U.S.-China Rift GrowsHow To Buy China Stocks In The FutureIn 2013, the PCAOB agreed to let Chinese companies access U.S. capital markets without fully meeting required levels of disclosure and transparency. That paved the way for a big crop of Chinese IPOs like Alibaba and JD.com.From 2013 to now, Chinese firms raised about $60 billion through more than 140 new offerings. Yet the PCAOB says China hasn't held up its end of the deal, leaving regulators unable to protect investors from fraudulent accounting.If China stocks lose their U.S. listings, American investors could still buy Chinese stocks via mutual funds and ETFs.Yet the era of U.S. investors choosing among the best China stocks, providing easy access to the Chinese e-commerce boom and rising consumer economy, may be winding down. That's a big deal.Three of the five top-rated stocks in IBD's Retail-Internet Group hail from China: JD.com, Vipshop and Alibaba. Vipshop and Futu Holdings hold spots in the premier IBD 50 stock list. Meanwhile, JD.com and Pinduoduo stock rate among top-performing stocks on IBD Leaderboard, which highlights elite stocks near a buy point.Nio stock and other Chinese EV stocks have been among the biggest market winners in 2020.IBD's SwingTrader portfolio just added Pinduoduo stock on Dec. 2.Several Chinese companies that initially listed in the U.S. are now also listing in Chinese markets.

That would therefore benefit Chinese actions."Whatever the outcome of the election, ties between the U.S. and Chinese financial markets will only deepen, despite the trans-Pacific trade war and unstable diplomatic relations.Amid talks on financial dissociation between China and the United States, China has accelerated the reform of its capital markets, giving foreigners easier access to their stocks and bonds while promoting international use of the yuan.Foreign investors held Chinese shares worth 2.75 trillion yuan ($409.5 billion) at the end of September, according to the latest data from the People's Bank of China, almost one trillion yuan more than the previous year, being one of the Asian country's attractions its solid economic recovery from the pandemic.The CSI300 Preferred Stock Index has gained more than 16% since the end of 2019, compared to a 4.3% gain for the S&P; 500.The rise of the yuan, high yields and inclusion in major global indices have also fueled interest in Chinese government bonds, bringing the total foreign holdings of its interbank market bonds to about 3 trillion yuan.(Report by Samuel Shen and Andrew Galbraith; additional report by Tom Westbrook in Singapore.

EU and US call on China immediate release of journalist Zhang ZhanCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 29, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 446 wordsBodyThe United States and the European Union on Tuesday demanded from China the immediate release of citizen journalist Zhang Zhan, imprisoned for reporting on the pandemic, while the head of American diplomacy, Mike Pompeo, accused Beijing of hiding the Covid-19 outbreak.Zhang, a former detained woman since May, was sentenced on Monday to four years in prison for reporting the Covid online when at the end of last year she appeared in Wuhan as a mysterious illness.?? Stay informed on our Google News channel"We urged (...) to release her immediately and unconditionally," Pompeo said in a statement."The Chinese Communist Party again showed that it will do anything to silence anyone who questions the party's official line, including crucial public health information," added outgoing President Donald Trump's secretary of state.Zhang's reports challenged Beijing's official speech - which noted that the government had defeated the virus - by questioning hospital capacity, access to virus testing in the early days of the pandemic, and showing the aggressions he suffered by Chinese authorities when he filmed on his phone.The 37-year-old woman was sentenced by a Shanghai court for "provoking disputes and problems."European Union (EU) foreign policy spokesman Peter Stano said in a statement that according to "reliable sources, Zhang has been subjected to torture and ill-treatment during his detention and his health has seriously deteriorated.""It is critical that he receives adequate medical assistance," he stressed in the document, which calls for the "immediate release of Zhang Zhan" and other human rights defenders in detention.  Bless you  Pompeo, a declared critic from Beijing, has attacked China for its role in the origins of the pandemic, which has claimed more than 1.7 million lives worldwide.On Tuesday, Pompeo said Beijing's censorship against Zhang was further evidence of how a "controllable outbreak became a deadly global pandemic.""The lie is a trait, not a failure of authoritarian regimes," Pompeo stressed.The Chinese government's "fear of transparency and its continued repression of fundamental freedoms are a sign of weakness, not strength, and a threat to all of us," he added.Brussels also demanded the release of Yu Wensheng, a human rights lawyer imprisoned on 13 December, and activists Li Yuhan, Huang Qi, Ge Jueping, Qin Yongmin, Gao Zhisheng, Ilham Tohti, Tashi Wangchuk, Wu Gan and Liu Feiyue.The EU declaration comes as the bloc finals an investment agreement with China after seven years of arduous negotiations, despite concerns about Beijing's history of human rights violations.SpotifyApple PodcastsGoogle PodcastsAcastDeezerLoad-Date: December 30, 2020End of Document

CHINA'S CENTRAL BANK ORDERS ANT GROUP TO MEET STRICT REGULATORY GUIDELINESStates News ServiceDecember 28, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 468 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the Voice of America (VOA):Regulators with China's central bank have ordered online financial services giant Ant Group to restructure its operations to meet regulatory guidelines.The People's Bank of China said in a statement Sunday that its regulators issued the requirements during a meeting with Ant Group executives the day before. Vice Governor Pan Gongsheng said the Bank outlined a list of problems with Ant Group, including a lack of sound governance, a defiance of regulatory demands, using its market dominance to squeeze out competitors and harming the rights and interests of consumers.Chairman and chief executive of Alibaba Group Jack Ma reacts during a session of "Future-Proofing the Internet Economy" at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in China's port city Dalian, September 9, 2015.Pan said Bank regulators urged Ant to establish a separate holding company to ensure it has adequate operating capital, and to "strictly rectify illegal credit, insurance and wealth management financial activities."Ant began as a payments service for Alibaba, the world's biggest online retail company, and evolved over time as one of the world's biggest online financial services companies, offering such services such as loans, investing and insurance. The Bank called on Ant to return to its "payment origins," enhance transparency around transactions and prohibit unfair competition.Ant has issued a statement promising to establish a working group to ensure it is rectifying its issues with the Bank's findings, and would fully comply with the Bank's requirements.The government surprised the financial world last month when it suspended the Ant Group's debut as a publicly traded company on the Hong Kong and Shanghai exchanges, a move that cost the company $37 billion, which would have set the record profit for an initial public offering.The Bank's meeting with Ant coincides with the Chinese government's market regulation agency decision to open an anti-monopoly investigation into Alibaba. The probe will look into the company's practice of forcing its business partners to choose either Alibaba or a rival competitor, instead of allowing them to sell their merchandise through both outlets.Alibaba was founded in 1999 by Jack Ma, who has become the richest businessman in China with an estimated net worth of $59 billion. The company is the world's biggest online retail company and expanded into financial services and other fields.The probe signifies Beijing's increasing efforts to tighten control over the country's dominant technology sector.Analysts also say Chinese leaders may be targeting Ma because he complained about China's regulatory system at a business conference in October, accusing it of stifling innovation and blocking opportunities.Load-Date: December 28, 2020End of Document

South Africa said earlier this month it expects to receive its first batch of vaccines from COVAX in the second quarter of 2021.The meeting is to "guide Ant Group to implement financial supervision, fair competition and protect the legitimate rights and interests of consumers", the statement said.Responding to it, Ant said in a statement on its official WeChat account: "It will study and comply with all requirements".Alibaba said it would cooperate with the investigation and that its operations remained normal.China's tech giants such as Alibaba and Tencent are facing increased scrutiny by the Chinese government, who are concerned about their growing size and power.In China, Alibaba's main e-commerce platform competes with rivals including JD.com Inc and Pinduoduo Inc. In October, Ma ruffled feathers by telling a technology conference that Chinese financial regulators stifle innovation and that big state banks operate like "pawnshops". Ant Group, a $16 billion-a-year business, has been chipping away at powerful state banks' market share and unnerving regulators with investment and lending products that have become so popular that Ant sometimes acts as a lender to distressed government banks - not the other way around.Load-Date: December 25, 2020End of Document

Federal Lawsuit Charges Billionaire Chinese Media Executive with Making 'Terroristic Threats' Against Noted Religious-Freedom Advocate; Lawsuit: Billionaire Guo Wengui inciting followers to kill Pastor Bob FuPR NewswireNovember 13, 2020 Friday 12:42 PM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 650 wordsDateline: MIDLAND, Texas, Nov. 13, 2020 BodyPR NewswireAttorneys for renowned Chinese activist, author and religious leader Bob Fu have filed a federal lawsuit alleging that Guo Wengui, the billionaire owner of Beijing Zenith Holdings, unlawfully targeted Pastor Fu through online death threats and protests at the Fu family home in Midland.According to the lawsuit, Guo is orchestrating a "multi-faceted campaign of character assassination" to silence Pastor Fu and his longstanding work to promote religious freedom and human rights within China."Although claiming to support the Chinese pro-democracy movement, Guo employs his vast legal, financial, and corporate resources, together with his robust social media presence, to systematically target pro-democracy and pro-religious freedom activists in the Chinese American community," the lawsuit says. "Since 2018, Guo has attacked Chinese human rights activists and bona fide CCP (Chinese Communist Party) dissidents in the United States. This year, Plaintiff Bob Fu became Guo's latest target."Guo began the public attacks against Pastor Fu in September in a series of videos posted on his GTV and GNews websites, in addition to Twitter and YouTube. The attacks have become more aggressive in recent weeks with the promotion of death threats and the presence of scores of protestors outside Pastor Fu's home. Following Guo's directives, the protestors allege that Pastor Fu is a fraud and a spy for the Chinese government.The false allegations, protests and credible threats against Pastor Fu have drawn the attention of local, state and federal law enforcement, and criticism from Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz. Pastor Fu and his family were recently placed in protective custody in separate locations."Dr. Fu is an internationally recognized spokesperson for Christian ministry and religious freedom, and this abuse of his reputation and encouragement of violence against him must stop," says his attorney, Lawrence Wilson of The Lanier Law Firm in Houston. "His decades of dedicated promotion of human rights and democracy in his homeland and around the world must not be subjected to these assaults. This lawsuit will now shine a bright light on the actions and motivations of Mr. Guo."The lawsuit cites a series of claims against Guo, his media companies and associated individuals. Those claims include stalking, defamation, conspiracy and invasion of privacy.Guo made international news recently as the owner of a $35 million yacht on which the FBI conducted an early morning raid and arrested well-known political strategist Stephen Bannon. In addition, Guo's media outlets have been used as platforms to spread a broad range of misinformation, including conspiracy theories about the origin of the coronavirus and accusations against Hunter Biden, son of President-elect Joe Biden.The lawsuit is Xiqiu (Bob) Fu v. Guo Wengui et al,No. 7:20-cv-00257, filed in United States District Court in Midland, Texas.  About The Lanier Law Firm  For more than 30 years, the men and women at The Lanier Law Firm have worked tirelessly, throughout the United States, to find unique and effective solutions for their clients.

Xi Jinping says Chinese economy could double by 2035CE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 3, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 371 wordsBodyPresident Xi Jinping believes china's economy could double by 2035 and that the country will reach a high-income status over the next five years."It is perfectly possible to achieve high-income country status by current standards by the end of the 14th Five-Year Plan and double the total output or per capita income by 2035," Xi said in a speech to the party's Central Committee, quoted by state news agency Xinhua.The president's words meet the objectives outlined in the 15th Five-Year Plan for the Chinese economy, discussed in the plenary of the Chinese Communist Party last week, and whose general lines were known on Thursday.Unlike the previous five-year plan, which sought to achieve "medium to high growth" to build a "moderately prosperous society," this plenary focused on quality rather than the pace of economic growth.Still, and even though the plan does not set a concrete target for GDP growth, the Chinese government maintains ambitious prospects that, if they come true, will lead China to take the place of the United States as the world's largest economy.According to the communist party's Central Committee statement, China's total economy size and per capita income "will rise to a new high level" by 2035, with significant improvements in its economic and technological power.China's gross domestic product (GDP) per capita will reach that of a "middle-level advanced country", with a larger middle-class group in the country and "new competitive advantages" abroad, according to the communiqué, which highlights the focus on sustainable growth and the development of a robust internal market.The new plan also elevates China's self-sufficiency in technology to a national strategic pillar, which relies heavily on chip self-sufficiency."With major advances in key technologies in key areas, China will become a global leader in innovation," according to the statement published by Xinhua.Beijing's efforts are gaining increasing urgency as the U.S. seeks to stem the rise of its geopolitical rival. The U.S. pressured allies to avoid Huawei equipment, prevented dozens of China's largest technology companies from buying U.S. parts, and imposed bans related to ByteDance's TikTok and Tencent's WeChat.Load-Date: November 4, 2020End of Document

Australia and China face off again over a "disgusting" tweetCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 1, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 617 wordsBodyDeteriorating China-Australia relations don't raise their heads. Tension reached new highs on Monday when a Spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry tweeted a photo montage featuring a smiling Australian soldier slitting an Afghan child's throat."Don't be afraid, we're here to bring you peace," reads at the bottom of the photo. The false image caused enormous outrage in Camberra, which demanded an immediate apology from Beijing for the "disgusting" publication and its withdrawal.The tweet was prostrate by Zhao Lijian, an ex-diplomatic famous for his incisive messages of marked nationalist court that has already been immersed in more than one controversy, as when in May he credited the theory that American soldiers had brought the coronavirus to Wuhan.Alongside the montage, by an artist known as Wuheqilin, the Chinese wrote: "Shocked by the murder of Afghan civilians and prisoners at the hands of Australian soldiers. We strongly condemn these acts and ask them to be held accountable."History of a findThe episode to which the tweet is referring is to a report broadcast by the Australian Army a few weeks ago in which he acknowledged that his soldiers had committed war crimes in Afghanistan between 2005 and 2016. According to the investigation, Australian elite troops killed 39 Afghan civilians and prisoners, none of them in incidents "under the pressure of combat" and many as part of new soldier initiation rituals.Thirteen soldiers from the Oceanic Army were announced to be expelled on Friday. Countries such as Russia or China itself took advantage of the report's findings to point to the "hypocrisy" of the struggle for human rights and the freedom of some Western nations in third countries. The origin of current bad relations between the two countries dates back to the end of April 2020. Australia was one of the countries that called for an independent investigation to determine the origin of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Just days after this information came to light, China's ambassador to Australia, Chen Jingye, suggested that the Chinese could respond with a boycott of Australian products. In mid-May, Beijing stopped Australia's meat exports citing "health reasons." Five days later, it imposed an 80% tariff on Australian barley exports, its main supplier of this key beer ingredient. In an August presentation to the National Press Club in Canberra, Chen Jingye stated that Australia's attitude of prompting an investigation into the origins of the pandemic "hurt the feelings" of the Chinese,given that it was based on the presumption that everything had begun in Wuhan, a hypothesis that China disputes.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison called the tweet "totally outrageous" and "disgusting," and asked Twitter for his immediate withdrawal. "The Chinese government must be totally embarrassed by this message (...) There are undoubtedly tensions between China and Australia, but this is no way to address them," he added.His criticisms were supported by other politicians, commentators and human rights organizations, who recalled Beijing's abuses against its own population in places like Tibet, Xinjiang or Hong Kong.However, his complaints found no echo in Beijing. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying publicly defended her colleague and dismissed requests for forgiveness.Ref"It is justified for Australian soldiers to killcoldly to innocent civilians in Afghanistan, but isn't it reasonable for people to condemn these crimes?" he told the press. On Monday the tweet was fixed at the top of Zhao's account, which makes him think that his superiors have not asked him to withdraw it.With information from La VanguardiaLook too       Load-Date: December 2, 2020End of Document

Chinese tycoon sues UBS in London for US$500 millionCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 6, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 370 wordsBody(Bloomberg) -- Guo Wengui, a wealthy Chinese businessman with close ties to Steve Bannon, has intensified his battle against UBS Group AG to claim the $500 million he lost after the bank made a loan margin call.Guo, who has been in exile in New York for more than five years, sued UBS in London and said the bank pressured him to agree to borrow money linked to the purchase of shares at Chinese securities firm Haitong Securities Co. Guo said UBS forced the sale of shares during a stock crisis and a 45% collapse in Haitong's Hong Kong trading shares in 2015 , which erased his investment.UBS said in a statement that it "totally disagrees with the prosecution and will defend itself vigorously."This is not the first time Guo has filed such a lawsuit, after not getting the lawsuit accepted in New York. The Chinese tycoon said he was initially untimely that UBS had inserted margin call agreements into contracts.UBS advised Guo to structure the agreement through an intermediary to avoid breaking thresholds that would require him to disclose his participation, he said in a legal document. The entrepreneur agreed that the shares in Haitong should first be acquired by a Chinese state investment fund. But after getting rid of the shares, the firm transmitted the loss to Guo.The runaway tycoon has used social media to launch accusations against Chinese government leaders. He has partnered with Bannon and says he likes former President Donald Trump adviser because he takes Guo's accusations that China wants to create turmoil in the U.S.Bannon was on Guo's yacht off the coast of Connecticut when he was arrested in August and charged with conspiring to divert hundreds of thousands of dollars from a fundraising campaign for a wall on the southern U.S. border.UBS had internal policies not to make margin calls to "highly valued clients" like Guo if the prices linked to the loan moved in the short term, an entrepreneur's lawyer said in the filing. In another high-profile financial transaction involving Chinese insurer Ping An Insurance Group Co., UBS had also agreed not to make margin calls, the lawyer said.Original Note:UBS Sued for $500 Million by Chinese Tycoon Over Deal Gone Awry©2020 Bloomberg L.P.Load-Date: November 7, 2020End of Document

UC-San Diego: New U.S. Strategy Unveiled for a Smart Competition With China in Science and TechTargeted News ServiceNovember 17, 2020 Tuesday 8:41 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 944 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: LA JOLLA, California Body(TNSRes) -- The University of California San Diego campus issued the following news:The United States' global leadership on science technology faces formidable competition from the People's Republic of China; however the U.S. can take actions to maintain its competitive edge while enhancing innovation and protecting national security, according to a new report from the University of California San Diego.Created as a guide for the 2020 white house transition teams, the report was authored by the bipartisan Working Group on Science and Technology in U.S.-China Relations, chaired by Peter F. Cowhey, dean of UC San Diego's School of Global Policy and Strategy. The report contains specific recommendations for a new and integrated approach to competition by the U.S. in four domains of science and technology: fundamental research, 5G digital communications, artificial intelligence and biotechnology.The working group recommends the U.S. approach to a smart competition be based on three complementary objectives: 1. Bolster U.S. investment in our own innovation capacities to stay competitive and secure. 2. Preserve openness to ensure a steady flow of much-needed global talent into the U.S. and 3. Tighten targeted measures for risk management to address security threats and minimize costs to the U.S.The analysis re-examines conventional wisdom held by many 'inside the beltway' to assess what is the best way for our country to compete with an increasingly more capable China, according to Cowhey who presented the report at a Nov. 16 press conference.For example, Cowhey points to the U.S. competition with Huawei in the area of 5G. "The discussion in Washington is frequently about the early leadership of Huawei and radio access equipment," he said. "This leadership is real, and it poses some real security issues; however, with 5G technology continually evolving, the U.S. should adopt a forward-looking strategy to enable a variety of new entrants to enter the 5G innovation space successfully."Some members expressed concern about the Chinese firm's ability to quickly scale up, given its dominant position in network equipment. But Cowhey added that overreaction to security threats, such as Huawei's technology, with restrictions on cross-border collaboration and immigration undermine American innovation.The report commends the great strides China has made in science and technology while raising an alarm on how China's pursuit to become a high-tech superpower is linked to, and an enabler of, its quest for domestic control, regional dominance and global deference. "Though the desire to develop China through innovation is legitimate, many of the ways in which the Chinese government uses technology concern the U.S. and other nations that hold liberal views of human rights and fair competition," said Susan Shirk, a member of the working group and chair of UC San Diego's 21st Century China Center. "However, policymakers need to keep the huge benefits of U.S.-China collaboration in mind for solving the world's pressing medical and public health problems, which is critical amidst the global COVID-19 pandemic."Organized by the UC San Diego 21st Century China Center, the working group which spearheaded the report operates under the auspices of the Task Force on U.S.-China Policy co-chaired by Shirk and Orville Schell from the Center on U.S.-China Relations of the Asia Society.The working group is comprised of 28 China specialists and experts in science and technology from academia, industry, and think tanks, including several former government officials.In addition to Cowhey and Shirk, the Nov. 16 press conference included co-authors Arthur Bienenstock of Stanford University; Anja Manuel of Rice, Hadley, Gates & Manuel LLC; Jason Matheny of the Center for Security & Emerging Technology at Georgetown University and Keith Yamamoto of UC San Francisco.Bienenstock, a professor emeritus photon science and former dean of research at Stanford University spoke on the report's recommendations for fundamental science."China is, by far, the primary nation with which U.S. researchers collaborate," he said. "We must maintain those collaborations, particularly in areas of common concern like climate change and pandemics - the major threats to our national security...Even in the midst of the Cold War, U.S and Soviet scientists were collaborating."Among the report's recommendations for how the U.S. can maintain collaboration with its greatest rival while managing risk includes the transfer of highly sensitive research from universities to national labs or outside commercial entities that are better equipped than universities to vet researchers and protect intellectual property.While it finds the U.S. is in better shape than many believe; the report also reveals how the country has neglected its own foundations for science and technology leadership. More investment at the federal level is recommended, specifically 1% or higher of GDP for federal R&D spending."Getting our own house in order is entirely in our own hands," said Shirk. "And these resources are critical to America's fundamental research and early stage discovery."To read the full "Meeting the China Challenge: A New American Strategy for Technology Competition" report, go to this website (https://china.ucsd.edu/policy/science-and-technology.html).

While Europe fears unemployment, China no longer finds workers in the face of its factory boomCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 21, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 627 wordsBodyThe covid crisis is attacking countries and sectors very unequally. A good example: while millions of people fear for their jobs in Europe, in China factories do not supply orders arriving from abroad (many related to material to fight covid) and complain that they do not find staff to meet all demand. China has won the economic battle in this crisis.China's recovery in manufacturing industry, driven in part by demand related to the covid-19 pandemic abroad, has far exceeded this year's expectations, so much so that factories are now striving to fill the shortage of skilled workers to meet growing orders, says since Reuters, which has contacted various industry sources in China.The unemployment data lets some of the situation be seen. In February, the unemployment rate in the 'Asian giant' hit 6.2%, highs in recent years. However, with the onset of covid in the West, China's economic recovery, underpinned by massive exports of health supplies to Europe, the US and other countries, also began. The unemployment rate began to fall rapidly and is now at 5.2%, levels that are not extremely low (for the Chinese economy), but which have left the market dry from the most demanded profiles for the industry.Production of industrial robots, computer equipment and integrated circuits in the country has recovered from its coronavirus paralysis: production of the year through November has increased by 22.2%, 10.1% and 15.9% in those areas respectively.    Strong foreign demand Much of the manufacturing boom has come from foreign demand, and export growth has exceeded expectations for eight of the past nine months.The remarkable change comes at a time when China has largely eradicated the virus, contrasting with the slow upticge seen in major industrialized countries, where factories continue to fight pandemic disruptions and the effect on demand.China's global export share increased to more than 13% in the second and third quarters since 11% last year, according to Nomura, the highest of any quarter since at least 2006, when the investment bank began collecting the data.   Fresh money for China While emergency stimuli in the US and Europe injected money into consumer portfolios, the fight to contain the virus in those markets triggered demand for both Chinese-made personal protective equipment (IPDs) and devices for Westerners staying at home.Chinese government data show that in November there were more people employed in the industrial sector of Jinhua City, comprising the eastern export center of Yiwu, than there were at any time since the end of 2017.  Poor planning "We are saying about 50 workers in the first half, and now with increased orders, we are short of staff and we cannot continue to increase production," says Deng Jinling, who owns a thermal bottle factory in Yiwu, which sells to the Middle East, the United States and Europe."We try to hire dozens of temporary workers but they're not good enough," Deng says. Some workers she fired have gotten a job in her country and are unwilling to travel back a few months before the next Lunar New Year vacation in February.Investment in robots However, with customers stepping on his heels, Deng bought two automated production lines at the end of November to increaseEfficiency."We've never thought about doing this before, but this year we've been so busy and exhausted our options," he says. "An automated production line equals 10 workers."A private Renmin University index that tracks labor demand reached a record in the third quarter.

The agency mentioned citizen complaints against pornographic, obscene and violent content, as well as fraud, gambling and prostitution.The ruling Communist Party closely controls what Chinese audiences see on the internet, and has launched several campaigns restricting websites and apps.TripAdvisor China, a joint venture of TripAdvisor and its Chinese partner Trip.com, did not first respond to an email asking for feedback.Following the withdrawal of its app in China, the Nasdaq-listed TripAdvisor listing had fallen by 1.68%, to $29.59 at market close in the United States on Tuesday.TripAdvisor has a 40% stake in TripAdvisor China. Trip.com owns the other 60%. Under the terms of the agreement, companies share their travel content and catalogs.___Associated Press reporter Joe McDonald in Beijing contributed to this firm.Load-Date: December 10, 2020End of Document

I'm Jackie DeAngelis, in for Maria Bartiromo today.It is Thursday, December 24th. Merry Christmas Eve.Your top stories at 7:00 a.m. Eastern time.The stimulus battle: President Trump and Speaker Nancy Pelosi on the same side of the issue as both put the pressure on Republicans to increase the amount of direct payments to Americans. When we can expect a new bill, ahead.Plus, more presidential pardons. President Trump handing out pardons to notable allies like Roger Stone and Paul Manafort in the final days of 2020. We're exploring that this morning.And examining the Hunter Biden investigation. The DOJ reportedly mulling whether or not to install a special counsel to take over the case before the next administration steps into the White House. What we can expect, ahead.And a look at markets this Christmas Eve. Futures are in the green. We have a shortened trading session ahead of us. The Dow indicated to be higher by 61 points, the Nasdaq by 14.5 and the S&P 500 by 7.5. This after a mostly higher performance yesterday. Markets boosted by stimulus optimism and an increase in vaccinations for the coronavirus.Meantime, Beijing versus Alibaba. The Chinese government announcing an antitrust suit into Jack Ma's business empire. The financial implications on the global market, ahead.And your holiday travel checklist, how to stay safe this Christmas season ahead of a busy day of travel.MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live right now.All right. A look at European markets at this hour. The FTSE trading slightly above the flat line. The CAC 40 slightly lower. So not much happening in Europe as we're waiting for news out there about a Brexit deal as well.That finalization could come at any moment now and Boris Johnson is expected to make comments on that.The DAX index in Germany closed for the holiday.We're watching Asia overnight as well. The markets were mostly higher. The KOSPI up 1.7 percent. The Hang Seng, the Nikkei just above the flat line. And the Shanghai composite down about six-tenths of a percent.Now some of the top stories that we are watching this morning.President Trump issuing 26 new pardons and three commutations yesterday including former campaign manager Paul Manafort, former adviser Roger Stone and Charles Kushner, the father of the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner.Stone's pardon comes after the president commuted his sentence in July. He was convicted of witness tampering and making false statements to congress.Meanwhile, President Trump vetoing the $740 billion National Defense Authorization Act in part because it didn't tighten restrictions on social media companies. Congress will attempt to override that veto on Monday.Meanwhile Congress will vote today on President Trump's request to increase stimulus checks from $600 to $2,000. But Republicans are almost certain to reject it with growing concerns about the skyrocketing national debt. And instead they're pushing to target billions in foreign aid.A surprising reversal from Georgia's Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger. He is speaking to end no-excuse absentee voting in an effort to prevent fraud despite weeks of refuting President Trump's claims of election voter fraud. This new proposal would limit the preferred voting method for 1.3 million people in Georgia.And Joe Biden announcing Miguel Cardona his pick for education secretary. The long-time educator is currently Connecticut's education commissioner and has strongly advocated for in-person learning.The fight against coronavirus. New studies suggesting that people who are infected once with the virus are unlikely to test positive again for up to six months and possibly even longer. Those with antibodies from natural infections were at much lower risk.Moderna meanwhile says that its vaccine could protect against a new COVID variant in the U.K. The company says it plans to run tests to confirm the vaccine's effectiveness.And Chinese firm Sinovac delaying the results of its late stage vaccine trials until January. This as the company consolidates data from Brazil with test results from Indonesia and Turkey.Time for "The Word on Wall Street", top investors watching your money this week.Joining me now: UBS Financial Services private wealth advisor Alli McCartney; Rosecliff Capital CEO and managing partner Mike Murphy; and Kingsview Wealth Management CIO and Fox Business -- Fox News contributor -- pardon me, Scott Martin.First up, Alli, let's get straight to you. Stimulus stumbles right now but this market is expecting something and there are so many people out there who do need those checks.ALLI MCCARTNEY, PRIVATE WEALTH ADVISOR, UBS FINANCIAL SERVICES: Yes. You were talking about that earlier on. I heard when you talked about the numbers coming down for spending and personal savings coming up.So the proposed bill that has, I guess, just been vetoed is about 4 percent of annual GDP. And that's really important because we basically need a bridge until vaccination, especially with the rollbacks that we're seeing.So interesting to see the Democrats and the administration on the same side of this. Funny also to see that the market begins its Santa Claus rally even as this stumbles. I think that there's probably this look-through to the fact that this gets done and this is more of a negotiating style or tactic that the world is used to where Trump is concerned.But we're definitely going to need a bridge until mass vaccination which is looking like mid to end second quarter of next year.DEANGELIS: Mike Murphy, we're also watching the Georgia senate races very closely because you've got a market that's pricing in split government here. If we should see a change there, if we should see the incoming Biden administration with more power than anticipated, would Wall Street scale back this rally in early 2021?MIKE MURPHY, CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL: Good morning, Jackie.DEANGELIS: Good morning.MURPHY: I think they could. But I think right now the market's looking past that. You know, we talked a lot about Trump losing and Biden coming in and how bad that would be for the markets.But right now, I think the markets are looking really at technology. They're looking at how underlying earnings are supporting the prices up at these levels.So Georgia's important, don't get me wrong, but even if it goes -- if Democrats get more control, the markets are going to figure that part out. They're going to figure out what higher taxes mean. Large S&P 500 companies are going to figure out how to keep more of their earnings. And the markets are going to get past it.So although it's important, I think from an investing standpoint I wouldn't put too much into it.DEANGELIS: All right. Mike, I want to stick with you for a second because we're watching the taking down potentially of Jack Ma's empire. The Chinese government launching this antitrust investigation into the retail giant, Alibaba, for this alleged monopolistic practices that we've been seeing while the country's central bank is planning to meet with Alipay parent Ant Group about implementing some new financial regulations. This coming after President Xi Jinping squashed Ant Group's blockbuster IPO last month.You know, you're looking at what's happening in China specifically with Alibaba and also potentially antitrust investigations into big tech here. There's so much happening and it's all happening simultaneously which is a bit surprising.MURPHY: Yes, it is. And it's a good segue from what can happen if a government gets too strong and is anti-business or wants to take a business down.You know, in China, we've seen this for a long time. Jack Ma's has spoken of out against the Chinese Communist Party. And that's not a good thing to do there. So they're coming after him. They're coming after Alibaba. The stock here in the U.S. is trading down almost 8 percent today.It will be interesting to see how that plays out because Alibaba has become such a global empire. But I look at what happens here in the United States, where we have free government. The government has looked at Google, for instance, and Google has gotten past that every single time and continued to move higher.So it will be interesting to see what the Chinese Communist Party does to Jack Ma and Alibaba, how it affects other businesses in China. But I think it's more isolated to them and their government and I wouldn't expect too much of an impact here on the U.S. markets.DEANGELIS: Scott, I want to bring you in here as well because we're waiting for news coming out of Europe from, you know, potentially this Brexit deal sort of narrowing down and honing in on and defining some of the trade issues that we'll be watching in 2021.The markets, European markets were flat as we're waiting for that. you know, it is a shortened trading session here and I'm wondering what you think is going to be made of that news?We are expecting prime minister -- U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson to comment on that deal at any moment.SCOTT MARTIN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Short-term impact, Jackie, probably some volatility. I mean gosh, you know, Brexit. What year is this? Like 2016? I mean come on, we're still working out deals from things four or five years ago. This thing is dragging on like COVID.So I think overall though, Jackie, with respect to trade deals going forward as the Biden administration has commented on briefly so far, look, we're going to be involved in global trade. Many countries around the world or all of them, frankly, because global supply chains are so intertwined these days and there's business across the globe.So they'll work out trade deals, just as say the Biden administration has talked about how they're going to work out new trade deals. And I think overall the impact is going to be more the fact that we're going to actually have maybe some final ruling on this thing which started back in 2016.DEANGELIS: And I just want to mention that Reuters is reporting it could take several more hours before we hear about this. They are still working out those final details.So it will be something that we'll be watching today, even though it is Christmas Eve.Alli McCartney, I want to go back to you because as we talked about stimulus and spending, you mentioned that Santa Claus rally. A big spike expected this year in online sales for the retailers.Do you think it will be enough to offset the reduction in foot traffic that we're seeing in stores. I mean, here in New York City you walk out on Fifth avenue and it's a shell of what it would normally look like.MCCARTNEY: Yes, New York, which is where I'm from as well, is probably not the right place to look to get a feel for the country. But if you think about it, you know, e-commerce is up about 29 percent this year. You know, digital adoption has been booming and booming and booming and moving into the future. But obviously this year kick started that.You know, look, this is a really tough time. Because what we've done is we've really looked through all of the issues that we're seeing which include a more virulent strain, which include more infections, which included some job numbers that were really scary because they told a story that was not a recovery story.But everybody knows it's temporary. So the hope, again, is that this stimulus, whether it's $600, whether it's $2,000 -- that it is not too little too late. And the question also becomes that with the Fed having increased liquidity and their balance sheet by 75 percent, by $3 trillion since March, with a second round of checks, with unemployment benefits which are part of this which is very important, say an increase until the end of the New Year, is can we keep the spending numbers up from where they were in November and take the place of the foot traffic that we are also desperately missing.DEANGELIS: Alli McCartney, Mike Murphy -- Scott's going to stay with us -- but thank you guys all for your insight this morning.MCCARTNEY: Thank you. Happy holidays.DEANGELIS: Same to you.Much more ahead this morning.Coming up on the show, former senior adviser to the Clintons, Stagwell Group president Mark Penn on his new business venture and also the political fallout from the president's most recent string of pardons.Next hour, New Jersey Congressman Jeff Van Drew talks the state of stimulus as President Trump pushes for more aid for Americans.And Florida Congressman Greg Steube talks the Hunter Biden probe and the prospects for a special counsel investigation.Joining the conversation all morning long: Joe Concha and Scott Martin.You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA, live on Fox Business.DEANGELIS: Good morning.Major marketing merger. MDC Partners and Stagwell announcing that the two companies will combine their businesses to form a massive global marketing network. The company is targeting growth to over $3 billion in revenue by 2025.Joining me now, former senior advisor to the Clintons and also MDC Partners CEO and Stagwell Group president, Mark Penn. Mark, good morning. Great to see you.MARK PENN, PRESIDENT, STAGWELL GROUP: Good morning.DEANGELIS: Let's talk about the merger. Let's talk about the kind of growth that you're expecting and how specifically you're using technology to, you know, increase the footprint and get that marketing message out there.PENN: Sure. This merger brings together incredible creative talent along with digital and technology talent that works for the modern consumer and modern marketer. I mean we just heard about the incredible explosion of online shopping and experience. And this is really the first scaled creative performance marketing firm designed with the right technology and talent in order to hit that consumer.That's what's going to give us tremendous growth in this marketplace.DEANGELIS: So let's talk about that a little bit because it's so interesting especially with the backdrop of the pandemic right now. So many businesses have been struggling. But in some ways, and not to diminish the human tragedy here, but in some ways your business can actually profit from the shifts that we're seeing here.PENN: Well, it's been a tough pandemic for all of us. But I think that marketing is playing an essential role here and when you look at the kind of company we have, you think of car companies, is Tesla different from those companies making other cars? Yes.We're kind of the Tesla of marketing and advertising, because we're really built for the digital consumer. We're built for this new online world. We're built to get the right ad to the right person at the right time.It's a whole new marketing and we are right in the center of it in 23 different countries and over 8,000 people.DEANGELIS: Yes. That's a huge workforce and it's, you know, key to bring these companies together at this time. Do you anticipate, especially as we're waiting for vaccine rollouts and for things to slowly get back to normal, as we're still in the thick of fighting this second wave, do you expect challenges in 2021?PENN: I do think that there are challenges here, while the vaccines roll in. But I do think by next summer there's going to be an explosion here of travel and pent-up even revenge consumerism that is really going to propel the economy. And as the economy gets propelled, so does marketing and if it's marketing it also is Stagwell and MDC which by the way MDC Partners is on the Nasdaq.We hope that this will really kind of be a win-win for the world, for the country, and for consumers.DEANGELIS: I want to switch gears while I have you here. Let's talk about the political side of things right now. President Trump issuing 26 new pardons, three commutations yesterday. Among the big names: former campaign manager Paul Manafort, former adviser, Roger Stone, Charles Kushner, the father of the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.This follows some of the pardons that we've seen for George Papadopoulos and ex-Congressmen Duncan Hunter and Chris Collins. Your take?PENN: I don't think this was unexpected. I worked with President Clinton where he issued some rather unfortunate and unexpected pardons on January 19th that would haunt him. I think here, everyone expected these pardons.They may be a little broader to include the Kushner family, but I think that because nothing was really behind the Russia -- the Trump-Russia allegations, it's logical that Stone and Manafort were going to get pardoned here. Everybody knew it. The president did it.But everybody's also waiting for the Durham report to explain what really happened here.DEANGELIS: Yes. We are waiting for that.Meantime I want to talk about Georgia because 1.6 million early votes already been cast in the Senate runoff and we're watching it closely. This as some Republicans are voicing concerns after President Trump vetoed the defense bill and Georgia's home to several major military bases.I'm wondering what you think about the veto with respect to hurting the Republicans' chances of hanging onto those two senate seats that would ensure split government.PENN: I don't think this veto of the Defense Authorization Bill is a big factor in this. I think the question is who is getting out their vote. I think the vote's pretty well set and is there fear by Republicans of the Democrats controlling the Senate or is it the Democrats that recently got Biden elected and want to see the agenda come through. I think this is a battle of turnout. I don't think anything that happens between then and now, other than turnout, makes a difference.DEANGELIS: All right. Mark Penn, great to see you this morning. Thanks for joining us.PENN: Thank you.DEANGELIS: Coming up on the show: the battle over tax revenue, the remote work fallout that could have severe budget implications for some states.Plus 2020's hottest new Christmas gift. How people are circumventing coronavirus headaches to show their love this holiday season. It's making a buzz this morning.You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA, live on Fox Business.DEANGELIS: The rise of remote workers amid the pandemic leading to a Supreme Court showdown over which states get to tax workers' income.New Hampshire filing a complaint with the Supreme Court in October to stop Massachusetts from taxing residents working remotely. New Jersey along with Connecticut, Hawaii and Iowa submitting briefs in support of New Hampshire's position on Tuesday.New Jersey arguing that it may credit $1.2 billion on income to New York through March of 2021 for remote workers in the Garden State.Joe, your reaction to this? I mean if I'm staying home and I'm not crossing state lines, should I be paying those taxes?JOE CONCHA, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, as the other Joe in his basement, I'm literally joining you from New Jersey right now in my basement from my home. And this is something that obviously we talked about a little bit last hour, as far as you can do anything from anywhere at this point, right, as far as working.You don't need to go into an office to use the fax machine anymore or because you need Internet access or because you need that conference room to meet with your coworkers because we have Zoom. There is no more fax machine and Internet speeds at home could be better than an office building.So all of that said, should I be taxed because I'm working from home and therefore I'm more productive from home because I don't have that lunch with coworkers, sometimes liquid (ph) lunch, unfortunately, that was a thing in my 20s.But then also when you talk about all the distractions that go with work, right. And then the commuting time, most important, from when I used to commute into the city from New Jersey, even though I was only like 30 miles away, it was 90 minutes in, 90 minutes out. I get 15 hours back per week to work from home to be more productive for my company.So therefore, should I be penalized for that? I don't think so.DEANGELIS: Scott, you know, when it comes to an athlete, for example, they play in all these different states and they have to file in those states and pay a share for the fact that they travel. I mean, you know, your thoughts here because everything is changing with respect to the pandemic.And some people are probably not going to return back to work in the office. That could create severe budget problems for states that were, you know, that have been used to relying on certain amounts of people crossing those lines.MARTIN: Liquid lunches and fax machines -- memory lane with Joe Concha. I love that.(CROSSTALK)DEANGELIS: Joe's getting into all this age stuff today, really.MARTIN: I tell you, if this isn't Christmas, it's celebratory of Joe -- I don't know what is.Jackie, you make the best point I think so far that the talk (ph) here -- the state and city budgets and the constraints they're already facing before the pandemic. And now the fact that workers are not going to come back to these urban areas.I'm in Chicago. And I love it some days, hate it others, of course. They were talking about putting in this urban tax on people that drove in about a year and-a-half ago. That failed. But then they were going to come back with something else.A lot of these cities and states who are counting on people, counting on workers, counting on businesses to exist as you mentioned prior to the pandemic are now going to be maybe up the creek a little bit with respect to their budgets and all the taxing they were looking forward to putting on people. And now they're going to have to find other ways to find some of that revenue.DEANGELIS: And let me add to this. There's another layer to it. We've been following so many stories of companies saying ok, look, if you like working remotely and it's working for you, you can do that. But, you know, if we move you into different parts of the country because people are doing that, they don't have to be in one state per se to work remotely, we're going to reduce your salary as well.So that would have an impact on the kinds of taxes that you pay, Joe.CONCHA: It's exactly right. And look, the U.S. Census just came out with a stunning report yesterday, maybe not so stunning if we live around here. As far as New York and people are moving out in record numbers, the reason why perhaps is, a, because crime is going through the roof and you're seeing shootings double and obviously New York has the highest tax burden of any state in the country.So people are saying I'm not safe here, and also I'm taxed out the wazoo and traffic is horrible like I just talked about and the weather is eh. So all those things are driving people out because they can work from anywhere in the country.So if I could go to Texas and do my New York job and I'm getting no state income tax there, then why wouldn't I do that.DEANGELIS: And Joe --CONCHA: But as a result though --DEANGELIS: -- if you haven't left New York already, you know, we're looking up to Albany and we're looking at Governor Cuomo dealing with all of these budget shortfalls as a result of the pandemic as well talking about raising taxes even more.So the people who haven't left, the people who are still here, are going to get it again and even have more of an incentive to flee.CONCHA: You literally had Bill de Blasio bragging earlier this week, the New York mayor, that he plans to redistribute wealth to fight structural racism. The problem is when the wealth leaves town there's nothing left to redistribute, right -- redistribute is what I meant to say.And Andrew Cuomo doesn't seem to get that as well because the state may go bankrupt at this point. So it's a real problem. And then the peripheral aspect here in terms of impact is what happens with these restaurants that are already going, you know, completely extinct in New York City.When they do come back post COVID and not as many people are going to the offices, well then not as many people are going to happy hour and not as many people going to restaurants afterwards.DEANGELIS: Lunch. Yes.CONCHA: It's going to be a real problem for places like New York City and other urban areas if everybody's working from home and not supporting the businesses after they're done with work.DEANGELIS: Yes. Scott, last question to you. Are we under-estimating the impact this is going to have on the overall economy? You know, the market with the Dow over 30,000 has been pretty positive about a recovery but at the same time I think there are aspects of this that investors may not have considered.MARTIN: Maybe. I mean, Jackie, I like the fact that people are showing and moving -- showing I guess their ways with their feet, you know, instead of just talking.As Joe mentioned, the exodus is striking. And it's certainly happening too in Chicago. And now unfortunately for some of the people in the city here, they are just moving to the suburbs so they are still stuck in the state, which I think is really where people should flee. It's not just the city of Chicago, it's the whole state as people are probably doing in New York.So I think it's actually a good thing. I think it's actually more efficient and more structurally sound for the economy going forward. If people do actually finally take action to what they've been talking about for many, many years and actually go to states that are going to be more favorable for them to do business in.JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: All right, gentlemen. Great conversation. And we're going to have you stick around with us for the remainder of the show.But meantime, coming up, Big Tech under pressure too. We're going to take you inside the string of lawsuits hitting Facebook and Google that may increase regulation.Plus, Christmas for your ears. The top streamed songs to get into the holiday cheer. It's making a buzz this morning. Stay with us.DEANGELIS: Good morning and welcome back. I'm Jackie DeAngelis in for Maria Bartiromo today. It is Thursday, December 24th.A look at the markets this half hour. We are looking at the Dow futures indicating higher open by 38 points; the NASDAQ by 10 and a quarter; and the S&P by 5 and a quarter. This is going to be a shortened trading day and after a mostly higher performance yesterday.Now, we did see the markets were boosted by stimulus optimism and an increase in vaccinations for the coronavirus. European markets right now at this hour, pretty much on the flat line. The FTSE 100 trading up by almost 6 points; the CAC down by 4 points. Of course, investors are standing by for the finalization of a Brexit deal which could come down as early as this morning. The DAX Index in Germany closed for today's holiday.In Asia overnight, markets mostly higher. KOSPI, Hang Seng, Nikkei in the green; Shanghai Composite down about six-tenths of a percent.And Attorney General Bill Barr touting the success of Operation Legend on his final day. Lauren Simonetti has those details for us. Good morning, Lauren.LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: Good morning, Jackie.Attorney General Bill Barr announcing Operation Legend accounted for 6,000 arrests in under six months' time. The operation which began in July has been cracking down on violent crime in nine U.S. cities, about 1500 of those arrested have been charged with federal offenses and roughly 467 arrested for homicide.Mayor Andrew Yang may one day be a possibility. The entrepreneur and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate officially filing paperwork to run for New York City mayor next year. Yang had no background in politics prior to this presidential run, but was able to build a strong grass roots following behind his pledge for $1,000 a month in universal basic income for every American adult.5G is breaking a new record. The FCC's sale of the wireless licenses has already fetched more than $69.8 billion. Analysts expect big names like AT&T and Verizon to walk away with a large share of the licenses for the high speed data.And this, Jackie, a crazy moment caught on camera. Check here. North Dakota Senator John Hoeven's office vandalized by that man carrying an ax. You can see him calmly walk up to the door and just begin smashing the office windows. Police say that man has been identified, but no arrests have been made. No word on why he did it either, Jackie, but he must have been mad about something.DEANGELIS: He was definitely mad about something. That is a really staggering video to watch. Lauren, thank you so much. We'll see you again next hour.Meantime, we're watching Facebook and Google, because they are in the hot seat. The Big Tech companies are facing multiple lawsuits from state and federal authorities in a challenge to their market dominance. Now, questions arising over what the companies will look like if they are, in fact, broken up.Joining me now, George Washington University Global Competition Professor of Law and Policy, and also former FTC Chairman, Bill Kovacic.Bill, great to see you this morning. And we're looking at all these kinds of lawsuits. The heat is going to intensify on Big Tech coming up in 2021. Do the suits have a merit? And I have a follow on that, once you answer.BILL KOVACIC, GLOBAL COMPETITION PROFESSOR OF LAW AND POLICY, GWU: The cases do on the face of the complaints, the complaints are very well- designed. They draw very heavily on the internal communications at the highest levels of the companies. The companies, of course, will have answers to this. But they tell a good narrative in both cases and they have absolutely serious remedial objectives.DEANGELIS: Well, let me ask you this and this is my follow, but I don't like to do two-part questions. It's really when we look at the most recent news, for example, with Facebook and Google. They had made a pact with respect to advertising, for example. And they also said if they come after us, we are going to cooperate with respect to any kind of investigation or lawsuit. But there were attorneys out there who told me it's not necessarily illegal with respect to what they did.Do you think that when the DOJ is looking at this, they should really focus on whatever their key big issues are? Maybe it's privacy, maybe it's dominance or anti-competitive practices. But it feels like they are sort of spread out and they are all over the place with respect to what they're going after.KOVACIC: The cases differ a lot in their focus. The Department of Justice case does not focus on the interaction that you just described. They are aimed much more clearly at a smaller collection of practices, so that the state of Colorado as well and its colleagues also did not focus on the behavior you that mentioned. And it makes you wonder whether they looked at the same evidence and concluded that it simply wasn't powerful enough to include as a separate claim. In many ways, the Colorado and Department of Justice cases are more narrowly focused.DEANGELIS: All right. I'm going to bring Joe in here.JOE CONCHA, MEDIA REPORTER, THE HILL: Yes. I'm curious as far as Section 230, and I think that has bipartisan support, it seems, anyway. Democrats, Republicans, don't like it and for the folks at home Section 230, of course, that's what shields social media companies from a liability perspective in terms of the content that their members or users post on their sites, yet those same social media companies have the ability to censor whatever they like in the process. Not a bad deal if you could get it.Do you think urge under a Biden administration that we'll see Section 230 repealed or at least modified?KOVACIC: I think it's almost certain that there is going to be a separate legislative path that's set in motion and that we're likely to see a modification of Section 230. And we're not only going to see that drawn into question, but there are probably going to be proposals to use legislation to directly get at some of the competitive conduct that's at issue in the private cases.So we will have both a legislative track and a litigation track. Section 230 will be part of the legislative track, but so will proposals to impose restrictions on these companies.DEANGELIS: Scott?MARTIN: Thanks, Bill. Yes. But, Bill, isn't that surprising, though? Because a lot of these companies have been largely Democratic supporting entities. So with respect to what Biden and the administration is going to do, they're going to have to put on maybe some kitty gloves with how they mess around with Section 230, right, as far as how it impacts the Twitters and the Facebooks of the world.KOVACIC: What's fascinating to watch is the great contest within the party now between those who might be more affiliated with Senator Warren, Senator Sanders, who are demanding far stronger intervention and those who are more traditional in their orientation who have taken a lighter touch approach. That battle, I think, is likely to result in the appointment of officials who will feel a stronger urgency to continue the cases that are being brought now and to be somewhat more aggressive.The Obama alumni who are being considered for many of these positions have been scorched in the commentary and by a number of Democrats for not doing enough. I think that's going to incline them, if they get these jobs again, to feel that they have to be more aggressive than they were before. In short, I think that means that Obama - that the Obama alumni, if they come back to these jobs, will come back with a charge that says, full speed ahead with these existing cases.DEANGELIS: Bill, how long does this process take to play out? We saw it take quite a while with AT&T, for example. Do we have to brace ourselves for that kind of a look here?And also, is there fallout afterwards? If you do go after these companies and break them up, are there unintended consequences to expect?KOVACIC: We've had one indication that this is going to be a long journey. The judge handling the case brought by the Department of Justice against Google has set the trial in that case for September 2023. One can expect he won't wrap up the trial until early 2024, issue a decision in the middle of that year. A year to go to the Court of Appeals, we're into 2025 and maybe to the Supreme Court, that's another year, 2026. That's five years from now.The other cases may move more swiftly. But we're not going to get a decision in these cases for three or four years. That's a very long, slow journey.The history of relief in these cases has produced unexpected results, good and bad. And it puts a premium on the skill of the government agencies in formulating a plan that's going to achieve their objectives and not have adverse side effects and judges in these cases are willing to impose drastic remedies. But they look at the government and say, I want you to give me assurance that I'm going to make things better rather than worse and that's a big challenge for the government plaintiffs in these cases.DEANGELIS: Bill, these companies are sitting on massive piles of cash and part of it is, I think, that they have anticipated that this day would come and they will need that cash to follow these lawsuits.Do you think that that is sort of their approach to this, that they can make it go away by fighting it out in court?KOVACIC: We should never underestimate the power of the resources they will be bringing to bear to represent themselves in these cases. They will hire the very best, the private bar has to offer. They will attract the best academic and economic consultants that they can find and that they will give nothing easily to the government in these cases, which is the reason why the litigation is going to take a while and the government is going to be pressed to match them in court.So this is going to be a titanic struggle and the companies will be well armed, they will be well prepared. In many respects, that gives them a considerable advantage in litigating these cases.DEANGELIS: Joe, last question to you.CONCHA: Yes. It's the dumb guy question, actually, because maybe I don't understand this very well. I watched a few good men a few times, but - and I understand you have to prepare for a case. But how does this DOJ case against Google get pushed out to 2023?Why three years? I mean, that just doesn't make any sense to me, but maybe I just don't know better.KOVACIC: You are quite right to be you puzzled by this. The parties asked for essentially 400 days of additional discovery. That means they are going to be interviewing third parties, they are going to be looking at more documents. The Google is going to want to see what the government has in its hand, the government going to probably be talking to more witnesses.When you bring a case like this, you draw out more complaining parties who offer to help. But I am puzzled at the length that's been set here. I give you an example by comparison of the Microsoft case, which the Department of Justice brought in 1998.They filed that case in May 1998 and the case went to trial in October of the same year. Five years later. It's incomprehensible to me that it would take a lag of almost three years to go to trial in this case. I'm surprised that a stronger hand has not been applied to managing the matter, because which of us know what this industry is going to look like in five years.DEANGELIS: Fascinating. Bill, what a great conversation! Thanks so much for coming on this morning. We appreciate it.KOVACIC: Thanks for the chance to do this. Thank you.DEANGELIS: All right. Coming up, Apple hits the road. We are looking at new reports about the Big Tech's pivot into the automakers market.Plus, 2020's hottest new Christmas gift. How people are circumventing coronavirus headaches to show their love this holiday season. It's making a buzz.You're watching "Mornings with Maria" live on Fox Business.DEANGELIS: An Apple iCar may one day be a reality. The company has plans to release its first vehicle by 2024, which is said to feature self-driving systems and breakthrough battery technology.Joining me to discuss, tech expert and one of the youngest members of the Forbes 30 Under 30 list in 2017, John Meyer. John, great to see you. When Apple does something, they go big. And they're not looking to partner with anybody here, they want to do it themselves.JOHN MEYER, MANAGING PARTNER, STARSHIP CAPITAL: They go really big when they want to go after something. And I think, to be honest, as we get into the mid-2020s, as you mentioned, 2023-2024, I think it's going to be the biggest time in Apple's history. Because that's going to be the period where Apple does roll out their so-called iCar as well as also gets into the augmented reality industry.Now, the car itself is supposed to be a fully autonomous, fully electric vehicle and according to what I've been and we have been hearing at my firm, Starship Capital, along the block with our sources at Apple is that, one of the key methods, interestingly enough, and this is the twist here, the key methods people will actually drive this vehicle or actually use this vehicle, since you won't be driving, is through what we call fleets, which is essentially going to be a Uber-style approach to delivering vehicle abilities to people where you will request the car from an app and it will approach you at your house or your work and take you wherever you want to go.DEANGELIS: It's remarkable. John, you actually rejected a job offer at Apple at age of 19 after you dropped out of school. You are very successful now. But any regrets about that decision? A lot of people would kill to work at Apple.MEYER: A lot of people would, and I was very fortunate to get it. However, I definitely am an entrepreneur at heart, definitely someone who really prefers working on my own companies. And with my firm, we've been able to be holders in Apple from an investor standpoint and so we have definitely seen the growth in that regard with Apple.DEANGELIS: All right. Tell us more about your company, Starship Capital. What exactly are you guys working on? What's the vision for the future?MEYER: Yes. So Starship Capital is a combination - it's a unique combination of a venture capital fund as well as a hedge fund. And so it allows us to actually invest in both publicly-traded companies and private companies, such as SpaceX or Palantir before it went public.And what's so interesting about it is, we also pair each company up, especially early-stage companies or start-ups with engineering support so they can build up their AI teams, for example. We pair them up with media and press support, we pair them up with other venture capitalists, all allowing for a early-stage company to go from zero to public in five to seven years or so, and be there with them throughout every stage of the cycle, which is very unique in the investor space.DEANGELIS: Real quick. Obviously, a challenging time for every business right now. How are you guys managing and navigating the pandemic and how are you thinking about the next six months to a year with respect to your view?MEYER: Well, we definitely don't think there's any recession in sight. And in addition, to be honest, I think there is really, what I call, a tech explosion coming, where we think that the largest gains are actually yet to come, especially in the tech sector, if you look at everything that's happening in AI and automation.Last night, I was flying to New York and landed in Newark and literally used a cashier-less grocery store where it uses cameras on the ceiling to detect what you're actually buying and pay for your goods that way. So I think automation, AI, autonomous vehicles, electric vehicles, battery technology are all huge industries for us that we're tracking. And I think it does actually give investors in the public markets the ability to see venture capital style returns over the next five years.DEANGELIS: That's remarkable. John Meyer, thank you so much. Happy holidays. It's great to see you.MEYER: You too.DEANGELIS: All right. It's time for the morning buzz. First up, the perfect go-to gift for pandemic as many shoppers get snagged by shipping delays and limited in-person shopping. People are just spending more on gift cards this year. The studies are showing that people are spending 17.6 percent more on that kind of gift this year. And the top cards, Visa, Amazon, Xbox, Microsoft, Kohl's and Lowe's.Scott, it's a little impersonal, right? I didn't go to the store and pick it out or even spend an hour doing it online. But at the same time, a lot of people like gift cards because they can get whatever they want.MARTIN: Yes, I guess so. If you did spend an hour online looking for a gift for me, I thin that's pretty quality. Nobody is going to the stores and picking stuff. Now that when they did pick it out for me, I'm kind of such a jerk, I didn't like it anyway. Jackie, I don't get gift cards, especially when you give them to adults. It's like, hey, I don't trust you enough to give you cash, so I'm going to give you a card from Kohl's to tell you where to spend the money. I get it for kids, but maybe not for adults. If you want to give me something, give me cash or Bitcoin, and I'll decide what to do with that.DEANGELIS: I hear you. Amen!All right. No surprise for this year's most-streamed Christmas song. Mariah Carey's Christmas classic, "All I want for Christmas". It's coming in at number one on Spotify. It's a great song. I've been listening for years. Rounding out, Justin Bieber's "Mistletoe"; Bobby Holmes' "Rockin' around the Christmas tree"; and "Let it Snow!" by Dean Martin.Joe, have you listened to any of these songs? Do you like the older ones, the newer ones, a little Bieber in your iPod?CONCHA: The Bieber is not in the iPod.DEANGELIS: Oh, I still have an iPod. Sorry, sorry, sorry.MARTIN: I don't believe it. I want to see the iPod.CONCHA: You're funny. Now we listen to things through - we were talking about Amazon before. We listen through the Alexa, which actually has like really good sound quality. I got a Sonos also, which is really good.But Mariah Carey, I got to say, you put on the best of Mariah Carey, she goes pretty deep into the whole Christmas song thing, and I think that's her legacy. I know she had a lot of other hits, but when you think Christmas, you think Mariah Carey. And then I go old-school, of course. I think the (inaudible) easily and second best Nat King Cole is the king of Christmas music. So, yes, I think you got those three, you are in pretty good shape. And all you have to do is say, "hey Alexa, play X", and they'll play it.DEANGELIS: All right, Joe. Well, the reason I have an iPod is because I don't like Alexa or Google Home or whether listening to me in my house. I have a problem with that. so my iPod that is probably about 10 years old is very self contained and it makes me feel safe.All right. Still ahead, guys, hearing from lawmakers. Congressman Jeff Van on the stimulus stalemate, and Congressman Greg Steube on the Hunter Biden probe and the prospects for special counsel.It all starts next hour on "Mornings with Maria" live on Fox Business.Load-Date: December 25, 2020End of Document

Chinese factories fight for workers over astonishing export boomCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 21, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 479 wordsBodyBy Gabriel Crossley and Stella QiuPEKON, 21 Dec (Reuters) - China's manufacturing industry recovery, driven in part by demand related to the COVID-19 pandemic abroad, has far exceeded this year's expectations, so much so that factories are now striving to fill the shortage of skilled workers to meet growing demands.Production of industrial robots, computer equipment and integrated circuits in the country has recovered from its coronavirus paralysis: production of the year through November has increased by 22.2%, 10.1% and 15.9% in those areas respectively.Much of the manufacturing boom has come from foreign demand, and export growth has exceeded expectations for eight of the past nine months.The remarkable change comes at a time when China has largely eradicated the virus, contrasting with the slow upticge seen in major industrialized countries, where factories continue to fight pandemic disruptions and the effect on demand.    China's global export share increased to more than 13% in the second and third quarters since 11% last year, according to Nomura, the highest of any quarter since at least 2006, when the investment bank began collecting the data.While emergency stimuli in the United States and Europe injected money into consumer portfolios, the fight to contain the virus in those markets triggered demand for both Chinese-made personal protective equipment (IPDs) and devices for Westerners staying at home.Chinese government data show that in November there were more people employed in the industrial sector of Jinhua City, comprising the eastern export center of Yiwu, than there were at any time since the end of 2017."We are saying about 50 workers in the first half, and now with increased orders, we are short of staff and we cannot continue to increase production," says Deng Jinling, who owns a thermal bottle factory in Yiwu, which sells to the Middle East, the United States and Europe."We try to hire dozens of temporary workers but they're not good enough," Deng said.Some workers she fired have gotten a job in her country and are unwilling to travel back a few months before the next Lunar New Year vacation in February.However, with customers stepping on his heels, Deng purchased two automated production lines at the end of November to increase efficiency."We've never thought about doing this before, but this year we've been so busy and exhausted our options," he said. "An automated production line equals 10 workers."A private Renmin University index that tracks labor demand reached a record in the third quarter. Some factory managers have increased wages by 25% to 10,000 yuan ($1,530) per month, well above the average starting salary of graduates, according to the country's media.(Information by Gabriel Crossley and Stella Qiu; additional Beijing correspondent information; edited by Sam Holmes; translated by Tomás Cobos)Load-Date: December 22, 2020End of Document

China administered Covid-19 experimental vaccine to Kim Jong UnCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 1, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 452 wordsBodyChina delivered North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his family with an experimental coronavirus vaccine, an American analyst said, citing two unidentified Japanese intelligence sources.Harry Kazianis, an expert in North Korea with the National Interest Center's expert group in Washington, said the Kims and several senior North Korean officials had been vaccinated. He added that it was unclear which firm supplied his drug candidate to the Kims and whether he had proven safe.?? Stay informed on our Google News channel"Kim Jong Un and many other high-ranking officials within the Kim family and leadership network have been vaccinated against coronavirus in the past two to three weeks thanks to a candidate vaccine delivered by the Chinese government," Kazianis wrote in an article for 19FortyFive.  Sports  Citing U.S. medical scientist Peter J. Hotez, Kazianis said at least three Chinese firms were developing a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, including Sinovac, CanSinoBio and China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm), which is based in Beijing.Sinopharm says nearly one million people in China have received their candidate vaccine. None of the companies have revealed the results of the Phase 3 clinical trial of their covid-19 experimental vaccines, which are being conducted outside China.Hua Chunying, spokesman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, did not deny or confirm when asked about vaccines for North Korea in a regular briefing, saying he had not heard of them.Some experts doubt Kim would use an experimental vaccine."Even if a Chinese vaccine had already been approved, no drug is perfect and he would not take that risk when he has numerous shelters that can ensure near-complete isolation," said Choi Jung-hun, an infectious disease expert who defected from North Korea in 2012.Mark Barry, an East Asian analyst and associate editor of the International Journal on World Peace, said Kim would prefer tested European vaccines to one supplied by Beijing."The risk is too great. But he's happy to get Chinese personal protective gear," Barry wrote on Twitter.  Society  North Korea has not confirmed any coronavirus infection, but South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS) has said that an outbreak cannot be ruled out, as the country had human-to-human and trade with China before closing the border in late January.Microsoft said last month that two North Korean hacker groups had attempted to enter the network of vaccine developers in several countries, without specifying target companies. Sources told Reuters that they included British AstraZeneca.The NIS reported last week that it had thwarted North Korea's attempts to hack South Korea's Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers.Load-Date: December 2, 2020End of Document

TikTok exec says she 'misspoke' in hearing about the app censoring Xinjiang contentCNN WireNovember 6, 2020 Friday 3:25 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 855 wordsDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  TikTok censored videos related to incidents in Xinjiang to avoid promoting conflict, an executive at the short-form video app told UK lawmakers this week.The statement came during a hearing held Thursday by the United Kingdom's Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee, which grilled Elizabeth Kanter, the company's director of government relations and public policy for UK, Ireland and Israel, over TikTok's links to China. TikTok is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, and has faced accusations from Western lawmakers that its ownership puts it at risk of being influenced by the Chinese government. TikTok has said in the past that it doesn't remove content based on sensitivities related to China. In a statement to CNN Business on Friday, Kanter said she misspoke during the hearing. "TikTok has previously acknowledged that in our very early days, we took a blunt approach to moderating content that promoted conflict, but we've also said we recognized this was the wrong approach and eliminated it," she said. "However, we want to be absolutely clear that even in those early policies, there was never a policy around the Uighur community, which is where I misspoke." According to the UK Parliament website, the session was held to determine whether businesses in the United Kingdom are exploiting forced labor camps in Xinjiang for their own gain.Kanter initially told the committee that TikTok does not censor content. She also said that if the ruling Chinese Communist Party asked the app to remove content or provide user details, such requests would be denied. "We do not moderate content based on political sensitivities or affiliation. There's no influence of the Chinese government on TikTok," she said.But when asked by Conservative lawmaker Nusrat Ghani about previous incidents of censorship on TikTok, Kanter said that videos related to Xinjiang had been removed "in the early days of TikTok," when content was governed by different guidelines."The people who wrote the content guidelines took a decision to not allow conflict on the platform and so there were some incidents where content was not allowed on the platform, specifically with regard to the Uyghur situation," she said.The previous content policy, which TikTok retired over a year ago, did not make reference to the Uyghurs, according to TikTok. Last November, the company blamed a "human moderation error" for the brief removal of a viral Xinjiang video posted by Feroza Aziz, a 17-year old Afghan American woman.Western governments and human rights groups are scrutinizing companies they suspect may be complicit in the Chinese government's sweeping detentions of Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in the far western region of Xinjiang. The US State Department estimates that as many as two million people may have been taken to detention centers, where former detainees claim they are indoctrinated and abused. While Beijing insists that the camps are voluntary "vocational training centers," many Western nations have condemned them as mass detention centers designed to eradicate Uyghur culture and Islamic practices. In July, several major clothing brands --- including PVH, the owner of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger --- said they were working on "reducing [their] supply chain footprint in China" after activists pressured them to respond to reports alleging that some of their goods came from forced labor camps in Xinjiang.Less than two months later, Disney provoked an international backlash after thanking Xinjiang authorities in the credits of its blockbuster film "Mulan."Some testimonies from former detainees describe over-crowded cells, torture and even the death of fellow detainees.Kanter did not provide the exact date when the content moderation policy was changed, but she said it had been "at least over a year.""I just want to emphasize that we do not censor content [now]. I would encourage you to open the app and search for Tiananmen Square, search for Uyghurs, search for Tibet, you will find that content on TikTok," she said, listing some topics considered out of bounds by the Chinese government.TikTok has hundreds of millions of users worldwide, but has faced massive scrutiny from governments wary of its Chinese roots. The Trump administration has threatened to ban the app from operating in the United States. It is working to complete a deal with Oracle and Walmart to avoid that fate. And the Indian government banned TikTok and other Chinese apps earlier this summer amid rising tensions between New Delhi and Beijing. The decision cut the app off from one of its largest growth markets.During the hearing, Kanter invited UK officials to come to TikTok's Transparency and Accountability Center to inspect the app's algorithm and observe the company's approach to content moderation, claiming they could see for themselves that there is no censorship anymore."We're the only platform that has announced an open approach to our algorithm and the code that drives our algorithm," she said.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Wall Street Remains Bullish On ChinaBenzinga.comDecember 2, 2020 Wednesday 7:37 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Accretive Capital LLC d/b/a Benzinga All Rights ReservedLength: 1821 wordsByline: DirexionBodyThe November rally in U.S. equities may be garnering most of the attention (especially as we get closer to having a COVID-19 vaccine) but don t sleep on China.Among Direxion s stable of leveraged ETFs, two of the five top-performing funds year to date provide magnified exposure to China. Here s a breakdown of what has driven each fund higher.Daily CSI 300 China A Share Bull 2X SharesThe Direxion Daily CSI 300 China A Share Bull 2X Shares (NYSE: CHAU) finds itself higher by about 17% over the past month. The ETF, which aims to deliver 200% the daily performance of the CSI 300 Index, has been propelled to its current levels thanks to strength across a surprising array of consumer-driven sectors including financials as well as consumer staples and discretionary stocks.Standouts within the ETF include China Merchants Bank (Pink: CIHKY), higher by about 25% in November, and appliance manufacturers Gree Electric and Midea Group, which both rose about 15% during the month.Bolstering these and other Chinese A-share equities in the index are strong consumer spending numbers. However, those spending numbers aren t from Chinese consumers. Instead, these A-shares are being supported through strong export numbers to consumer economies outside of China, in neighboring countries like Singapore, Malaysia, and even the U.S. and Europe.China s own consumers are not so eager to spend, especially as an estimated 9% of its workforce remains unemployed. As a result, much of the country s economic traction is coming from the country s booming export figures, which may diminish if and when the world bounces back from the pandemic.Nevertheless, the numbers have been an encouraging driver for Chinese stocks at large. And even though exports are the primary economic driver, they re not the only one.In a dynamic that U.S. investors are very familiar with, companies with large online presences have dominated and become increasingly central to China s economy, as evidenced by the strength in Direxion s Daily CSI China Internet Index Bull 2X Shares (NYSE: CWEB). Though the trade has cooled off of late, CWEB has still more than doubled in 2020.That return is the product of fairly consistent growth across most of the country s many internet giants. This of course includes e-commerce powerhouses Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA) JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: JD) and Meituan-Dianping (Pink: MPNGF), the latter of which has seen massive growth thanks to its online food delivery.However, the biggest standout among this internet contingent is the recently IPO ed fintech KE Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: BEKE), which has surged 72% since its listing in early August. Backed in part by Japan s SoftBank Group Corp (Pink: SFTBY), the online property platform has drawn comparisons to Zillow Group Inc (NASDAQ: ZG) and has ridden on rising enthusiasm in China s economic resilience and sustained growth in boosting the nation s real estate market.In addition to CHAU and CWEB, Daily FTSE China Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: YINN) (up 15% in the last month) and Direxion Daily Emerging Markets Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: EDC) (up 29%) have also outperformed.Ultimately, what continues to drive China s growth is its dedication to building itself by investing in public services and utilities like high-speed internet and essential infrastructure to bolster both its manufacturing and technological capabilities. These investments, combined with the allure of its rising middle class, appear likely to keep Wall Street bullish on China in spite of any geopolitical headwinds. The performance data quoted represents past performance.

The use of leverage by a Fund increases the risk to the Fund. The Direxion Shares ETFs are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by sophisticated investors who understand leverage risk, consequences of seeking daily leveraged investment results and intend to actively monitor and manage their investment.Direxion Shares Risks   There are special risk considerations relating to Stock Connect Program and RQFII and QFII investors and the Chinese A-Share market. The Stock Connect Program is subject to daily and aggregate quota limitations, and an investor cannot purchase and sell the same security on the same trading day, which may restrict the other funds  or counterparties  ability to invest in A-Shares through the Stock Connect Program and to enter into or exit trades on a timely basis. A-shares are issued by companies incorporated in the People s Republic of China ( PRC ). The A-share market in China is made available to domestic PRC investors and certain foreign investors, including those foreign investors that have been approved as Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors ( RQFII ) or as Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors ( QFII ). The Fund s ability to achieve its inverse investment objective is dependent on the ability of other ETFs and counterparties to obtain their QFII or RQFII quota. If the Fund is unable to obtain sufficient exposure to the Index due to the limited availability of necessary investments or financial instruments, the Fund could, among other things, as a defensive measure, limit or suspend creation units until the adviser determines that the requisite exposure to the Index is obtainable. During the period that creation units are suspended, the fund could trade at a significant premium or discount to its NAV and could experience substantial redemptions.Risks associated with investments in Chinese companies include, among others, (i) the small size of the market for Chinese securities and low trading volume, resulting in a lack of liquidity and in price volatility; (ii) currency devaluations and other currency exchange rate fluctuations or blockages; (iii) the nature and extent of intervention by the PRC government in the Chinese securities markets, whether such intervention will continue and the impact of such intervention or its discontinuation; (iv) the risk of nationalization or expropriation of assets; (v) the risk that the PRC government may decide not to continue to support economic reform programs; (vi) limitation on the use of brokers; (vii) higher rates of inflation; (viii) greater political, economic and social uncertainty; (ix) market volatility caused by potential regional or territorial conflicts or natural disasters and; (x) the risk of increased trade tariffs, embargoes and other trade limitations. These factors can directly affect A-shares, and may indirectly affect investments that derive their value from A-shares. Any reduction or elimination of access to A-shares will have a material adverse effect on the ability of the fund to achieve its investments objective.Risks of the Fund include Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk, Derivatives Risk, Leverage Risk, Market Risk, Market Disruption Risk, Aggressive Investment Techniques Risk, Counterparty Risk, Intra-Day Investment Risk, Daily Index Correlation/Tracking Risk, Other Investment Companies (including ETFs) Risk, and Emerging Markets Risk. Investing in, and/or having exposure to, emerging markets instruments involves greater risks than investing in issuers located or operating in more developed markets. Please see the summary and full prospectuses for a more complete description of these and other risks of the Fund.Direxion Funds Risks   An investment in the Funds involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Funds are non-diversified and include risks associated with concentration risk which results from the Funds  investments in a particular industry or sector and can increase volatility over time. Active and frequent trading associated with a regular rebalance of a fund can cause the price to fluctuate, therefore impacting its performance compared to other investment vehicles. For other risks including correlation, compounding, market volatility and specific risks regarding each sector, please read the prospectus.Distributor for Direxion Shares: Foreside Fund Services, LLC.© 2020 Benzinga.com.

Who is guilty of the pandemic?CE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 5, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 820 wordsBodyAt the start of the pandemic, in Seattle, Washington state in the northwestern United States, a serious, manufactured virus was reported, which frightened the gringos and sent it to China. On the other hand, on 21 January this year there was talk of a middle-aged man who had just returned from Wuhan, China. A month later, it was also in nearby Seattle that the first official deaths were recorded by COVID-19 Which of the two is the truth: first Seattle and then Wuhan or vice versa?I receive a text that says the following:"The world is a handkerchief!! Wuhan's Chinese biological laboratory actually belongs to Glaxo, who by chance owns Pfizer, who manages the finances of Black Rock, which by chance manages the finances of the Open Society (Soros), which by chance takes care of the interests of frenchman AXA, whose German company Cool Winterthur built the Chinese laboratory, accidentally purchased by Germany's Allianz, and which by chance has as its large shareholder Vanguard, a shareholder in Black Rock, which controls central banks and manages 1/3 of the world's investment capital, which by chance is a large shareholder of Microsoft and Gates, which is a shareholder in Pfizer and now the first WHO sponsor!!!"Note: There are some mistakes among them: Winterthur is not German: It was a very famous Swiss insurance company that to communicate to its customers and distributors the acquisition of Winterthur, AXA (in the case of Spain) decides to change its trade name during 2007, being called AXA Winterthur.The text received says that Glaxo who by chance owns Pfizer - as is known, is the one that is manufacturing one of the most important vaccines against coronavirus - and Black Rock of New York, a company founded in 1988, an investment giant that manages the finances of the Open Society of Hungarian Soros who by chance takes care of the interests of AXA French multinational, as already said, was an insurance business founded in 1916.The Spanish newspaper ABC (collaborators of the most recalcitrant and even far-right, several of them anti-Semitic) in this regard said: "The well-founded or publicity suspicions that weigh on the P4 virology laboratory, in the Chinese city of Wuhan (11 million inhabitants), as a possible "propagator" center of COVID-19, pose the immense historical problem of the uncontrollability of strategic technology transfers to the Chinese communist government. In 2003, China suffered a major crisis, the already "far away" of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCPE) defines as follows: "It is a viral respiratory disease caused by a coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-associated coronavirus."President Chirac of France (1932-2019) who was president from 1995-2007 set out to provide humanitarian and technological relief. Then came the first idea of creating Wuhan's virology laboratory, with three pillars: state cooperation, technical cooperation and cooperation.The Pasteur Institute (from France) warned that Chinese political power appropriated "imported" technology, "but did not communicate or respect the "information" and "cooperation" agreements. Worse, it ended up being "discovered" that Chinese scientists, subjected to the strictest bureaucratic control of communist power, worked on lands (viruses and vaccines) that systematically concealed from French colleagues who had transferred sensitive knowledge, techniques and research to them."Known that experience, Emmanuel Macron extended Franco-Chinese "privileged relations" with President Xi Jinping. Within a few days of the comfination of France on 17 March 2020 last year, theFrench president still presented as a great diplomatic triumph his personal dialogue with the Chinese president and the convening of a G20 emergency meeting, with a practical result to be discovered, when they have continued to "drip" the risks of transferring strategic technologies to the Chinese communist government."OTHER COUNTRIES INVOLVEDClearly, it is a hyper-business of many agencies related to medicine and the global pharmaceutical industry. Supposedly, private citizens in many countries will not pay for vaccines, perhaps not out of their immediate pocket, but from the taxes they pay to their respective governments as in the case of Mexico where the government "gave the vaccine to the population".As we see above, the current coronavirus is not so new, since it has been talked about for many years or the idea of imposing the vaccine on the basis of terror on the various populations, is novel.Controlling the world's over-population is no modern idea as any sincere international politician could tell us without caring too much whether it is criminal right-wing or false-left as today's communism. To which, of course and fortunately, Mexico no longer belongs. Further research is needed to find out who humans owe the current situation in the world.Load-Date: December 6, 2020End of Document

Committee to Protect Journalists: Chinese Filmmaker and Photographer Du Bin Detained by PoliceTargeted News ServiceDecember 19, 2020 Saturday 9:50 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 389 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: TAIPEI, Taiwan BodyThe Committee to Protect Journalists issued the following news on Dec. 18:Chinese authorities should immediately release journalist Du Bin and refrain from harassing and detaining members of the press, the Committee to Protect Journalists said today.On the morning of December 16, police in Beijing arrested Du for allegedly "picking quarrels and provoking trouble," a criminal offense, according to news reports.Du, a freelance filmmaker and photographer, has worked for the state-owned newspapers Beijing Youth Daily and Workers' Daily, as well as international outlets including The New York Times, and often posts political commentary on his personal Facebook account, where he has about 1,000 followers, according to news reports and CPJ's review of his posts.According to those reports, police have questioned Du several times over the past year and have demanded Du delete posts from his Twitter account. CPJ was unable to find that account."By arresting Du Bin, China is only adding to its sorry record as the world's worst jailer of journalists," said CPJ Asia Program Coordinator Steven Butler, in Washington, D.C. "Du should be freed at once, and authorities should stop detaining members of the press."On the night of December 16, the Beijing City Daxing Public Security Bureau called Du's sister Du Jirong, and notified her that Du has been detained, according to an interview his sister gave with The Epoch Times, a U.S.-based media company that reports critically on the Chinese government.The New York Times reported that Du's detention may be related to his ongoing historical book projects. Du's newest book "Red Terror: Lenin's Communist Experiment," is scheduled to be published on January 1, 2021.When CPJ called the Daxing Public Security Bureau in Beijing, an officer who answered said that he had no information regarding Du's detention and hung up.Du was previously detained for 37 days in 2013 on the same allegations, as CPJ documented at the time.On December 1, CPJ found that at least 47 journalists have been imprisoned in China in 2020, making it the largest jailer of journalists worldwide for the second year in a row.On December 11, Beijing police detained Haze Fan, a staff member of Bloomberg News, as CPJ documented at the time.[Category: Media]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7332633 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: December 19, 2020End of Document

GRASSLEY EXPLAINS THE DEMOCRATIC COVER-UP OF THE HUNTER BIDEN INVESTIGATIONStates News ServiceDecember 14, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1431 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Iowa Senator Charles Grassley:Prepared Floor Remarks by U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley of IowaExplains the Democratic Cover-up of the Hunter Biden InvestigationMonday, December 14, 2020For over a year, Senator Johnson and I investigated the Biden family's financial dealings.For over a year, the liberal media and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle falsely said we were peddling Russian disinformation.They ginned up any story they could to falsely portray our investigation in an effort to delegitimize its findings.Even my colleague, Senator Wyden, whom I've worked with on many bipartisan investigations, said the following: "This disinformation also became the basis of the Johnson-Grassley investigation. The political nature of this investigation has been clear all along. Bottom line: the Johnson-Grassley investigation is baseless. It is laundering Russian propaganda for circulation in the U.S."It seems the liberal media and the Democrats have a nervous tick.Any time a Republican gets close to the truth and is about to serve justice, the other side yells "Russian disinformation!"That's a load of garbage.As I've said on this floor several times before, our report was rooted in information from U.S. government agencies and a left-aligned U.S. lobby shop that represented a corrupt Ukrainian gas company.And by now, the American people know that it's really the Democrats and liberal media that are connected to Russian disinformation.See the Steele Dossier. It was infected with Russian disinformation and paid for by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign.The liberal media and those on the other side of the aisle were scared of the facts. They were scared that the American people would see the Biden family's deep and extensive links to foreign governments, including the communist Chinese government.And once we publicly issued our findings, those same liberal outlets said the report repackaged old material and that there was nothing new to it.They went into full Joe Biden protection mode. And they didn't even try to hide it.One Washington Post columnist said: "Even after accepting disinformation from Russian agents, Johnson and Grassley couldn't come up with anything new or interesting on Hunter Biden."Politico ran a story with this headline: "GOP Senators' anti-Biden report repackages old claims."And NPR said about the New York Post Hunter Biden stories: "We don't want to waste our time on stories that are not really stories, and we don't want to waste the listeners' and readers' time on stories that are just pure distractions."Look at what Twitter and Facebook did to the Hunter Biden news.Simply said, they interfered in the election and gave the Biden campaign a multi-million dollar in-kind donation courtesy of their blatant and unforgiveable censorship.My fellow Americans, let us never forget what Twitter and Facebook did during the 2020 election.Fast forward to today, now it's confirmed that Hunter Biden is under criminal investigation reportedly for his taxes and financial dealings the very fact pattern that we described in our report.It shouldn't take Hunter Biden to confirm that he's under criminal investigation before the main stream press gets permission to report the news.It's a complete outrage at the way the liberal media used its power to cover up facts relating to Hunter Biden and the Biden family yet ran story after story with false information about the Russia investigation into Trump and the credibility of the Steele Dossier.The recent news also shows that our report was not "baseless" and it didn't "repackage old claims."Quite the opposite. It was well-founded, ahead of the curve and right on the money in more ways than one.Our report teed up the facts, but the mainstream press never stepped up to the plate.Some of the nation's supposedly leading press outlets with teams of investigative reporters were scooped by Congress. Now they are scrambling to chase the story they ignored.It didn't have to be this way. We already did much of the heavy lifting before issuing our report.The report made public information that hadn't been known before.For example, it showed the following:Hunter Biden and his associates and family members were connected to Chinese nationals and Chinese companies linked with the communist party and People's Liberation Army. This includes CEFC China Energy Company Limited and its subsidiaries.Records show that a company linked to the communist regime sent Hunter Biden's law firm millions of dollars.Other records show that Hunter Biden opened a line of credit with a Chinese national linked to the communist regime and funded it with approximately $100,000. Then he, James Biden and Sara Biden went on an extravagant global spending spree.Still other records show that Hunter Biden, via his law firm, also sent over a million dollars to James Biden's consulting firm, the Lion Hall Group.These transfers began less than one week after CEFC sent $5 million to a company called Hudson West III, a company linked to CEFC and Chinese nationals associated with the communist regime, which then sent money to Hunter Biden's law firm.When the bank contacted Sara Biden, who was associated with the firm's bank account, she refused to answer their questions and provide additional documentation.According to records we have on file, the bank submitted the account for closure.Senator Johnson and I recently issued a supplemental to our report that showed Hunter Biden's close business associate, Rob Walker, received $6 million from a Chinese company linked to the communist regime. There's yet another link in the chain from the Biden family and their associates to the Chinese government.The report also showed that State Department officials believed that Hunter Biden's Burisma board membership created the perception of a conflict of interest and "was very awkward for all U.S. officials pushing an anticorruption agenda in Ukraine."Secretary of State Kerry publicly denied knowing of Hunter Biden's role on Burisma's board.We acquired evidence showing that he did, in fact, know about that role.In December 2015, instead of following U.S. objectives of confronting oligarchs, Vice President Biden's staff advised him to avoid commenting on Burisma's oligarch and instead say, "I'm not going to get into naming names or accusing individuals."Joe Biden was running an anticorruption agenda in Ukraine and he pulled his punches while his son was on the board of Burisma.Based on witness testimony, Burisma's owner allegedly paid a $7 million bribe to officials serving under Ukraine's prosecutor general to shut the case against him. When he allegedly paid that bribe, Hunter Biden was on the board.These examples are just a sampling from the report and the tip of the iceberg with respect to the Biden family's troubled ties to governments adverse to U.S. interests.These associations, and the millions of dollars that passed between and among Hunter Biden, James Biden and others, create criminal financial, counterintelligence and extortion concerns.That's why I've since written to the Justice Department about the risk that Hunter and James Biden essentially served as agents of the communist Chinese government for purposes of the Foreign Agents Registration Act.After Hunter Biden publicly confirmed he was under criminal investigation, liberal news outlets reported on concerns that his financial associations could create criminal financial and counterintelligence problems.That's what we said in September 2020 and we were roundly criticized for it.And just over the weekend, a new email was made public that reportedly says Joe Biden and his brother were "office mates" with the very same Chinese nationals we wrote about in our report.Those same individuals were the ones with links to the communist regime and it's military.Based on all the facts known to date, Joe Biden has a lot of explaining to do.I've run many oversight operations and investigations during the course of my career. I'm interested in the facts, in the evidence, in the truth.I learned a lesson long ago when I first started my oversight focus and that is: no matter how difficult the media or the other side of the aisle makes it to find the facts never give up, keep working hard.The American taxpayer deserves nothing less.That's the attitude and approach I've had my entire career and it's what I will take with me as I continue to look into the Biden family matters and as I move back to lead the Senate Judiciary Committee.Load-Date: December 14, 2020End of Document

Chinese tech giants lose $260 billion in two-day stock marketCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 11, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 328 wordsBodyChina's tech giants have already lost nearly $260 billion in market value in the past two days, after Beijing advanced legislation to limit the growing power of these prices.Alibaba, Tencent, JD.com, Meituan and Xiaomi all slide up to 8%, after the previous session sank. Alibaba lost 9.80% to 248.40 Hong Kong dollars (HKD), JD.com gave up 5.63% to $80.08 in the United States and 9.20% to HKD 300 in China, Meituan broke 9.67% to 271 Hong Kong dollars and Xiaomi lost 8.18% to HKD 22.45.On Tuesday, the Chinese government unveiled legislation aimed at combating monopolistic practices in the internet industry after years without intervening in the sector. The new rules come to avoid anti-competitive practices such as collusion to share sensitive consumer data, alliances that stifle smaller rivals or subsidize services by making them below cost price, even eliminate competition.Regulators will be concerned about the reach of these companies, which already operate in more sensitive sectors such as finance and healthcare. "Chinese major technology companies will have to rethink their business models," says the Anjie Law Firm. The philosophy of internet companies is that the winner wins everything, and in particular in platform operators, who gather similar traffic and build similar ecosystems," the same company continues, in a statement to Bloomberg.The forecast of investment house Chanson &Co; is that these measures may discourage companies in the sector from quoting in the Chinese market. Already the previous week, the same executive had interfered with the plans of a major representative of the sector, Ant Group, which was preparing to enter the stock exchange, with an issue of 35 billion dollars. According to a statement quoted by Bloomberg, the Shanghai stock exchange suspended the group's entry due to regulatory issues. China argues that this company, tycoon Jack Ma, will be subject to the same capital and leverage restrictions as banks.Load-Date: November 12, 2020End of Document

It cited what it said were public complaints about obscene, pornographic and violent information or fraud, gambling and prostitution.The ruling Communist Party tightly controls what the Chinese public sees online and has launched repeated crackdowns on websites and apps.TripAdvisor China, a joint venture between TripAdvisor and its Chinese partner Trip.com, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.Following the removal of its app in China, Nasdaq-listed TripAdvisor’s stock price was down 1.68% to $29.59 at the market's close in the U.S. on Tuesday.TripAdvisor owns a 40% stake in TripAdvisor China, with Trip.com owning the other 60%. Under the partnership, the companies share its travel inventories and content.___Associated Press writer Joe McDonald in Beijing contributed to this report.Load-Date: December 9, 2020End of Document

Government gives TikTok another week to sell its operations in the countryCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 25, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 262 wordsBodySan Francisco, Nov 25. (EFE News).- The Government on Wednesday granted a new seven-day extension to the Chinese company ByteDance, which owns TikTok, to sell its operations in the country, the second issued to date and which allows it to continue operating until December 4. In a document filed wednesday with the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, the court leading the case, TikTok's attorneys informed the judge of the new extension granted by the U.S. Foreign Investment Committee (CFIUS).Had the extension not occurred, the last deadline on Friday, November 27, but the U.S. government gave it additional time to review recently received documentation.The case dates back to last August, when President Donald Trump issued an executive order saying that TikTok's U.S. business should be sold to a company in the country and otherwise veted. The Trump administration argues that what it wants is to prevent data from Americans using TikTok from being shared with the Chinese government, something those responsible for the popular short video app say they would never do. In September, U.S. firms Oracle and Walmart agreed that 20% of TikTok Global, a new country-based company that would lead the application's service worldwide, will still be negotiated, although it remains to be negotiated what stake ByteDance will continue to have in TikTok. In this regard, TikTok ensures that negotiations to complete the agreement remain open. Implementers have always maintained that all their data centers are outside China and that their data is not subject to Chinese law.Load-Date: November 27, 2020End of Document

Sen. Peters Slams Administration for Lack of Action Against Foreign Adversaries Over Coronavirus Vaccine Research HacksTargeted News ServiceNovember 21, 2020 Saturday 8:50 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1366 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodySen. Gary Peters, D-Michigan, issued the following news release:U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI), Ranking Member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, slammed the Trump Administration for their lack of action against foreign adversaries, including Russia, China, and North Korea, that have sponsored cyber-attacks against American hospitals and research institutions in an effort to steal information related to development of Coronavirus vaccines. Peters' letter comes after President Trump fired senior cybersecurity official Christopher Krebs, and announcements from two pharmaceutical companies that Coronavirus vaccines under development could be highly effective."I am angered by these government sponsored cyber-attacks and your lack of action to deter them over the past months. And now you've decided to fire the Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Deputy Director of CISA, and the CISA Assistant Director for cybersecurity. CISA, with the Department of Defense, is responsible for the cybersecurity of your own Operation Warp Speed to develop a COVID-19 vaccine and you've removed its top three cybersecurity leaders," wrote Peters.Peters continued: "I urge you, again, to send a strong message to any foreign government attempting to hack into our medical institutions that this behavior is unacceptable. The Administration should use the tools at its disposal, including the threat of sanctions, to deter future attacks against research institutions. In the event that any foreign government directly threatens the lives of Americans through attacks on medical facilities, other Department of Defense capabilities should be considered to make it clear that there will be consequences for these actions."By attacking health care providers' and vaccine researchers' information systems, foreign adversaries put the health and safety of Americans at risk. After evidence of cyber-attacks sponsored by the Chinese government arose in May, Peters pressed the Administration to take swift action to hold the Chinese government accountable.As Ranking Member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and a member of the bipartisan Senate Cybersecurity Caucus, Peters has led efforts to bolster our nation's cybersecurity defenses. The Senate unanimously approved Peters' bills to develop and retain highly-skilled cybersecurity professionals in the federal workforce and strengthen cybersecurity coordination between DHS and state and local governments. Peters also introduced bipartisan legislation to improve access to cybersecurity resources and training for small businesses, support K-12 schools with the resources they need to bolster their cybersecurity and ensure that America is prepared to respond to and recover in the event of a major cyber-attack.Peters has also worked to address America's overreliance on foreign adversaries, such as China, for critical drugs, personal protective equipment and medical supplies needed to address the Coronavirus pandemic. In a 2019 report, Peters raised concerns and recommended actions to address vulnerabilities in our medical supply chain, including shortages for prescription drugs, masks, gloves, and vaccine delivery devices, which are compounded by the United States' dependence on foreign manufacturers.* * *November 19, 2020To: The Honorable Donald J. Trump, President of the United States, The White House, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20500Mr. President,On May 12, 2020, I sent you a letter highlighting concerns around reported Chinese government sponsored attacks against the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), hospitals, research laboratories, and pharmaceutical companies with the goal of stealing COVID-19 treatment and vaccine research. In that letter, I urged you to take action to stop these attacks.On July 16, 2020, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the U.S., released an advisory stating that the Russian Government has also been targeting our health care system, again in search of COVID-19 vaccine development and testing data. On November 13, Microsoft published an alert warning of hacking groups connected to the Russian and North Korean governments that targeted COVID-19 vaccine and treatment researchers in Canada, France, India, South Korea, and the United States. According to the alert, some of their attacks were successful.I am angered by these government sponsored cyber-attacks and your lack of action to deter them over the past months. And now you've decided to fire the Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Deputy Director of CISA, and the CISA Assistant Director for Cybersecurity. CISA, with the Department of Defense, is responsible for the cybersecurity of your own Operation Warp Speed to develop a COVID-19 vaccine and you've removed its top three cybersecurity leaders. While I have full confidence in the dedicated workforce at CISA to continue to execute their mission despite your actions, the removal of these individuals invites attacks from our adversaries based on a perception of instability, rather than prevent them.This is not about keeping COVID-19 vaccine research for Americans alone, it is about ensuring that the institutions performing this research are not experiencing intrusions onto their systems that could disrupt or destroy this research. I again urge you to take necessary actions to mitigate this threat. These hackers put the lives of Americans at risk.In my previous letter, I called on you to take action to deter adversary activity, and while I applaud the joint advisory issued over the summer and recent Department of Justice indictments, it is clear these attacks have continued and that your actions thus far are insufficient to deter our adversaries. Not only have you not taken adequate action to stop Chinese government aggression, but your inaction has invited additional attackers. This is completely unacceptable.As the Ranking Member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, I have called for improving the security of state, local, and private sector institutions that are researching COVID-19. I have made clear that in this time of crisis, the federal government should prioritize cybersecurity support to safeguard our health care sector.I urge you, again, to send a strong message to any foreign government attempting to hack into our medical institutions that this behavior is unacceptable. The Administration should use the tools at its disposal, including the threat of sanctions, to deter future attacks against research institutions. In the event that any foreign government directly threatens the lives of Americans through attacks on medical facilities, other Department of Defense capabilities should be considered to make it clear that there will be consequences for these actions.Given the continuation of attacks throughout the year, and your lack of response to my previous letter, I reiterate my request for you to take all necessary measures to protect medical institutions working to save lives by developing treatments and a vaccine for COVID-19. These measures should include:* Directing CISA and CYBERCOM to continue to prioritize cybersecurity support to hospitals and medical research institutions, including providing risk and vulnerability assessments and sharing cyber threat intelligence information with those organizations.* Utilizing all levers of national power - diplomatic, military, economic, and law enforcement - to deter adversary governments from any attacks against U.S. health care system and make clear that any attack on our medical systems will be treated as a significant threat to our country.* Increasing cybersecurity funding as part of future COVID-19 funding requests to Congress for hospitals, medical and research institutions.* Directing Secretary Azar to prioritize HHS information technology appropriations towards improvements in cybersecurity, and encouraging the Secretary to work with GAO and the HHS Inspector General to improve its cybersecurity posture.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7303102 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: November 21, 2020End of Document

China seeks foreign capital to develop 5G or autonomous drivingCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 29, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 464 wordsBodyShanghai( China), Dec 29 (EFE)- China wants to attract foreign capital to develop industries such as fifth generation mobile networks (5G) or autonomous driving, according to a list of sectors in which foreign investment published by the Ministry of Commerce is encouraged.This document, published last night, covers a total of 480 sectors nationwide and another 755 specific to the central and western regions of the country, which Beijing seeks to push to try to balance economic growth with that of traditionally prosperous coastal areas.This is the latest update to the list, which includes 127 new industries that will seek to attract investment from other countries - 88 existing ones have also been revised to expand the chances of receiving capital - and which will enter into force on 27 January 2021.According to a Trade Spokesperson, emphasis has been placed on manufacturing and production services to improve production efficiency and improve industrial technologies, with new sectors added to the list such as online education or cross-border e-commerce.Also included are covid pandemic-related work areas such as respirators or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) machines, used in patients whose lungs are severely damaged.Foreign investors who contribute capital in these sectors may benefit from "preferred policies" on taxes or land use.In recent years, China has been trying to boost the process of opening up its economy with such initiatives, including the so-called "negative list" of sectors that still prevent investment from entering abroad, from 40 to 33 industries in 2019.And, in the face of the bad timing of its trade relations with the United States, Beijing is promoting treaties such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the world's largest free trade agreement, recently signed with fifteen other countries in the Asia-Pacific region, or the Comprehensive Investment Agreement (IDB) with the European Union (EU).On the latter, a political agreement could be announced tomorrow - although the ratification process could take months - after no country in the European organization has put a stop behind the last round of negotiations, something that would put an end to a process that began in 2014.Diplomatic sources explained to Efe that China now seems ready to address European doubts about labour standards in the Asian country and to work towards ratification of the Conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO), areas where the Twenty-seven had doubts about Beijing's commitment.With the IA CAI, the EU aims to improve access to the Chinese market for European companies and increase the transparency of subsidies that the Chinese government gives to state-owned companies to ensure equal competition.Load-Date: December 30, 2020End of Document

China criticized Francis because the pope referred to Uighurs as "persecuted"CE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 24, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 432 wordsBodyChina on Tuesday criticized Pope Francis for a passage from his new book in which he mentions the suffering of the Uighur Muslim minority in the country.The pontiff's statements "have no factual basis," said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian."People from all ethnic groups enjoy all the rights of survival, development and freedom of religious belief," Zhao said at his daily press conference.The spokesman did not mention the camps in which more than 1 million Uighurs and other Muslim minority groups have been held.The United States and other countries, in addition to human rights groups, say prison-like facilities seek to steer Muslims away from their religious and cultural heritage, forcing them to declare the communist party and its leader, Xi Jinping, loyal.China, which at first denied the existence of the camps, now says they are voluntary centres that provide vocational training and prevent terrorism and religious extremism.In his new book, "Let Us Dream," to be published on December 1, Francis mentions the "poor Uighurs" among the examples of groups persecuted for their faith.The pope writes about the need to see the world from the periphery and margins of society, "places of sin and misery, of exclusion and suffering, of sickness and loneliness".In these places, "I often think of the persecuted peoples: the Rohinya, the Uighurs, the Yazidi _ what the Isis has done to them is truly cruel _ or The Christians in Egypt or Pakistan, killed by bombs while praying in the church," the pontiff wrote.Francis has refused to criticize China for its crackdown on religious minorities, including Catholics, to the disappointment of the U.S. government and human rights groups. The Vatican renewed last month its controversial agreement with Beijing for the nomination of Catholic bishops, and Francis has been very cautious to avoid saying anything that offends the Chinese government on this issue.China and the Vatican have no formal relationship since the Communist Party severed ties and arrested Catholic priests shortly after taking power in 1949.NEWSLETTER 9AM From Monday to Friday, the selection of our editors of the most relevant information for each day.

RUBIO JOINS YOHO, COLLEAGUES IN URGING UN TO INVESTIGATE UYGHUR HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES IN XINJIANGStates News ServiceNovember 17, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 870 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Florida Senator Marco Rubio:U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) joined Congressman Ted Yoho (R-FL), and a group of bipartisan and bicameral colleagues, in sending a letter to Secretary-General of the United Nations Antnio Guterres urging him to leverage the international organization's investigative and political mechanisms to urgently investigate and elevate the ongoing crisis in Xinjiang. The letter's requests align closely with the demands of leading experts and the non-governmental community. Notably, the appointment of a Special Envoy, Special Rapporteur, or other investigative mechanism, as well as the holding of a Special Session of the Human Rights Council.Joining Senators Rubio and Congressman Yoho in sending the letter were U.S. Senators Rick Scott (R-FL), John Cornyn (R-TX), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), as well as Representatives Tom Malinowski (D-NJ), Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Steve Chabot (R-OH), Steve Cohen (D-TN), Mike Gallagher (R-WI), Donald Beyer (D-VA), Joe Wilson (R-SC), Jim McGovern (D-MA), Brian Mast (R-FL), Jamie Raskin (D-MD), Guy Reschenthaler (R-PA), Ben McAdams (D-UT), Tom Tiffany (R-WI), and Elaine Luria (D-VA). International support on the letter included parliamentarians from Australia, Canada, the European Union, Italy, and Switzerland.Rubio is Cochair of the bipartisan and bicameral Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) and is a member of the Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and International Cybersecurity Policy.Thefull text of the letter is below.Mr. Secretary General:We write today to urge you to use your authority as Secretary General to take immediate actions to address the growing human rights crisis in Xinjiang. Specifically, we echo calls for you to appoint a Special Envoy or other investigative mechanism and for you to publicly support calls for the UNHRC to hold a special session on the crisis.As you are intimately aware, millions of Uyghurs and other minorities have been taken from their homes and arbitrarily detained in "re-education centers" where innocent citizens have been reportedly subjected to political indoctrination, torture, rape, and forced injections. According to the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, there are at least 380 identified mass detention facilitiesincluding "re-education camps," prisons, and other facilities in Xinjiang. Despite claims by the Chinese government of slowed expansion, 61 of these detention facilities show signs of expansion in the past year alone. As reported by The Guardian, a recent Chinese Communist Party white paper openly claims that "an average of 1.29 million workers [...] had gone through 'vocational training' every year between 2014 and 2019."Victims of the ethnic persecution in Xinjiang have also testified to our respective legislative bodies on widespread government-led efforts to suppress religious identity and expression. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute estimated that approximately 8,500 mosques have been destroyed in Xinjiang since 2017. Further evidence indicates that Uyghur women have been sterilized under threat of punishment, which could include being sent to the camps.Independent reporting has also confirmed that the Chinese government uses diplomats, officials, and other proxies in our member nations to spy on and track down Uyghurs residing abroad. We are also concerned by a consistent pattern of the Chinese government refusing to renew passports or travel documents for Uyghur citizens, forcing them to choose between returning to China and likely detention or facing potential deportation due to invalidated or expired documents. In addition, we are deeply concerned that Chinese authorities seek to silence protected speech of Uyghurs in our own countries by harassing and detaining their family members in China.As a result of these widespread and well-documented reports, 50 human rights experts issued a call for key actions by the United Nations. Making note of the alarming attack on fundamental freedoms in Xinjiang and the unwillingness of the Chinese government to allow independent investigations, these experts urged several key actionsincluding some under your direct authority. Notably, the UN Human Rights experts urged:An urgent debate and/or special session of the UN Human Rights CouncilThe establishment of an independent UN monitoring mechanism on rights in China, which could include a UN Special Rapporteur, an HRC Panel of Experts, or a Special Envoy appointed by the Secretary GeneralAs you know, this call for meaningful action by UN human rights experts was reiterated by over 400 global NGOs. We write to join this call for action. The time for strong and unequivocal condemnation is not over. However, the circumstances today call for you to take unilateral action to the full measure allowed under your authorities to bring to bear the full power of UN investigative and political pressure on the crisis in Xinjiang.We would welcome a conversation with you on the steps your office will pursue and encourage within the United Nations system to investigate the reported ethnic and religious persecution in Xinjiang.Sincerely,Load-Date: November 17, 2020End of Document

TIBETAN WOMAN DETAINED, THREATENED IN QINGHAI OVER CALLS FOR DEMOCRACYStates News ServiceDecember 8, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 985 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Authorities in Qinghai province in northwestern China last month detained a Tibetan woman known for her online advocacy of democracy and the rule of law, holding her for 10 days before releasing her under continuing surveillance, Tibetan sources say.Tsering Tso, who had drawn police attention with her postings on the social media platform WeChat, was taken into custody at her home in the provincial capital Xining on Nov. 12 and brought by 10 officers to a detention center in Trika (in Chinese, Guide) county, an India-based Tibetan rights group said this week.In addition to surviving only on steamed buns and boiled water during her detention, she was subjected to ill-treatment and intimidation, the Tibetan Centre For Human Rights and Democracy (TCHRD) said, adding that detaining officers had hoped to pressure her to give up her advocacy work.By detaining people like Tsering Tso, the Chinese government is violating the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which China has signed and agreed to abide by. However, China is inflicting many other policies on Tibetans in Tibet that violate international laws, TCHRD researcher Tenzin Dawa said.The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is one of some 60 rights instruments under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on Dec. 10, 1948.With the approach of the annual UN Human Rights Day on Dec. 10, estimates of political prisoners in Tibet range from more than 500 in U.S. Congressional reports to more than 2,000 in a database kept by the TCHRD.Tibetan political prisoners endure harsh prison conditions, including torture, deprivation of food and sleep, and long periods in isolation cells, said the Washington-based International Campaign for Tibet, which notes that opaque Chinese record keeping makes it hard to determine how many are being held.In the current political climate imposed by Chinese authorities, even the most mild expressions of Tibetan cultural or religious identity can be punished by torture and arrest, says the ICT.One of the most famous prisoners of conscience is Tibet's Panchen Lama, who vanished into Chinese custody as a young boy 25 years ago and has not been heard from since.Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, was recognized on May 14, 1995 at the age of six as the 11th Panchen Lama, the reincarnation of his predecessor, the 10th Panchen Lama.The recognition by exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama angered Chinese authorities, who promptly took the boy and his family into custody and then installed another boy, Gyaincain Norbu, as their own candidate in his place.The ranks of Tibet's political prisoners include numerous monks, scholars, educators, and artists.Beaten by policeTsering Tso had also served a period of detention in 2017 after petitioning for the rights of Tibetans to apply for passports, during which she was physically assaulted by a security officer named Jamga who kicked her in the head, face, chest, and abdomen, leaving her hospitalized for her injuries, TCHRD said.Police officers in November gave no reason for her detention following a trip she made to Thailand, Tso told RFA's Mandarin Service in an interview.There were no concrete reasons for my arrest, Tso said, adding, But while I was returning from Thailand, I had a feeling they would arrest me, and I think they had already planned this from the beginning.Finally, on Nov. 2, I was accused of violating the law by sending two message on WeChat related to issues of stability,' and I was detained for 10 days. I have no idea how my postings might have threatened stability, Tso said.A Nov. 13 announcement by the Trika county Public Security Bureau said that Tso had been charged with disseminating discussions of provocative issues on social media, adding that she would be fined and held in administrative detention for 10 days.Tsering Tso had regularly written on topics like democracy and the rule of law on her social media platforms, Dawa told RFA in an interview. But the Chinese government has always threatened people who speak up about these things.Reached for comment on Monday, a U.S. State Department spokesperson said, We continue to press the [People's Republic of China] to respect the freedom of speech and beliefs of its own people, and in particular those who seek to protect Tibet's unique religion, language, and culture.Tibetan researcher heldA Tibetan researcher at Tibet University in Tibet's regional capital Lhasa has meanwhile also been detained, with no word given as to his whereabouts since he was taken into custody in June, RFA has learned.Kunsang Gyaltsen, a student in his late 20s from Qinghai's Mangra (Chinese, Guinan) county, is thought to have been arrested for circulating booklets containing unauthorized views of Tibet's political history, a Tibetan living in exile told RFA, citing sources in the region.Chinese authorities have concealed all information about him, and despite numerous attempts by family members to learn where he is being held, there has been no response from authorities at all, RFA's source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.Pema Gyal, an analyst at TCHRD, confirmed the account of Gyaltsen's arrest and disappearance, adding that information about his current status is unavailable because his parents have been denied access to him.A formerly independent nation, Tibet was taken over and incorporated into China by force nearly 70 years ago, following which Tibet's spiritual leader the Dalai Lama and thousands of his followers fled into exile in India, and Beijing maintains a tight grip on Tibet and on Tibetan-populated regions of western Chinese provinces.Reported by Lobe Socktsang for RFA's Tibetan Service and by the Mandarin Service.

China wants to attract foreign investment to develop 5G and autonomous drivingCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 29, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 328 wordsBody       This document, prepared by China's Ministry of Commerce, covers a total of 480 sectors at national level and another 755 in the central and western regions of the country, whose development Beijing wants to promote, aiming to balance the economic growth of the inland provinces with that of the most prosperous coastal areas.In the last update of this list, 127 new sectors were added. The list goes into effect on 27 January 2021.    According to a spokesman for China's Ministry of Commerce, the priority is manufacturing and production services, to improve efficiency and industrial technologies.Among the new sectors added to the list are online education and cross-border e-commerce.There are also areas related to the covid-19 pandemic, such as the production of ventilators or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machines (ECMO), used in the life support of patients with severely injured lungs.Foreign investors who contribute capital in these sectors will be able to take advantage of "preferential policies" at tax or land use.In recent years, China has sought to promote the process of opening up its economy with this type of initiative.There is also the so-called "negative list", which covers the sectors in which the entry of foreign investment is prohibited, and which has been shortened. Currently, there are 33 sectors that are part of this list. In the face of a protracted trade war with the United States, Beijing is promoting the signing of agreements such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the world's largest free trade agreement, which includes 15 countries in the Asia-Pacific region, or the Comprehensive Investment Agreement, which is due to be signed soon with the European Union (EU).With this last agreement, the EU wants to achieve reciprocity in access to the Chinese market by European companies and increase transparency in subsidies granted by the Chinese Government to state-owned enterprises.       Load-Date: December 30, 2020End of Document

China's CRRC, Monterrey and CdMxCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 30, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 457 wordsBodyIn less than a month, Fu Chengium, MANAGING Director of the Chinese company CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive, achieved two major contracts in Mexico. The first announced in October for Monterrey for $90 million with the sale of 26 light rails, and the second for the comprehensive modernization of trains, control system and tracks of Line 1 of the Metro Collective Transport System in CdMx for a total of 32 thousand 219 million pesos.If nothing happens, on December 18, the contract will be signed on the esplanade of the Metro offices with the guarantee of compliance for 2 billion pesos. In the event that the contract is not formalized for reasons attributable to the winner, you will lose this "guarantee of seriousness" as established in the bidding bases.The economic offer of the Chinese consortium is 14 thousand 438 million pesos lower than that presented by spain's CAF, of 46 thousand 657 million, which eventually withdrew it. Faced with such a high difference, it is already mentioned among specialists that Chinese supply is dumping, once it has the support of the Chinese government both financially and in production.Corporate alstom and Bombardier did not even submit economic offer allegedly because they saw the dice loaded in favor of the Chinese company. Among the suspicious things is the information published in El Sol of Mexico where they pointed out that their French partner Thales has plants in Mexico with a thousand 400 workers when on the official latin American website he claims to have 650, and the fact that it did not matter in Mexico that congressmen from the United States denounced that CRRC is a threat to national security and the economy , and which practices anti-competitive policies.CRRC was formed in June 2015 and is the world's largest rolling stock manufacturer, above Alstom and Siemens; is a state-owned company. He has no experience in pneumatic treadmills like those required by the capital metro, and nowhere in the world has he headed a brownfield that must provide rolling stock, change signaling, maintain and change the track in one of the most important Meters in the world by the number of users and the complexity of its operation on the floor of CdMx , its seismic characteristic and the age of the track.Next roomSpain's Adolfo Domínguez, who runs Antonio Puente, officially announced that she will pay off 20 outlets in Mexico after undoing her alliance with Raúl Beyruti's GINGroup. You will stay with 110 points... BBVA reported that no agreement was reached regarding the merger with Banco Sabadell...

Mexican cartels: The Asian connectionCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 8, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 3667 wordsBodyJorge A. proudly poses at the foot of the five-star Radisson Blu, New World hotel in Shanghai in January 2016. The image footer posted on Facebook soberly describes the reason for the trip: "Chambeando walko". Jorge A. is an employee of Corporativo Escomexa, a Mexican company dedicated to the import and export of various products – in particular tequila and chemicals and agricultural products. Apparently it's cold, it's thousands of miles from his home in Culiacán, Sinaloa, Mexico. It's raining likes. Her mother, who is easy to recognize excitedly on screen, says: "Blessings look, take care of yourself and success in your efforts. I love you!! Kisses!"" Everything is carefully documented in your profile, from the poorly focused selfie to the immortalized crab dish in an overly close shot.This fast-paced business trip through Asia is accompanied by two other partners featured in numerous photos. With several weeks, Mexicans make multiple stopovers: Shanghai, Hong Kong, Japan, and finally India, where they meet Manu Gupta, an Indian businessman with whom they had already met in Hong Kong. Gupta is a director of Mondiale Mercantile Pvt Ltd, a company whose businesses are as diverse as they are vague. In addition to focusing on import and export – in areas as heterogeneous as the chemical and pharmaceutical industry, agri-food, sand and machinery – the company offers legal advice on customs procedures.The other aspect of Gupta's business was clarified two years later. On September 25, 2018, the Indian authorities arrested him in a laboratory in the city of Indore along with a Mexican and an Indian chemist. The three partners, who wore nmáscaras and gloves, were in possession of fentanyl, a powerful synthetic painkiller. Improper consumption of this substance causes thousands of overdoses worldwide. They planned to send the drug to Mexico on a commercial flight, hidden in a suitcase. In an internal report by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) of December 2018 that Forbidden Stories was able to access, Gupta – who is now in detention awaiting trial, along with the other two defendants – is identified as "alleged partner of a well-known member of the Sinaloa Cartel, who acquired chemical precursors to manufacture illicit drugs in Mexico , which were then distributed in the United States." Forbidden Stories tried to contact Manu Gupta but received no response.Pill productionComparing information disseminated by the BlueLeaks – a leak of a large amount of internal data from U.S. law enforcement published in June 2020 – Forbidden Stories and its 25 international partners investigated this Indian-registered case, which says a lot about the techniques used by Mexican cartels to dominate the juicy fentanyl market. In constant adaptation to international regulations and in search of greater profitability, lethal Mexican cartels use the same methods as any company, such as offshoring, to put them at the service of its crime multinational.Fentanyl, the new golden egg henA confidential DEA report discovered in the BlueLeaks, dating from October 2019, can be clearly read: "Data from law enforcement analyzed from 2018 to the end of February 2019 indicate that the Sinaloa Cartel has been imposed as a fentanyl producer and trafficker of this substance in the United States." Although in 2016 Joaquin was arrestedGuzman, aka "El Chapo", the historic head of this cartel, the U.S. agency notes that the business is going full throttle.Across the border, victims number in the thousands: in 2018, of the more than 67,000 overdose deaths in the United States, about half were caused by fentanyl or similar synthetic drug use; 10% more than the previous year. There is talk of an epidemic like that of heroin in the years 2000-2010, when this drug, obtained from the morphine extracted from the poppy, caused havoc in the country. Since then, Mexican cartels had been able to impose themselves: in 2016, 90% of heroin sold in the United States came from Mexico.Now the cartels are looking to the future: synthetic drugs. The Mexican 'golden triangle' (north of the country), known for its opium and marijuana crops, is being transformed by the Sinaloa Cartel. In the mountainous terrain surrounding Culiacán, sleeper fields have left room for laboratories. "In Mexico, we are one of the world's leading heroin producers, but we began to face government restrictions [the Mexican army was burning poppy crops, NDLR]. To supply that market we started to get into the opiates, which were cheaper. That's where the business was born. We started transforming the substance, making synthetics," explains a chemist hired by the Sinaloa Cartel, interviewed by Forbidden Stories.Production resultsFrom his clandestine laboratory, hidden among the trees, near Culiacán, the man explains: "For cartels it is at the top of drugs, among the most attractive. It leaves you more profit. It's just one pill per person. So, if you bring 10, 000 pills, it's ten thousand people who have to consume." On a cooking plate, mix the white powder you use to make fentanyl-based tablets with a plastic spatula. By marking them with the letter "M" they seek to imitate the tablets of oxycodone, another very addictive opiate. "This way, I know my pill is powerful and it's going to be addictive. It's what I want my user to consume and then have the need for another dose."Thus, they minimize the infrastructure and labor to obtain a very powerful drug: the profitability of fentanyl is exceptional. In its 2019 report, the DEA makes its calculations: producing a pill costs a dollar; in the United States it sells for ten dollars or more. Lottery for the Mexican cartels, Sinaloa's at the helm.A well-oiled systemUntil very recently, a large part of fentanyl sold in the United States was exported directly from China. "There were people who imported fentanyl from China, compressed the pills in their basement and then sold them online, on the darknet, retail, or made contact with local distributors to sell them on the street," explains Bryce Pardo, researcher at American think tank RAND and drug policy expert.However, the tightening of regulations at the international level and in China in 2017 and 2019 changed the rules of the game: direct sending fentanyl became more risky. An opportunity for the cartels, who envisioned the possibility of entering the market as intermediaries. "They gain good profit margins by synthesizing and refining precursors by manufacturing fentanyl in their laboratories," explains Falko Ernst, Mexico's expert at the International Crisis Group.However, China remains the leading supplier of precursors,necessary to produce synthetic drugs and drugs. The cartels therefore "established relations with China in the 1990s and 2000s," says Falko Ernst. At the time, chemical precursors were mostly used to make methamphetamines.With networks established for decades, the Sinaloa Cartel can rely on a strong infrastructure for this transition to synthetic drugs. One of the DEA notes, from the BlueLeaks, points to a highly organized circuit, which features warehouses at the border and distributors throughout the United States. Later, one of the cartel's techniques for supplying precursors is mentioned: it hires "a guy based in Culiacán, Sinaloa", who works independently, to purchase "large additional quantities of fentanyl chemical precursors directly from China".Who is the man the DEA refers to? We asked him, but the U.S. agency declined to answer, "We generally do not confirm or deny that a person or entity is or has been the subject of our investigations." Forbidden Stories found numerous matches with Jorge A., culiacán's original businessman in Sinaloa state, who poses alongside Manu Gupta with his Mexican partners in 2016 in Shanghai. According to an intelligence source in India from a Forbidden Stories partner, Jorge A. would be being investigated by U.S. authorities. Some of the activities of the company for which he works also give rise to certain questions. Relying on information from open sources and with the help of C4ADS, a think tank specialized in data analysis, journalists from the consortium discovered a network of entities connected to this Mexican company of a complexity that seems designed to erase its trace.Companies with activities that arouse suspicionOnline, Corporativo Escomexa, the company of which Jorge A. is officially the auditor, and its "innovation manager" on LinkedIn, has presented products that can be used in the manufacture of methamphetamines. You can find a trace of that on your website, but also on various B2B platforms (platform that contacts companies and suppliers.)In analyzing corporate Escomexa's trades, transactions were found between September and October 2016 that arouse suspicion. Within a month, the company received a number of pharmaceutical equipment, including a tablet pressing machine, from India. Added to this are 676 kilograms of lactose monohydrate powder, microcrystalline cellulose and copovidone. Products known to be used in the production of narcotics, in particular fentanyl.Although the latest activities of Corporativo Escomexa registered by the Panjiva platform date from October 2016, C4ADS identified a wide network of companies linked to this Mexican firm (to varying degrees), which are still active. "This network appears to be very extensive and include dozens of companies operating in both Mexico and the United States. Some of them record business activities for a short period of time; they work until a new or different company appears on the network that assumes primary responsibility for shipping," explains Michael Lohmuller, a C4ADS analyst. It seems to be the case of Corporate and Link Ram, a firm that seems to work with the company in which Jorge A. works (presents an address, an agent, suppliers, makes similar imports of products for pharmaceutical use). According to data available online, in June 2016 this company received a shipment from Mondiale Mercantile, the Indian company of Gupta, the businessman arrested for fentanyl traffic and with whom Jorge A. posed on his business trip. This one,add up the photos featuring corporate and Link Ram executives with Jorge A. and one of his partners, present during the business trip to Asia."While there was no evidence of criminal activity, the existence of links in terms of imports and exports and the commercial relations of Corporativo Escomexa S.A. de C.V. with the entities of this network, could justify a thorough investigation or point to the modus operandi of the trans-Pacific trafficking networks of fentanyl or methamphetamine," sums up Michael Lohmuller. We interviewed José R., one of the two responsible for Corporate and Link Ram, who said, "I don't know the operations of that company, I don't know that person and I don't know that supplier from India." We also tried to interview Jorge A. but never responded to our request."This is one of the main myths, there is the image that a cartel is a perfectly integrated organization," explains Falko Ernst. Cartels, including Sinaloa's, often employ independent networks specializing in logistics or money laundering. "They are the true backbone of this business," explains the researcher. Over time, "the cartel marks disappear, they are erased. But all these networks remain because they are much less visible ... they remain in some anonymity. Therefore, they are much more protected in the short to medium term, safe from market volatility."In a society corroded by corruption, everything is conimaginable in a grey area, where Mexican cartels explode cheerfully. "If you look at the impunity rate in Mexico, you'll find it's close to 90%. So you're very likely to get away with it - especially if you have relationships at the highest levels of the state. Many companies use legal facades – such as lawyers, who are the key to all this – and use impunity to get involved in criminal markets and make a lot of money," Falko Ernst sums up. In October 2020, 15 customs agents were suspended; 6 of them for collusion with organized crime. One of many examples of this endemic corruption.On the other side of the planet, Chinese precursor producers adopt similar methods; to the limit of legality, they bring a good advantage to the authorities.Always one step aheadTrade in precursors is highly regulated due to the dangers they pose. The International Narcotics Control Board (IFB) publishes a "red list" of substances under international control. In the case of fentanyl it is NPP and ANPP.The problem is that the chances of evading controls by creating other unregulated precursors are almost endless. The substance is slightly modified, but the effect remains the same. "I once heard a chemist say, 'If we really want to solve the fentanyl problem, we would have to ban carbon.' Clearly, we can't ban carbon!" explains Bryce Pardo. We call that the "bounce effect": as soon as a substance is controlled, new phentanyl precursors, similar to NPP and ANPP, are synthesized in China ready to be sent and exploited. "China possesses the human capacity that is required. We're talking about chemicals with PhDs in synthetic and organic chemistry that easily know how to do it."To combat this, THE JIFE included numerous substances in its list of "under surveillance" products, called ISSL. It contains products that are not legally controlled but could be used illegally. The IFB has no competence to restrict its use, so in theory it has the goodwill of companies and the controls of the authorities. In thepractice, a simple Google search is enough to get an idea of the magnitude of the problem.In just a few clicks, by typing the reference of certain fentanyl precursors, we arrive on the Pinterest social network. Between wedding moodboards and user-published decoration trends, we find advertisements from Chinese companies that offer fentanyl precursors for export, some aimed in particular at customers in Mexico. We found the substance 4-AP, which is listed in the ISSL and has recently been under control in the United States. According to the DEA, the 4-AP only serves one thing: produce fentanyl. Posing as a Mexican customer, Forbidden Stories contacted three companies; they all offered us substances known for their use in opioid synthesis – and we don't even need to mention our identity or the name of a company.One of the sellers, particularly solicitous, offered us substances similar to the 4-AP that are still for sale; he even proposed to us to use a "special line" to Mexico. First he sent us photos and videos of a precursor recorded in the foreground (a whitish powder); then told us about his famous special line: "We have bought from Mexican customs personnel in which we have full confidence; this helps us with all our shipments to Mexico. So you don't have to worry about customs." On another occasion he explained that one of his "big" customers in Mexico was his own line, which uses cargo planes to deliver the precursors. "When the goods arrive in Mexico, they use their own connections to pick it up." Resuming his words: "Is there anything in this world that money cannot do?"Bryce Pardo sums up: "Our drug control laws are based on a very old system, dating back to the 1961 United Nations convention and focusing on three plants: cannabis, coca and numbness. Things have changed a lot in the last ten, fifteen years, since the pharmaceutical sector grew in China, to the point that we can no longer keep up with the designation of substances."China has tightened its rules. To evade them, some Chinese have chosen to relocate some of their activities; they are transferred to countries where they know that control is less stringent, such as India. In another internal DEA report describing Gupta's arrest, the agency explains that the Indian businessman worked with a man living in China. In 2019 the DEA suspected: "This person of Chinese nationality continues to send precursor chemicals to Mexican cartels for the manufacture of methamphetamine, analogous to fentanyl and its derivatives; also fentanyl already manufactured." When asked about the report, the DEA spokesman explained that he did not know and had not seen the above-mentioned report.Richest Group: in all respects, almost fine"There is a force that can promote the development of history. A power that can change the world. Richest Group changes the world with its products and services," you hear with epic music in the background. This is how the Chinese company Richest Group advertises in a spot that looks more like the trailer for a Hollywood movie than a corporate video. At first glance, the group dedicated to the import and export of chemicals and food additives, led by Kevin Dai, seems unimpeachable. Its main subsidiary, Shanghai Ruizheng, even has a note of 4 diamonds (out of 6) on the Chinese virtual trading platform Alibaba. The company stresses that it has such prestigious customers as Samsung, LG, Canon and boasts about exporting its products worldwide.Soon the varnish falls: a deeper investigation on the internet revealed what's behind the stage. In October 2019 Shanghai Ruizheng sold in Alibaba known forerunners ofuncontrolled fentanyl. On one of its websites was the 4-AP (the famous substance now restricted in the United States). On Facebook we discovered the profile of a seller, Alia Yang, who clearly showed that she belonged to the company and offered these fentanyl precursors, geolocating various promotional publications in Mexico, to have greater visibility to users in that country. "New lot, enough stock, don't miss it," can be read in a May 2019 post.A few weeks ago, an organization chart could still be found on the company's website, on a page dedicated to the Richest Group structure. At the center of the graph, among the group's other two Chinese subsidiaries, was Mondiale Mercantile Pvt Ltd, Gupta's company, the Indian businessman accused of working with the Sinaloa Cartel and suspected by the DEA, was working with the Chinese. The American agency did not answer our questions about the shanghai-based company.A consortium journalist interviewed Kevin Dai, director of Richest Group, who denied that the group was linked to fentanyl production: "Our company has neither produced nor produced fentanyl or substances related to its manufacture, we respect the regulations." He also said he was not aware of Alia Yang's Facebook posts. According to the entrepreneur, Yang left the company months before we contacted him (November 10, 2020). In addition, it asserted that Richest Group never got to work with Mondiale Mercantile Pvt Ltd., Gupta's company, even if the Indian company appears at the center of the group's organization chart. "They said they could help us enter the Indian market and proposed to us to work with them. So we put the photos on our website to show that we're a great company." Hours after the interview, Gupta's company disappeared from the organization chart; Alia Yang completely cleaned her Facebook profile, changed her name and her promotional posts disappeared. On November 17, Richest Group closed the branch of the group installed in the offices where it had received Forbidden Stories weeks earlier.An eternal defeat to organized crimeFaced with precursor trafficking, the Chinese government seems to find it increasingly difficult to effectively control the country's extensive pharmaceutical industry. "Until a couple of years ago there were about eight different authorities involved in the development of industry regulatory regulations. Sometimes it was hard to know who was watching," explains Bryce Pardo. Efforts have been made in recent years to better control the market, including new regulations. In the particular case of Richest Group, China's National Narcotics Control Commission (NNCC) explained to Forbidden Stories that it had already asked the Chinese company to be careful with the products it sold, as some of them could be used by drug traffickers to make drugs. Despite these recent changes, some regulations appear inadequate in proportion to the scale of the problem. According to Information from Bryce Pardo, when inspectors are going to conduct a "surprise inspection" they must announce it to companies 72 hours earlier. "If you're making fentanyl, you're going to clean up and change everything to make it look like you're making an ibuprofen formula for babies," the researcher says.From fentanyl to new psychoactive substances there is only one step. Or, according to Bryce Pardo, a simple Google search: "Now that everything is online it's very easy for a chemist in China to go to the U.S. Patent Office website or google new drugs researched for medical purposes." A trend confirming the office's latest reportUnited Nations On Drugs and Crime (UNODC) on this issue: "recently there appears to be a shift in the market from synthetic opiates to new and more varied classes of chemicals." Criminal organizations adapt to the tightening of controls, the report explains.Months before this research was published, we called alia Yang's number that was online. The saleswoman no longer worked for Kevin Dai, but for Shanghai Talent Chemical, a similar company created by an entrepreneur who belonged to the Richest Group. We were answered by a "Lucky" (although then on WhatsApp a photo of Alia appeared along with her name and before, Alia had confirmed to us that that was her number). This time no fentanyl precursor; Lucky offered us a new product, Xylazine, a powerful tranquilizer for horses that is not under control and is increasingly present in cases of overdose in the United States, often mixed with fentanyl.When we expressed our fear of aroused suspicion, the seller did not immote and proposed, for shipping, to change the name of the tranquilizer for veterinary use: "Some customers ask us to say that it is creatine, potassium cinamate or white pigment. The customer decides."Load-Date: December 9, 2020End of Document

China accused of spying on cell phones of tens of thousands of U.S. citizensCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 15, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 370 wordsBodyAn investigation by a communications security expert concluded that China used telephone networks in the Caribbean to monitor US mobile phone users, especially between 2018 and this year. Tens of thousands of people will have been affected - enough for the act to be classified as "espionage." According to the information Gary Miller made available to The Guardian, the alleged attacks have allowed China to target, intercept and locate telephone communications of U.S. citizens, exploiting vulnerabilities in the country's technological infrastructure."Government agencies and Congress have known about the vulnerabilities of mobile networks for years," Miller told The Guardian. "The security recommendations have not been followed and are not enough to stop attackers," he warned.According to the expert, who worked at security firm Mobileum before founding Exigent Media (which specializes in preventing cyberattacks), China has used a carrier controlled by its own state - China Unicom - to illegitimately target signals to the mobile phones of U.S. citizens, often traveling abroad. These signals, imperceptible to the user, are usually used for normal mobile communications processes, such as connecting two mobile phones or accessing roaming.Miller focused his research on signs of these that had been "disallowed" by the GSM Association, an international association representing most of the world's telephone communications companies. "No one in the industry wants the public to know the severity of these surveillance attacks. I want the public to know," he added.The Guardian, China's EMBASSY in the UK commented on the allegations: "The Chinese government's position on cybersecurity is consistent and clear. We are firmly against cyber attacks of any kind. China is a strong advocate of cybersecurity."James Lewis, director of the Strategic Technologies Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), told The Guardian: "We have an illusion of security when we talk on our phones. People don't realize that we're about a constant espionage attack on everything that's connected to a network. This is just another example of a very aggressive and sophisticated campaign of this kind."Load-Date: December 16, 2020End of Document

China investigation unsettles investorsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 29, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 275 wordsBodyAlibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a second day of frantic sales among China's largest technology companies, driven by fears that antitrust scrutiny will extend beyond Jack Ma's empire, and impact the country's most powerful companies.Alibaba and its three biggest rivals - Tencent Holdings Ltd., food delivery giant Meituan and JD.com Inc. - have lost nearly $200 billion in two sessions since Thursday, when regulators revealed an investigation into alleged monopolistic practices at Ma's firm.This marked the formal beginning of the Communist Party's repression not only against Alibaba but possibly also against the broader and increasingly influential technology sector."It is very difficult to predict the outcome of the Chinese government's ongoing investigation of Alibaba and other large consumer internet platforms," Colin Sebastian, Baird's analyst, wrote in a note, who downste from $325 to $285 its indicative price for Alibaba shares listed in the United States, introducing "uncertainty around government oversight and the possibility of direct regulatory action next year."China's central bank ordered Ma's other online titan, Ant Group Co., to return to its payment service roots and restructure adjacent companies, ranging from insurance to money funds, which led to the possibility of eventual division.Having been hailed as the icons of China's economic and technological supremacy, Alibaba and his compatriots now face increasing pressure from speed-conscious regulators with which they are accumulating influence in sensitive areas such as media and education and gaining influence on the daily lives of hundreds of millions of people.Load-Date: December 30, 2020End of Document

AT PERMANENT SUBCOMMITTEE ON INVESTIGATIONS HEARING, PORTMAN HIGHLIGHTS NEED FOR USPS AND CBP TO FULLY IMPLEMENT BIPARTISAN STOP ACTStates News ServiceDecember 10, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 2171 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Ohio Senator Rob Portman:Today, as Chair of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) delivered opening remarks in a hearing entitled "Combatting the Opioid Crisis: Oversight of the Implementation of the STOP Act." The hearing followed up on Senator Portman's bipartisan Synthetics Trafficking and Overdose Prevention (STOP) Act, which became law in 2018. The STOP Act is working to help reduce the supply of fentanyl shipped into the United States through the U.S. Postal Service, and the hearing focused on how well federal agencies are implementing the requirements.As the Chairman and Ranking Member of PSI, Portman and Carper conducted an 18-month investigation into this issue and released a stunning bipartisan report detailing how drug traffickers exploit vulnerabilities in our international mail system to easily ship synthetic drugs like fentanyl from China into the United States through the U.S. Postal Service. The STOP Act closes this loophole by requiring advance electronic data on all inbound international packages, including packages coming from China. Starting January 1, 2021, the STOP Act requires the Postal Service to refuse any inbound international packages without advance electronic data.A transcript of Senator Portman's opening statement can be found below and a video can be found here."This hearing will come to order. I see the witnesses, virtually, on a computer screen. I see my colleague, Senator Carper is here and I know we have some other colleagues who have checked in this morning already virtually and we'll be hearing from them. We are here today to follow-up on the implementation of legislation called the STOP Act. This was a direct result of an investigation by this committee, and a couple of hearings, and some good work that was done to be able to stop this deadly fentanyl from coming into our country."I want to start by thanking my Ranking Member. Senator Carper, this will be our last hearing together, I'm told, as part of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. And I want you to know that over the past four years, you and your staff have been productive partners as we have undertaken a number of really important topics and had some success in passing legislation as well. We've looked at the treatment and care of unaccompanied alien kids by the federal government; we have investigated the security of personal and financial data held by both private companies and the federal government, and come out with strong recommendations; we have looked at loopholes in our sanctions program exploited by Russian oligarchs."Recently, we've done ground-breaking work on the influence of the Chinese government here in the United States, and this has included a review of the threat to academic freedom caused by having a Confucius Institute, say, on a university campus, but also we've exposed how China has systematically taken U.S taxpayer-funded research and IP to advance its own military and economic interests through these talent recruitment programs, like the Thousand Talents Plan. And we've written good legislation, bipartisan legislation that deals with this very serious issue. And we've looked at the national security risks associated with Chinese government-owned telecom firms licensed by the FCC to operate in the United States. So, I want to thank you for your continuing your bipartisan partnership and continuing the tradition of this Subcommittee, which is to really dig deep into serious issues and get something done, I would say on even a nonpartisan basis."Today's hearing is the continuation of our work in this Subcommittee on the federal government's efforts to crack down on the fentanyl coming into our country, and more broadly to deal with the fentanyl and opioid crisis that has seized our entire country and every state represented in this chamber. We started with a hearing in May of 2017 examining how illicit fentanyl, a synthetic opioid 50 times more powerful than heroin, how it is being shipped into the United States through the U.S. mail."We found out that, unbelievably, almost all of this was coming through the mail system, into our communities, from China. And it was the number one killer and remains the number one killer. We conducted a six-month investigation into the issue then, and in January of 2018, Senator Carper and I issued a bipartisan report and held a hearing that detailed how online drug dealers in China were exploiting a loophole in international mail. That loophole allowed packages to be shipped into the United States with no identifying information or so-called "advance electronic data," AED -- which we will hear a lot about today, and if -- and only if --the package was shipped through the U.S. Postal Service. In other words, if it went through another channel, it had to have this AED, which is very important to law enforcement to be able to stop the fentanyl and other contraband from coming in."Our report described how during our investigation Subcommittee staff emailed with six websites located in China that advertised fentanyl for sale on the open internet. When asked, all six of these websites told us they preferred to ship through the international arm of the Postal Service because of this loophole. In fact, one of the websites actually guaranteed delivery of this deadly fentanyl into our communities, but only if the fentanyl was shipped through the Postal Service. So our own federal government was complicit in providing this poison into our communities."These online drug dealers in China preferred the Postal Service for a specific reason. In the aftermath of 9/11, Congress required private express carriers to collect AED on all packages being shipped into the United States. This is the FedExes, the DHLs, and so on. This data on the package's shipper, recipient, weight, and contents allows the Customs and Border Protection folks to identify and target high-risk packages containing illegal items, including fentanyl. But Congress punted on whether the Postal Service should be required to collect the same data. So after 9/11, they said to, again, DHL, UPS, FedEx and others 'you've got to collect it' but they said with regard to the Postal Service, 'we're going to ask the Treasury Department, the Treasury Secretary and the Postmaster General to make a decision to issue a report if the same AED requirements should be imposed on the Postal Service.' That never happened."This left the Postal Service -- and the mail it carries -- vulnerable to all kinds of contraband, including this deadly fentanyl. By failing to require the Postal Service to collect AED like private express carriers, Congress created a national security risk in the roughly 500 million international packages entering the United States each year. 500 million each year. This vulnerability of course was exploited by Chinese online drug dealers to guarantee delivery of illicit fentanyl into the United States through the Postal Service. Based on the recommendation of our report, in October of 2018, our Synthetics Trafficking and Overdose Prevention Act, or STOP Act, was passed by Congress and signed into law by the president. The STOP Act requires AED on all packages entering the United States starting next year, three weeks from now. So remember, this was back in 2018, October of 2018, we passed the law. We say by January 1, 2021 coming up a few weeks from now, you've got to have 100 percent AED of packages coming into America. Just as, again, what is already required by the other carriers."Spain, France, and Germany have followed our lead and announced that packages shipped to those countries without AED will be delayed or refused and returned to the sender starting on January 1, 2021. In fact, our legislation is consistent with the legislation that the EU put out generally, the European Union. But specifically, Spain, France and Germany have followed our lead and said as of January 1st, can't accept these packages unless they have AED on them. This January 1st deadline was based on a generous timeline, again, that gave the Postal Service, CBP -- Customs and Border Protection -- and the State Department over two years to prepare."The STOP Act also set other milestones for the three agencies here today. These agencies failed to meet any of the important deadlines set out in the legislation. So the law is passed, we set some deadlines, I think they were reasonable, they were well thought out. Not a single important deadline was actually met. The STOP Act required the Postal Service and CBP to conduct a Joint Strategic Plan for the management of AED by December 23, 2018, two-years ago. The plan was not submitted to Congress until March 29, 2019."The STOP Act required CBP to finalize regulations regarding how packages would be dealt with that had no AED by October 2019. Those regulations weren't even submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review until August of 2020. We were told those regulations have now been passed back to the Customs and Border Protection CBP -- people with comments, but we still don't know when they will be final. I hope we'll learn that today. And the STOP Act required the Postal Service to collect AED on 70 percent of all packages and 100 percent of packages from China by the end of 2018, so we're talking about way back in January of 2019. Yet in January 2019, the Postal Service had AED only on about 57 percent of packages from all foreign posts, not 70 percent, and only 76 percent of packages from China, not 100 percent."The State Department also has a role. Through efforts at the Universal Postal Union, of which the United States is a member, along with all foreign posts, the State Department leads the efforts to collect AED from our foreign partners. It is true that the rate of international packages with AED has improved over the past few years since the implementation of the STOP Act, and I appreciate that. And it has made a big difference and it's saved a lot of lives, and in fact less fentanyl is coming into the country because of that. Three years ago, only 26 percent of international packages shipped through the Postal Service had AED. By January 2020 it was 67 percent that's a nice improvement. Unfortunately, during COVID that amount has actually dropped off to about 54 percent. So we were up to 67 percent, now we're down to 54 percent in October of this year. We were making good progress and recently we have seen a drop-off. We want to know why."As noted, on January 1st, the Postal Service and CBP will be required to refuse any international package without AED. This means that because deadlines weren't met, a substantial number of packages will be turned away starting on January 1, 2021. I'm told there's about 150,000 packages a day expected to be coming in during that time period. Of concern, some of the countries failing to provide AED on the majority of their packages are some of our closest allies: the United Kingdom and Australia to name a few. We need to tighten up on that."The number of seizures of illicit fentanyl in inbound international mail is down, as I said, and that's good news. According to Mr. Cintron's testimony, today, dramatically down. And again, we're very pleased to see that. That means more lives saved, fewer people falling into addiction. Fentanyl is the deadliest of the drugs. It seems the threat of the STOP Act and the increased ability to target packages containing illegal items have worked. However, I understand that seizures of illicit opioids have shifted to the domestic mail stream, mainly in packages coming from locations near the Southwest border. We have reason to believe that Mexico continues to be a conduit for fentanyl and in fact some of it is actually being produced there now, partly because of the STOP Act. The way that traffickers send it has been shifting, not to come directly into our postboxes here in the United States and to people's homes, but to go through Mexico."However, I do understand that these packages coming from locations near the Southwest border are probably being brought across the border first. So I hope we'll hear today from how the U.S. Postal Service and the Customs and Border Protection folks are dealing with this new threat, including ensuring the safety of our mail carriers. So, we've got a lot to talk about at today's hearing. We need to understand why none of the milestones Congress established in the STOP Act were met. We need to understand how the Postal Service and the Customs and Border Protection folks plan to deal with the packages with AED starting three weeks from now. And we need to know what efforts the State Department is taking at the Universal Postal Union to encourage other countries to provide AED on its packages."I appreciate the witnesses being here today and I look forward to hearing their testimony. With that, I'll turn to our Ranking Member, Senator Carper."###Load-Date: December 10, 2020End of Document

The last chapter was lived today, when the Department of Justice filed an appeal with the aim of enforcing a ban on TikTok decreed by the representative, who argues - without evidence - that the application uses its users' data to spy on Beijing's favor and encourage misinformation in networks. These are the keys to the case.Trump's accusationsThe representative allegedly banned the use of the platform for digital security reasons. According to his accusations, Tik Tok collects data without asking users. However, the company had managed to stay afloat when that ban was rejected earlier this month by district judge Carl Nichols and in a side case filed in the state of Pennsylvania.See more: TikTok ban is coming up in the US. Here's what we know about an agreementWhat the judge saidNichols argued in his opinion that TikTok's lawyers demonstrated that Commerce probably exceeded his authority by trying to prohibit social network activity on local territory and "acted arbitrarily and capriciously by not considering obvious alternatives."The White House reactsFor its part, the White House states that TikTok, whose parent company is China's ByteDance, is a risk to national security due to possible ties with the Beijing government.Popular with teenagers to share their short videos and usually a funny tone, TikTok has repeatedly defended against accusations about data transfers to the Chinese government, arguing that it stores user information on servers in the United States and Singapore.The platform will also have to appear in U.S. courts by an August 14 presidential decree requiring ByteDance to sell its U.S. operations to a local company.Load-Date: December 30, 2020End of Document

U.S.A. Attorney's Office files charges against Zoom executive for censoring Tiananmen videosCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 19, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 395 wordsBody    MADRID, 19 (EUROPA PRESS)   The U.S. Attorney's Office has filed charges against a zoom video calling company executive on Friday for allegedly censoring videos and meetings to mark the anniversary of the demonstrations against the Chinese regime in 1989 Tiananmen Square.   Xinjian Jin, who lives in China and is also known as Julien Jin, has been accused of entering meetings with other workers using an alias and profile picture showing something related to terrorism or child pornography, which enabled the platform to close the event online, according to 'The New York Times'.   In this way, he managed to get at least four calls that were commemorating the anniversary of this protest depicted in the global collective memory by the photo of the young man facing only the tanks in the square and whose repression is estimated to have killed hundreds of people.   Investigators accuse Jin of being the liaison between the company and the Chinese government, so he faces conspiracy charges, although being in his native country cannot be stopped by US authorities.   Zoom has assured in a statement that he has fired Jin for violating his internal rules and will conduct an investigation.   The company has also noted that all platform calls are encrypted and that workers in China can no longer access the company's global network.   Accusations of censorship of Chinese companies are not new in the United States, as the TikTok social network faced similar accusations after a user denounced the closure of her account for talking about the 're-education' camps in which the Chinese government is recruiting the Uighur Muslim minority in Xinjiang province , as denounced by international organizations and countries such as the United States itself.INCREASED TENSIONS WITH CHINA   This case has been announced at the same time that Commerce registered 60 Chinese companies in the 'Entity List', meaning that every purchase they make of U.S. technology must be approved by the U.S. government.   In addition, US President Donald Trump has signed a law that could trigger in the medium term the exclusion of Chinese companies from U.S. stock markets.   Trump's presidency has been marked by the trade war with the Asian giant, and while a change in forms is expected, President-elect Joe Biden's mandate is not expected to mean an aperturistic stance toward Beijing.Load-Date: December 20, 2020End of Document

Democratic Party of Georgia: AJC - Perdue Is 'Proud' of His Years of Work Outsourcing Jobs as China Connections Come 'Under The Microscope'Targeted News ServiceDecember 19, 2020 Saturday 9:10 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 627 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: ATLANTA, Georgia BodyThe Democratic Party of Georgia issued the following news release:As the Atlanta Journal-Constitution put Senator David Perdue "under the microscope for his own connections to China" leading Dollar General's "aggressive expansion into China" and using Hong Kong as "a base to build an Asian operation," a campaign spokesman touted that Perdue was "proud" of his years spent in China outsourcing jobs.While "fearmongering" about China has been a "central theme" of Perdue's campaign, a HuffPost report revealed that Perdue's new biographical video is "nearly identical" to the one from 2014 except he deleted mention of his years of experience in Asia, even removing a picture of him and his wife at the Great Wall of China."Perdue is so out of touch with hardworking Georgians that his campaign brags about his toxic record of outsourcing jobs for corporations during his years in Hong Kong while Georgians are out of work amid a pandemic," said Braxton Brewington, spokesman for the Democratic Party of Georgia. "While Perdue may be proud of his years sending American jobs overseas, Georgians certainly aren't proud of Perdue."AJC: David Perdue And The China Connection https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/the-jolt-david-perdue-and-the-china-connection/NIYVQNEP6FGZRCVP4XKTEKPARQ/"U.S. Sen. David Perdue's latest digital ad claims Democrat Jon Ossoff is "China bought." The opening female narrator - U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee - accuses him of working for a "Chinese Communist government-owned company." Which is not true.""Another voice - Dana Perino of Fox News - quickly theorizes that Ossoff is susceptible to Chinese subterfuge -- as a photo of U.S. Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Cal., was displayed.""Perdue went even further on Monday. During a personal appearance on Fox News, the senator said that he is running "against a guy who worked directly for the Chinese Communist Party in China." Again, this is a falsehood. You can find the actual facts here.""We have had a sitting U.S. senator falsely accuse people of having communist ties before. It did not end well for the senator, or the country.""The Perdue ad, released Thursday, comes days after The Huffington Post reported that Perdue's new biographical campaign spot looks just like the 2014 version -- except that Perdue has erased the two years he worked in Hong Kong for Sara Lee. Also gone from the new bio video -- a photo of him and his wife Bonnie on the Great Wall of China.""Perdue and his allies have tried to tar Ossoff over his ties to China throughout the campaign, and the attacks have only intensified in the runup to the Jan. 5 runoff to decide control of the U.S. Senate.""But Perdue could come under the microscope for his own connections to China. When he was chief executive of the Dollar General chain, he led the chain store's aggressive expansion into China. And while working at Sara Lee, he used Hong Kong as a base to build an Asian operation from the "ground up."""The Chinese provinces of Guangdong and Guangzhou, important labor pools, border Hong Kong. Anyone who was doing business in mainland China in the early 1990s, just as today, was doing business with someone who had connections to the Chinese Communist Party. Just like today.""His spokesman John Burke said he's "always been proud to talk about those achievements" -- while claiming Ossoff has tried to conceal his ties to China.""Ossoff spokeswoman Miryam Lipper referred to Perdue's efforts as "one of the most laughable smear campaigns in Georgia history."""It's embarrassing how wildly desperate David Perdue looks as he tries to lie himself out of this losing campaign, especially when he is the one with deep ties to China," she said."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7331428 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: December 19, 2020End of Document

Briefing.com: Story Stocks (R)Briefing.comDecember 30, 2020 Wednesday 1:50 PM ESTCopyright 2020 Briefing.com, Inc. All rights reserved.This content is provided to LexisNexis by Comtex News Network, Inc.Length: 1624 wordsBodyStory Stocks (R)Updated: 30-Dec-20Quotes at time of story, top stories today: 12:20 | 10:57 | 09:5212:20 ETJD.com looking to cash out through another spin-off as China cracks down on tech giants: JD.com (JD), the second largest eCommerce company in China, has been very active recently as the company looks to shed business units and raise billions in new capital. Earlier this month, the Alibaba (BABA) competitor spun-off its healthcare segment through a $3.5 bln IPO in Hong Kong. Meanwhile, reports have surfaced that the company is aiming to launch an IPO for its burgeoning logistics segment in a deal that could fetch $3 bln or more in capital.Adding to the flurry of activity, JD disclosed in a filing this morning that its Board of Directors has authorized the company to explore a potential spin-off of the JD Cloud and AI business to Jingdong Digits. JD, which owns a significant minority stake in Jingdong Digits, would receive additional equity interest in that entity.The obvious question is, what's driving this purge in business segments?Similar to the U.S. government, which has recently filed antitrust suits against Facebook (FB) and Alphabet's Google (GOOG), the Chinese government is cracking down on large technology companies that it believes have amassed too much power. This scrutiny was thrust into the spotlight last month when Chinese regulators forced BABA founder and Ant Group backer, Jack Ma, to shelve Ant Group's IPO. This action was followed by an order for Ant Group to focus on its core payment services, possibly setting the stage for the fintech company to shed its insurance and money management business lines.Since then, it appears the Chinese government has tightened the screws further after it was revealed that regulators are investigating monopolistic practices at BABA. This revelation has cast fears that the scope of China's investigations will extend beyond BABA to other technology leaders, including JD.Based on this turn of events, a reasonable conclusion is that JD is attempting to get ahead of potential government actions/penalties by selling off non-core assets. It might be more lucrative for JD to cash in on these businesses now before the company is forced to by the government.While JD doesn't disclose specific financial information for its logistics or cloud/AI segments, it's clear that these are high-growth generators. JD's "New Business" segment houses its logistics services and technology initiatives. In 3Q20, the New Services segment achieved revenue growth of 94% to RMB5.88 bln, easily outpacing the 27% growth for its core Retail business.The strong growth should spur plenty of interest from investors, while the sale of these assets will also allow JD to focus on its main retail operations. There is still plenty of room for growth in the eCommerce arena due to the ongoing logistical developments of smaller towns in China. These once underserved markets are now viable service areas for JD, providing the company with an enduring catalyst.10:57 ETKornit Digital as 2021 Stock Idea: Good play on the industry shift to digital textiles:With the new year upon us, we have been publishing profiles on Investment Ideas for 2021. We have posted reports on AMD, WDC, LVS, SPTN, CCL, and MGNI. Today we wanted to revive a name that we have been following for years: Kornit Digital (KRNT). We profiled KRNT as a 2019 idea at $18.73 and it's now trading near $90, so it has been a big mover since then. We are more hesitant about highlighting it at these levels as an idea for 2021, but the fundamentals of the story remain intact.Kornit Digital is an Israel-based supplier of digital printing systems for the garment, apparel, and textile industries. Kornit provides digital printing systems, inks, consumables, software, and after-sales support.What draws us to it as an idea for 2021?The vast majority of printed textile industry output is still made using analog print methods (screen printing, carousels, rotary screen printers). Digital textile printing is attractive because it's more flexible. A full image or design can be printed on a garment or cut fabric in one manufacturing step as compared to the multiple steps required in an analog printing process. Also, the technique allows for short run production that can be modified quickly if garments are not selling. This reduces inventory risk. A key part of the story is Kornit's close relationship with its largest customer, Amazon (AMZN). AMZN has a long-standing partnership with Kornit to power its Merch by Amazon services. The two companies recently expanded their partnership wherein Kornit issued warrants to Amazon for 8% of its shares outstanding. In exchange, Amazon committed to buying products and services from Kornit totaling $400 mln over the next five years. Beyond Amazon, KRNT is engaged in large scale expansion projects with key customers like Stakes, Printful, and TSC. KRNT also has a unique partnership for integrated on-demand fulfillment for Delta Apparel and Hot Topic. Gear for Sports, owned by Hanesbrand (HBI), is another key customer that has expanded its relationship with Kornit. Kornit has also been innovative on the product front. Digital printing on cotton T-shirts has always been easy. However, polyester has been a more tricky material to work with, as colors printed on it never seem to come out as hoped. KRNT launched the industry's first digital, industrial process for high-quality printing on polyester. This is a big deal because polyester is the second largest category in the overall T-shirt market. Kornit called this a "game-changer", and we tend to agree.Buying a textile printing company is not the most exciting idea. However, it's an interesting opportunity as digital printing is just starting to scratch the surface, and KRNT is the largest player in this space. We always like a story in which a company is a play on an emerging trend in an industry. CEO Ronen Samuel summed it up well, saying earlier this year, "The business is on fire -- fashion companies are moving online and to textile printing on demand," according to Israeli newspaper Haaretz.Kornit is right on the verge of scaling up. EPS is expected to grow from $0.19 in 2020 to $0.87 in 2021 and on to $1.52 in 2022. As you can see, that's some nice growth. We also like Kornit's recent expansion of its deal with AMZN and the fact that AMZN is an equity stakeholder. A stop loss limit in the 15-20% area makes sense, but we like the risk/reward within those parameters.09:52 ETAstraZeneca keeps market rally healthy after attaining emergency use authorization in the UK: AstraZeneca's (AZN) COVID-19 vaccine, AZD1222, received authorization to be supplied on an emergency basis from the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). This authorization comes on the heels of Moderna (MRNA) and Pfizer (PFE)/BioNTech (BNTX) gaining stamps of approval earlier this month when the FDA granted emergency use for their vaccines. Along with positive stimulus package developments, these vaccine approvals and initial rollouts have provided the impetus for the stock market's rally to all-time highs as investors anticipate better economic conditions in the new year.AZN and partner Oxford University have experienced a bumpier path to emergency use approval than either MRNA or the PFE/BNTX team. In late November, AZN disclosed that a mistake was made regarding dosages during the clinical trial. Instead of two full doses, some trial participants were accidentally given one half dose and one full dose of the vaccine.Interestingly, the half-dose regimen achieved a 90% efficacy rate, which was much stronger than the 62% efficacy rate for the two full doses. The discrepancy seems counter-intuitive, and AZN hasn't provided detailed analysis to explain the difference.The dosing error pushed AZN's timeline back because a new study needed to be conducted in which the half-dose was administered intentionally to confirm the results.For now, the MHRA has approved two full doses of the vaccine. The lower efficacy rate of this regimen is a popular talking point, especially when stacked up against the ~95% efficacy rate for the vaccines from PFE/BNTX and MRNA. However, AZN CEO Pascal Soriot tried to ease this concern, stating, "We think we have figured out the winning formula and how to get efficacy that, after two doses, is up there with everybody else. I can't tell you more because we will publish at some point."Furthermore, AZN's vaccine has one distinct advantage: it's easier to transport and store because it can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. In contrast, the vaccine from PFE/BNTX is recommended to be stored at -70 Celsius.The simplified logistics should make delivery quick and seamless to the UK government, which ordered 100 mln doses. When combined with the purchase of 30 mln doses from PFE, there will be enough for two doses for the entire UK population.It's important to note that AZN's vaccine has not received approval of any kind in the rest of Europe. Noel Wathion, the Deputy Executive Director of the European Medicines Authority (EMA), commented yesterday that European regulators have not received enough data about the vaccine to warrant a conditional marketing license. In fact, AZN has not formally applied for a license, making it unlikely that the vaccine will gain EU approval in January.The main takeaway today, however, is that emergency approval in the UK represents another step forward in containing virus spread and in ultimately overcoming the virus.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: December 30, 2020End of Document

Brazil supports U.S. principles on network security in new gesture against HuaweiCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 10, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 872 wordsBodyIn a new gesture against Huawei's participation in the future 5G market, the Government Jair Bolsonaro declared support for the principles of the Clean Network, an American initiative on network security that aims to limit the Chinese presence in the sector.The announcement took place in Brasilia during a visit by U.S. State Department Undersecretary of Economic Growth, Energy and environment, Keith Krach."Brazil supports the principles contained in the U.S. Clean Network proposal, including the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), aimed at promoting, in the context of 5G and other new technologies, a safe, transparent and compatible environment with democratic values and fundamental freedoms," said Ambassador Pedro Miguel Costa e Silva Secretary of Bilateral and Regional Negotiations in the Americas. , speaking alongside the American diplomat.Clean Network is the name of the American plan to exclude the Chinese giant from 5G technology infrastructure in several countries – the auction in Brazil is scheduled for next year.Krach pointed out that several countries around the globe endorse the principles of the Clean Network, but that Brazil is the first Latin American to formally endorse the alliance's values.According to industry interlocutors, the principles of the Clean Network are commitments that countries promise to follow in the area of network security. Thus, Brazil's support does not mean huawei's ban, but is a relevant signal that the government intends to follow this path in the future.The State Department does not use half words to define the goals of the initiative. On its website, U.S. diplomacy says the Clean Network is an approach to protecting citizens' privacy and sensitive information from companies from "aggressive intrusions of evil actors such as the Chinese Communist Party.?U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said hours before the announcement that he had received information from aides that Brazil supports the plan to exclude Huawei from 5G technology structures and, without giving details, added that he hopes to sign a memorandum on the topic "in the near future," although Brazilian officials do not guarantee that a decision has already been made.Pompeo said he got the news through Krach."I have heard from him in the last few hours that the Brazilian government supports the principles of the Clean Network and I am confident that we will sign a memorandum of understanding in the near future. I want to thank Brazil and its leaders for doing this," Pompeo said.Economy Minister Paulo Guedes said on Tuesday that there is no decision made on the issue, but admitted that it takes into account warnings from countries such as the U.S. and the U.S., which want to block China.Late last month, Brazil's ambassador to Washington, Nestor Forster, said decisions on the auction of the new technology in the country would not be made until early next year.The main u.S. goal is to ban or at least limit the Chinese company's participation in the auction of frequency in Brazil on the grounds that Huawei passes on sensitive information to the Chinese government, which threatens Brazil's data security and cooperation with the U.S.The Donald Trump administration has promised to offer credit, through official agencies, for Brazil's telecommunications giants to acquire components from Huawei's competitors.Behind the scenes, however, representatives of Brazil's telecommunications sector say that companies have little interest in buying equipment with financing, because most of the current 4G network is equipped with Huawei components —Ericsson and Nokia also already participate.To make the transition to 5G, it would be necessary to change this device, something that would cost much more than the American fund itself has available.The press statement at Itamaraty also served for the launch of a trilateral alliance between the governments of the U.S., Brazil and Japan.The so-called Japan-U.S.-Brazil trilateral dialogue is expected to defend common values of these countries in Asia and Latin America, but its main objective is to create another forum to counter China.The United States, globally, and Japan, in regional, are currently the biggest antagonists of the Chinese government.According to the ambassador, the dialogue will discuss regional issues, economic prosperity and democratic governance.The two countries also announced on Tuesday a forum for cooperation in the environmental area.  The U.S. diplomat's trip to Brazil comes amid the tumultuous U.S. post-election process, in which Democrat Joe Biden was the winner of the election but the current president, Donald Trump, refused to acknowledge the result. Without evidence, the current representative said there had been fraud in the electoral dispute.Pompeo himself gave a controversial statement on Tuesday and said there will be a "smooth transition" to a second trump term.President Jair Bolsonaro, for his part, has not yet congratulated Biden on his victory, which is interpreted as a sign that he still maintains allegiance to the current American representative.During the press statement, both the Brazilian diplomat and the American did not mention Trump or Biden.Load-Date: November 11, 2020End of Document

US restricts entry into the country of members of the Chinese Communist Party (press)CE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 3, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 335 wordsBodyWashington adopted new, stricter rules limiting the entry of Members of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC) into the United States, the New York Times reported Thursday, citing the State Department.These new restrictions, which entered into force on Wednesday, limit the duration of visas for PCC members and their direct families to one month and allow them only one entry into the country, according to the newspaper."For decades we have allowed the PCC free and unhindered access to U.S. institutions and businesses, when those privileges were never received by U.S. citizens in China," said a Department spokesman, cited by the New York Times.Previously, visa applicants could obtain permanent visitor authorization for ten years. According to the newspaper, these new restrictions could theoretically affect 270 million people.Bilateral tensions have been exacerbating in recent times in diverse areas and the two countries have taken travel-restricting measures.The Beijing authorities did not confirm these new restrictions on Thursday but had previously mentioned the possibility of them being approved and felt that it would be "a hateful and abnormal attitude towards the Communist Party.""Some anti-Chinese forces in the United States, driven by strong ideological bias and a Cold War-anchored mindset, are politically oppressing China," a spokesman for Beijing's foreign ministry said thursday.This year, Chinese authorities expelled about 15 American journalists from major media. Washington, for its part, decreased the number of accreditations by Chinese journalists to government bodies and made the rules for various Chinese state media more severe in its territory, estimating that they were "propaganda" bodies.In addition, in donald Trump's four years of rule, visas for some 1,000 Chinese students and investigators suspected of espionage in the United States have been revoked.Beijing reacted to this decision by denouncing "political persecution and racial discrimination."bur-gle/at/pz/bl/sLoad-Date: December 4, 2020End of Document

China targets Jack Ma's Alibaba, Ant empire in monopoly probeStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeDecember 25, 2020 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: MARKETS; Pg. 1Length: 413 wordsByline: Jean GarciaBodyChina's market regulator announced Thursday that it had opened an investigation into the country's e-commerce giant, Alibaba, for alleged anti-competitive activities.Investors also cheered reports that Britain and the European Union were on the cusp of striking a narrow Brexit trade deal.Markets will close at 1:00pm ET on Thursday and will be closed for Christmas holiday on Friday.Alibaba, the world's biggest e-commerce company by total sales volume, and another company were fined in mid-December for failing to apply for official approval before proceeding with some acquisitions. The Chinese government is increasing its oversight of large tech companies and, in particular, has cracked down on Jack Ma's tech empire. Alibaba describes this rule as "standard market practice", but its domestic competitors had been complaining about it for years.Separately, other watchdogs said they would hold talks with Alibaba's affiliate fintech company Ant Group.The meeting would "guide Ant Group to implement financial supervision, fair competition and protect the legitimate rights and interests of consumers", the statement said.OR sets record high for weekly COVID-19 deathsEarlier this month in Douglas County, one person who was sick went to work, and later tested positive for the coronavirus. Oregon Governor Kate Brown recently extended a state-of-emergency order until the end of March.The flamboyant Alibaba co-founder has all but vanished from public view since Ant's initial public offering was derailed.The probe is part of a sudden and quick crackdown on monopolistic behaviour suspected to be in China's booming internet ecosystem, and the latest setback for Jack Ma, the 56-year-old former school teacher, who founded Alibaba and became China's richest man in the modern era.Their patronage has also groomed a generation of titans, including food and travel giant Meituan and Didi Chuxing - China's Uber. Those that prosper outside their orbit, the largest being TikTok-owner ByteDance Ltd., are rare.Market overseers subsequently suspended Ant's IPO - the world's largest at US$35 billion (S$46.5 billion) - while the anti-monopoly watchdog threw markets into a tailspin shortly after with its draft legislation.Alibaba can not be immediately reached for comment."China has streamlined a lot of the bureaucracy, so it's easier for the different regulatory bodies to work together now", said Mark Tanner, managing director of Shanghai-based consultancy China Skinny.Load-Date: December 26, 2020End of Document

What's behind Ant's frustrated stock market debut?'CE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 5, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 749 wordsBodyBEIJING (AP) — The world's largest online financial company was about to make its public debut when the Chinese government stopped it dry about Beijing's anxiety about the risks associated with that step, worrying global investors and accentuating uncertainty about Chinese financial markets.Regulators suspended the Ant Group's debut two days before its shares began trading on the stock exchange to "maintain capital market stability" and protect investors, said a spokesman for China's foreign ministry, Zhao Lijian.Zhao gave no details, but experts said the Chinese Communist Party fears the company cannot handle financial risks that China is trying to avoid while seeking to boost economic growth following the slumk caused by the coronavirus pandemic.The launch of Ant, a detachment of the Alibaba Group -- the world's largest online sales firm in terms of sales volume -- symbolized China's takeoff after overcoming the pandemic and added to other debuts of smaller companies. In an unusual step, it was to be listed in both Shanghai, local investors and Hong Kong, for international buyers.A brief statement Tuesday spoke of changes in regulations, without giving details. The authorities have increased controls on online loans and raised capital requirements.The abrupt move can make investors more cautious, according to Shaun Rein, of Shanghai's China Market Research Group. He added that they wondered whether regulators were really concerned about the risks or acted in response to the unrest caused by the founder of Ant Jack Ma, China's richest entrepreneur, by publicly complaining that they are hurting innovation."Whatever it is, the system doesn't look good," Rein said. "It makes a lot of investors think twice before investing in China."The PC is trying to make the state-dominated economic system more suited to the market economy and increasing access to loans from entrepreneurs that generate most of China's jobs and wealth. At the same time, it wants to reduce the risks associated with rising debt, which could jeopardize the financial system.This episode reflects the clash between the government and Ma, who founded Alibaba in 1999 so that Chinese suppliers could sell their products in the West. It expanded a lot and dabbed in online sales, film production and other fields.In 2004 Ma launched Alipay, an online payment service, to facilitate sales in a society where few people had credit cards.Alipay broke away from Alibaba in 2001 and gave way to the Ant Group. In addition to Alipay, Ant manages one of the world's largest capital market funds and Sesame Credit, a credit assessment system. The company was valued at $150 billion in 2018 and is one of the most sought after in the world.Ant helped fuel an online sales boom that caused Chinese household debt to increase."Ant ended up being a perfect example of possible excesses in family indebtedness," said Martin Chorzempa of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.The Ant Group is promoted as a technology company, not a financial one, but this week's move seems to indicate that regulators do not accept that definition.Ant and other private sector financial platforms are dabbling in land dominated by state-owned banks whose mission is to support government businesses, not serve the public.Ant and other companies connect borrowers with state-owned banks. But they also competewith state-owned enterprises by offering entrepreneurs and consumers access to higher interest rates for their deposits and cheaper services.Ant "is taking part of the market from commercial banks," said Francis Lun, CEO of Geo Securities Ltd. in Hong Kong.He noted that the government "intervened to protect its own interests.""The state cannot allow these online financial institutions to be larger than commercial banks and not subject to any regulation," Lun said."This reminds us how unpredictable China is," said Au Yeung, who works in Hong Kong's financial sector. Au said he was planning to invest all his savings, $21,000, in Ant's stock.The regulators' decision could scare Chinese entrepreneurs who wanted to list their companies on the local stock exchange, according to Rein."Until yesterday, every businessman I spoke to wanted to be listed on the Chinese stock exchange because they thought that would increase their value and impress the government more," Rein said. "Now, after what happened to Jack Ma, I don't know what they're going to do."___AP researcher Yu Bing collaborated in Beijing.Load-Date: November 6, 2020End of Document

Huawei reportedly worked with 4 additional companies to build surveillance tools that track people by ethnicity, following recent revelations that it tested a 'Uighur alarm'Business Insider USDecember 14, 2020 Monday 12:11 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 809 wordsByline: tsonnemaker@businessinsider.com,  (Tyler Sonnemaker)Body• Huawei has worked with at least four partner companies to develop surveillance technologies that claim to monitor people by ethnicity, The Washington Post reported Saturday.• Last week, The Post reported that Huawei in 2018 had tested a "Uighur alarm" - an AI facial recognition tool that claimed to identify members of the largely Muslim minority group and alert Chinese authorities.• Huawei told the The Post that the tool was "simply a test," but according to Saturday's report, Huawei has developed multiple such tools.• The reports add to growing concern over China's extensive surveillance and oppression of Uyghurs and other minority groups, as well as increasing use of racially discriminatory surveillance tools and practices by US law enforcement.• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.Huawei tested an AI-powered facial-recognition technology that could trigger a "Uighur alarm" for Chinese authorities when it identified a person from the persecuted minority group in 2018, The Washington Post reported last week.At the time, Huawei spokesperson Glenn Schloss told The Post that the tool was "simply a test and it has not seen real-world application."But a new investigation published by The Post on Saturday found that Huawei has worked with dozens of security firms to build surveillance tools - and that products it developed in partnership with four of those companies claimed to be able to identify and monitor people based on their ethnicity.Documents publicly available on Huawei's website detailed the capabilities of those ethnicity-tracking tools as well as more than 2,000 product collaborations, according to The Post. The publication also reported that after it contacted Huawei, the company took the website offline temporarily before restoring the site with only 38 products listed."Huawei opposes discrimination of all types, including the use of technology to carry out ethnic discrimination," a Huawei spokesperson told Business Insider. "We provide general-purpose ICT [information and communication technology] products based on recognized industry standards.""We do not develop or sell systems that identify people by their ethnic group, and we do not condone the use of our technologies to discriminate against or oppress members of any community," the spokesperson continued. "We take the allegations in the Washington Post's article very seriously and are investigating the issues raised within."Huawei worked with Beijing Xintiandi Information Technology, DeepGlint, Bresee, and Maiyuesoft on products that made a variety of claims about estimating, tracking, and visualizing people's ethnicities, as well as other Chinese tech companies on tools to suppress citizens' complaints about wrongdoing by local government officials and analyze "voiceprint" data, according to The Post.Beijing Xintiandi Information Technology, DeepGlint, Bresee, and Maiyuesoft could not be reached for comment.Human rights groups, media reports, and other independent researchers have extensively documented China's mass surveillance and detainment of as many as one million Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and other Muslim minority groups in internment camps, where reports allege they are subjected to torture, sexual abuse, and forced labor for little or no pay.To help it build the surveillance apparatus that enables such widespread detainment, the Chinese government has at times turned to the country's technology firms."This is not one isolated company. This is systematic," John Honovich, the founder of IPVM, a research group that first discovered the 2018 test, told The Post. He added that "a lot of thought went into making sure this 'Uighur alarm' works."In October 2019, the US Commerce Department blacklisted 28 Chinese government agencies and tech companies including China's five "AI champions" - Hikvision, Dahua, SenseTime, Megvii, and iFlytek - on its banned "entity list," thus preventing US firms from exporting certain technologies to them.Still, some of those blacklisted companies have managed to continue exporting their technologies to Western countries, and BuzzFeed News reported last year that US tech firms, including Amazon, Apple, and Google, have continued selling those companies' products to US consumers via online marketplaces.In the US, law enforcement agencies and even schools have also increased their reliance on facial recognition software and other AI-powered surveillance technologies, despite growing evidence that such tools exhibit racial and gender bias.But recent pushback from activists, tech ethicists, and employees has pushed some tech companies to temporarily stop selling facial recognition tools to law enforcement, and some US cities have issued moratoriums on their use, highlighting some divides between approaches to policing in the US and China.Read the original article on Load-Date: December 13, 2020End of Document

U.S. sanctions Chinese firm over Venezuela supportUPINovember 30, 2020 Monday 10:56 PM ESTCopyright 2020 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 627 wordsByline: DARRYL COOTEDateline: Nov. 30 BodyThe Trump administration on Monday targeted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro by sanctioning a Chinese technology company it accuses of supporting the embattled regime's efforts to undermine democracy in the South American country.The U.S. Treasury and the State Department announced the United States has designated the Beijing-owned China National Electronics Import &amp; Export Corp., known as CEIEC, which they said aids the Maduro regime by restricting Internet service and conducting digital surveillance and cyber operations against political opponents."The illegitimate Maduro regime's reliance on entities like CEIEC to advance its authoritarian agenda further illustrates the regime's prioritization of power over democratic values and processes," Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement. "The United States will not hesitate to target anyone helping to suppress the democratic will of the Venezuelan people and others around the world."The Treasury said undemocratic governments use Chinese-exported technologies, such as those developed by CEIEC, to repress political dissent and Maduro has been utilizing CEIEC's services since 2017.It has provided Venezuela with software, training and technical expertise, including deploying experts to state-run telecommunications provider Venezuelan National Telephone Co., which created a commercialized version of China's "Fire Firewall" that is used to maintain strict censorship, the Treasury said.The State Department said this tool is used by Venezuela to block online independent newspapers and speeches by opposition members."The Maduro regime has repeatedly demonstrated its willingness to suppress its citizens' democratic rights, intimidate them from expressing their political views or overwhelm their voices using technology-enabled means, as buttressed by CEIEC," the Treasury said in a news release.The United States has been sanctioning the socialist nation for more than a decade, but the effort has been redoubled under the Trump administration, which has been seeking to oust Maduro following his 2018 re-election being declared illegitimate.Some 160 Venezuelans or Venezuelan-connected individuals, as well as its state oil company, government and central bank have been sanctioned under the Trump administration's two-year effort. But Maduro continues to cling to power with the support of China, Russia and Cuba, officials have said.The Trump administration has also led a coalition of more than 55 countries in backing opposition leader and interim President Juan Guaido's right to the country's helm.Venezuela has balked at the United States' actions, describing them as criminal and evidence that will be used against it in international trial.Jorge Arreaza, Venezuela's foreign minister, described the sanctions against CEIEC on Monday as "coercive measures" employed to disrupt efforts ahead of parliamentary elections on Dec. 6.Venezuela "will not be intimidated," he said in a statement, describing the sanctions as "attempts to create anxiety and attack the functioning of the public."U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned in a statement that the elections in Venezuela, including upcoming parliamentary votes, will neither be free nor fair due to "Maduro's desperate attempts to manipulate the democratic process."The Treasury said it has given companies 45 days to wind down interactions with CEIEC, which has 200 subsidiaries and offices worldwide.The sanctions freeze all property and interests in property of CEIEC in the United States and blocks U.S. citizens from doing business with the Chinese company."We stand with interim President Guaido and the Venezuelan people who have struggled for years to restore democracy and liberty to Venezuela," he said.Load-Date: December 1, 2020End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 27 of 267US, China squeeze Brazil by 5G network  Page 30 of 267CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY MEMBERS WORKED IN FOREIGN CONSULATES: LEAKED LIST  Page 33 of 267BANGLADESH INSTALLS LAST SPAN OF AMBITIOUS CHINESE-BACKED BRIDGE PROJECT  Page 35 of 2674 years in prison for Chinese journalist covering the epidemic in Wuhan  Page 38 of 267The US-China rivalry in tech and trade won't end because Joe Biden is president  Page 40 of 267REPORT: Chinese Tech Giant Tested Facial Recognition Software To Alert Authorities To Uighurs  Page 42 of 267FCC Chairman Pai Issues Statement on China Telecom Corp.  Page 44 of 267THE FIRST AMENDMENT FIGHT AGAINST THE WECHAT BAN  Page 46 of 267DF Connection to China Chile on the Digital Silk Road  Page 48 of 267Chinese regulation of big tech companies alerts more entrepreneurs  Page 51 of 267Trump is targeting China's national champions on his way out the door  Page 53 of 267Chairman Neal Calls for Re-Commitment to Securing U.S. Trade Deal With Europe  Page 56 of 267Shanghai airport momentarily descends into chaos after workers test positive for Covid-19  Page 58 of 267Jake Sullivan Trashed Trump's Israel Policy In Interview With Chinese Propaganda Outlet  Page 60 of 267The Spectator explains: the rifirrafe between Australia and China by a manipulated photo  Page 62 of 267China, the European Union and an ambitious investment pact  Page 64 of 267Chinese probe lands on Moon to collect lunar soil samples  Page  of Sen.
