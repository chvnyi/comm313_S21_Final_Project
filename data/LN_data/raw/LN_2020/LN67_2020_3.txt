Twitter closed thousands of accounts linked to China, Turkey and Russia regimes used to make disinformation propagandaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 12, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 530 wordsBodyOn Friday, Twitter announced the closure of tens of thousands of Chinese, Russian and Turkish accounts "linked to the state" and used for propaganda and misinformation.The social network noted that it had disabled a "core" of 23,750 accounts linked to China and broadcast by another 150,000 accounts that serve as "amplifiers". Twitter also closed 7,340 accounts linked to Turkey and 1,152 linked to Russia.All these accounts have been closed but their contents have been stored in a database for scientific research, the company noted.The US giant explained that the network of Chinese accounts was discovered using tools installed last August to delete Beijing-linked accounts during protests in Hong Kong.That network posted tweets, mainly in Chinese and probably destined for the diaspora, "spreading favorable geopolitical theories to the Chinese Communist Party, while supporting misleading theories about political dynamics in Hong Kong," Twitter explained in an analysis note.These thousands of accounts have also served to promote Beijing's views on the fight against coronavirus and anti-racist protests in the United States, said Australian expert group ASPI, which analyzed the flow of tweets.A mobile phone screen where you see the Twitter app logo (THOMAS WHITE/)"While the Chinese Communist Party does not allow the Chinese people to use Twitter, our analysis shows that it does not hesitate to use it to spread propaganda and misinformation internationally," an ASPI official, Fergus Hanson, said in his analysis note.As for the Network of Turkish accounts, which was detected in early 2020, it was mainly dedicated to the promotion of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the ruling party, according to Twitter.As early as May this year. an army of bot accounts linked to a propaganda campaign backed by the Chinese government was spreading disinformation on social media about coronavirus and other issues, including on an exiled businessman, according to a London-based researcher.The accounts have been used to promote content that attacks critics of the Chinese government and to spread conspiracy theories that blame the United States for the origin of the virus, according to Benjamin Strick, who specializes in analyzing information operations on social media websites.Between April 25 and May 3, Strick said he identified more than 1,000 Twitter accounts that were associated with China's disinformation effort, as well as more than 50 different pages on Facebook. He estimated that 300 or 400 new Twitter accounts joined the network every day, as part of the Chinese campaign."The network has evolved and continues to grow," Strick said in an interview. "I think it's a state-backed Chinese campaign."Strick's work is the latest research suggesting that China has intensified the misinformation around coronavirus, to dilute its own guilt and blame others, although some have cast doubt on certain findings or suggested that they could warrant further investigation.MORE ON THESE TOPICS:Zoom closed the account of an activist who wanted to commemorate Tiananmen victims: suspect Chinese regimeHow to regain access to your Instagram account if it was hackedLoad-Date: June 13, 2020End of Document

US CYBERFIRM SAYS VATICAN TARGET OF CHINESE HACKERS, NY TIMES REPORTSStates News ServiceJuly 29, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 317 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the Voice of America (VOA):The New York Times Wednesday said the Vatican's computer networks have been breached by Chinese hackers since May, in an apparent espionage effort before the start of sensitive talks between the Roman Catholic Church and Communist China.The Times says the attack, discovered by private U.S.-based cybersecurity and monitoring firm Recorded Future, appears to be the first time hackers have been publicly caught directly hacking into the Vatican and a Hong Kong-based group of de facto Vatican representatives who have negotiated with China over the Church's status on the mainland.The newspaper says cybersecurity experts at Recorded Future have presumed the hackers are working for the Chinese government.The Vatican and China are expected to begin talks in September over renewal of a provisional agreement they reached in 2018 that gives the pope the final say over bishops selected by the Communist Party for the state-sanctioned Catholic Church. The Times says the revelations are certain to anger the Vatican and further complicate its relationship with the Chinese government.The two sides cut off formal diplomatic ties in 1951. The Vatican officially recognizes Taiwan, the self-ruled island Beijing claims is a rogue breakaway territory that belongs under its control. If the Vatican and China restore diplomatic relations, Chinese officials are certain to demand that the Church cut off all ties with Taiwan.China officially recognizes Catholicism and four other religions, but Communist Party officials often suspect religious groups and worshipers pose a threat to national security and are working to undermine the party's grip on power.Authorities have often used cyberattacks to gather information on groups such as Buddhist Tibetans, Muslim Uighurs and members of the outlawed Falun Gong who operate outside of China.Load-Date: July 29, 2020End of Document

Chinese press did not mention the military confrontation that left at least 20 Indian soldiers deadCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 17, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 611 wordsBodyChinese newspapers did not mention on Wednesday in their print editions the military clash on the Border with India, which left at least 20 dead on the Indian side, nor did the main television newscast in its Tuesday edition.On Tuesday, the Chinese government accounted for the clash in the Himalayas, the first with dead for 45 years, without saying whether there were Chinese casualties and retributing responsibility for the facts to India.On Wednesday, several Chinese newspapers merely published on their websites the Chinese Defense Ministry's statement calling for moderation to India.In an editorial, Global Times stated that Beijing refuses to communicate the number of Chinese victims to "avoid comparisons and prevent an escalation of the sense of confrontation."India evoked victims of "both sides" and recognized 20 deaths in their ranks. For its part, the Chinese Defense Ministry spoke of "dead and wounded" without specifying quantity or nationality.However, on social media some internet users call on the Chinese army to exact revenge. "If we don't attack India to death, such provocations will never stop," wrote a user of the Weibo network."I read in foreign media that five Chinese soldiers died. I'm totally furious," said another.Indian soldiers near the border with China. REUTERS/Danish Ismail (DANISH ISMAIL/)Troops from the two nuclear powers have been immersed since early May in several clashes along the common border, mainly in Ladakh, and reinforced their presence on both sides with thousands of soldiers. A crisis that both sides say, however, want to "resolve peacefully" diplomatically."Both India and China have expressed a desire for a de-escalation, and we support a peaceful resolution of the current situation," said a U.S. State Department spokesman after the confrontation.Following negotiations between generals of the two armies about ten days ago, a demilitarization process began in some disputed altitude areas in Ladakh.For his part, Chinese Foreign Minister Zhao Lijian said Indian troops had crossed the border and "provoked and attacked Chinese personnel, prompting a serious confrontation."Senior officials on both sides are currently negotiating at the scene to defuse the situation, according to the Indian army statement."China and India agree to continue resolving bilateral problems through dialogue," the Chinese spokesman said.A man enters a conference room used for meetings between military commanders from China and India on the Indian side of the Indo-Chinese border in Bumla, Arunachal Pradesh state, northeastern India, in November 2009.

"We urge both sides to keep the utmost restraint, " declared to the media EriKaneko.In early May, the clashes with stones and sticks opposed the military of both countries in the Sikkim region of eastern India. Several injuries were reported.Chinese troops also advanced in areas considered by India to be located on its territory in Ladakh, leading New Delhi to bring reinforcements to the region.Tensions between the two countries have been increasing in recent weeks along their common 3,500-kilometre border, which was never properly delimited.Both regional powers had various territorial disputes in the Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh areas.The two countries faced off in a lightning war in 1962.

U.S. accuses Chinese 'hackers' of stealing information about Vaccines against Covid-19CE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 21, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 390 wordsBodyThe U.S. government today accused two Chinese hackers of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars in trade secrets from companies working on a vaccine against covid-19.The U.S. Department of Justice says hackers investigated the vulnerabilities of computer networks of companies involved in developing a vaccine against the new coronavirus to steal valuable information from them.The charge involves crimes of theft of trade secret and conspiracy of electronic fraud against hackers, who will have acted in accordance with the interests of the Chinese Government.This is the first lawsuit against hackers for theft of scientific innovation involving the new coronavirus, although US authorities warned of this possibility several months ago, but last week authorities in the US, Canada and uk had already raised suspicions about the involvement of hackers with the Russian government in vaccine-related criminal activities."China now takes its place, alongside Russia, Iran and North Korea in the shameful club of countries that provide safe haven for cybercriminals working in the service of the state, in this case to feed the Chinese Communist Party's insatiable hunger for intellectual property developed by U.S. companies, notably in research against covid-19," Assistant Attorney General John Demers said in a statement. , of the Department of Justice.The indictment does not mention evidence that the hackers succeeded in their attempt to steal trade secrets, but prosecutors say the pirates were able to hack into the computer network of a Massachusetts biotech company known for investigating a vaccine against covid-19, as well as exploiting vulnerabilities in a Maryland company , who also developed similar research.The lawsuit was initiated earlier this month in a federal court in Washington state, and was announced today.The Chinese Government has not yet commented on this process.The covid-19 pandemic has claimed more than 610,000 lives and affected more than 14.7 million people in 196 countries and territories, according to a report by French news agency AFP.The disease is transmitted by a new coronavirus detected in late December in Wuhan, a city in central China.After Europe succeeded China as the center of the pandemic in February, the American continent is now the one with the most confirmed cases and most deaths.Load-Date: July 22, 2020End of Document

US: Chinese hackers attacked vaccine developersCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 22, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 472 wordsBodyWASHINGTON (AP) — Hackers working in collaboration with the Chinese government attacked companies that develop coronavirus vaccines and stole hundreds of millions of dollars in intellectual property and trade secrets from companies around the world, the Justice Department reported Tuesday when it announced criminal charges.The complaint does not accuse the two Chinese suspects of obtaining coronavirus-related research, but highlights the degree of importance of scientific innovation to foreign governments and criminal hackers seeking to know what US companies are developing during the pandemic. In this case, hackers investigated vulnerabilities in the computer network of biotechnology and diagnostic companies developing vaccines and diagnostic testing equipment, as well as investigating antiviral drugs.The charges are the latest in a series of aggressive actions by President Donald Trump's administration against China. It is at a time when Trump, whose re-election aspirations have been undermined by the coronavirus pandemic, blames China for the outbreak and his government officials have escalated his complaints against Beijing, including alleged attempts at intellectual property theft through hacking.The allegation includes charges of theft of trade secrets and conspiracy to commit electronic fraud against hackers, who were colleagues at an electronics college and who are reported to work together for more than a decade by conducting cyberattacks against high-tech companies in more than 10 countries.The hackers, identified as Li Xiaoyu and Dong Jiazhi, stole information not only for their personal benefit, but also research and technology that they know would be valued by the Chinese government, prosecutors claimed.In some instances, the complaint notes, they provided a Chinese intelligence service official they worked with, with email accounts and passwords belonging to priests, dissidents and pro-democracy activists. The official also provided assistance by providing software after one of the hackers went through problems violating the email server of a Burma human rights group.The two defendants are not in detention and federal authorities admitted Tuesday that they are unlikely to step on a U.S. court. But the formal accusations are of great symbolic importance and deterrent to the Justice Department, which decided that publicly reporting this behavior was worth more than waiting for the unlikely scenario of suspects traveling to the United States and risking arrest.Hacking began more than 10 years ago, with attacks on pharmaceutical, solar and medical device companies, but also against political dissidents, activists and priests in the United States, China and Hong Kong, the federal authorities noted._____Associated Press journalist Frank Bajak contributed this firm from Boston.Load-Date: July 23, 2020End of Document

China hawks eye a new target: Airport jet bridgesPolitico.comJune 15, 2020 Monday 7:08 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 1634 wordsHighlight: A handful of senior, mostly Republican lawmakers wary of China's influence and potential security threats are trying to stop CIMC-Tianda.BodyA Chinese company once found guilty of stealing information from a U.S. company that manufactures airplane boarding bridges is making a fresh push into American airport markets - and becoming the newest target for anti-China hawks in Congress.A handful of senior, mostly Republican lawmakers wary of China's influence and potential security threats are trying to stop CIMC-Tianda, which has again begun bidding on U.S. airport contracts.This obscure fight over whether a Chinese manufacturer can be trusted to make sophisticated equipment that operates on airport tarmacs is just the latest example in an escalating war between China and Washington, which has sprawled from industry to industry and provoked a worsening trade war between the two countries.CIMC-Tianda was found guilty by a U.S. district court in Houston in 1998 of stealing the intellectual property of Jetway Systems, which builds the "jet bridges" - the connectors people walk across to board airplanes - and then using what it learned to undercut Jetway in contract bids. CIMC-Tianda, a subsidiary of state-owned China International Marine Containers, has since become a dominant force in the international airport equipment market, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region.The company has largely been absent from U.S. markets after a 1998 court order prohibited it from selling designs other than its own for a decade. But the ban has expired, and with Tianda newly reincorporated inside the United States, it has begun bidding afresh on airport projects in Miami, Orlando, Boston and Dallas. In some cases, according to a fact sheet obtained by POLITICO circulated around Capitol Hill by Jetway, Tianda is using a small U.S.-based company as a "proxy bidder." Tianda and its lobbyists did not respond to several requests for comment for this story.Members of Congress have introduced legislation, urged the Federal Aviation Administration to step in and reached out directly to airport authorities asking them to reject their bids, so far without much traction.The lawmakers pressing on this issue include some of Congress' biggest China hawks, such as Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The effort is mostly Republican, but they've been joined by at least two Democrats, Michigan Sen. Gary Peters and Rep. Marc Veasey of Texas.A bill introduced by Cornyn, Rubio and Peters in the Senate and Veasey and Rep. Ron Wright (R-Texas) in the House, would in effect speed a process that Congress already told the FAA to start as part of December's spending deal.Their bill, aimed directly at CIMC-Tianda, would direct the FAA to make a list of state-owned companies that have been "determined by a Federal court to have misappropriated intellectual property or trade secrets" from U.S. organizations. Then the agency would have to prevent those companies from entering into federally-funded contracts for passenger boarding bridges.The sponsors of the bill also wrote to the FAA in April referencing CIMC-Tianda's new bids, and asking the agency to "exercise your authority to preempt contracting with Chinese owned or subsidized companies for our critical airport infrastructure." Cornyn's office said the FAA has not responded.In a statement, the FAA said it has started working with the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and Justice Department on identifying entities that have misappropriated intellectual property or trade secrets. The agency noted that recipients of airport funding already have to comply with Buy America requirements, which include the use of steel and manufactured goods produced in the United States.The timing of the push is largely centered around an upcoming contract in Miami, which Tianda appears poised to win. Local officials are considering two bids to build 12 jet bridges at Miami International Airport: one from the German engineering firm ThyssenKrupp (which has had its own tangles with CIMC-Tianda over boarding bridges) and another from Miami-based North American Construction Co., which lists CIMC-Tianda as a subcontractor. The airport's request for proposals says the lowest bid will be chosen, and CIMC-Tianda's is the lower of the two.A spokesperson for the Miami airport said the bids are still being evaluated, and had no comment on the entities that are bidding.Florida's Senate delegation is also involved in pushing against Tianda. Rubio, Sen. Rick Scott and fellow GOP Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, who heads the House Appropriations panel in charge of transportation spending, wrote to the Miami airport's CEO in December asking him to reject the bid despite its "attractive price tag."Another Florida airport getting ready to sign a contract for bridges, Southwest Florida International Airport in Fort Myers, put a clause in its request for bids that pointedly rules out Tianda."Bids will not be considered from bidders who have been found guilty by any court in the United States of crimes pertaining to industrial espionage or intellectual property theft," the document reads. Victoria Moreland, a spokesperson for the airport, said the language came about after its purchasing department was "made aware of the concerns" around Tianda.A spokesperson for Boston Logan International Airport confirmed that Tianda had also bid on a proposal for passenger bridges there earlier this year, but had not been chosen. Tianda also lost out in a bid in Orlando last year, despite being the lowest offer.In the background, Tianda and Jetway Systems are duking it out, with Jetway circulating information on Capitol Hill charging that these sophisticated pieces of equipment used all over the very heart of airports pose security risks if they're in the wrong hands. Tianda, meanwhile, hired its own lobbying firepower, though it appears to have been short-lived.In March, Tianda hired a lobbyist who had recently stepped down from the federal Department of Transportation, where he was a senior official, according to a Senate lobbying disclosure form. The lobbyist, Anthony Bedell, was deputy assistant secretary for congressional affairs at DOT from May 2017 to November 2019.The relationship didn't last long. The lobbying disclosure lists the start date as Feb. 12, but when POLITICO reached Bedell on June 9, he said he was no longer lobbying for Tianda. Bedell did not respond to a request for more information about when the lobbying registration had been terminated, or why. Bedell's firm, Becker, was paid around $20,000 for the work.Perry Jasin, CIMC-Tanda's director of operations for North America, challenged the assertion that the U.S. outpost of the company is state-owned."CIMC-Tianda USA is a Delaware corporation. It was formed in 2017 ... to manufacture passenger boarding bridges in the U.S. under the license and IP wholly owned by CIMC-Tianda, a Hong Kong company," Jasin said in an interview with POLITICO. "It does not receive any funding or support from the Chinese government."The Utah-based company Jetway contends that myriad security threats would be created by allowing a Chinese company to build boarding bridges in the United States."Newer jet bridges are technologically sophisticated and can integrate fully with internal airport or FAA systems," it warned in a one-pager passed around Congress, including financial, flight information, alarm and closed-circuit television systems."The primary concern is the access to information CIMC-Tianda may be afforded as a result should they win contracts moving forward," the document says.Jetway added in a statement to POLITICO that bridge manufacturers "retain the ability to access these systems to facilitate predictive and reactive maintenance and supply data to improve operational efficiencies to airports and airlines, and if those systems are compromised, airport operations could be significantly impacted."But Jasin, who worked at competitor ThyssenKrupp for four years, said Tianda largely uses the same technology as its competitors. "Our bridges are designed in the US ... and our control systems are made by a local Texas vendor," Jasin said. "It's actually the same equipment that [Jetway] and ThyssenKrupp put in theirs."Legislative efforts to box out Chinese companies have become commonplace in many sectors, but transportation in particular has seen a number of battles spring up lately. The battle lines are usually similar - security concerns - and have focused on Chinese companies that manufacture everything from drones to railcars and buses.A large coalition of lawmakers successfully got a provision into last year's defense authorization that bans transit agencies from purchasing Chinese rolling stock with federal funds, citing similar fears of security vulnerabilities and spying.A House Republican aide who is working on the passenger bridge issue said the latest effort is intended to "mirror" that success, although they are still searching for a vehicle for their legislation.While airports are generally wary of requirements that limit their flexibility in procurement, the industry at large doesn't oppose the passenger bridge legislation as long as the FAA and other government agencies bear the burden of determining which manufacturers to prohibit, said Joel Bacon, executive vice president of government and public affairs at the Association of American Airport Executives.Security is the main rationale behind the bills circulating on Capitol Hill, but at least one lawmaker also tied it to punishing China for its role in the coronavirus pandemic.In a statement introducing the House companion bill, Wright accused China of being "reckless and negligent" in the pandemic response. "Make no mistake, the [Chinese Communist Party] will stop at nothing to gain power and control. We cannot afford to give them inroads to our most critical systems," he said.Load-Date: June 16, 2020End of Document

U.S. state official testifies China is working to steal U.S. COVID-19 technologiesUPIJuly 22, 2020 Wednesday 12:33 PM ESTCopyright 2020 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 451 wordsByline: DON JACOBSON&DANIEL URIADateline: July 22 BodyDeputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun testified Wednesday that China has been working to steal U.S. technologies to treat COVID-19 and arresting those who speak up about the threat of the virus.Responding to questions by Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., Biegun cited Justice Department indictments unsealed Tuesday, alleging Chinese hackers sought to steal U.S. intellectual property including COVID-19 research."We have firm evidence to suggest that Chinese hackers working in close association with Chinese national security institutions have in fact been trying to steal information related to the development of technologies to treat coronavirus," he said.Biegun also referred to an extensive history of the Chinese government silencing dissenting voices when asked if they were "disappearing" health officials and others who warned of the dangers of the coronavirus outbreak."China has been arresting dissenting voices for my entire career but in recent months we have seen, in particular, this focus has turned against those who spoke up -- particularly early on -- about the COVID virus in Wuhan, absolutely," he said.Biegun added he believes the Uyghur Muslim population in China is being "severely mistreated" but stopped short of declaring the treatment torture, despite a push from Gardner."Torture is a legal definition and I don't simply have the evidence available to me to make that statement as a legal matter," he said.Biegun was sworn in to his deputy post in December. He was special representative for North Korea for 16 months in 2018 and 2019.U.S.-China relations have declined since President Donald Trump took office in 2017. A lengthy trade conflict, accusations of theft and implications over the origins of the coronavirus pandemic have soured political ties.Earlier Wednesday, Beijing condemned the Trump administration for closing a Chinese consulate in Houston -- a move the State Department said was intended to "protect American intellectual property and Americans' private information."The Chinese government promised "legitimate and necessary" countermeasures if the consulate isn't allowed to reopen.Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., questioned the administration's approach on China saying it "labors under the mistaken belief that just being confrontational is the same thing as being competitive" while referencing the decision to close the consulate."I'm all for safeguarding our national security, I understand the importance of being tough with China, but being tough is the means, not the ends," he said. "So while there may be a reason for taking this action ... I want to understand better not just the tactical considerations, but how this measure advances our strategy."Load-Date: July 22, 2020End of Document

The CEOs from Amazon, Apple. Facebook and Google will testify by video before the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee. They're expected to be grilled over their growing influence and the impact on competition. The testimony could help build public pressure for government action to remove the protections that these companies enjoy.In separate statements Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and Sundar Pichai all emphasized competition that their companies already face as well as their contributions to the U.S. economy.Taking a look at big tech this morning, all the stocks are up this morning. Best performer right now is Amazon, up better than 1 percent.Sparks flying on Capitol Hill yesterday as Democrats spar with Attorney General Bill Barr during a heated House hearing Democrats grilling Barr yesterday on his handling of the unrest in Portland and the Russia probe. Barr firing back accusing Democrats of turning a blind mind eye to ongoing violence across the country.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAM BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: Federal courts are under attack. since when is it ok to try to burn down a federal court? If someone went down the street to the (INAUDIBLE) court here, that beautiful courthouse we have right at the bottom of the Hill and started breaking windows and firing industrial grade fireworks in to start a fire, throw kerosene balloons in and start fires in the court, is that ok? Is that ok now?(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Also Barr dealing with Democrat accusations that he is carrying out President Trump's political wishes as well. It was all politics yesterday in the House Judiciary Committee.Meanwhile grim new milestones in the COVID-19 pandemic. Six states reporting one day records for deaths as Texas becomes the fourth state to pass the 400,000 COVID case mark. Dr. Anthony Fauci is now warning parts of the Midwest. There are early signs that a coronavirus outbreak could be brewing in Indiana, Ohio, Tennessee and Kentucky.Stimulus battle rages meanwhile. Lawmakers are negotiating a new round of coronavirus aid. One point of contention on both sides of the aisle, funding for non-COVID-19 related items including a new FBI building. President Trump weighed in yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We'll be negotiating -- it's sort of semi-irrelevant because the Democrats come with their needs and asks and the Republicans go with theirs. So we'll be discussing it with Mitch and all of the other people involved.We want to do what is best for the people. I want to do what is best for the people. I want to do what is best for the economy because that means jobs and lots of good things.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is Delaware Senator Chris Coons.And Senator, it's great to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining me.SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE): Great to see you, Maria. Thanks for having me on.BARTIROMO: So tell me what the priority is from your standpoint. What needs to be in this stimulus package?COONS: Well, Maria, what's striking is that the House of Representatives passed the HEROES Act two months ago. And the biggest pieces of that bill that are utterly lacking in the HEALS Act, which was just introduced by Majority Leader McConnell here in the Senate, is aid to state and local governments.As you may know, I spend 10 years in county government in Delaware. All over our country we've got state and local governments that have record revenue shortfalls. A million and a half public employees have already been laid off. And these aren't faceless folks in gray buildings. They're teachers, they're paramedics, they're nurses. They're the folks who administer programs like unemployment or small business assistance at the local level.And so frankly, I think we have to provide another round of relief to state and local governments.BARTIROMO: Well, how are you going to ensure that those state and local governments use the money wisely? We know that the state unemployment coffers are under serious strain.You know, we had Mayor de Blasio on the show a couple -- about a month ago. He says he needs $7.5 billion right now. What is he going to use the money for? It's not -- it's obviously not going to help the police bring law and order in any of these cities.COONS: Well, Maria frankly, having adequate funding for state and local police is an important part of continuing to have a prosperous and stable and safe and secure local communities.But frankly, so is having the resources for reopening our schools safely. One of the key things that I think was missing from the HEALS Act was sufficient funding for schools to reopen, both to have enough for testing and enough for PPE.I'm hearing lots of concerns in Delaware from small businesses about another round of PPP support that will help them either get open again or stay open, from parents and teachers about safe reopening of schools, and from citizens who are concerned about whether or not the unemployment benefits that they've benefited from over the last two months -- four months now -- will still be there.We are about to hit a significant cliff where an eviction moratorium for renters, which is about a third of all Delawareans, and the unemployment benefit from the CARES Act from four months ago will both run out. We've had two months to negotiate.I'm really disappointed frankly that we are just now seeing Majority Leader McConnell's proposal. And it's a proposal that clearly doesn't have the support of all of the Republican caucus. I'm talking to Republican colleagues, about half of that caucus isn't going to support that bill.So these negotiations need to get going and get going quickly in a way that will help us again deliver bipartisan support to the American people.BARTIROMO: Well, you're right. People are facing some serious strain out there.But let's go through some of the thing you said.First off, on schools. The president had earmarked $105 billion. Is that not the right number?And secondly on the CARES Act that was passed in the House a couple of months ago, it is totaling $3.5 trillion that Nancy Pelosi would like to move forward. It includes $600 unemployment benefits until January.We are talking about debt in this country of $21 trillion. We are soon going to be having as much debt as the entire size of the economy at $22 trillion. So was that a realistic plan?I know you say, well, we passed it months ago, I'm disappointed hearing what the GOP is coming up with now, but was $3.5 trillion truly realistic given its price tag?COONS: Well Maria let's be clear. Four months ago the Senate passed the CARES Act unanimously. That was $2.3 trillion. Two months ago the House did pass what's called the HEROES Act, and it's got a price tag a little over $3 trillion.What's been introduced here in the Senate just yesterday is at about a trillion. That is a big difference, $1 trillion to $3 trillion.Of course, we have to be concerned about the long-term impact of our national debt. We are pushing out more spending to sustain our economy, to respond to this pandemic than has been done federally since the Second World War.But what I hear from small business owners, from parents, from public employees, from folks who've lost their jobs is that, if it were not for this federal support, we would be in the second great depression.So there are 30 million Americans roughly who are relying on this $600 a week additional federal unemployment. The proposal that we've just seen from the Republican majority here in the Senate would make every person take a 30 percent pay cut who is currently relying on unemployment.One of the main challenges we face is antiquated I.T. systems at the state and federal level, changing that so that we've got a more resilient, more adjustable system isn't going to be possible on the fly in a couple weeks.So, we've got to negotiate something that is responsible in this environment. And in my view, that means extending unemployment for an awful lot of folks who otherwise won't be able to keep a roof over the heads of their families.There's one other thing I wanted to talk about Maria, if I could for a moment --BARTIROMO: Yes. Of course.COONS: Today I'm introducing a bipartisan bill with Senator Rubio, Senator Cornyn, Senator Hassan. It's a manufacturing resiliency task force.One of the things we've seen in this pandemic is that we are vitally reliant on China for critical supplies, whether it's medical devices like ventilators or it's pharmaceuticals.And this is a look at how we could restore to the United States manufacturing that has gone offshore in the last 20 years and that we should try and bring back to the United States, so that we're not as vulnerable to sudden shocks globally, whether it's a pandemic or something else.I think this is an important next step in making sure that manufacturing in the United States is resilient and can get built back stronger after this recession.BARTIROMO: Well, it is. And you are right.And thank you for introducing this legislation, because I think many Americans were just, you know, shocked to learn that 70 percent of our active ingredients in our prescription drugs are made in China.And in the middle of the pandemic China tried to threaten us, with "The Global Times" state-run media saying, well, maybe we won't export these prescription drugs right now since Trump is pushing Xi Jinping on tariffs. So this is very important.Let me ask you this, Senator. How long do you expect it is going to take for an average company to say, OK, I am taking my -- my supply chain out of China, and I'm going to put in the U.S. or I'm going to put it in India, et cetera?Is this an eight-year -- an eight-year timeframe, five-year timeframe? Because I know this doesn't happen overnight. It's great to get this started, but this is a long term decision.COONS: It is. Maria, I worked for a global manufacturing company for eight years before I went into local government. And I will tell you, reallocating manufacturing resources facilities around the world is a challenging thing to do.It depends on what industrial sector you are in. And whether you are leasing contract manufacturing space or whether you directly own and have built and control it.China has been the most appealing, fastest growing market for decades, and many American companies have been heavily invested there.But this is not a new development. Over the last five years Xi Jinping has taken the Chinese government, the Chinese Communist Party in a sharply different direction. So many American companies have already been looking at the question of whether they couldn't diversity where they're doing manufacturing.What I'm hoping we'll do is to provide incentives for them to bring that manufacturing back to the United States. The company I worked for had much of its manufacturing in Germany and the United States, because it was advanced manufacturing so it required high-skilled, highly-integrated workforces.I think we can compete and win in manufacturing. It just requires sustained bipartisan focus on this.BARTIROMO: Yes. It does. And we are going to need that manufacturing base fired up in the U.S. because the services part of our economy right now is shot, obviously, in a shutdown.Senator, we'll be watching the developments. We so appreciate your time and energy on this. Thank you, sir.COONS: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Senator Chris Coons.Coming up, Trump 2020 campaign press secretary Hogan Gidley is here talking about the latest on the race for the White House. Much more ahead.You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Tech giants on the Hill. The CEOs from Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google will testify before Congress today.Hillary Vaughn is in Washington right now with a preview. Hillary.HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria.This is the first time all four tech CEOs will appear virtually before Congress. Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Apple's Tim Cook, Alphabet Google's Sundar Pichai will have the same goal today. Convince Congress they are not too big and they should not be broken up or reined in by regulators.All four companies are in the top six most valuable public companies in the world and their top executives showing up today even virtually shows how important this is on their agenda.We got to look at their opening statements and here is the takeaway from each CEO that we will hear today.Amazon's Jeff Bezos is the only one who has not testified before Congress yet. His case for competition is this. Brick-and-mortar stores like Target, Costco and Walmart have both a larger physical presence in U.S. but also a rapidly growing online presence. He will also talk about how the pandemic has forced large companies to become even more competitive online saying this, quote, "Curbside pickup of online orders has increased over 200 percent in part due to COVID-19 concerns. We also face new competition from the likes of Shopify and Instacart.Apple's Tim Cook will make the case that one of their biggest rivals is sitting on the virtual witness bench right next to him, Google saying Apple competes with their Android devices along with LG and Huawei saying this. "I share the subcommittee's belief that competition is a great virtue. That it promotes innovation, that it makes space for the next great idea and that it gives consumers more choices.Google's Sundar Pichai has testified in front of Congress before and has come under scrutiny on a flood of issues from things like privacy and politics. Today he will make the case that the phrase "Google it" is now competing with things like "Hey Siri" and "Hey Alexa" saying there's more ways for consumers to look things up than ever before.He'll also talk about the free services that they offer like Maps and Gmail and how those are key to making Main Street stay online during the pandemic saying quote, "I am deeply proud that because of our tools, businesses on Main Street can compete in a away that was not possible 20 years ago. Nearly a third of small business owners say without digital tools they would have had to close all or part of their business."And finally Facebook Mark Zuckerberg warns that regulator should not make changes that threaten freedom of innovation that make it look more like a China. Facebook has been bombarded with criticism over political bias on their platform. Has made both Republicans and Democrats unhappy with them. He will say that ultimately he thinks that decision should not be up to them, but instead there should be a one rule for all from regulators, Maria.BARTIROMO: All right. Hillary, we'll be watching. It should be interesting.Be sure to tune in later today on Fox Business. We'll be taking that tech hearing live starting at noon Eastern. You can watch the full hearing right here live.Plus the changing movie business. The new deal to shorten the time between a theatre release and the digital copies. We're going to take a look at that when we come right back.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Blockbusters headed to your home sooner. AMC and Universal Pictures have agreed to cut the exclusive theatrical window to 17 days. A source telling "The Wall Street Journal" that AMC also negotiated a share of the revenue new Universal movies will earn from digital rentals purchased on other platforms such as Apple TV and Amazon's Web site.Dagen, you'll those movies sooner rather than later. What do you think?MCDOWELL: It was -- these companies have been pushed into this by the pandemic. And you will not going to have crowded theatres, people flocking back to movie theatres until there's a vaccine in this country. Maybe that's later this year, maybe it's next year but this has to happen.Again with really big movies like (INAUDIBLE) people will flock to the theatres trying to see that with the super sound and the giant screen. But I'm perfectly happy to watch the King of Staten Island, that Pete Davidson movie sitting in my pajamas.BARTIROMO: Yes. Me, too. I love it Scottie Martin. What do you think? I mean, you know, we all have these big TVs now and it's more comfortable at home.SCOTT MARTIN, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT: Yes. I would add (INAUDIBLE) to that list too, Maria, and I put on a tank top myself not the PJs.And I'll tell you what. Insert that pun here, Maria, but if the theaters and the production companies didn't do something about the streaming in the pandemic we know how this movie ends. They're going to go out of business and so therefore, I think they're making the right move in shortening the release.BARTIROMO: Philip, you've got to adapt. We're in an incredible moment in time.WEGMANN: You've got to adapt and I think what is interesting is that the past time of going to the movies with their friends, I think that -- that might be disappearing not just because of the pandemic but because it's easier to stay at home and, you know, we're going to be watching a lot more television alone by ourselves, I think moving forward. And I think that's kind of sad actually.BARTIROMO: Unbelievable. It's just extraordinary how many things have changed since this pandemic arrived, just four months ago.All right. We will keep looking at it.We'll take a break.When we come back, Trump 2020 campaign press secretary Hogan Gidley is here talking about the latest on the race for the White House.A lot more ahead. You are watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA, live on fox business.We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Wednesday, July 29th. A look at markets right here just before 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.We got gain pretty much across the board now. Dow Industrials now at the highs of the morning. Dow futures up 57 points, Nasdaq futures up 67. Tech is on fire again this morning. And the S&P 500 up 10 points this morning.It is a big day in Washington. Big tech CEOs are testifying. We've got stimulus negotiations ongoing and the decision from the Federal Reserve.All ahead of that, futures are rallying right now.Let's check global markets this morning. A firmer tone there as well. European indices this morning up across the board now with the FT 100 up 20 points, the CAC quarante up 40 points and the DAX index in Germany up 7 points.In Asia overnight markets were mostly higher. The best performer was China. The Shanghai composite overnight up better than 2 percent. Japan was down. The Nikkei average down better than 1 percent.Well, we are learning more this morning about the woman killed in a rare shark attack in Maine.Cheryl Casone with those details.Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Maria.It's a sad story. Julie Dimperio Holowach was a form New York City fashion executive. The 63-year-old was swimming near Bailey Island with her daughter just 20 yards offshore, close to the family's vacation home. Officials confirm she was attacked by a great white shark. Kayakers who witnessed the attack rushed her to shore but couldn't save her. Her daughter, luckily, was not hurt. This is the first deadly shark attack in Maine's history.Well, seeking office. A record 122 black or multiracial black women have filed to run for Congress in the upcoming election. According to the Center for American Women in Politics, that figure has steadily increased. In 2012, the number was just 48. The collective pac (ph) says nearly 60 black women are still in the running for November.And, finally, here is a look at what is trending this morning on foxbusiness.com.Dr. Anthony Fauci warns the Major League Baseball season may be in jeopardy after four more Marlins players tested positive for Covid-19.Spirit Airliners is going to inform its unions this week that up to 30 percent of its worker may be furloughed come October.And a mystery buyer just snagged a record setting $102 million penthouse right here in New York City, which is likely a bargain considering what real estate looks like right now in New York, Maria.And those are your headlines.BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thank you.Well, we've got some Capitol Hill clashes to report. Attorney General Bill Barr delivering fiery testimony before the House Judiciary Committee yesterday. AG Barr going toe-to-toe with Democrats on several issues, from Russia meddling to ongoing protesters across the country.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Attorney General, the time is mine.WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL: You've waited to talk to me like this? You didn't need to wait so long.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: When asked --UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Attorney General, you did answer the question. I'll be --BARR: No, you said under penalty of perjury. I'm going to answer the damn question, OK?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But you said --BARR: I've asked another U.S. attorney to look into the issue of unmasking because of, you know, the high number of unmaskings and some that do not readily appear to have been in the line of normal business.REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): Wait a minute, so I want to be clear, so there is a -- there is another investigation on that issue specifically going on at the Justice Department right now.BARR: Yes.JORDAN: Can you give us that U.S. attorney's name or is that something you're comfortable doing?BARR: John Basch of Texas.Federal courts are under attack. Since when is it OK to try to bun down a federal court?The U.S. Marshals have a duty to stop that and defend the courthouse. And that's what we are doing in Portland. We are at the courthouse defending the courthouse. We're not out looking for trouble.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now, former White House deputy press secretary and Trump 2020 presidential campaign national press secretary, Hogan Gidley.Hogan, it's great to see you again. Thanks so much for being here.GIDLEY: Absolutely. Great to be with you. Thanks so much for the time.BARTIROMO: So what was your reaction to that hearing yesterday? It felt like it was a whole lot of politics, frankly.GIDLEY: It really was. And words like "shameful" and "disgraceful" and "disgusting all come to mind and they're accurate, but they don't really do justice for what we saw yesterday. I mean the Democrats refusal to hear the truth, or even want to, is dangerous for the future of this country. I don't want to overstate that. I can't understate it because an American presidential campaign was spied upon by the government of the United States and they didn't want to hear about it.Our city streets are devolving into lawlessness where there is rioting and looting and innocent Americans being dragged into the streets, beaten, simply for trying to protect their own businesses. And they call it a myth and don't want to hear the truth about churches being burned and buildings being burned? Ask the people who have lost their lives. Ask the people who have lost their businesses. Those sweet children in our -- in our -- in our big cities like New York being hit by stray bullets killed.BARTIROMO: Yes.GIDLEY: Ask them if that's a myth.BARTIROMO: Yes.GIDLEY: And the only person standing up to this is Donald Trump. He wants law and order. He wants safety and security in our city streets. And all Joe Biden does when he pops up out of his hidey hole is makes excuses and say defund the police. That's not a strategy that's going to work.BARTIROMO: Yes.GIDLEY: And no American is going to appreciate that type of head in the sand mentality to ignore what's going on in our city streets and communities.BARTIROMO: Well, I mean, it really is extraordinary that you don't hear one Democrat raise the issues of what took place in 2016. I mean we know that there was criminality already. We know that one FBI agent changed evidence, you know, said that Carter Page wasn't an asset for the CIA when, in fact, he was. We know that two out of four of the -- of the FISA warrants unlawful. I mean we know all of this already. We know that there was leaking to Congress, there was lying to Congress, and yet not a word. It's really embarrassing, actually, that we would not all agree that we don't want the power in Washington to put their finger on the scale in a major presidential election, and then to call some of these things peaceful protests when they're not.Do you think voters, at the end of the day, will hold them accountable for all of this?GIDLEY: Yes, absolutely, they will. And, look, there was one Democrat saying something, thankfully, on your show because you pressed Valerie Jarrett yesterday and she said, that's four years ago. What are we worried about spying on -- on American citizens four years ago.But I can tell you this, your American way of life is -- is not safe with Joe Biden. Your cultural is not safe with Joe Biden. His policies are absolutely set up to allow this lawlessness to continue. Donald Trump has been working with these mayors and these governor at the local level, trying to get federal assets into these cities to help with the protection effort. And you're seeing it time and time again. So many across this country are watching what's happening and they're saying, I don't want that to occur in my town, I don't want that in my community.BARTIROMO: Yes.GIDLEY: But rest assured, it's coming because the Democrats aren't going to stand in the gap, Joe Biden sure isn't going to work to stop it but President Donald Trump will.BARTIROMO: I'm going to get your take on the stimulus struggles, but before we do, Valerie Jarrett did join me yesterday and I asked her about President Trump's involvement in all this spying as there's lots of speculation about who knew what and when. Here is what she said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Did President Obama direct any of this?VALERIE JARRETT: That's not how it works. That's not how our investigations work. That -- we leave that to the intelligence community to bring forward information and -- and -- and the dossier, I would imagine, would be one piece of a much bigger puzzle. And so if you're saying, is it important to make sure that there isn't influences -- and, actually, the Mueller report didn't conclude that there wasn't any wrongdoing. In fact, he was explicit in saying quite the opposite. And so I don't think we should read in where there hasn't been actually any conclusions to that effect yet.BARTIROMO: Well, I --JARRETT: You're making statement that actually haven't been proven --BARTIROMO: Just -- just to be clear --JARRETT: (INAUDIBLE) based in fact.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: And what I was saying was, just to be clear, Robert Mueller did say no collusion. Michael Horowitz did say no collusion --GIDLEY: That's right.BARTIROMO: And yet we're not seeing the admission from the media and we're not seeing admission from the Democrats, Hogan.GIDLEY: Well, it -- it absolutely destroys their narrative that Donald Trump somehow colluded with a foreign entity. I mean what a -- with a bogus charge, what a complete and total lie.We now know, because of released documents, thankfully, at the IG level, that in 2017, higher-ups in the FISA courts and other plays in the FBI knew that the sub sources were bogus --BARTIROMO: Right.GIDLEY: That the whole dossier was built on a house of cards, a cornerstone of lies. And they kept moving forward with it anyway.BARTIROMO: Yes.GIDLEY: And I shudder to think what would happen had Donald Trump not been elected president, we would never know the names of Peter Strzok and Lisa Page.BARTIROMO: I know.GIDLEY: We wouldn't know about the corruption of Comey, Clapper, Brennan.BARTIROMO: You're right.GIDLEY: And now we do. Donald Trump rooted out corruption in his first term. He's talked about draining the swamp, which he has done in this first term and he'll continue to do it till it's bone-dry in the end of the second.BARTIROMO: Yes.Well, what I -- what I always say is, look, if -- if a sitting president can be treated this way, that the FBI just investigates sitting presidents -- I mean they had wiretaps on Carter Page throughout 2017.GIDLEY: That's right.BARTIROMO: Then the rest of us have no shot for any fairness.GIDLEY: That's right. Absolutely.BARTIROMO: If you've got an actual president of the United States, people being spied on.Let me move on to the battle over the next round of Covid-19 and this aid that is so needed. Days after Republicans unveiled their proposal, Democrats and some Republicans are not sold on the proposal. President Trump is -- weighed in yesterday. Here's what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: All of the people involved, Steve Mnuchin's done a great job. Keeps everybody together. Both Democrat and Republican. And we'll see. We want to do what's best for the people. I want to do what's best for the people. I want to do what's best for the economy, because that means jobs and lots of good things, all right?(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: And this still back-and-forth fighting, are they going to get a deal done, Hogan, before they leave again on August 7th?GIDLEY: Look, I sure hope so. The American people deserve it. This president has been fighting to make sure that in the -- in the face of this unforeseen, unprecedented virus that was sent here by China, that the American people are protected, that they're safe, that it's not just about health, it's about their well-being.BARTIROMO: Yes.GIDLEY: And these stimulus checks, this money, these trillions of dollars we've infused into the bank accounts of so many Americans has really worked to keep this country going to some degree. It allows people to actually pay rent. It allows people to put food on the table in this --BARTIROMO: Yes.GIDLEY: In this difficult time. This president's pushed for that at every single turn. Democrats, whether it's DACA, whether it's, you know, the riots and looting, whether it's this stimulus package and coronavirus, they want to play politics with it. They do not care about the future of the American people. They care about the future of their political power.BARTIROMO: Yes.GIDLEY: You see it every day, and it's on display with this stimulus package. They push for green new deal nonsense in the first couple of trillion-dollar checks that went to, you know, destroy our economy. They're pushing for more craziness in this one as well. The fact is, this president is looking out for the people. He does it every single day. It was an honor for me to stand by his side while he did it. Now I'm fighting on the campaign side of it and watching it. And what I see now is what I saw then. He wants the American people's future safe and secure. He wants them healthy. And these types of battles with Capitol Hill prove the point --BARTIROMO: Yes.GIDLEY: Somebody's in it for the American people and somebody's in it for politics.BARTIROMO: Real -- real -- real quick -- yes, let me bring in Dagen McDowell real quick.Go ahead, Dagen.MCDOWELL: Hogan, then why is President Trump trailing Joe Biden, who has barely been out on the campaign trail and his only presence is really, you know, out of his house? He's trailing in national polls. He's trailing in all the swing state polls. And Valerie Jarrett pivots to the here and now because the number one issue for Americans is the coronavirus. It's not the economy. It's not even race relations. And according to the latest Fox News poll, President Trump trails Joe Biden on doing a better job on coronavirus by 17 points. Why isn't the president's message resonating then?GIDLEY: Well, first of all, a lot of those polls are junk. We can talk about methodology and science on those who allow -- it's a -- it --MCDOWELL: Well, that's a cop-out. That's a cop-out and you know it. You can argue that they don't indicate how the election turns out. That's fine. But that's just a cop-out, Hogan.GIDLEY: It's not a cop-out where the numbers bear out the fact that 10 percent more Democrats are surveyed in these polls than there were in 2016. That's just sheer mathematics. I can't change that. So they are skewed to the left for sure.But if we're talking about coronavirus, that's the beauty of this election. So many times we're talking in the abstract, what would it look like if somebody were president. You don't have to guess what it would look like for pandemic responses under Joe Biden. He was in the office of the -- of the White House for eight years. And when H1N1, swine flu, hit this country, all he did was shut down testing and said we're not going to report because 60 million Americans have it, who cares.MCDOWELL: Well, Hogan, these polls clearly -- these -- these polls clearly matter to you and the president --GIDLEY: Of course.MCDOWELL: Because he's changed his position and tone based on that very polling to focus more on virus because you're losing on that subject.GIDLEY: I would disagree that he changed his tone. He's been talking about the safety and security of the American people from day one. We're the ones who mentioned the coronavirus in the -- the state of the Union at the first of the year. It was Joe Biden who said go out and party, everything's fine and called us xenophobic for shutting down travel into this country to protect and save lives. This bold, decisive action from this president --BARTIROMO: Yes.GIDLEY: Saved American lives. And I promise you, as we get closer to the election and the American people start to drill down on this and see that elections are about choices, the choice is clear, if they want safety, security, health and well-being --BARTIROMO: Yes.GIDLEY: It's Donald Trump, not Joe Biden.BARTIROMO: I would just throw in, Dagen, I think we could probably handle dealing with the coronavirus and having that conversation, as well as dealing with the conversation of the massive wrongdoing that took place in 2016 and 2017. I understand Valerie Jarrett's pivot, but I think we can probably do both and ensure that we have fair elections --MCDOWELL: But -- but they -- but one takes priority over the --BARTIROMO: And you don't have a powerful person at the FBI putting his finger on the -- on the -- on the button.MCDOWELL: But one takes -- but if you're -- if you want to get re-elected, the coronavirus, the American voter is saying that is the number one issue, so something has to take a priority.BARTIROMO: Yes.GIDLEY: Well, absolutely, but it is --BARTIROMO: Oh, sure, but that doesn't mean the Obama administration shouldn't answer for these questions. It doesn't mean the Obama administration should not be forced to answer what the heck happened in 2016 and why was there a whole story created of collusion that had the whole public going nuts for three years.GIDLEY: Right. Look, while -- while the media -- while the media went from crisis to crisis, this president went from solution to solution. He's the one who's solving this, not the left, not the liberals, not Joe Biden. They don't have a plan. They don't have any ideas of how to fix this.BARTIROMO: Hogan, thank you so much.Hogan Gidley.We're looking at New York real estate next with Bill Rudin.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Signed, sealed and leased. Some signs of hope for New York City's real estate market. Financial services giant Raymond James signing a major office lease for 160,000 square feet on Park Avenue, according to "The New York Post." The Florida' based firm says it's consolidating smaller locations in Manhattan.Joining me right now to talk more about the state of New York is one of the leading real estate companies, Rudin Management Company's CEO and Co- Chairman Bill Rudin.Bill, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks so much for joining me.BILL RUDIN, CEO AND CO-CHAIRMAN, RUDIN MANAGEMENT COMPANY: Good morning, Maria. Good to be with you.BARTIROMO: So I know that this pandemic has really changed the behaviors and the plans for a lot of people. Give us the state of affairs in New York right now in terms of commercial real estate. Are you seeing increasingly that companies are saying we don't need all of this space, we've got lots of people working from home? And give us the signs of hope that you may be seeing on the other side of that.RUDIN: Well, you just -- at the top of the segment you mentioned about Raymond James. That's a very positive sign. On top of the announcement last week that AIG, the insurance giant, has signed a million square -- half a million square feet of leases, moving their headquarters right around the corner from Fox headquarters on Sixth Avenue at the old "Time Life" building. And they're expanding downtown.Then we also have Bank National the Paribas BNP renewing their lease also not far from where your headquarters are on Seventh Avenue. And we're seeing companies start to dip their toe back in the water. These, you know, leases that were signed, you know, reaffirm that, but we're also seeing, now that we can -- we're back into phase four in terms of reopening, brokers are allowed to take their customers, with proper protocol, through spaces and we're seeing a significant increase in -- in touring. We're seeing people who were in negotiation in the -- in January, February, March who have stopped their deals now starting to revive it.BARTIROMO: Right.RUDIN: We have a couple of deals in our portfolio.BARTIROMO: All right.RUDIN: We're moving forward with a -- right around the corner again from you a major renovation at Three Times Square.BARTIROMO: Yes.RUDIN: So, you know, what -- we're starting to see these green shoots happening.BARTIROMO: I want to see what it's going to look like. Bill, I want to see how we're going to change the workplace. Let's talk about that.Slip in a short break and come right back.More with Bill Rudin when we come right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.We are back with Rudin Management Company CEO and Co-chairmen Bill Rudin.Getting back to work. This pandemic rapidly reshaping how companies do business. Many shifting to working from home.Bill, tell me about the changes that we're going to see in buildings. How does this retrofitting look different given these new worries about -- about social distancing amid Covid?RUDIN: Well, we're going to -- we've already implemented all these protocols. You have to wear a mask when you come into our building. We have limitations on elevator occupancy. We have social distancing requirements within our space. And, you know, we have hand sanitizers and we constantly remind our tenants we have a -- a online notebook that we send to our tenants, you know, that explains to them what the rules are and I think everybody is retrofitting their spaces, putting up sneeze guards, making sure that everyone's safe. We've increased our filter capacities within our buildings. We're providing more fresh air.So we're really focused on making sure that the environment that our tenants come back into is the safe as possibly can be. We have an app that we can provide information to our tenants. So we're finding people, as they start to onboard appreciate all the things that we're doing, and we're starting to see slowly increasing of people coming back to work.You had a segment a minute ago about Starbucks reopening their stores.BARTIROMO: Yes.RUDIN: That's very important. We need to have that activity on the -- on the street.But, Maria, I think the key thing that we need in our city, and all cities across the country, you've mentioned many times this morning with Senator Coons and others, the federal Covid four relief bill. We -- cities and states are -- where -- we went from the worst state in terms of infections to the best state. We don't want this to come back to us.BARTIROMO: Yes.RUDIN: But we've taken severe budget hits.BARTIROMO: Yes.RUDIN: And that's going to happen all across the country. So we're encouraging every congressman and senator and the White House to get in a room and work out this deal and make sure that the American people get the relief that we all need to move our economy forward.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, obviously, New York needs help. A lot of states need help right now.Bill, we'll be watching the developments. Thanks so much. Great insights from you, as always.Bill Rudin.More MORNINGS WITH MARIA right after this.BARTIROMO: Thanks everybody, Dagen McDowell, Philip Wegmann, Scott Martin, great to see you.Have a wonderful day everybody. Thank you for joining us. Varney & Co. is up next.Stu, take it away.Load-Date: July 29, 2020End of Document

The US wants to kill part of an 8,000 mile-long undersea cable linking Hong Kong with LA over China spying fearsBusiness Insider USJune 18, 2020 Thursday 05:17 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 456 wordsByline: feedback@businessinsider.com,  (Isobel Asher Hamilton)Highlight: A DOJ committee is worried a cable connecting the US with Hong Kong could be vulnerable to hacking by the Chinese government.BodyGetty/ullstein bild/Contributor• In 2016 Google and Facebook announced a new high-speed undersea cable connecting Hong Kong and Los Angeles.• The cable is now laid, but a DOJ committee has advised the FCC deny approval for the Hong Kong section of the cable.• The committee is worried the cable could be tapped by the Chinese government.• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.The US government seems poised to stunt a multimillion undersea cable project by Google and Facebook.The cable is part of the Pacific Light Cable Network and was announced in 2016. Google said at the time the cable would be 8,000 miles long and span the Pacific Ocean, linking Los Angeles with Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the Philippines. It is designed to manage 120 terabytes of data per second, or 80 million HD videoconference calls between LA and Hong Kong, according to Google's statements in 2016.A Depart of Justice committee called Team Telecom has now recommended to the FCC that the part of the cable connecting Hong Kong be rejected on security grounds.The committee said it fears a cable to Hong Kong could be vulnerable to being tapped by the Chinese government, and is particularly concerned by  the fact a large investor in the cable was a Hong Kong-based company called Dr. Peng Ltd which it says is the "fourth largest provider of telecommunications services in the PRC [People's Republic of China]."More broadly it says the cable could help China make Hong Kong a pan-Asian Pacific telecommunications hub, meaning US data would be more likely to pass through Chinese infrastructure even if China wasn't its final destination.The US government's fears were heightened is due to "the PRC government's recent actions to remove Hong Kong's autonomy and allow for the possibility that PRC intelligence and security services will operate openly in Hong Kong."In May China introduced sweeping new legislation for Hong Kong, cracking down on dissent and taking away many of the region's semi-autonomous powers, sparking widespread protests.Team Telecom said the portions connecting the US with Taiwan and the Philippines should be allowed to function.NOW WATCH: Why electric planes haven't taken off yetSee Also:• Here are the top 10 US colleges that tech giants such as Google, Apple, and Facebook hire from, according to new LinkedIn data• Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai are reportedly willing to testify before Congress over antitrust concerns on the condition that Jeff Bezos and Tim Cook testify as well• European regulators just set a July 20 deadline to decide whether they will allow Google's Fitbit deal to passSEE ALSO: Here are the most explosive claims former national security adviser John Bolton made about Trump in his upcoming bookLoad-Date: June 18, 2020End of Document

The United States is 'looking at' banning TikTok and other Chinese social media apps, Pompeo saysCNN WireJuly 7, 2020 Tuesday 6:36 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 497 wordsDateline: HONG KONG/WASHINGTON (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG/WASHINGTON (CNN Business) --  The United States is "looking at" banning Chinese social media apps, including TikTok, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Monday. Pompeo suggested the possible move during an interview with Fox News' Laura Ingraham, adding that "we're taking this very seriously."Pompeo was asked by Ingraham whether the United States should be considering a ban on Chinese social media apps, "especially TikTok.""With respect to Chinese apps on people's cell phones, I can assure you the United States will get this one right too, Laura," he said. "I don't want to get out in front of the President [Donald Trump], but it's something we're looking at."Washington's top diplomat added that people should only download the app "if you want your private information in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.""TikTok is led by an American CEO, with hundreds of employees and key leaders across safety, security, product, and public policy here in the US," a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement following Pompeo's comments. "We have no higher priority than promoting a safe and secure app experience for our users. We have never provided user data to the Chinese government, nor would we do so if asked."Pompeo's remarks come during a time of heightened tensions between the United States and China, which have spilled over into several arenas including national security, trade and technology. TikTok --- which is owned by Beijing-based startup ByteDance --- has been repeatedly criticized by US politicians who accused the short-form video app of being a threat to national security because of its ties to China. They allege that the company could be compelled to "support and cooperate with intelligence work controlled by the Chinese Communist Party."TikTok has said previously that it operates separately from ByteDance. It says its data centers are located entirely outside of China, and that none of that data is subject to Chinese law. US user data is stored in the United States, with a backup in Singapore, according to TikTok. A spokesperson for the company told CNN Business in May that it thinks the national security concerns are "unfounded."The app has exploded in popularity in the United States and other western countries, becoming the first Chinese social media platform to gain significant traction with users outside of its home country. It was downloaded 315 million times in the first three months of this year, more quarterly downloads than any other app in history, according to analytics company Sensor Tower.The company has also run into roadblocks elsewhere. Last week, the Indian government said it would ban TikTok and other well-known Chinese apps because they pose a "threat to sovereignty and integrity." Tensions between India and China have been escalating after a clash along the Himalayan border. -- Sherisse Pham contributed to this report. TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

CHINA ORDERS US MEDIA TO HAND OVER OPERATIONAL RECORDS AFTER US MOVEStates News ServiceJuly 1, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 487 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:China on Wednesday ordered four U.S. media organizations to hand over details of their operations in the country in retaliation over widening U.S. restrictions on its state media, which Washington says are propaganda organizations run by the ruling Chinese Communist Party.The Associated Press, UPI, CBS, and National Public Radio have been asked to provide details of their staff, financial operations, and real estate in China within seven days, foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said."We urge the U.S. to immediately change course, correct its error, and desist in the political suppression and unreasonable restriction of Chinese media," Zhao told a regular news briefing in Beijing.The United States and China have been engaged in a series of retaliatory actions involving journalists in recent months, amid increasing tensions over a range of issues from the coronavirus pandemic to Hong Kong.The move came after the U.S. said last month it had added another four Chinese state media outlets to the list of agencies regarded as foreign embassies.The State Department said in a June 22 statement that China's news organizations have been reorganized under Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping, who now exerts even more direct control over them than previously."[Chinese] media are beholden to the Chinese Communist Party," it said, designating the U.S. operations of state broadcaster CCTV, the China News Service, Communist Party mouthpiece the People's Daily, and its sister-paper the Global Times as representatives of China on U.S. soil.Earlier, the State Department had added state news agency Xinhua, the China Global Television Network (CGTN), China Radio International (CRI), the China Daily Distribution Corp., and Hai Tian Development USA. as foreign missions on the same grounds.Chinese government controlAll the organizations met the definition of a foreign mission under the Foreign Missions Act, which is to say that they are "substantially owned or effectively controlled" by a foreign government, the statement said."In this case, they are effectively controlled by the government of the People's Republic of China," it said, adding that the decision didn't refer to the content produced by these organizations."Entities designated as foreign missions must adhere to certain administrative requirements that also apply to foreign embassies and consulates in the United States," the statement said.China in March effectively expelled around a dozen U.S. journalists from the New York Times, the News Corp-owned Wall Street Journal, and the Washington Post in retaliation over the initial announcement.It also asked those outlets, as well as broadcaster Voice of America and Time magazine, to provide details of their China operations.Reported by RFA's Cantonese and Mandarin Services.

China charges 2 Canadians with spying in Huawei-linked caseAssociated Press Financial WireJune 19, 2020 Friday 5:27 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 774 wordsByline: KEN MORITSUGU, Associated PressDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) — Chinese prosecutors charged two detained Canadians with spying Friday in an apparent bid to step up pressure on Canada to drop a U.S. extradition request for a Huawei executive under house arrest in Vancouver.Michael Kovrig was charged by Beijing on suspicion of spying for state secrets and intelligence. Michael Spavor was charged in Dandong, a city near the North Korean border, on suspicion of spying for a foreign entity and illegally providing state secrets.The charges were announced by China’s highest prosecutor’s office in brief social media posts.Asked what evidence China had against the two, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said only that each is charged with “secretly gathering state secrets for overseas forces with particularly serious consequences.”“The facts are clear and the evidence solid and sufficient," Zhao told reporters at a daily briefing. Zhao gave no details.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he was “very disappointed” by China's latest move and called it a very difficult time for the two Canadians and their families. “The Chinese authorities have directly linked the case of the two Michaels to the judicial proceedings against Mrs. Meng, which is extremely disappointing," Trudeau said. “These Canadian citizens are being held for no other reason than the Chinese government being disappointed with the independent proceedings of the Canadian judiciary.”Trudeau said they will continue to press the Chinese for their release and said Canada's allies are equally concerned.Both men have been held for 18 months. They were detained shortly after the December 2018 arrest of Meng Wanzhou, a top executive at Chinese tech giant Huawei. The daughter of Huawei’s founder was arrested at the request of U.S. authorities who want her on fraud charges related to trade with Iran.A Canadian judge ruled this month that the U.S. extradition case against Meng could proceed to the next stage.China has denied any explicit link between her case and the lengthy detention of the two Canadian men, but outside experts see them as tied and Chinese diplomats have strongly implied a connection.Meng has been released on bail while her extradition case proceeds in court and is residing in one of her two Vancouver mansions where she is reportedly working on a graduate degree. Kovrig and Spavor are being held at an undisclosed location and up to now, have been denied access to lawyers or family members.China has also sentenced two other Canadians to death and suspended imports of Canadian canola, while saying those moves were also unrelated to Meng’s case.Relations between Canada and China are at their lowest point since the Chinese military’s bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protests centered on Beijing’s Tiananmen Square in 1989. "I was heartbroken and I was really angry when I learned of the latest development with the two Michaels,” Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said. “We will not rest until they are able to come home.”Freeland also said China must provide consular access to them. Canadian officials have not been granted consular access to to them since mid-January.Kovrig worked as a Hong Kong-based analyst at the non-government International Crisis Group. He previously worked as a diplomat for Canada.“This is yet another arbitrary and baseless step in a case that has been arbitrary and baseless from day one. Michael was not endangering China’s security: everything he was doing was in the open and well known to China’s authorities,” International Crisis Group President and Chief Executive Officer Robert Malley said in a statement.The tensions appear to be causing further harm to Huawei’s reputation in the Americas, with two of Canada’s three major telecommunication companies announcing earlier this month that they’ve decided not to use the Chinese tech giant for their next-generation 5G wireless network.Bell Canada announced that Sweden-based Ericsson will be its supplier and Telus Corp. later announced that it had also selected Ericsson and Nokia.Huawei is the world’s biggest supplier of network gear used by phone and internet companies, but has long been seen as a front for spying by China’s military and its highly skilled security services.The U.S. has urged Canada to exclude Huawei equipment from their next-generation wireless networks, saying Huawei is legally beholden to the Chinese regime. The United States and Australia have banned Huawei, citing concerns it is an organ of Chinese military intelligence — a charge the company denies.____Associated Press writer Rob Gillies in Toronto contributed to this report.Load-Date: June 19, 2020End of Document

TikTok May Make Changes to Distance Itself from China amid U.S. PressureNewsweek.comJuly 10, 2020 Friday 5:17 AM ESTCopyright © 2020 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 694 wordsByline: Jason MurdockHighlight: Officials from ByteDance, the Beijing-based tech startup that owns the short-form video app, are now mulling a shake-up of TikTok's corporate structure, a new report suggests.BodySenior executives from TikTok's parent company are reportedly considering ways to distance the popular app from China, as U.S. pressure mounts.Officials from ByteDance, the Beijing-based tech startup that owns the short-form video app, are now mulling a shake-up of TikTok's corporate structure that could see it launch a new headquarters outside of China, TheWall Street Journal reported.According to the paper, early-stage talks raised the possibility TikTok could install a new management board that would further separate it from the operations of its parent firm. Possible HQ locations have been touted as Singapore, London or Dublin.Plans are being accelerated due to "recent events," a source told the Journal, speaking after threats of an investigation or ban by Trump administration officials.A TikTok rep told Newsweek: "As we consider the best path forward, ByteDance is evaluating changes to the corporate structure of its TikTok business.""We remain fully committed to protecting our users' privacy and security as we build a platform that inspires creativity and brings joy for hundreds of millions of people around the world. We will move forward in the best interest of our users, employees, artists, creators, partners, and policymakers," a company statement added.It is unclear if distilling TikTok's structure would allay the fears of U.S. politicians, who have repeatedly claimed the app's close links to China are a national security concern, leaving U.S. user data at risk of being exposed to a foreign government.TikTok, which is hugely popular with teenagers across the world, had been downloaded more than two billion times globally as of April, according to Sensor Tower data. In the first quarter this year, TikTok attracted 165 million installs by U.S. users."While TikTok was on the ascent before 2020, the app has hit new levels of popularity so far this year. Its record-breaking Q1 came during a global pandemic, leading in part to an increase in downloads, engagement, and revenue," the analytics firm said.Since May this year, TikTok has been led by ex-Disney streaming executive Kevin Mayer, who is based in California. Inside China, a version of the app is called Douyin.While opposition to the app in the U.S. has existed for months, it surged this week after comments made by secretary of state Mike Pompeo, later backed up by President Donald Trump, suggested TikTok could be outlawed by the U.S. government.When asked if U.S. citizens should ever download the mobile app during an interview on Fox News' The Ingraham Angle on Monday, Pompeo told the host: "Only if you want your private information in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party." His comments came after India banned TikTok and dozens more apps over security concerns.In its company statements, TikTok has repeatedly denied working with the Chinese government, asserting that it never hands over its users' data."TikTok is led by an American CEO, with hundreds of employees and key leaders across safety, security, product, and public policy here in the U.S. We have no higher priority than promoting a safe and secure app experience for our users. We have never provided user data to the Chinese government, nor would we do so if asked," the firm said.In a previous blog, TikTok claimed that U.S. user data is stored in the U.S., with a backup redundancy held in Singapore. "Our data centers are located entirely outside of China, and none of our data is subject to Chinese law," it asserted.This week, TikTok ceased operating in Hong Kong over a controversial new security law, following similar actions by tech firms Google, Facebook and Twitter.Regardless, speculation of an imminent ban surged across social media this week, only made worse on Thursday after the app suffered a temporary service outage. If it were to go ahead, download statistics suggest it would affect millions of U.S. users.The following graphic, provided by Statista, shows the countries where TikTok has been downloaded the most. It is based on app download figures as of June 30 this year.This article was updated to add a Statista graphic and a response from TikTok. Link to ImageGraphic TikTokMANJUNATH KIRAN/AFP/GettyAn Indian mobile user browses through the Chinese owned video-sharing 'Tik Tok' app on a smartphone in Bangalore on June 30, 2020.Load-Date: July 10, 2020End of Document

Meet The Politician Who Lives on TikTokPolitico.comJuly 16, 2020 Thursday 4:01 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 1405 wordsHighlight: Minnesota state Sen. Matt Little has built a national Gen Z following by embracing the app that other politicians shun.BodyWhen reports began surfacing that President Donald Trump's plans to ban the video app TikTok wouldn't go into effect immediately, Minnesota State Sen. Matt Little responded in typical fashion - by lip-syncing along to DJ Khaled's 2010 hit "All I Do Is Win" in a TikTok video.The 35-year-old Little is a rarity: A politician who fully embraces the Chinese-owned social media site, which is taboo to many in Washington because of concerns that it could be used as a data-collecting tool for the Chinese government.Unafraid to look goofy, the tousle-haired Little leads a tiny cadre of politicians, almost all Democrats, who have defied calls for a ban and used the app to reach young voters.The best-known by far is Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey, who is in the race of his life against an opponent three and a half decades his junior, Rep. Joe Kennedy III. Though Markey is one of the Senate's most prominent voices on tech issues, the footprint of his official account is small - just under 9,000 followers. By contrast, Little has more than 140,000, making him, according to a POLITICO analysis, easily the most followed American politician active on the hugely popular app.For the handful of politicians who've embraced it, TikTok fills a couple of important voids. For one, it's among the few vehicles guaranteed to attract one of the most elusive demographics - Generation Z, the very youngest voters. And at a time when Covid-19 makes door-to-door connections unlikely, Markey's campaign manager John Walsh sees it as a way to connect directly, and informally, to voters.A Markey video shows the septuagenarian senator in khakis draining free-throws on a basketball court while a speech extolling the virtues of the Green New Deal plays in the background. The campaign says the hashtag #edmarkey has reached over 800,000 people on the app."We go where people are, and young people are there," Walsh said of the app. "It's a bunch of teenagers and a 74-year-old United States senator."Both Little and the Markey campaign downplayed any concerns about TikTok presenting a national security risk."Ed Markey recognizes that TikTok as a platform is far from perfect when it comes to privacy and he has called for the Federal Trade Commission to increase its attention to the dangers that minors encounter online, including the use of their personal data for advertising dollars," Paul Bologna, Markey's digital and creative director, said in a statement in response to questions over the app's security concerns.Little put it this way: "I think TikTok's getting singled out because it's been the younger generation's tool for politics," he said, citing other popular Chinese-based apps like gaming app PUBG that don't receive similar attention."If they want to see my Google Maps running back and forth to the Capitol or going out campaigning, they can see that," Little added, noting he uses the app on his personal phone and not on any government property.But most politicians, across party lines, are far more skittish - shunning TikTok almost entirely. Markey posted a video touting the endorsement of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), but Ocasio-Cortez herself, though known for her social-media savvy and her 6 million Instagram followers, does not post on TikTok.In March, Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.) authored legislation that would ban TikTok from the phones of TSA workers. She said in a statement that lawmakers using TikTok concern her, as politicians can be the target of intelligence operations and their accounts can inadvertently send the message that the app is "completely harmless.""When it comes to cybersecurity and protecting the privacy and data of the American people, our government - including elected officials - should set an example for the public," Spanberger, a former CIA officer, said. "As representatives, we should always be looking for ways to communicate with our constituents, but we cannot lose sight of risks associated with certain tools, especially when they can be manipulated by foreign adversaries."The issue has also struck a chord among GOP lawmakers wary of Chinese influence on American lives. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), the most outspoken TikTok critic in Congress, labeled TikTok "a surveillance apparatus for Beijing" and "a Trojan horse" in a statement.Hawley has co-authored legislation with Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) that would further ban the Chinese-owned app from the phones of government employees - a measure the Senate passed on August. The Missouri Republican also wrote a letter with Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) urging the Justice Department to open an investigation into the social media platform."TikTok not only captures the videos that you upload, but it also monitors your keystrokes, what websites you visit, your contact list - all when it's just running in the background," Hawley said in a statement. "Not only does TikTok scoop up that data, but its parent company ByteDance is based in China where Chinese law requires companies to share sensitive data with the Chinese Communist Party."TikTok officials dispute the notion that the app represents anything more nefarious than any other social-media site, arguing TikTok is unfairly targeted due to its Chinese origins. They say they follow U.S. law and point to their pledge to employ thousands of Americans as evidence of TikTok's role as "responsible and committed members of the American community."Meanwhile, millions of American teenagers and young adults have flocked to the social media app, sharing short videos, dancing along to hit songs and circulating viral memes. A 2018 analysis found 41 percent of the app's users are 16 to 24 years old, and TikTok's popularity has only ballooned in years since.TikTok prioritizes authenticity, something young voters often find in short supply among politicians, and so succeeding on TikTok can be like breaking a complicated code. That's why Little, for one, insists that it's such a valuable tool.He launched his TikTok account in January, aiming to gain 2,000 followers. Now, the state lawmaker - a lawyer and former union official who was little known outside his district of around 80,000 south of the Twin Cities -- has seen his hundreds of videos garner over two and a half million likes in total. Users flood him with comments noting his uncanny resemblance to "Parks and Recreation" character Ben Wyatt, urging Little to run for president and lamenting the fact that some can't vote for him due to their location.In one TikTok video, Little sums up his legislative priorities while lip-synching to "Exactly How I Feel" by local artist Lizzo. With each repetition of the chorus, Little points to text popping up on the screen: "Prescription drugs should be affordable." "We need affordable college." "Paid Family Leave." "Affordable childcare." "Automatic voter registration." "Campaign Finance Reform."While the Democratic state senator peppers his policy views throughout his hundreds of videos, his jokes reign supreme: The nearly 8,000 likes on Little's policy-oriented video are dwarfed in comparison by the 316,000 likes on a clip that features another politician checking in to see if Little is "still using TikTok.""Oh hi, thanks for checking in," Little sings along, while sitting on his office floor. "I'm still a piece of garbage!""The stuff that does well is the self-aware TikToks - I know the reputation of politicians," Little said. "It's hard to be yourself all the time on these apps, but this one really allows me to do that."There are early signs that political organizing on the app can achieve tangible results. In July, Little's account posted a video urging users to Venmo his campaign account small donations to "defeat the Super PACs trying to beat me."Three days later, Little said the campaign had raised $3,500 from around 700 people, driven by Venmo donations.But Little said his TikTok account mainly aims to ease the burden of a tough calendar year."I think people have enjoyed the positivity, the humor, the relief from the typically divisive nastiness that politics comes with," Little said.Little acknowledged that TikTok isn't for everyone, and suggested that many politicians shun it not out of national-security concerns but because they can't handle the demands for authenticity."This app fits my personality," Little said. "But if you get on there and do it wrong, you're just going to get roasted." Load-Date: August 15, 2020End of Document

China's new coronavirus outbreak sees Beijing adopt 'wartime' measures as capital races to contain spreadCNN.comJune 15, 2020 Monday 2:10 AM ESTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: ASIALength: 1054 wordsByline: By Nectar Gan, CNNBodyBeijing is reintroducing strict lockdown measures and rolling out mass testing after a fresh cluster of novel coronavirus cases emerged from the city's largest wholesale food market, sparking fears of a resurgence of the deadly outbreak.The Chinese capital reported 36 new Covid-19 cases on Monday, bringing the total number to 79 since a locally transmitted infection was reported on June 12 for the first time in nearly two months, according to the National Health Commission.The cases are linked to Xinfadi market in the southwest of the city, which supplies most of the capital's fresh fruit and vegetables. The market, which also sells meat and seafood, has been shut down since Saturday.The outbreak has already spread to the provinces of Liaoning and Hebei, where a total of five new cases were found to be close contacts of patients in Beijing.The new cluster has sent shock waves throughout China, with Beijing's municipal government spokesman Xu Hejian describing it as "an extraordinary period" during a press conference Sunday.Chinese state media has repeatedly touted China's effective measures in containing the virus as the number of infections and deaths surged abroad, contrasting its success with the failures of Western governments, especially the United States.The sudden reemergence of the virus in Beijing, previously considered among the country's safest cities, has raised the prospect of a second wave of infections and the possible reintroduction of the types of sweeping lockdowns that had previously brought much of the country to a halt and hammered the economy.At a meeting of the State Council, China's cabinet, late on Sunday, Vice Premier Sun Chunlan said the risk of the latest outbreak spreading was "very high," citing the market's dense and highly mobile population, according to state news agency Xinhua."Wartime" measuresFengtai district, where the Xinfadi market is located, announced Saturday the launch of a "wartime mechanism" and the establishment of a command center to curb the spread of the virus.On social media, the Global Times, a nationalist tabloid run by the Chinese government, posted a video of paramilitary police officers donning face masks patrolling the market after it was closed down on Saturday.Authorities imposed a lockdown on 11 residential compounds in the vicinity of the market, strictly prohibiting anyone from entering or leaving. Residents will have their temperatures checked and reported on a daily basis, and their food and daily necessities delivered.Beijing also rolled out mass nucleic acid testing for the coronavirus, setting up 193 sampling booths across the city. More than 76,000 people were tested on Sunday, with 59 people testing positive, Xu said at a news conference on Monday.Nucleic acid tests work by detecting the virus' genetic code, and can be more effective at detecting an infection, particularly in the early stages, than tests which examine a body's immune response, though the latter are easier to conduct.Fengtai district has collected samples from 8,950 people who worked in the Xinfadi market. So far, more than 6,000 samples have been tested and the results are all negative, according to Xu.Authorities also tracked down and collected samples from nearly 30,000 people who had been to the market in the 14 days prior to its closure. All of the 12,000 tests conducted so far showed negative results, Xu said.The Beijing government has ordered anyone who visited the market and their close contacts to stay home for two weeks for medical observation. It also delayed the resumption of classes for elementary school students, which was originally scheduled for Monday.Several local officials, including the deputy head of Fengtai district, have been dismissed following the outbreak.The outbreak is not the first time the virus has returned. In May, several places in the country's northeast were swiftly placed under stringent lockdown after imported cases caused outbreaks among local communities.Before the new cluster, however, Beijing had only recorded 420 local infections and 9 deaths compared to over 80,000 confirmed cases and 4,634 deaths nationwide, thanks to its strict travel restrictions imposed at the start of the pandemic.Like much of the rest of the country, life in Beijing had started to return to normal, with businesses and schools reopening, and crowds returning to shopping malls, restaurants and parks.In a sign of the Chinese government's confidence in its control of the outbreak, the country's parliament even held its annual gathering in late May after a two-month delay, allowing thousands of delegates to traveled to Beijing from across the country and sit side by side for meetings that lasted 10 days.Tracing the sourceThe outbreak in Beijing will be the latest test of China's coronavirus containment strategy.Hu Xijin, the editor-in-chief of Global Times, said on Twitter that Beijing will not become the second Wuhan, the original epicenter of the pandemic where the coronavirus was first detected in December last year."There is no way Beijing becomes Wuhan 2.0. The world will see China's powerful capacity in controlling the epidemic, including (the) government's strong leadership, respect to science, public's willingness to cooperate and nationwide coordination of control measures. We will win again," he wrote in a post Monday.Beijing authorities are still trying to trace the source of the latest outbreak, however, pledging to conduct "the strictest epidemiological investigations."Zhang Yuxi, the market's chairman, told the state-run Beijing News on Friday that the virus had been detected on a chopping board used by a seller of imported salmon at the market, leading to fears of wider contamination. Several supermarket chains have since removed salmon from their shelves, according to Beijing Daily.While investigations are still underway, a researcher with the Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control said genome sequencing indicated the virus found in the market is similar to strains normally found in Europe."But it is still uncertain how the virus originated. It could have come from contaminated seafood or meat, or been transmitted by people who have come into the market via their secretions," Yang Peng, the researcher, told state broadcaster CCTV on Sunday.Load-Date: June 16, 2020End of Document

ICYMI: "CHINA CHEERLEADER" DAINES AMONG VULNERABLE GOP SENATORS "FIGHTING FOR THEIR POLITICAL LIVES" BY PIVOTING TO ANTI-CHINA MESSAGING [NYT]States News ServiceJune 15, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 337 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: HELENA, MT BodyThe following information was released by the Montana Democratic Party:Senator Steve Daines and his vulnerable Senate Republican colleagues are desperately attempting to save their political careers by bashing China, in a shameless move to distract from President Trump's insufficient response to the coronavirus pandemic. Daines' pivot to anti-China rhetoric comes after years of "actively courting senior Communist Party officials" and doing the country's "political bidding." Daines has been so friendly to China while in the Senate that a Chinese government official called him "China's ambassador in Congress."New York Times: Faced With Crisis and Re-election, Senate Republicans Blame ChinaBy: Catie EdmonstonHighlights:Fighting for their political lives amid twin domestic crises a pandemic that has battered the economy vulnerable Republican senators running for re-election are working to divert voters' gazes half a world away and make their races a referendum on China. The tactic, party strategists say, is a way for Republicans to avoid defending the president's handling of the virus, which has been met with widespread public disapproval, and instead offer up an alternative issue that already inspires fear and skepticism among voters.Facing plummeting standing in the polls and few upbeat messaging options, Ms. McSally and several other Republicans have leaned heavily into the message. Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina released a five-point strategy last month meant to hold the Chinese government accountable for its "lies, deception and cover-ups." A video of him standing in front of a poster, labeled "the Tillis Plan" in all capital letters, breaks down each point. In Montana, Senator Steve Daines, who is facing a challenge from the state's popular Democratic governor, Steve Bullock, unveiled a digital and television ad campaign centered on casting China as responsible for the virus. Senator Joni Ernst in Iowa posted on Twitter and Facebook condemning "so many bad actions out of China."###Load-Date: June 15, 2020End of Document

The complicated future of TikTok, the Chinese social network that Trump so hatesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 21, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 742 wordsBodyMaybe in its day, when we talked about TikTok more than a year ago, we were short in defining it as "the app that succeeds among your children and that you won't understand" because, in 2020, there are a good handful of political issues revolved around this short video app.We did get it right when we said it was the first Chinese app to sneak into our day-to-day normality. And that doesn't like a hair to the US, where this past week he put himself on the table vetoing the app for fear that it will be a Chinese propaganda and espionage vehicle."We are considering restricting users' access to the TikTok app because of concerns that the Beijing government is using it as a means of monitoring." That's how Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State, proned.This is reminiscent of what happened with Huawei, the technology manufacturer whose mobiles can no longer use the Android operating system or other technologies originating in the US. The motive behind this veto, the fear that Huawei's antennas and 5G technology could serve as access for the Chinese government.All this effort to block TikTok little or nothing has to do with what happened in June in Tulsa, when a mass of south Korean culture and music fans, the so-called k-popers, organized the site through social media, mainly through TikTok, to boycott President Trump's first electoral rally with astonishing success.Most experts point out that the fear of greater information control from China through apps such as why the US has turned against TikTok. And the app managers don't seem able to remove such a sambenito no matter how much they've moved their servers out of China and signed up to a Disney heavyweight to run the company.The veto in the US would be a hard stick for a social network that has quickly infected its competition. It's easy to find videos with TikTok's watermark on both Instagram and Twitter, where competing-born memes run freely and are widely shared.However, the US or Europe are secondary markets at the moment for TikTok, which has its main problem in Asia. That India, its second largest country in number of users, has vetoed the app is a huge blow. This is not the first time this has happened, as TikTok has already been vetoed by the Indian government's suspicions regarding, yes, data collection for China.The reason behind this second veto is just as complex: on the one hand, the dispustas border with China that have already been killed on both sides. On the other hand, the fear of data collection. On the other, the commercial interests of the great technology in India who, for the most part, want to escape everything that smells like Chinese. And also, some censorship of content among the younger ones.The latter is what worries other Asian countries where TikTok has become a phenomenon above Instagram, as is the case with Pakistan. India's neighbor is finalizing the veto on TikTok after giving them an ultimatum: either they end up with the "immoral, obscene and vulgar" content in their application or they will stop working in their country.In just three years, when TikTok began to gain popularity after becoming what it is today, the great Chinese app for young people faces an imposed limitation of its potential market, which could be limited to China, where it is impossible for it to grow any more; to Europe, where the app is very popular, but there are not enough young people to accumulate a large mass of users; some Asian countries and all but the Us.The impact this can have on its survival in a voracious market such asApplications are yet to be seen, but one thing is clear: there are already sharks willing to eat their share of the market, starting with Instagram. Facebook, which owns the app, will launch its own TikTok within Instagram in August, a mode called Instagram Reels that works just like TikTok.The future of TikTok paints black while having enemies on numerous fronts and may lose any possibility of growing beyond its current user base, which in the face of censorship or the ban on the app quickly migrate to its competitors, who in turn prepare or adapt their products to attract potential TikTok users.At a time when Twitter is a potential danger from the spread of hoaxes and when Facebook is being openly accused of undermining Western democracies, these platforms survive the political climate while products and services from China are being held back by clear political-social motivations or fears.Load-Date: July 22, 2020End of Document

ANOTHER INDONESIAN SAILOR DIES ABOARD A CHINESE FISHING BOATStates News ServiceJuly 9, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 896 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Authorities in Indonesia recovered a corpse and detained two Chinese fishing boats after receiving a tip that the body of an Indonesian sailor had been kept onboard for about a week, police said Thursday.The sailor's death marked the latest case of an Indonesian who died while working aboard a China-flagged boat. At least eight deaths of Indonesians have been reported in various incidents on Chinese fishing boats since November 2019, with crew members complaining that they were subjected to harsh working conditions. The boats involved in the latest case were sailing off Nipa Island near Singapore when they were stopped and their crews detained by Indonesian Coast Guard ships on Wednesday, Riau Islands provincial police spokesman Harry Goldenhardt said. The boats had 32 crew members, including 10 Indonesians. "We received information that an Indonesian migrant worker died on one of the boats and the body had been kept in cold storage for about a week," Goldenhardt told BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service . "We chased the boats and forced them to dock at the naval base," he said, adding that the Indonesian's corpse had been taken to a hospital for an autopsy.The dead sailor was identified as Alfriandi, 20, a resident of Lampung province on Sumatra Island, said Mohammad Abdi Suhufan, coordinator of Destructive Fishing Watch (DFW) Indonesia, an NGO.Previously, DFW and Indonesian authorities had expressed concern about the deaths of seven Indonesians linked to Chinese fishing boats since last November. The corpses of some of those died were thrown overboard.On Thursday, Arie Dharmanto, director of general crimes at the Riau provincial police, said investigators had detained the Lu Huang Yuan Yu 117 and the Lu Huang Yuan Yu 118 boats and their crews, pending a probe into Alfriandi's death."The victim's body was found on the 117. We are still questioning the crew members and delving into the case," Arie told BenarNews.Suhufan said an Indonesian working aboard the Lu Huang Yuan Yu 118 had called DFW's 24-hour hotline to report the death of a compatriot who allegedly had been physically abused by the boat's captain. DFW passed the tip to a team of police, naval and coast guard personnel."Apparently the body was moved from one ship to the other, which is owned by the same company," Suhufan told BenarNews on Thursday.The Chinese embassy in Jakarta did not immediately respond to a request for comment from BenarNews.Previous incidentsOn June 11, Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi urged the Chinese government to conduct "transparent and fair" investigations into the deaths of Indonesian crew members who were allegedly subjected to harsh treatment akin to forced labor.One month earlier, she had condemned the alleged mistreatment of the Indonesian sailors and summoned China's ambassador to Jakarta to respond to her concerns. She asked the Chinese ambassador to explain why sailors' corpses had been thrown overboard."The government has a strong commitment to resolve this case thoroughly," she said on May 10, adding that Indonesia and China would set up a joint investigation into the allegations of abuse.Retno was reacting to a South Korean media report showing an Indonesian crew member who said three bodies were thrown into the sea between December 2019 and March. The report alleged that Indonesian crew members were sometimes forced to work 30 straight hours while standing and were given only six hours to eat and sleep before resuming their duties.More recently, two Indonesian sailors jumped from a Chinese-flagged fishing boat as it sailed in the Malacca Strait on June 5, according to officials. They were rescued off Karimun, an island in the Riau Islands, and taken there the next day after drifting for seven hours in the sea.Suhufan said the men were verbally and physically abused and forced to work long hours.Alleged human traffickingDFW's Suhufan urged authorities to investigate suspected human trafficking involving PT Mandiri Tunggal Bahari (MTB), a company based in the Central Java regency of Tegal that recruited Indonesians to work on Chinese fishing boats, including those detained on Wednesday."Apparently they advertised jobs on Facebook to attract sailors from outside Tegal and Central Java," Suhufan told BenarNews.He said four of the 27 Indonesian sailors who were recruited by MTB to a number of Chinese-flagged fishing vessels had died, while two were missing. The others have returned safely to Indonesia safely.Central Java police spokesman Iskandar Fitriana Sutisna said two top executives at MTB had been formally charged with human trafficking and would stand trial."Their files have been submitted to the prosecutor's office. Just wait for the next process," Iskandar told BenarNews on Thursday.In addition, investigators have named nine people as suspects in the case, including one who worked as a recruiter for MTB, according to Arie of the Riau Islands police. He said investigators are trying to track down a Singapore citizen who is suspected of being a broker as well.Indonesian police previously reported arresting five people from four local labor agencies in connection with previous cases.BenarNews was unable to contact MTB for comment on Thursday.Reported by BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service.Load-Date: July 10, 2020End of Document

Zoom is backing away from China - and doubling down on IndiaCNN WireJuly 24, 2020 Friday 9:06 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1028 wordsDateline: SAN FRANCISCO (CNN Business) BodySAN FRANCISCO (CNN Business) --  The US tech industry's biggest names have made a beeline for India in recent months, and current darling Zoom is following suit.The videoconferencing company announced this week that it will triple its existing workforce in India's financial capital, Mumbai, while also establishing new data centers in the tech hubs of Bangalore and Hyderabad. The company declined to share exactly how many employees it currently has in India and how many more it plans to hire."It's very much the culture of Zoom to be curious, to look for ... opportunities for growth wherever they may present themselves and not to close us off to any option," the company's chief operating officer, Aparna Bawa, told CNN Business in an interview the day after the announcement. India's 700 million-plus internet users --- with roughly 500 million more yet to come online --- increasingly present a must-have prize for Silicon Valley. Facebook, Google, Intel and Qualcomm have collectively poured more than $16 billion into India this year. Zoom's expansion is a response to a spike in usage, with the company saying free user signups in India rocketed 6700% between January and April this year. Zoom has arguably been the breakout star of the coronavirus pandemic, with a meteoric rise in demand for its video calling services as people around the world were forced to work and socialize at home. Daily meeting participants, the metric Zoom uses to track usage, soared from 10 million at the end of December to 300 million in April.The company now appears to be at an inflection point following its pandemic bump and a three-month period to fix its security and privacy issues, and will be looking to sustain that momentum while also charting a path for future growth.But it comes as the company faces pressure to dial back ties with another big market and employee base. Zoom's longstanding ties to China have caused a series of issues --- a controversy over some data being routed through Chinese servers forced it to start allowing users more control over their data, and the company sparked outrage by temporarily shutting down accounts of some human rights groups at the request of the Chinese government. The company also has a sizable workforce in China, including its R&D department of over 700 employees, which the company warned in its annual report "could expose us to market scrutiny regarding the integrity of our solution or data security features." Those ties could become more of a liability as tensions between the US and China increase, particularly when it comes to tech. The Trump administration has led a campaign against Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei, and says it is "looking at" banning short-form video app TikTok, which is owned by ByteDance, a company based in China. And while Zoom is a US company based in San Jose, California, its ties to China --- both real and perceived --- mean it risks getting caught in the crossfire."Given the fact that their network is fairly ingrained in some of the Chinese data centers and overall infrastructure, it's an ongoing risk factor to keep in mind," said Matt VanVliet, vice president of equity research at investment firm BTIG. Zoom in May announced new R&D centers in Phoenix and Pittsburgh, with a plan to hire at least 500 new engineers across the two cities. VanVliet said that move appears to be an attempt at "future proofing" in case of a "more exact line in the sand" from the US as tensions with China escalate.Zoom CEO Eric Yuan acknowledged as much in an interview with CNN Business earlier this year, suggesting a number of locations in the US where the company could move its R&D operations. "If things get worse, we do have a plan," he said.Bawa said the expansion into Bangalore, often referred to as India's Silicon Valley, aims to tap into the country's engineering talent to further shore up its R&D teams."I think it's undebatable that India is a great hub for tech talent," she said. "It's an obvious choice for Zoom as it looks to expand its engineering talent all over the world."India is also rethinking its technological ties with China. A recent border clash between the two countries left 20 Indian soldiers dead, and has ratcheted up tensions that are spilling over into the tech industry. The Indian government last month banned dozens of Chinese apps, including TikTok and WeChat, after widespread calls to boycott products with roots in China.India and China have both been challenging markets for US tech companies. Silicon Valley giants are largely shut out of China because of its massive censorship apparatus known as the Great Firewall. And while they have made more progress in India's comparatively open digital economy, they have had to deal with numerous regulatory roadblocks as India leans toward protectionism. And with technology becoming more of a proxy for security and economic issues between countries, tech firms are having to tread more carefully when it comes to overseas expansion.Meanwhile, as India and the US increasingly align on their distrust of Chinese tech, Zoom has had to deal with perception issues in both countries. "Some of the misconceptions are disheartening, especially those about Zoom and China," Velchamy Sankarlingam, Zoom's head of product, wrote in a lengthy blog post just days after India's ban on Chinese apps. "Like many global technology companies, Zoom has offices in China operated by subsidiaries of the US parent company."It's a clarification Yuan, who was born in China but moved to the US in 1997 and became a US citizen in 2007, has had to make on multiple occasions, including after Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi erroneously referred to Zoom as a "Chinese entity." "It is our job to continue to talk about ourselves in the way that is true," Bawa said. "We're a US company, we're listed on the Nasdaq, headquartered here in San Jose, probably very similar to other technology companies that look for talent globally across the world, and want to put forward the best service that we can put for our customers to use." TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Barr Says China "Stealing And Cheating" To "Supplant" US As Technological LeaderThe FrontrunnerJune 22, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 428 wordsBodyAttorney General Barr, on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures (6/21, 1.94M), discussed the state of US relations with China. Barr said, "This is fundamental challenge to the United States. Since the late 19th century, our opportunity and our growth, our prosperity as a country has come from our technological leadership. We've been the technological leader of the world. In the last decade, China has been putting on a great push to supplant us. They want to be the leader in all the future technologies that are going to dominate the economy. What's at stake is the economic opportunity of our children and our grandchildren. Whether we can continue to be the technological leader of the world. The Chinese have embarked on a very aggressive program during this time of stealing and cheating in order to overtake us. They've stolen our intellectual property. When they steal our secrets about future technology, they're stealing the future of the American people."The Washington Examiner (6/21, Dunleavy, 448K) reports DOJ "has increased its scrutiny of China's activities recently, starting the China Initiative in 2018 and charging espionage cases, cracking down on hacking schemes, prosecuting efforts to steal trade secrets, and going after the Thousand Talents program, including Harvard professor Charles Lieber." Barr "pointed to World War II and quipped, 'We're not speaking German today because the American business...stood with the United States. ... We need American business community's understanding of the nature of the problem right now."Barr Supports Government Stake In Nokia, Ericsson.Barr, on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures (6/21, 1.94M), also discussed the possibility the US government would acquire a minority stake in Nokia and Ericsson to better compete with Huawei, saying, "The two companies in the best position to compete with Huawei are Ericsson and Nokia. But unlike Huawei, Huawei has the backing of the Chinese government and all the Chinese government money. Just to give you an example, for 5G network facilities, the total global addressable market is probably around $90 billion and the Chinese government set up a fund of over $100 billion to subsidize it. So they can go to countries and say we'll put this in cash-free, very cheap money. So that's what we're competing against with Huawei. And companies like Ericsson and Nokia are the strongest western competitors in this sector and I gave a speech saying that ultimately the west has to rally around these companies. Whether that means private ownership or state involvement."Load-Date: June 22, 2020End of Document

U.S. accuses Chinese 'hackers' of attacking vaccine companiesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 22, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 502 wordsBodyThe hackers, identified as Li Xiaoyu and Dong Jiazhi, are accused of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars in intellectual property and trade secrets, information they knew was of value to the Chinese government, prosecutors said, as well as conspiracy to commit computer fraud.According to the Associated Press (AP) news agency, the indictment points out that in January Li conducted a reconnaissance on the computer network of a Massachusetts biotech company known to be investigating a potential vaccine, and sought vulnerabilities in a Maryland company's network, less than a week after the company announced it was conducting similar scientific work.Li also reportedly probed the networks of a California diagnostic company involved in the development of test kits and a biotech company from the same state that conducts antiviral drug research.In some cases, according to the indictment, the defendants also allegedly provided an official with China's secret services with e-mail accounts and passwords belonging to dissidents and pro-democracy activists.The Chinese official also allegedly provided malicious software to hackers after difficulties in attacking the email server of a Burmese human rights group.Computer hacking would have started more than 10 years ago, targeting pharmaceutical and solar companies, but also political dissidents, activists and clergy in the United States, China and Hong Kong, federal officials said.Federal officials admitted on Tuesday that it is not likely that the defendants, who are not in judicial custody, will be tried in U.S. courts, but considered that the charge has a symbolic and deterrent value.Deputy Attorney General John Demers, the Justice Department's top national security official, accused China of "providing a safe haven for hackers."These are the first criminal charges of the U.S. Department of Justice against foreign 'hackers' suspected of targeting the investigation related to the new coronavirus, despite multiple complaints.Last week, the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada accused a group of hackers of being behind an attempt to steal research from a vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, saying they were "almost certainly framed in the Russian secret services."China refuted on July 17 what it called "insulting defamations" and attacks by Washington, after the United States denounced 'hackers' allegedly linked to the Chinese government of attacking U.S. universities and companies to steal research related to the development of a vaccine for the new coronavirus.The covid-19 pandemic has claimed more than 610,000 lives and affected more than 14.7 million people in 196 countries and territories, according to a report by the France-Presse news agency (AFP).The disease is transmitted by a new coronavirus detected in late December in Wuhan, a city in central China.After Europe succeeded China as the center of the pandemic in February, the American continent is now the one with the most confirmed cases and most deaths.Load-Date: July 23, 2020End of Document

Two Chinese Hackers Targeted U.S. COVID Vaccine Research, Military Intelligence, Prosecutors AllegeNewsweek.comJuly 21, 2020 Tuesday 4:16 PM ESTCopyright © 2020 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 578 wordsByline: Meghan RoosHighlight: Two Chinese nationals allegedly hacked computer systems around the world repeatedly starting in 2009. Their latest targets were companies developing COVID-19 vaccines, according to an indictment released earlier this month.BodyAn indictment filed earlier this month against two Chinese nationals alleges they repeatedly hacked into computer systems around the world for more than a decade and recently targeted efforts to produce a vaccine for the new coronavirus.The hackers, who were identified as 34-year-old Li Xiaoyu and 33-year-old Dong Jiazhi, are both wanted by the FBI.The assistant attorney general for national security, John Demers, announced the charges Tuesday with representatives from the FBI and the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Washington. Xiaoyu and Jiazhi both face 11 counts that include conspiring to steal trade secrets and commit wire fraud, identify theft and unauthorized access of computers.Though the indictment alleges Xiaoyu and Jiazhi both worked on behalf of the Guangdong State Security Department, a branch of China's Ministry of State Security, it also accused them of pursuing their own financial gain during some of the alleges incidents.The indictment "highlights how the Chinese government is willing to turn a blind eye to prolific criminal hackers operating within China's borders," Demers said in a statement about the charges."China has now taken its place, alongside Russia, Iran and North Korea, in that shameful club of nations that provide a safe haven for cybercriminals in exchange for those criminals being 'on call' to work for the benefit of the state, here to feed the Chinese Communist Party's insatiable hunger for American and other non-Chinese companies' hard-earned intellectual property, including COVID-19 research," Demers said.The accusations came less than two months after the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency warned Americans that they suspected China was targeting U.S. companies' COVID-19 research efforts.Xiaoyu and Jiazhi allegedly hacked into the computer systems of businesses in the tech, education, civil and pharmaceutical industries, as well as military satellite and communications programs. Individuals—including a community organizer in Hong Kong and a former Tiananmen Square protester—were also allegedly targeted.The U.S. first came across their activities when Xiaoyu and Jiazhi allegedly hacked into U.S. Department of Energy computers in Hanford, Washington, according to U.S. Attorney William D. Hyslop for the District Eastern District of Washington. The indictment said some of the alleged victims were in the U.S. but others were spread out around the world. Xiaoyu's and Jiazhi's latest targets were companies working on COVID-19 research, vaccines, treatments and testing, the indictment alleges."The Defendants stole hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of trade secrets, intellectual property, and other valuable business information," the indictment alleges.The U.S. Department of Justice said in a news release that the "terabytes" of data that the hackers allegedly stole "comprised a sophisticated and prolific threat to U.S. networks."FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich said in a statement the charges against Xiaoyu and Jiazhi served both to punish their alleged actions and to put the Chinese officials behind them "on notice.""There are serious risks and consequences for stealing our technology and our intellectual property," Bowdich said. "China is facing a degradation of their image on the world stage as a trusted partner."Newsweek reached out to the Chinese ambassador to the U.S. but did not receive a response in time for publication.Link to ImageGraphic John DemersZach Gibson/GettyU.S. Assistant Attorney General for the National Security Division John Demers speaks during a news conference discussing new criminal law enforcement action against China for economic espionage on November 1, 2018 in Washington, D.C.

US orders closure of Chinese consulate in Houston, bilateral tensions riseCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 22, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 512 wordsBodyU.S. ordered the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston, a decision announced Wednesday by Pekin that considered it a "provocation"The decision is known amid tensions between the two powers on a number of issues, such as the controversial national security law in Hong Kong, accusations of espionage or the human rights situation in Xinjiang, northwest.The consulate was closed "to protect American intellectual property and Americans' private information," the Trump administration explained without giving further details."The Vienna Convention says that state diplomats must 'respect the laws and rules of the host country' and 'have a duty not to interfere in the internal affairs of that state,'" State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement.American diplomacy added that the communist regime had in the past carried out "mass espionage" in the United States and interfered in domestic politics, put pressure on economic leaders, and "threatened Sino-American families residing in China."According to various Houston media outlets, firefighters went to the consulate Tuesday night because there would be documents burning in the building.Local police confirmed on Twitter that smoke was seen but that relief teams "are not allowed to enter the consulate compound."- "Outrageous and unjustified action" -China has five consulates in the United States. Houston's, Texas, was the first opened in 1979, the year of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.It has 900,000 Chinese citizens registered in their records.Closure "is a political provocation (...) that severely violates international law," said a spokesman for Chinese diplomacy, Wang Wenbin."China condemns this outrageous and unjustified decision," the spokesman added, threatening Washington with "retaliation."In addition to an embassy in Beijing, the United States has five consulates in mainland China and one representation in Hong Kong.The Global Times, the Chinese nationalist newspaper, on Wednesday published a Twitter poll to ask foreign internet users to choose which U.S. consulate to close in retaliation.Although it appears to be unrelated, the decision to close the Houston consulate comes after the indictment in the United States of two Chinese people accused of computer attacks on companies working to seek a vaccine against the new coronavirus.The US Minister of Justice on Tuesday announced the indictment of Li Xiaoyu, 34, and Dong Jiazhi, 33, "two Chinese hackers working with the Chinese Minister of State Security."However, they were not arrested and are initially in China.Beijing rejected these accusations."The Chinese government is a fervent advocate of cybersecurity and always opposed cyberattacks," said Chinese diplomacy spokesman Wang Wenbin, who called on the United States to "immediately cease its slander and defamation."In full tension with Washington, China also warned its students in the United States on Wednesday, more than 300,000, of the risk of "arbitrary interrogations" by US police.lxc-sbr-tl-map/bar/cls/pc/mbLoad-Date: July 23, 2020End of Document

How to Hopscotch China on 5GNewsweek.comJune 4, 2020 Thursday 1:18 PM ESTCopyright © 2020 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 938 wordsByline: James Edwards, Ph.D.Highlight: There is much that the U.S. can do to ensure that China and Huawei do not dominate a 5G world.BodyDuring this time of social distancing and "virtual" connecting, Americans are really appreciating our wireless and cable networks. This infrastructure for working from home and for entertainment—and its reliability and capacity to handle the tremendous demand—is proving a godsend.This new realization comes as fifth generation, or 5G, wireless technology is rapidly developing and beginning to deploy initial service in some locations.Before the coronavirus, long-term capital spending decisions about 5G infrastructure were underway around the world. Several of our allies, Britain among them, have chosen lower cost over security. They've opted, wholly or partially, for Huawei's 5G wireless equipment, despite the serious security vulnerabilities such a decision entails.The reason for such a wrenching choice comes down to having just a handful of equipment makers left. Huawei is reported to be heavily subsidized by the Chinese government. The company has squeezed the profit from the capital-intensive telecom sector and captured the market.It doesn't have to compete fairly and squarely in the marketplace. Thus, competitors can't beat Huawei's artificially rock-bottom prices.Huawei brings a proprietary, vertically integrated system for a bargain-basement price. Only its technicians service its equipment for the next few decades. Only Huawei parts work with the infrastructure.A nice little chokehold arrangement, courtesy of the Chinese government, which under its law may demand Chinese businesses to spy, steal or otherwise snatch from other countries' public and private sectors.Many in business, policy circles and government have increasingly recognized the link between national security and economic security, including in wireless technology. The Trump administration's 2017 National Security Strategy stated this fact outright: "Economic security is national security."Thankfully, there's an ideal solution for 5G. And it leverages American strengths. It hopscotches the capital-intensive infrastructure model by delivering broadband and wireless 5G service via an open radio access network (RAN).Open RAN amounts to a software and cloud computing-based virtual network. Rather than a proprietary soup-to-nuts model, controlled by a single entity from a foreign aggressor nation, 5G delivered by virtual RAN employs an integrated, modular model.It's disaggregated, allowing multiple private companies in free nations to provide different facets of the system. Both established companies and entrepreneurs may offer pieces of the virtualized infrastructure that altogether will provide interoperable, reliable, high-speed, high-capacity wireless service.Such a virtual network, which is already taking shape in Japan, promises the type of robust, nationwide connectivity necessary for the industrial internet of things and rural broadband access.Businesses collaborating on 5G virtual wireless networks include Altiostar, AT&T, DISH Network, Facebook, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, Qualcomm, Rakuten, Verizon, VMWare and Vodafone. These and other firms involved in open RAN's development span the spectrum, from foundational wireless technologies to telecom service providers to software and computer networking to original equipment makers.As the Open RAN Policy Coalition notes, "Multivendor deployments enable a more competitive marketplace and give network operators greater ability to manage their networks and flexibility to draw on the innovations of multiple suppliers to upgrade their infrastructure with the latest technology."This innovative solution blocks Chinese hegemony over next-generation wireless connectivity. And it averts very serious national security threats from such a disadvantage. Because of its modular architecture, virtual 5G networks couldn't be taken over or subverted by China, Russia or another rogue nation.The basis for this solution is our bread and butter. As President Reagan's Commission on Industrial Competitiveness once said, "Technological innovation is a mainstay of the American economy. It is the foundation of our economic prosperity, our national security and our competitiveness in world markets."Open RAN virtual networks for 5G rest in the hands of the private sector. That's far better than government attempting centralized control of innovation.There's a role for government: Namely, a system of law that respects and upholds due process and private property rights—particularly intellectual property.Also, our government must guarantee an antitrust system that fosters competition—in part by withholding its heavy hand where intellectual property exclusivity is being exercised, because innovation drives dynamic competition. As Reagan's commission also said, "Innovation spurs new industries and revives mature ones."The government could help private innovators with proof-of-concept settings. It could incentivize research and development and invention in this area of technology through tax credits. It could guarantee purchase of RAN networking innovations to speed these networks into usage and to signal the commercial market and spur private sector adoption.That's the right approach to foster 5G research and development, leapfrog China's national champion in this technological advance at this crucial juncture and appropriately lead our national industrial interests without picking winners and losers.James Edwards, Ph.D., is executive director of Conservatives for Property Rights (@4PropertyRights) and patent policy advisor to Eagle Forum Education & Legal Defense Fund. The views expressed in this article are the writer's own.Link to ImageGraphic Huawei internet routerSABEL INFANTES/AFP via Getty ImagesHuawei internet routerLoad-Date: June 4, 2020End of Document

Chinese hackers wanted to steal covid investigation and breached hundreds of companies, says USCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 21, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 516 wordsBodyChinese hackers wanted to steal covid investigation and breached hundreds of companies, says USWashington, 21 Jul 2020 (AFP) - Two Chinese hackers have been charged with trying to steal data on the development of covid-19 vaccines and breach the systems of hundreds of companies, the US Justice Department said Tuesday. Li Xiaoyu, 34, and Dong Jiazhi, 33, are also charged with attacks on human rights activists from the United States, China and Hong Kong, said the assistant Attorney General for Homeland Security within the Department of Justice, John Demers, at a press conference in Washington.According to Demers, they sometimes acted "for their own personal benefit" but others did so in support of the Chinese State Ministry. The hackers are presumed to be in China, out of the reach of the US police. According to the indictment, which had remained sealed until now, the two pirates are guilty of "fraudulently entering computers around the world and stealing terabytes of data." Demers explained that the attacks targeted companies in ten Western countries, including the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom, Germany and Belgium, and "hundreds of companies, governments, non-governmental organizations and dissidents, democratic and human rights clergy and activists in the United States and abroad, including Hong Kong and China." In addition, the indictment states that the two men provided the authorities in their country, among other information, with emails exchanged by a Chinese dissident with the office of Tibetan religious leader Dalai Lama, and the key to accessing a Hong Kong activist's personal email." Cybercrime led by the Chinese government's intelligence services threatens not only the United States, but also the rest of the countries that support fair play, international standards and the rule of law," said FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich. For his part, federal prosecutor William Hyslop stated that pirates had their interests in companies across the orb. "The IT systems of many companies, individuals and agencies across the United States and around the world have been hacked and compromised, and there are a lot of sensitive and valuable trade secrets, technologies, data and personal information that have been stolen," Hyslop said. According to those investigated by American justice, the hackers met during their engineering studies in China and together, starting in 2009, stole trade secrets estimated at several hundred million dollars. However, to date they have not been arrested. To do this, they exploited security flaws on the servers and installed malicious software without the knowledge of their victims, confiscating data related to military satellites, solar panels or chemicals. The authorities did not say whether the two men managed to steal secrets from the government, but they still expressed their dismay at these facts." We are concerned that this piracy or attempted piracy slows down the investigation, because in the event of an intrusion, the focus is on finding a remedy for this violation," Demers.cl/ft/dga/ll/llu/pizLoad-Date: July 22, 2020End of Document

Harvard investigation says coronavirus was already circulating in Wuhan in August, much earlier than reported by the Chinese regimeCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 9, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1050 wordsBodyThe new coronavirus may have been spreading in China since August 2019, according to research by Harvard Medical School based on the analysis of 111 satellite images of hospital travel patterns and internet search engine data."The increase in hospital traffic and symptom search data in Wuhan preceded the documented start of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in December 2019," according to research by the prestigious American university. "While we cannot confirm whether the volume increase was directly related to the new virus, our evidence supports other recent work showing that the onset occurred before the identification at the Huanan seafood market."According to that Boston-based research house, "these findings also corroborate the hypothesis that the virus emerged naturally in southern China and was potentially already circulating at the time of the Wuhan outbreak."Satellite images showed a large increase in the occupation of hospital car parks in August 2019."In August we identified a unique increase in searches for the term diarrhea that had not been seen in previous flu seasons or reflected in cough search data," according to the research. The Harvard report is signed by Elaine Nsoesie, Benjamin Rader, Yiyao L. Barnoon, Lauren Goodwin and John S. Brownstein."The COVID-19 global pandemic originally related to a zoonotic spread event at the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan in November or December 2019. However, recent evidence suggests that the virus may have been circulating at the time of the outbreak," the paper notes. "We use pre-validated data streams (satellite images from hospital parking lots and Baidu search queries on disease-related terms) to investigate this possibility," the scientists add.Based on the data analyzed, the researchers noted that they observed "an upward trend in hospital traffic and search volume beginning in late summer and early fall 2019. While consultations on 'cough' respiratory symptoms show seasonal fluctuations that coincide with annual flu seasons, 'diarrhoea' is a more specific symptom of COVID-19 and only shows an association with the current epidemic. The increase in both signals precedes the documented start of the COVID-19 pandemic in December, highlighting the value of new digital sources for surveillance of emerging pathogens.""Although surprising, this finding aligns with the recent recognition that gastrointestinal symptoms are a unique feature of COVID19 disease and may be the main complaint of a significant proportion of patients presenting. This increase in symptom-finding is followed by an increase in hospital parking traffic in October," the specialists say.The Beijing StoryThe Chinese regime has always noted that the virus started in a wet market in The city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, last December. However, all indications show that Beijing initially concealed the epidemiological outbreak that eventually became a pandemic spreading millions of people around the world and killing hundreds of thousands.It was not the only fact that puts the undemocratic regime in the eye of accusations. During January, the World Health Organization (WHO) publicly praised China for what it described as a rapid response to the new coronavirus, and thanked the Chinese government for "immediately" sharing the genomeof the virus.Tedros Adhanom, WHO Director-General, shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping before a meeting at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China, on 28 January 2020 when the coronavirus had already begun to expand throughout the young (Reuters) (POOL New/)But in reality, the Chinese authorities delayed the delivery of the genetic map of the virus for more than a week after several government laboratories had deciphered it, retaining crucial details for designing tests, drugs and vaccines. The delay was probably due to strict information and competition controls within The Associated Press, as the Associated Press discovered after analyzing internal documents, emails and conducting dozens of interviews.Health authorities only shared genome information after it was published by a Chinese laboratory on a virology website on January 11. Even then, China took at least another two weeks before providing WHO with the details it needed, according to recordings of several internal meetings held in January by the United Nations health agency. The delay occurred at a time when the outbreak could perhaps have slowed down considerably.Reserved documentsBy early April, research by an American television network NBC News showed that the epidemic had begun much earlier. The US media had access to confidential documents that accounted for the Wuhan health system, the epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic, since November 2019. The information matches Harvard's recent report.Beijing reported by 31 December to the World Health Organization (WHO) that a new viral strain had been born in that city but lied to ensure that it was already under control and with no chance that it would expand beyond the province that contained it, Hubei, west of Shanghai. In that same communication, he had stated that the first cases dated from the middle of the last month of the last year.NBC News gained access to secret papers from U.S. intelligence agencies that had data on a collapse in Wuhan's healthcare system as early as November. The information came to the analysts through intercepted communications but mostly with images showing a sustained increase in the health centers of that city.The reports, according to that independent medium, were not formalized due to lack of conclusive material so they were not transmitted to the White House, a situation confirmed by the U.S. Department of Defense in a communication made Thursday night. "We can confirm that media reports on the existence/launch of a coronavirus-related product/evaluation at the National Center for Medical Intelligence (NCMI) in November 2019 are incorrect," Dr. R. Shane Day, Air Force Colonel and director of the center, said through a statement.MORE ON THIS TOPIC:China's deception of the world was worse: evidence shows that the coronavirus already existed since before December and the regime hid itChina and the sophisticatedlab of the lie that prevented you from fighting the coronavirus from the beginningLoad-Date: June 10, 2020End of Document

5G auction in Brazil, a new chapter of the China-U.S. Cold WarCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 22, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1490 wordsBodyBrazil is at the center of the Cold War for the coveted auction to occupy the new 5G mobile phone frequency. The dispute pits the two richest nations in the world: the United States and China. A market is at stake that can attract up to $34 billion in investments to Brazil, a country that has more mobile phones than it already inhabitants: there are 225.3 million devices for 209.5 million people.At the center are China's Huawei and other non-American companies, but have sympathy and, in some cases, the promise of funding from Donald Trump's administration. This is the case of Sweden's Ericsson, Finland's Nokia and South Korean Samsung, which, like Huawei, are providers of equipment and services for mobile phone companies operating in Brazil, such as Vivo, Claro, Tim, Oi and Algar. According to market information and technicians from the Government of Jair Bolsonaro, these five companies, currently operating with 3G and 4G networks, have shown interest in participating in the auction.The third generation of mobile networks, the 3G, arrived in Brazil in 2007 and transformed the phone into a minicomputer. She was responsible for popularizing mobile Internet access, which reaches 95% of Brazil's 5,570 municipalities. 4G landed five years later: it improved data traffic and increased speed by 100. It currently reaches 75% of cities. The 5G emerges as an improvement of the previous generation and promises to keep you all connected at once, not only computers and mobiles, but also TVs, refrigerators, cars, washing machines and security cameras. That's why it was dubbed "the Internet of Things," with a speed up to 20 times faster than 4G.Experts agree that giving operators a new frequency is a matter of national security and governments should therefore take special care. "It's the cold war of the 21st century, because it's about choosing the technology standard of data. It is so important that we see presidents from several countries debating this issue," says the former Secretary of the Ministry of Defence, Flávio Basílio.Five blocks for 5G. Huawei today finds restrictions around the globe will be auctioned in Brazil, after the U.S. government prevented it from entering its domestic market. The argument was that the Chinese company cannot guarantee the safety of its equipment, which would jeopardize the communication of sensitive issues: government, defence, public security and foreign relations. The same would be true of communication between ordinary citizens.Company spokesmen in several countries deny the allegations. "They are unfounded. All the growth we've had over the last ten years shows that governments, operators and partners have been very interested in evaluating Huawei intensively," says the company's Director of Cybersecurity and Solutions in Brazil, Marcelo Ikegami Motta. With the exception of the United States, Huawei is present in all countries where there is 5G. It is the largest company in the industry and supplies equipment and technology for mobile and Internet networks to 170 countries.Last week, the UK decided to veto telecom companies contract Huawei's services and equipment. It also determined that devices that were already in operation should be out of service by 2027. Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Greece tend to follow the same path, or at least limit Chinese enterprise.The arrest of Meng WanzhouPresident Donald Trump intensified his attacks on Huawei in 2018, when a company executive,Meng Wanzhou, daughter of founder Ren Zhengfei, was arrested in Canada for allegedly violating U.S. sanctions law. Since then, the company has been accused of spying for the Chinese government and stealing secrets from competition. For this reason, Americans threaten governments to block intelligence agreements if they do not limit Huawei's participation in its auctions.As Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro has an almost automatic alignment with the United States, Brasília's technicians and politicians believe the Executive is considering restricting Huawei's operations, which would be unprecedented. "The U.S. government is setting an example of economic nationalism. The same can happen here," says economist Arthur Barrionuevo Filho, a professor at the Getúlio Vargas Foundation.Before Bolsonaro, Brazil was oblivious to this geopolitical debate. Based on a liberal economic policy, the government never created guidelines and allowed operators to self-regulate. "In telecommunications, Brazil has always let the market choose," explained former Secretary Flávio Basílio, who participated in the initial process of the technology auction during the Government of Michel Temer (2016-2018).The Ministry of Communications and the National Telecommunications Agency (Anatel) say there is no consensus on a possible limitation to Huawei. The ministry did not rule out a possible veto, but claimed that any decision depends on the analysis of several other state agencies, such as Institutional Security, Economics and Foreign Affairs. On the other hand, the agency says that "the public authority will not interfere in the election, since it is an issue concerning private relations between companies".Vulnerable technologyBecause it looks more like software than hardware, the 5G network is more vulnerable, because evolution is based on software rather than computers. For example, to intercept a communication on the 4G network, a hacker must install a device on a mobile phone antenna. In the case of 5G, it is sufficient to breach the network from a remote access port, to access the information of the thousands of devices that use it. By way of comparison, it would be like installing a virus on computers to copy the files saved on the machine.According to specialists, despite all the pressure Americans put on, there is no guarantee that their preferred companies will be 100% safe. "The United States fears losing hegemony, so they act this way," says engineer Fábio de Miranda, coordinator of the Computer Engineering course at Insper, one of the most prestigious engineering schools in Latin America. In its view, Brazil should not exclude Huawei from the process. "As a peripheral country and not as prone to exacerbated political tensions, ideally focus on the cost and performance of the technology and do a team audit," he said.According to the company's internal data, Huawei supplies products to almost half of the Brazilian market. The Chinese company argues that its current technology is 1.5 times faster than that of its competitors and that its equipment consumes 30% less energy.Multimillion-dollar figuresBrazil's Ministry of Communications and Anatel plan to hold the auction in June 2021, after two cancellations, the last one in March of this year. Former national telecommunications secretary André Muller Borges says it was not the right time to hold an auction, even before thePandemic. "Traders are still completing and exhausting investment in 4G, which began in 2014. 5G is deferring because they can't make this investment now," Muller says.The financial issue is one of the most important in the current situation. When 5G began to be considered, in 2017, the government estimated that it could raise between $3.8 billion and $5.6 billion with the frequency auction. Currently, the value is being reconsidered. "The authorities have to decide what is most important: maximizing the proceeds from the auction, the fee for the user or the ability to expand this service in the national territory. Only then will we know the price," says Sergio Paulo Galindo, executive president of the Brazilian Association of Information and Communication Technology Companies (Brascom).From Anatel, they informed EL PAÍS that prices are still being studied: "The priority of setting investment commitments to expand access to telecommunications services by the population, to the detriment of collection".If operators and the Government have not yet agreed on the values to be placed on the table, another equipment supplier presses for the auction as soon as possible. At the end of last year, Ericsson presented a study that the delay in bidding would delay investment in the country. The implementation of the 5G in 2020 was estimated to attract $24 billion over the next five years. Therefore, each year of delay would represent a loss of $4.7 billion, between tax collection and equipment sales.The 5G service is available in South Korea– the pioneer — and in several regions of the United States, China, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, Germany, France and the Netherlands.In Latin America and the Caribbean, 5G is still in diapers. The technology works only in Uruguay, through a state-owned company. Smaller operators also operate in regions of Puerto Rico, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Earlier this year, Chile announced that it was preparing its auction, while Argentina decided to start testing precisely with Huawei.Load-Date: July 23, 2020End of Document

Human Rights Watch: Silenced in China - The ArchivistsTargeted News ServiceJuly 23, 2020 Thursday 8:50 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 945 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyHuman Rights Watch issued the following news release:Readers of online materials from sources in China are often frustrated when they click on an interesting article--only to find it has been deleted by government censors. Sometimes only a few minutes elapse after an article is published before it disappears.Terminus 2049, a crowd-sourced project started in April 2018, sought to change that by archiving materials censored on Chinese media outlets and social media platforms. But after only a year of operation, on April 19, the Beijing police took away the group's founders, Chen Mei and Cai Wei, both 27, from their homes. After detaining them in an undisclosed location for 54 days, authorities formally arrested them on June 12 on charges of "picking quarrels and provoking trouble." They are now being held in Beijing's Chaoyang Detention Center.Authorities rejected the lawyers the families hired for the two men, and instead assigned state lawyers to represent them. "I am very worried that Chen Mei could face unfair trial and imprisonment," Chen Mei's brother Chen Kun told me.Terminus 2049 was hosted on Github, the world's largest open-source code-sharing and publishing site. The project automatically archived webpages of links that netizens had sent to the site. The articles would be preserved on the site even after they were later blocked. So Terminus 2049 was a decentralized, crowdsourcing platform in which netizens could participate and preserve the Chinese internet's memory together. Web-users could also visit the site just to read articles that authorities didn't want them to see. Authorities have occasionally tried to block Github, but have never fully done so, perhaps because numerous developers in China rely on it to build software.Before Chen and Cai's detention, Terminus 2049 had archived over 600 articles, of which about 100 are on Covid-19. Those articles, including news pieces, interviews, and personal accounts, documented the real-life situation of people in Wuhan during the outbreak, some of which criticized the Chinese government's initial cover-up of the novel coronavirus. The site had also archived censored articles on China's #MeToo movement and its crackdown on labor activists.Since Chen Mei was taken into custody, Chen Kun has tirelessly campaigned for his release. "When I give media interviews [about my brother], I often feel a sense of absurdity," Chen said. "I have to explain that [China's] internet censorship...has become so severe that they were forcibly disappeared for simply archiving some articles."Chen Kun is right. Since President Xi Jinping came to power in late 2012, China has significantly tightened information control and ramped up propaganda, to the extent that idealistic young people like Chen and Cai willing to take up a fight against censorship have become rare.Some Chinese people over 30 have known a Chinese internet that was freer and connected to the global internet. These tend to be the ones who most resent censorship. Some younger people, having grown up without international platforms such as Twitter and Google but only heavily censored Chinese alternatives have not experienced this relative information freedom. And government propaganda has some of the younger generations believing that the Great Firewall, the authorities' extensive censorship system, protects them from false information and the country from social instability.On the surface, Chen Mei and Cai Wei seemed unlikely rebels. Both are young and from inland provinces that tend to be less exposed to progressive ideas. Chen Mei, from a middle-class family, has been strongly influenced by his older brother Chen Kun. Chen Kun said that he was lucky that when he was in college the environment on campus and online were relatively free, and that he was able to gain knowledge and perspectives that are different from or contrary to official teaching. Chen Kun, who was detained for 81 days in 2014 for supporting the Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong, has passed to his younger brother what he called his "passion for open-source technology" and "the belief that a free internet can bring about social change".Cai Wei was from a poor family in Hubei province. In 2007, when he was in middle school, a volunteer-based grassroots organisation called Liren that provided summer camps and libraries for rural youth set up a library in his school. Liren volunteers - mostly college students from big cities - brought him not only reading materials but also ideas that he would not have learned from school.Chen and Cai met in 2011 at Liren-organized activities and became friends. Later, both became volunteers for the group. But Beijing had other ideas, cracking down on independent groups. Liren thrived and struggled in spite of growing official hostility, until in 2014 the authorities shut it down. They detained its founder, Li Yingqiang, for eight months in 2019.Chen and Cai's experiences show the power of ideals, and how one idealist can inspire another. And even in the face of government reprisals, some young activists persist. In June Nick Chen (a pseudonym) started Duty Machine, a project similar to Terminus 2049. "There are 'incorrect' memories we must preserve," Chen told Radio Free Asia. We must fight for our memories." When asked why he named the project Duty Machine, Chen recalled a student participant of the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989. When a journalist asked the student pedaling his bike why he was heading to Tiananmen Square to protest, the student responded cheerfully: "I think this is my duty."[Category: International]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7184386 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: July 23, 2020End of Document

A SIGNED ARTICLE BY AMBASSADOR CONG PEIWU PUBLISHED ON HILL TIMESStates News ServiceJune 13, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 943 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: BEIJING, China BodyThe following information was released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China:From Chinese Embassy in CanadaOn June 11, 2020, Hill Times published a signed article by Chinese Ambassador Cong Peiwu titled "What We Talk About When We Talk About Doing Business with China". Here is the full text:Tim Hortons, a fast-food chain brand beloved by Canadians, announced last month it has received financing from Tencent Holdings Ltd, the Chinese Internet services giant. Across the Pacific Ocean, the two well-known companies from China and Canada have joined forces. It is reported that Tim Hortons will speed up store opening after the financing, and is expected to open more than 1,500 stores in China soon. There is no doubt that both companies hold positive expectations for the future with such a vast consumer market in China.Though the global economy has been facing substantial downward pressure for the recent years, by 2019, about 490 of the world's top 500 companies have invested in China. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has hit the global economy and China's economy hard. However, like Tim Hortons, many foreign enterprises are still enthusiastic about having commercial cooperation with China and choosing to expand their business in the country.Lately, heads of several multinational companies, including Tim Cook, chief executive officer (CEO) of Apple, Steve Mollenkopf, CEO of Qualcomm, and Ozawa Hideki, Chairman and CEO of Canon (China), expressed their confidence in China's long-term economic development and their readiness to keep close contact with their Chinese partners and continue to expand business cooperation.Meanwhile, the Canada-China Business Impact Survey 2019/2020 recently released by the Canada-China Business Council also shows the overall optimistic attitude of the Canadian business circle towards the prospects of China-related business. According to the survey, more than 60% of Canadian companies will further raise or maintain China's presence in their future global plan.So what exactly is China's appeal?In the survey, it is found that sound economic fundamentals, complete industrial system, increasingly optimized business environment, self-contained infrastructure conditions and super large market are "high-frequency words" that are mostly mentioned. In the eyes of foreign business partners, these are precisely the strength and attractiveness of China. Since the beginning of this year, the long-term positive fundamentals of China's market and economy have been strongly confirmed in the battle against the pandemic. More and more multinationals are feeling the resilience and charm of China's economy.China boasts a huge consumer market. In 2019, China's GDP increased by 6.1% to about 14.4 trillion US dollars, with per capita GDP exceeding 10,000 US dollars, and the final contribution rate of consumption expenditure to economic growth reached nearly 60%. The thriving consumer market not only consolidates confidence in China's economic growth, but also provides huge cooperation space for foreign companies. China will make good preparation for the third China International Import Expo this year, which is a large globally-oriented market of higher standards.China has advantages from a complete industrial system. China, as the only country in the world with all industrial categories in the United Nations industrial classification catalogue, has a complete industrial system and full complementary capacity from upstream and downstream industries. Currently, these advantages are unmatched by any other country in the world.China has an increasingly optimized business environment. China has long pressed the "fast forward button" to optimize its business environment. In 2019, China was rated one of the 10 economies that improved the most on the ease of doing business for the second year in a row by the World Bank. In the 2020 Report on the Work of the Government, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang made a promise that China would make sustained efforts to create a market-oriented, law-based, and internationalized business environment, and promote high-standard opening up. China is making greater efforts to further shorten the negative list of foreign investment access, and grant greater autonomy in reform and opening up to pilot free trade zones. For example, in the financial sector, China formally removed the restrictions on the ratio of foreign shareholding in securities and fund management firms this April.China has broad prospects for cooperation. The CCBC survey shows that China's economic development has a positive impact on Canadian companies' success, and successful companies are often active in industries of more attention in China's development planning and policies. In the next stage, China will put more focus on upgrading of manufacturing and the growth of emerging industries. Priority will be given to new infrastructure and new initiatives and major projects. It will provide new cooperation opportunities for more Canadian enterprises for sure.As the post-epidemic era comes, all countries are confronted with the urgent task of recovering their economies. What measures should be taken to hedge the downside risks of the economy, what partners should be selected for common development, how to solve the problems of employment and sales, where the goods can be sold, and where to build new production lines...... The whole world is reflecting on these questions. But, there is no doubt that while we are thinking, China will be a factor and an option that cannot and should not be avoided.Back to the question of the title of thisLoad-Date: June 17, 2020End of Document

Pentagon Lists Companies Connected to Chinese Military, Including HuaweiNewsweek.comJune 24, 2020 Wednesday 5:35 PM ESTCopyright © 2020 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 608 wordsByline: Jeffery MartinHighlight: "If Beijing cannot develop technology on its own, it attempts to steal it from the United States using cyber espionage," read a 2019 letter from U.S. lawmakers.BodyThe U.S. Department of Defense listed 20 companies with alleged relationships to the Chinese military, including telecommunications company Huawei, which has already been charged with racketeering by the U.S. Department of Justice. The document cleared the prepublication review process in June.Also included on the list is the video surveillance company Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology, Co. Ltd., which manufactures equipment that may be used in China's Xinjiang region, where the ethnic Uighur people and other Turkic Muslims are reportedly being detained in concentration camps. Other entities on the list include aerospace, transportation and nuclear technology companies. Companies on the Pentagon's list may be engaged in delivering U.S. technological information to the Chinese Communist Party.Lawmakers, including U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton, requested the list in a 2019 letter to Secretary of State Mark Esper. According to the letter, China was using a "Military-Civilian Fusion" tactic involving technological espionage to further its goals."If Beijing cannot develop technology on its own, it attempts to steal it from the United States using cyber espionage, intelligence assets operating in the United States, and state-directed companies that acquire American firms to transfer proprietary information," the letter read.Newsweek reached out to the Department of Defense, the office of Senator Schumer and Huawei Technologies U.S.A. for comment. This story will be updated with any response.In February, Huawei was charged in a Brooklyn, New York federal court with conspiracy to steal trade secrets. According to the DOJ, Huawei and four of the company's subsidiaries attempted to "misappropriate intellectual property." Information about internet routers, robotics technology and cellular antennas were allegedly provided to Huawei, allowing the company to cut its "research and development costs and associated delays, giving the company a significant and unfair competitive advantage."Huawei also allegedly did business through its subsidiaries in Iran and North Korea despite the fact that the U.S. had levied sanctions against those countries, making such transactions illegal.Hikvision was placed on a trade blacklist by the U.S. Department of Commerce in October, citing implications that the company was involved in "China's campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance."In an October press release, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said that the blacklisting, designed to make getting U.S. materials for manufacturing more difficult, would "ensure that our technologies, fostered in an environment of individual liberty and free enterprise, are not used to repress defenseless minority populations."Diplomatic relations between the U.S. and China have become strained since the coronavirus pandemic spread worldwide, causing the global economy to suffer losses. President Donald Trump has publicly referred to the virus as the "Wuhan Flu," after the Chinese city where the coronavirus was first reported in December.President Trump also signed the Uighur Human Rights Bill of 2020, allowing the U.S. government to levy sanctions against China in response to allegations of human rights abuses.In response to the bill, China's Foreign Ministry said in a June statement that the U.S. should not use the legislation to "harm China's interests and interfere in China's internal affairs. Otherwise, China will resolutely take countermeasures, and all the consequences arising therefrom must be fully borne by the United States."Link to ImageGraphic huawei, chinaSTR/AFP/GettyAccording to a list compiled by the Department of Defense, 20 companies engaged in business practices within the U.S. have alleged ties to the Chinese government including telecommunications company Huawei.Load-Date: June 24, 2020End of Document

"The Chinese government wants to force them back to China, and China's tactics to do so are shocking.""China is engaged in a statewide effort to become the world's only superpower by any means necessary," he added.(With EFE information)Load-Date: July 9, 2020End of Document

Mnuchin said "he expected China to meet the terms of the Phase 1 trade deal, which called for an additional $200 billion in Chinese purchases of U.S. goods and services over the next two years, despite a sharp downturn in the global economy caused by the pandemic."Zoom Faces Criticism For Censoring Virtual Talks On Hong Kong And Tiananmen.The Washington Post (6/11, Shih, 14.2M) reports, "Several prominent critics of the Chinese government, including protest leaders in Hong Kong and pro-democracy activists in the United States, have accused Zoom of shutting their accounts and severing live events in recent weeks under pressure from Beijing." The three incidents are "reviving concerns" about the communication technology company's "susceptibility to Chinese government influence weeks after the firm began facing scrutiny over security, including its routing of data through China." In each instance, event organizers said "each of the Zoom accounts and events was created and hosted outside mainland China but appeared to be quashed under Chinese government pressure after they were publicly advertised."Load-Date: June 12, 2020End of Document

US Congress approves sanctions on Chinese companies that threaten Hong Kong autonomyCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 3, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 429 wordsBodyThe U.S. Senate on Thursday passed a bill to impose sanctions on Chinese companies that threaten Hong Kong's autonomy and those who do business with these organizations, in response to the Chinese imposition of the national security law on that territory, which provides for life imprisonment for dissidents.The Senate had already initially passed the bill last week, but Wednesday night the House of Representatives backed a version with some differences, forcing senators to put the legal initiative back to a vote, according to Senators Pat Toomey, Republican, and Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat, authors of the legal text.Upon unanimous approval in the Senate, only the signing of the president, Donald Trump, is required for the entry into force of the initiative, drawn up in fear of fears by US lawmakers that the application of China's national security law on Hong Kong territory will eliminate democratic freedoms in the former British colony."The U.S. Congress, in a bipartisan dynamic, has long been united to hold Beijing accountable for its brutal campaign against those who peacefully demand its rights and freedoms, including Hong Kong," lower house president Nancy Pelosi had put it in the plenary session where the text was approved.Pelosi added that these sanctions are "a urgently needed response to the cowardice of the Chinese government in implementing the self-styled 'national security law' that seeks to end the premise of 'one country, two systems', promised exactly 23 years ago."The approved text added a letter from the State Department warning U.S. companies that they may face "reputation, economic, and legal" problems if they do business with companies based in China's Xinjiang region.Controversial lawThe Chinese national security law for Hong Kong, which includes life sentences, came into force last Wednesday after being approved by chinese legislature and ratified by the country's president, Xi Jinping; a move that has sparked mass protests among Hong Kongers.Beijing thus bets on the heavy hand to end the anti-government protests that the city's pro-democracy movement has been organizing since the middle of last year, in which the Chinese regime sees a foreign 'black hand', targeting Washington.Details of the 66 articles that make up this law include the specific crimes to be pursued: secession, subversion of state power (frequently used by Beijing against activists and dissidents), terrorist activities and conspiracy with foreign forces to endanger national security.commentsforum0WhatsApp  Facebook  Twitter  Linkedin       Load-Date: July 4, 2020End of Document

ICYMI: RUBIO JOINS LEADERSHIP INSTITUTE, CAMPUS REFORM TO DISCUSS CHINA'S INFLUENCE IN ACADEMIAStates News ServiceJune 3, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1083 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Florida Senator Marco Rubio:U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) joined a conversation with Campus Reform and the Leadership Institute to discuss the role the Chinese government and Communist Party has played in influencing American universities. See below for highlights.On China's impact on younger generations:"I encourage you to look at Made in China 2025, it is an industrial plan put out by the Chinese Communist Party where they basically detail the 10 industries that they intend to be the world leader in... I think that's a call to action on our part and that means that we have to make sure that we have our own capabilities and that we're investing and prioritizing in these key industries like biomedicine, like quantum computing and artificial intelligence, telecommunications, but also things like rail and clean energy and all sorts of other industries that they intend to be dominant in the world because we want to have those capabilities as well and we don't want to be dependent on China for them. It gives them tremendous leverage over the rest of our country."On Chinese foreign exchange students:"A growing number of Chinese students in the United States do not get the full university experience. There is, and we know there is, active monitoring on behalf of Chinese embassies and other programs to keep an eye on foreign nationals that have traveled to the United States to in essence, in their theory to prevent them from becoming infected with Western ideas, human rights, freedom of speech and the like... Ultimately, we've always counted on diversity, plurality of opinions and our society to balance it out. And ultimately, for someone from abroad to see that and say, wow this is a great country, it functions, and people are allowed to believe all sorts of different things and not be punished, I don't believe Chinese students are getting that experience any longer when they come to the U.S., primarily because I think they are being watched. And that is not a conspiracy theory. That is something that we have been able to document and to see and many on campuses will tell you it's been a reality as well..."I do know that one of the things we're going to have to address, particularly graduate students in certain fields, is we are going to have to be more sensitive about, frankly allowing foreign nationals of a variety of different places who are known for active efforts to steal trade secrets and technological secrets we're going to have to be more careful of that sort of thing."On ties between the Chinese Communist Party and U.S. professors:"There's been instances like the professor at Harvard or researchers at the Moffitt Cancer Center in my own home state of Florida who were deriving a paycheck from their own institution, Harvard or Moffitt, but they were also secretly getting a paycheck and sharing the exact same research with an institution in China, and that was not being disclosed. So I think part of the answer here is to require strict disclosure, when you are doing research or you are drawing compensation from a foreign state, particularly China, who has a track record of trying to steal research or at a minimum getting you to duplicate it for them, that has to be something that is disclosed and there needs to be criminal penalties for people that deliberately hide it."On Confucius Institutes:"Confucius Institutes are programs of the Chinese Communist Party they run it through a bunch of different organizations, it sounds benign, but it is most certainly an effort of the Chinese Communist Party... it's become a growing and important part of their influence efforts in the United States for the future..."You can make universities and schools aware of all of this and ask them to voluntarily cut ties because of the threat they represent... I've also introduced a bill called the Foreign Influence Transparency Act, which would require higher education institutions to report gifts, contracts from a foreign source for $50,000 or more. I would prefer to start along that route before beginning with threats of cutting funding and things of this nature... I think it's more important that we convince people this is a threat and get them to voluntarily do it before we start bringing down the hammer of threatening cuts to federal funding and the like, which would impact the entire student body, but probably wouldn't impact the Confucius Institutes."On the WHO and China's cover-up of the coronavirus origin:"As the largest donor of the World Health Organization (WHO), we should be demanding accountability... The political leadership of the organization, which is not supposed to be political, was covering for China because they didn't want to upset China, because they didn't want to anger them. That can't continue if you're going to be the World Health Organization, you can't be a political organization... because we're depending on you to serve as a sort of fusion center for the world to respond to things like a pandemic, and we lost about 8 to 10 weeks in this response because we didn't have clear eyes as to what was happening on the ground in China."On China's production of pharmaceuticals and the role of U.S. territories:"We need more domestic capabilities in that field, as this recent pandemic has proven. We need to improve our own domestic capabilities, as I think you're going to see a growing amount of biomedical nationalism around the world, because countries have faced the abyss of running out of materials and are going to look for ways to be able to produce more by themselves. We're going to have to have that same capability, but also because it produces great jobs... It would also help with Puerto Rico's economic recovery, by producing high paying jobs available to the graduates in Puerto Rico and those who seek to return from the mainland and back to the island... It fits a need that our country has, and it also helps to deal with the need to help Puerto Rico recover economically after a financial crisis, two terrible storms, and an earthquake. It's been a tough five years."On holding China accountable:"The most important thing that we need to do in order to deal with all this is take care of our own business, ensure that we are rebuilding these industrial and technological capabilities and not continuing to allow this erosion because it puts our national security and our national economic interests, especially in the long term, in danger.Load-Date: June 4, 2020End of Document

"These are rumors": university where he studied alleged virologist accusing China and WHOCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 13, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 525 wordsBodyThe University of Hong Kong (HKU),the best in that Asian region, issued an emergency statement following Fox News's revealing interview with Li-Meng Yan,the Chinese virologist who fled to the United States in April, and assured that his country and the World Health Organization (WHO) covered up the coronavirus.In a missive published on Saturday, July 11 on its website, the studio house confirmed, without specifying dates, that Li-Meng Yan "was a postdoctoral fellow, but left" the studies."While HKU respects freedom of expression, past or present (expert) opinions and views do not represent us," so "the content of that news report does not match key facts as we understand them," the university added.According to the statement, Li-Meng Yan "did not conduct any research on human-to-human transmission of the new coronavirus at HKU during December 2019 and January 2020, as he said in the interview.""We also note that their versions do not have a scientific basis, but look like rumors. HKU does not act on rumours and we will not comment on the matter anymore," they said.Li-Meng Yan spoke last Friday with conservative network Fox, an interview that has been echoed in numerous local media outlets.The virologist claimed that the Chinese government knew of the danger posed by SARS-CoV-2 before it informed WHO of the outbreak in China's Wuhan region on 31 December.A virologist fled China and revealed how the regime hid information about coronavirus: "Thousands of lives could have been saved," said scientist Li-Meng Yan, who said that in December the enormous contagion capacity of covid19 was already known. #NoticieroTrece pic.twitter.com/8jHFt4TKsI— Thirteen (@trecepy) July 13, 2020In addition, she recounted that she began studying the virus in December from Hong Kong and was in contact with other scientists who were in mainland China and had more information about it.He allegedly found out that the strain was being transmitted very quickly among people, something that was still unknown, and reported his findings to Dr. Leo Poon, a suspected WHO contractor who concealed his research and asked him to remain silent, revealing that he could lose his life."He asked me to remain silent and be careful. That it did not touch the red line, that is, that it was not against the proceedings of the Chinese government and did not contradict its principles. Otherwise, I'd get in trouble and I could 'disappear,'" Yan told Fox.Li-Meng Yan accused WHO of "corruption" and complicity with the Chinese government, a hypothesis that U.S. President Donald Trump has championed since the start of the pandemic.WHO has denied Li-Meng Yan's accusations and told Fox that "many people work for them as consultants," but they don't have data proving that Yan, as she claims, worked for a reference lab of the virus and pandemic organization.WHO told Fox that it also has no data on Poon, Yan's supervisor, in its files.Since the onset of the pandemic, 12.7 million people worldwide have spread and more than 565,700 have lost their lives, according to Johns Hopkins University's independent account in the United States.With information from EFELoad-Date: July 14, 2020End of Document

DCMS SECRETARY GIVES UPDATE ON HUAWEI INVOLVEMENT IN 5G NETWORKStates News ServiceJuly 14, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 733 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: LONDON BodyThe following information was released by the British Parliament:Oliver Dowden made a statement to the House on Huawei equipment used in the UK's 5G network after the US announced sanctions against the company.In January, the Government announced that Chinese firm Huawei would be allowed to supply much of the infrastructure equipment needed for the UK 5G network, despite security concerns. However, it designated it a "high risk vendor" and said it would cap the company's market share.But on 15 May, US officials announced that sanctions were to placed on Huawei, which would mean they could not use US technology to manufacture their chips and would have to use third-party suppliers. The Trump administration claims that Huawei was used by the Chinese government to spy, which the company strongly denies.Today, Oliver Dowden announced that, after the end of this year, UK telecoms operators will not be allowed to buy Huawei equipment and that existing Huawei infrastructure will be removed.Oliver Dowden MP: "situation has changed"Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Oliver Dowden told the House that the UK would only remain at the "forefront" of technology by developing "5G for mobile and gigabit-capable for fibre". However, he said it was important to have full belief "in the security and resilience of the infrastructure" of these technologies, which is why the Government carried out the telecoms supply chain review.The Minister said that "the situation has changed" since January, citing the sanctions put in place by the US on 15 May. He explained that these restrictions would have "potentially severe impacts" on Huawei's ability to supply new equipment to the UK, as they could not use US technology or software.Mr Dowden stated that the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) had reviewed its security assessment of Huawei's actions in the UK in light of the USA's sanctions. The NCSC have now determined that the UK cannot be sure of being able to "guarantee the security of future 5G equipment ".The Government agreed with this assessment and have determined that "telecoms operators must not buy any 5G equipment from Huawei" after the end of the year. Mr Dowden told the House that will be illegal for them to do so after the Telecoms Security Bill is passed (the Bill will be introduced in October). He said that the UK had set a "diversification strategy" to identify alternative suppliers.The Minister also announced that the UK will "commit to a timetable for the removal of Huawei equipment" from the 5G network by 2027. He said that in total, the roll-out of 5G will be delayed by two to three years and will add up to 2 billion to costs.He said:"The security and resilience of our telecoms networks is of paramount importance."Chi Onwurah MP: "a car crash for our digital economy"Responding on behalf of the Opposition, Shadow Minister Chi Onwurah said that is had been evident "for some time" that there were "serious questions" about Huawei's involvement in the UK's telecoms network. She said that Government had been "incomprehensibly negligent" in its approach to the situation.Ms Onwurah said that the Government had refused to work with back benchers and the Opposition to legislate against high risk vendors and asked when that legislation would be brought forward. She asked the Minister to publish the advice that informed today's decision and questioned what conversations had been held with other ministers on "likely retaliation" from China.She also wondered what other sectors were reliant on China for equipment, whether the US sanctions were a surprise since "in the past he has emphasised how closely he was working" with the country, if UK security policy is being led by the US and if Chinese human rights violations played any part in the decision.The Shadow Minister went on to question what actions are laid out in the diversification strategy, if money will go to UK companies, and how the Minister will ensure the price of removing Huawei infrastructure would not fall on the public. She also asked what the implications are for the emergency services network, where BT was planning to use Huawei.The Member/Minister of State said/told MPs/stated:"The reality is that the original decision on Huawei was made because, over the past decade, this Government have failed to deliver a sustainable plan for our digital economy."Load-Date: July 15, 2020End of Document

The U.S. Projected to Lead The COVID-19 Mitigation Products Market: $55 to $112 Billion* per annum, Followed by ChinaPR NewswireJune 29, 2020 Monday 1:18 PM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1689 wordsDateline: WASHINGTON, June 29, 2020 BodyPR NewswireHSRC announces the publication of its research report, "US COVID-19 Pandemic Mitigation Products Market - 2020-2024". According to this most up-to-update analysis, the U.S. is set to lead the Global market* with an annual market share of 22% to 25% of the cumulative 2020-2024 $1.7–$2.2 Trillion global market.The U.S. is the leading nation in healthcare spending, resources, medical research, and sophisticated medical care. The U.S. spends $3.3 trillion (IMF, 2019) per year on healthcare, which is more than the combined expenditures of China, Japan, Germany, India, the United Kingdom, Italy, Brazil, Canada, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Australia, Mexico, Indonesia, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Switzerland ($3.24 trillion).When compared directly to China, given the rivalry between the PRC and the USA, it might be important to note that China is very much still a developing country in the field of healthcare infrastructure and spending. China spends 23 times less than the U.S. in terms of per-capita health care expenses ($430 to $10,100) and has 9.6 times (2019 data) fewer intensive care unit hospital beds per hundred thousand people than the U.S. does (34.7 to 3.6). That said, due to the size of China's population, the PRC has half the overall number of ICU beds that the U.S. has. However, the U.S.'s advantages seemed not to be an impediment to having 29 times more COVID-19 infected cases (2,424,168 to 83,430) and 27 times more COVID related deaths than China (123,473 to 4,634).Despite the huge spending, the U.S. became the leading COVID sufferer and mitigation market leader. HSRC estimates that there are a number of reasons why this has happened:The Pandemic turned into a political issue, not a healthcare one, which should have been led by the CDC which was established 77 years ago with one mission: to mitigate the spread of diseases. The White House was late to take counter-pandemic measures, including, but not limited to: stopping international travel (especially from China). The Trump administration has no consistent mitigation strategy. CDC challenges - during February, the CDC used erroneous PCR testing reagents and up to now they are not doing enough testing nation-wide. The federal government does not have a national lockdown authority. This authority is in the hands of the 50 states. Millions of infected low-income individuals and others, who are not covered by a medical insurance, refrained from seeking medical care when needed.The USA is and will continue to be the largest COVID-19 mitigation products market because at this point that's the only option it has, and it has the resources to invest whatever it takes to mitigate the pandemic.This should be contrasted to China's successful response, which, it is important to point out, was not solely, as many believe, due to its authoritarian government. There are six elements which dominated the effective mitigation of China's COVID-19 outbreak:Lessons learned from past outbreaks. The 2003 SARS, 2009 H1N1 flu and the 2013 H7N9 outbreaks demonstrated the effects of outbreaks. This resulted in funding a restructured healthcare system and the establishment of a pandemic related laboratory network across the country. A draconic lockdown of 50 million people. China's Safe City Infrastructure The government invested during 2014-2018 billions of USD on a 650 cities' "Safe City" infrastructure. The core of the "Safe City" system is a people surveillance platform based on 230 million video cameras, backed by face recognition biometrics. The "health code" surveillance infrastructure The Chinese augmented the safe city infrastructure by a so called "health code" service. The "health code" service, running on ubiquitous smart phone's platforms, was developed for the Chinese government to give users color-coded labels based on their health condition and travel record, and a code that can be scanned by government authorities and millions of establishments. As millions of people in China emerge from a long period of lockdown, their freedom of movement is largely dependent on the "health code" apps. The apps users with a green code are allowed to travel relatively freely. A yellow code indicates that the holder should be in home isolation, and a red one indicates a verified COVID-19 patient who should be in quarantine. Chinese citizens (like many in Asia-Pacific countries) culture is to wear face masks when needed. "We will invest whatever it takes to contain the outbreak" government policy.The global COVID-19 Pandemic Mitigation Products Market - 2020-2024 report presents a thorough market analysis of 57 products & services sub-reports, 6 vertical, 4 revenue source, 5 regional and 13 national markets providing in-depth analysis of this newly formed market.This 1020-page 5-volume market mega report is the first and most comprehensive review of the new global COVID-19 Pandemic Mitigation Products & Services market available today.

Missouri GOP Senator and China Critic Blasts NBA Commissioner's Campaign Contribution to BidenNewsweek.comJuly 23, 2020 Thursday 3:24 PM ESTCopyright © 2020 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 585 wordsByline: Matthew ImpelliHighlight: Missouri Republican Senator Josh Hawley, on Thursday, criticized NBA Commissioner Adam Silver after data from the Federal Election Commission showed Silver donating the maximum contribution permitted to presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden's presidential campaign.BodyMissouri Republican Senator Josh Hawley criticized NBA Commissioner Adam Silver Thursday after data from the Federal Election Commission showed Silver donating the maximum contribution permitted to presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden's presidential campaign."Of course he did. Now will Silver and the @NBA take the pledge to be #slavefree?" Hawley wrote on his Twitter account, with an article discussing Silver's donation from OutKick.com.According to the Federal Election Commission, Silver donated $2,800 to Biden's presidential campaign. Data from the commission also shows the NBA commissioner making several more donations to Democratic candidates and political campaigns over the past few years, including donations to former President Barack Obama's reelection campaign in 2012.The news of Silver's donation also sparked criticism from President Donald Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr."The @NBA's commissioner, who's completely in bed with China, backs #BeijingBiden. Makes sense," Trump Jr. wrote in a tweet posted on Thursday. "Wonder if Hunter's [Biden] getting a cut like he usually does?"Hawley and Trump's references to China include the ongoing controversy between the sports league and the Asian nation. The issues between the two began in October 2019, after Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey posted a tweet expressing his support for the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. The protests began after the proposal of an extradition law that would allow Chinese authorities to detain and extradite individuals from Hong Kong.The tweet, "Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong" was deleted shortly after, but it sparked backlash from several Chinese companies, who decided to end their business ties with the NBA. Silver later confirmed that Chinese government officials called for Morey's firing.This is not the first time Hawley has expressed disapproval towards the league.On July 10, Hawley sent a letter to Silver, "blasting the league's apparent decision to strictly limit messages players can wear on their jerseys to a few pre-approved, social justice slogans while censoring support for law enforcement officers or the military and any criticism of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)," according to a press release from Hawley's website."The truth is that your decisions about which messages to allow and which to censor – much like the censorship decisions of the CCP – are themselves statements about your association's values," Hawley wrote in the letter. "If I am right – if the NBA is more committed to promoting the CCP's interests than to celebrating its home nation – your fans deserve to know that is your view. If not, prove me wrong. Let your players stand up for the Uighurs and the people of Hong Kong. Let them stand up for American law enforcement if they so choose. Give them the choice to write 'Back the Blue' on their jerseys. Or 'Support our Troops.' Maybe 'God Bless America.' What could be more American than that?"Additionally, in October 2019, Hawley sent a similar letter to Silver, criticizing the league's "decision to side with the authoritarian Chinese government over protestors in Hong Kong." This letter came after Morey's tweets were published. Following his tweet, a spokesman for the NBA released a statement saying that it was "regrettable" that Morey's views "deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China."Newsweek reached out to Hawley and the NBA for comment but did not receive a response in time for publication.Link to ImageGraphic NBA Commissioner Adam SilverStacy Revere/GettyNBA Commissioner Adam Silver speaks to the media during a press conference at the United Center on February 15, 2020 in Chicago, Illinois.

Hong Kong was a 'safe harbor' for tech companies shut out of China. Not anymoreCNN WireJuly 10, 2020 Friday 2:59 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1291 wordsDateline: SAN FRANCISCO (CNN Business) BodySAN FRANCISCO (CNN Business) --  For decades, Silicon Valley giants shut out of China by the country's massive censorship apparatus have continued to operate in Hong Kong thanks to the city's unique political status that guaranteed it a free internet. But a new law that gives Hong Kong authorities sweeping powers to regulate online content could put those companies on a collision course with that censorship mechanism, known as the Great Firewall --- and potentially force them out of Hong Kong altogether. Under the national security law that went into effect last week, Hong Kong police can demand that online platforms and network providers take down content deemed a threat to China's security or restrict access to their services. If they fail to do so, company representatives could face nearly $13,000 in fines and six months in prison.That has big implications for tech companies that use the city as a regional base thanks to its relative openness and proximity to China and the Asia Pacific region, even if its approximately 7 million residents don't make up a significant portion of their users."It is not a huge market, but is important symbolically," said Adam Segal, director of the digital and cyberspace policy program at the Council on Foreign Relations. Caught in the middleCompanies are already reacting. Facebook, Twitter, Google and Microsoft were among those declaring this week that they would temporarily stop honoring government data requests about their Hong Kong users, while TikTok --- owned by Chinese company ByteDance --- decided to shut down its platform there completely. "Firms would be worried by the impact it has on their users, staff, and executives --- as well as global concerns that they would be actively facilitating human rights abuse happening under that framework," said Raman Jit Singh Chima, Asia policy director at technology advocacy group Access Now. Chima and other experts say companies are likely to wait and see how far China will go in its crackdown on Hong Kong's internet, but exits from the city remain a possibility. "They may wait to see if the government makes a request, but then they will be forced to decide, and leaving is likely," Segal said.The vaguely worded law also has a provision that states it would also apply to offenses from outside the region "by a person who is not a permanent resident," potentially giving China the ability to take action against any post against Hong Kong on any platform, anywhere. "I think that is meant to have a general chilling effect on people everywhere, not just not particularly high tech companies," said Scott Kennedy, an expert on China's economic policy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. And while that could lead to a degree of self-censorship overseas, Kennedy says there are questions about China's ability to actually enforce its rules on tech platforms outside its own territory."That's something that's a vast overreach by the Chinese, and I think they'd generate more pushback," he added.Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft said they will continue to examine the law and its implications on their businesses. "Our teams are reviewing the law to assess its implications, particularly as some of the terms of the law are vague and without clear definition," a Twitter spokesperson said in a statement. A Facebook spokesperson said the company would conduct a "further assessment" of the law in consultation with human rights experts. "We believe freedom of expression is a fundamental human right and support the right of people to express themselves without fear for their safety or other repercussions," the spokesperson added. "As we would with any new legislation, we are reviewing the new law to understand its implications," a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement.Google, which also has operations and users in Hong Kong, did not respond to requests for comment. While those three companies are largely cut off from mainland China, the law could also have implications for firms, such as Apple and Microsoft, that have a lot more at stake, according to Steven Feldstein, a nonresident fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Both companies have large manufacturing bases for their hardware products in China, which is also one of the world's biggest markets for iPhones. "These companies, particularly Apple, are really interesting because they have a lot more to lose, particularly given the amount of hardware that they sell in terms of iPhones as well as their manufacturing," Feldstein said. "I don't know exactly where they're going to end up ... short of a lot of public pressure, it's easy to conceive of a scenario where they try to also muddle their way through."Apple has found itself caught between China and Hong Kong in the past, most recently last October when it removed a mapping app from its App Store that the city's pro-democracy protesters were using to track police movements. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday, but said in a statement to Bloomberg earlier this week that it was "assessing" the law.Safe harborHong Kong's internet freedom is a product of a 1997 agreement between China and Britain, which handed the territory back to the Chinese government under a principle known as "one country, two systems" whereby the city would "safeguard the rights and freedoms of its residents" for a period of 50 years. But Beijing has been tightening its grip on those rights and freedoms for several years, and many fear the national security law is another big step in that direction. Several countries including the US, UK and Australia have criticized the law, with some warning their citizens against visiting Hong Kong because of it. "It's clear that the Chinese didn't want to pass it simply to create the illusion that they controlled Hong Kong," said Kennedy. "They really want to control Hong Kong and change the facts on the ground."Being blocked from China hasn't stopped Facebook and Google from trying to make inroads, with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's repeated charm offensive trips to Beijing in recent years prompting criticism. Google was forced to walk back plans to build a version of its search engine in China in 2018 after widespread outrage over what was seen as aiding Chinese censorship.Many tech firms could now be eying an exit, with analysts pointing to Singapore as one of the prime alternatives if they are forced to leave Hong Kong. Many tech firms already have a presence in Singapore, though the Southeast Asian country has its own issues with free speech."If [Hong Kong is] a regional hub for you, or you're there specifically because of the safe harbor it provides due to rule of law ... it's a challenge for you," Kennedy said. "I wouldn't be surprised If every single [US company in Hong Kong] is considering their options about location, and the same for all of their employees."In the meantime, Hong Kong is getting a taste --- if not the full impact just yet --- of life within the Great Firewall, and companies will be on their guard."Even Hong Kong lawyers are unable to provide clear advice or guidelines on what would amount to an offense --- the provisions are so broadly crafted that they are capable of capturing even benign conduct such as slogans," said Sharron Fast, deputy director of the journalism graduate program at the University of Hong Kong. "Censorship is coming," she added, "and if the breathtaking pace at which we have seen implementation ... is any indication, it will happen sooner rather than later."CNN's Sherisse Pham, Eric Cheung and Isaac Yee contributed to this report. TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Firing fallout, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Geoffrey Berman announcing he is leaving office, just hours after U.S. Attorney General William Barr said President Trump fired the powerful prosecutor.The move comes after Berman disputed Barr's earlier claim that he was stepping down, a lot of back and forth that started Friday night.In a letter to Berman Bill Barr wrote this, because you have declared that you have no intention of resigning, I have asked the president to remove you as of today and he has done so.Senator Lindsey Graham says he won't move forward with replacing Berman until he receives from approval from Senators and Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, the two senators from New York.Joining us now former White Water Independent Counsel, former Federal Prosecutor Robert Wray. And also here with me all morning long Pollster and Maslansky and Partners President Lee Carter. PwC Partner Mitch Rochelle. And RealClearPolitics Co-founder and President Tom Bevan, welcome one and all.Robert Wray, to you first, what do you make of this Berman getting shown the door over the weekend? The "Wall Street Journal" has an editorial about it and it's -- they call it your average Trump melodrama. That it was inartfully handled if you will, but -- and it could distract from Bill Barr's attempt to actually clean up the Justice Department.ROBERT WRAY, FORMER WHITEWATER INDEPENDENT COUNSEL: Dagen, it wasn't the smoothest rollout, but I don't think anybody questions the authority of the president to make a change.I -- the only thing here that, you know, in terms of what the end result will be, it's rather unfortunate to think that there isn't a nominee that could be proposed that would satisfy the two New York Senators.I hope that's not the case and I understand they're -- they're concerns, but right now, of course, the result is that the office will be led by an acting U.S. attorney who was Mr. Berman's deputy, and the president has the right to fill that -- that position.So, I don't know that this is the end of the story, it was a rather tumultuous from Friday night all the way through the weekend, but it doesn't change the fact that the president wants to make the change in the Southern District of New York and that change should be made, and it shouldn't have to wait until after the election.MCDOWELL: The "Wall Street Journal" in its editorial writes that, you know, people -- people on the left, the Democrats are using this narrative -- this to create the narrative that this is an attempt to protect political allies. There is one minor investigation going on into Rudy Giuliani, Trump Advisor, according to the editorial.But again, the whole point is, is that replacing Berman with a -- Jay Clayton was who they wanted to nominate for the job, who is running the Securities and Exchange Commission, but again, removing Berman isn't making cases go away.Explain to the audience the way that the SDNY, the Southern District of New York, the whole Justice Department exists their career -- their career attorneys in this entire division and the -- these -- replacing the head of SDNY doesn't make them disappear.WRAY: Well correct. I mean, Dagen, there's about 200 Assistant U.S. Attorneys in that office, at least 100 of which are in the criminal division and many of them are -- are young and they -- the office has a long tradition of independents. That will continue whoever is running the office and whoever the president's appointment is.But again, I -- you know, I think this was a long time coming. I know that the Democrats narrative on this, is that this constitutes yet again another effort by the Attorney General to attempt to obstruct justice on the president's behalf.There's no evidence or indication that that's the case and I understand they'll have a -- you know, a boat load of former federal prosecutors try to come write another letter, you know, claiming that Attorney General Barr should be impeached or should resign.I don't -- I think that's far from the case here. I think that's, again, more melodrama, but the substance of this is that the president is entitled to have his choice running that office. It's in the interest of justice and it's apparently what the attorney general wants.He's entitled to have a relationship that's a good one between him and the person who's leading the most prominent and the most important U.S. Attorney's Office in the country.MCDOWELL: Right, Geoffrey Berman was never nominated and confirmed by the Senate. He was a judicial appointment and it was within the president's power and right to fire him if he wanted.I want to move on to Attorney General William Barr, in an interview with Maria Bartiromo, hinting at when more details on the origins of the Russia Probe will be out. Maria sat down with Barr in an exclusive interview and asked him about the Derm (ph) Investigation. He explained the delays on "Sunday Morning Futures." Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Has he been delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic?BARR: There has been delay because of the pandemic. Yes there has.BARTIROMO: And an inability to interview people?BARR: Yes. Not an inability, but a distinct slowing down of that process.BARTIROMO: Because you can't gather a grand jury?BARR: Well, I don't -- I don't want to suggest there has been or is a grand jury, but it is a fact that there have been not grand juries in virtually all districts for a long period of time. And also, people have been reluctant to travel for interviews and things like that.So, it has slowed things down, but it -- but -- but there's -- he's been working where he can an other matters that aren't affected by the pandemic, but there has been an effect.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Robert Wray, your reaction to that.WRAY: Well notice, of course, how careful the attorney general is to not confirm or deny the existence of grand jury investigation and that -- and that's comes by operation of federal rule. He's not really permitted to do so.I mean, I think it's pretty clear to many of us on the outside who have experience, that there in fact is a grand jury investigation up and running, but there is no question as the result of the pandemic that a grand jury is not going to be able assemble with the same degree of regulatory that would have otherwise have been the case prior to COVID-19.I guess I would say -- what I hope here at the end of the day is that they could get to important conclusions in that Durham investigation before the election. I think the electorates entitled to have the benefit of -- of those results. And I hope we can get there. We still have a number of months left, but it would be ideal if the public had the benefit of that election before November 3.MCDOWELL: Do you worry that the Berman firing gets in the way of this incredibly important probe, again, into the origins of an investigation into a presidential campaign and ultimately a president with many people working together within Justice and the FBI to basically take down a president?WRAY: I mean, I hear the point Dagen, but I really don't think so. I mean, I think this is a weekend distraction, which is the Berman saga. I think that this too shall past. I don't think that really will have an affect on what John Durham is doing and I don't think it's a significant distraction from the Attorney General's ability to shepherd that investigation to a conclusion.MCDOWELL: Robert Wray, great to see you. Please come backWRAY: Thanks Dagen, take care. Be well.MCDOWELL: Take care. You as well.We're just getting started this morning. Coming up the Federalist Ben Domenech on big tech censorship, he has experienced that first hand.Then in the 7:00 o'clock hour Indiana Congressman Jim Banks on the threat from China and more from Maria's interview with Attorney General William Barr.BarkerGilmore Co-founder and Managing Partner John Gilmore on the next jobs in American, and realtor former HGTV host Mike Aubrey on rents plunging in the most expensive cities in the country.And in the 8:00 o'clock hour we have the Trump Campaign Senior Advisor Mercedes Schlapp on the president's rally in Tulsa Saturday night. More to come this week.Lady Gaga's father, New York City restaurant owner Joe Germanotta on New York's phase two reopening, outdoor dining now allowed.You don't want to miss any of these special guests.MCDOWELL: President Trump holding his first rally since the coronvirus pandemic in Tulsa, Oklahoma over the weekend, but not without some controversy.Blake Burman is here with the latest. Good morning Blake.BLAKE BURMAN, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Hi there Dagen, good morning to you as well. Going into the relauch of these presidential rallies we have been hearing from President Trump and his campaign for days about this record demand to attend and this record demand for tickets.However, by the time President Trump took the state on Saturday night in Tulsa, Oklahoma, you could look all around the arena and see batches of empty seats.The Trump Campaign, in part, blaming that on the media, saying in a statement Sunday, quote, "The fact is that weeks' worth of fake news media warning people away from the rally because of COVID and protestors, coupled with recent images of American cities on fire, had a real impact on people bringing their families and children to the rally."Here is how the president described those who did show up.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: To our warriors, I've been watching -- I've been watching the fake news for weeks now and everything is negative. Don't go, don't come, don't do anything. Today it was like, I've never seen anything like it. I've never seen anything like it. You are warriors.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURMAN: Now, as we start the week the White House and the president will also likely be pressed over these comments the president made regarding -- regarding COVID-19 testing.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: When you do testing to that extent you're going to find more people, you're going to find more cases. So, I said to my people, slow the testing down, please. They test and they test. We had tests of people who don't know what's going on. We've got tests. We've got another one over here. They young man's 10 years old, he's got the sniffles, he'll recover in about 15 minutes, that's the case.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURMAN: Joe Biden responded in a tweet over the weekend writing, quote, "I can't believe I have to say this, but we should be speeding up testing, not slowing it down."Now there has been a bit of clean-up from President Trump overnight as he has sent out the following tweet as well, writing quote, "Our coronavirus testing is so much greater, 25 million tests and so much more advanced that it makes us look like we have more cases, especially proportionally than other countries. My message on that is very clear."Dagen, back to youMCDOWELL: Black Burman, thank you so much for that.Joining now, Trump Presidential Campaign Principal Deputy of Communications Director Erin Perrine. Erin, you attended Saturday's rally. How can you assure the president -- he's got rallies coming up this week, I believe, in Arizona and Wisconsin, that the places are packed, that you don't have that many empty seats.ERIN PERRINE, TRUMP CAMPAIGN PRINCIPAL DEPUTY COMM. DIRECTOR: What we saw was an enthusiastic crowd for President Trump to be able to get his message out there.Not only were people wanting to be there, but we were right when we said that there was a real issue when it came to people feeling comfortable being able to go because of what was being reported in the news.But those who went had a great time. We saw over 12,000 people be able to attend President Trump's speech. And so, we're going to continue that ground swell. And when you couple that with the over 10 million views online, just on the Team Trump broadcast, we know that that message from President Trump was far and wide received and we feel good about what were able to do on Saturday.MCDOWELL: Tom Bevan, jump in.TOM BEVAN, CO-FOUNDER OF REALCLEARPOLITICS: Erin, I just want to get your sense of where this race stands right now. We're under five months until the election. Donald Trump is behind in our RealClearPolitics national average about 9.5 points and is behind in some of these key swing states like Florida and Michigan, Pennsylvania.Is that your sense of where this race is, or do you guys see -- see things differently? And if so, you know, what's the game plan moving forward over the coming months?PERRINE: Yes, so internally we see that when we match up President Trump with a defined Joe Biden, the president is competitive in every state across the country and we are close if not leading in those states.So, it's our job to continue to get the message out there about Joe Biden's failed 40 years of policies in D.C. So, we will continue that fight. And we fought the greatest ground game that's ever existed in presidential politics.We've got millions of volunteers engaged. We're doing volunteer trainings remotely and in person across the country, contacting over -- making over 40 million voter contacts. We're going to continue to do that all the way to Election Day.MCDOWELL: Joe Biden out-raised President Trump though, at least in the month of May by $7 million. I know that the Trump Campaign has more cash on hand, but are your focused on ramping up that fundraising?PERRINE: We're going to continue to bring in money and most of our money comes from small dollar donors across the board for the campaign. We actually had record setting month for May and we're over $800 million on this campaign, with $200 million cash on hand. Those are hardworking Americans giving to support President Trump.So, we're going to continue to fight for every vote and every dollar to make sure we get the president's message out there, because we want to be able to hold those trainings and continue to push online and across the board.MCDOWELL: Erin, thank you for being here this morning. Have a great week.PERRINE: Thanks. You too.MCDOWELL: Erin Perrine. Coming up a tech cold war, Attorney General Bill Barr telling Maria what the U.S. may do in the race for 5G.Plus censoring controversy, Federalist Publisher Co-founder Ben Domenech on his platform being silenced by Google with the help of NBC News.MCDOWELL: This Fox Business alert, Attorney General William Barr breaking the news to Maria Bartiromo on "Sunday Morning Futures" yesterday saying the U.S. must rally behind telecommunications companies like Ericcson and Nokia that pose the strongest threat against Chinese telecom giant Huawei. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIMORO: Would the U.S. consider acquiring Ericcson and Nokia to send a message tot eh world that if you use if Ericcson and Nokia you've got the backing of the United States government as an alternative to Huawei?BARR: So, I -- I mean, I -- I gave a speech a while back saying that it was -- that two companies best positioned to compete with Huawei are Ericcson and Nokia, but unlike Huawei, Huawei has the backing of the Chinese government and all the Chinese government money.So, just to give you an example, for 5G network facilities, the total global addressable (ph) market is probably around $90 billion and the Chinese government has set up a fund of 100 -- over 100 billion to subsidize it. So, they can go to countries and say, hey, we'll put this in cash free, you know, very cheap money.So, you know, that's -- that's -- that's what we're competing against with -- with Huawei and the companies like Ericcson and Nokia are the -- the strongest western competitors in this sector and I have a speech saying that -- that ultimately the west has to rally around these companies, whether that means private ownership or state involvement.BARTIROMO: So, you would be OK taking a stake, even if it's a minority in -- in these companies to offset the threat of Huawei then?BARR: That's not a decision for the Justice Department. I -- I -- I do think that the west has to pick a -- pick a horse or horses.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Mitch Rochelle, potentially acquiring -- U.S. acquiring minority stakes in Nokia and Ericcson. What do you make of that?MITCH ROCHELLE, PWC PARTNER: It's interesting Dagen. If you look at where we as the United States own enterprises, sort of state-owned enterprises on our part, it's all in the farm banks, the mortgage banks --MCDOWELL: I need to hear this.ROCHELLE: -- import banks, all of which are relevant to propping up our financial system. So, it stands to reason that if you think that 5G infrastructure is important, we should have the state-owned enterprises own a piece of that so that we can compete globally.The fact of the matter is, there are many industries that have foreign (ph) (inaudible) enterprises and it's very difficult for us to compete on the global bases when governments own a piece of the business.So, I think there's going to be more discussion about this and 5G is the future of telecommunication, so it stands to reason that this will be something that continues to be out there and discussed.MCDOWELL: Lee Carter, your quick reaction?LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT OF MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS: I think it's really important that we frame this around the investment in 5G, rather than about being private owned, because I think the United States does need to be involved in the future of 5G, 5G is where it's at.We want to be at the forefront, we are about innovation and that's what this needs to be about rather than us versus China owning (inaudible), I think this is really about America innovation and that's what we need to be focuses on.MCDOWELL: Coming up, big tech's influence. Attorney General Bill Barr talking to Maria about the platforms sway over content. Essentially Google can put you out of business if it wants to and we talk to a guest who was on the forefront of that.Plus, New York City bouncing back, one small business owner who defied state orders, opening his business as the Big Apple rolls into phase two today. We're back after the break.MCDOWELL: Welcome back. I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Monday, June 22nd. Your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.Futures set for a triple digit gain at the open. 199 point gain on the Dow futures. Stocks in the green across the board despite a sell off Friday over Apple keeping stores closed, some of them amid the pandemic. But it was a winning week for all three major market gauges here.In Europe today, stocks there largely flat after erasing earlier losses. The EU and China meeting for a video summit today hoping to ease tensions over coronavirus disinformation. We have losses across the board at the moment, although slight.In Asia overnight it was also selling galore on a resurgence of COVID cases. All four major markets there to the downside.China revealing new details for Hong Kong's controversial new national security law. Cheryl Casone has more. Cheryl.CASONE: Yeah, that's right Dagen. China unveiled the blueprints for the security law over the weekend. It would allow Beijing to override Hong Kong's independent legal system. According to Chinese State Media, a special bureau will be set up in Hong Kong to investigate and prosecute crimes considered threatening to national security. The law also would allow Hong Kong's top official to hand pick which judges hear cases. China's legislature is currently reviewing the proposal.Well, China has suspended poultry and pork from the Tyson food plan in Arkansas after hundreds of employees tested positive for COVID-19. The company announced last week that more than 480 workers tested positive for the virus at two facilities in the state. This after outbreaks at plants in North Carolina and Nebraska and Iowa. Tyson foods said in a statement its looking into the reports and added that global health organizations agree there is no evidence to support transmission of the virus through food.And then finally, here's a look at what is trending this morning on foxbusiness.com. In the streaming wars battle Amazon Prime now offering three times more movies than Netflix. Amazon's Prime Video averages more than 1,400 movies per dollar. As movie theaters start to reopen big blockbusters are slated to debut in July and August, including Disney's Mulan, Tenet, Bill and Ted Face the Music, and Marvel X-Men Reboot, The New Mutants. And finally this, wealthy Americans are flocking to Turks and Caicos to buy luxury real estate, despite the coronavirus pandemic. And those are your headlines Dagen.MCDOWELL: Keith Richards owns property on Parrott Cay in Turks and Caicos. Just saying. Thank you, Cheryl. Google's crackdown, in the meantime, NBC had reported the tech giant planned to demonetize both Zero Hedge and The Federalist over alleged racist commentary in the comment section. But NBC had reported The Federalist to Google itself. Essentially NBC, a news organization was ratting out a competitor, who had been critical of it, in cahoots with a left wing foreign organization. Google, ultimately reviewing the claims, and asking The Federalist to take down its comment section but allowed it to remain on the advertising platform. Joining me now, the publisher of The Federalist, Ben Domenech. Ben, good morning. What is, what's--BEN DOMENECH, PUBLISHER, THE FEDERALIST: Good morning Dagen.MCDOWELL: Do people understand the gravity of what happened, particularly NBC's actions, in an election year? You want to talk about election interference, but also, the power of Google at this point, to essentially, as I believe you have said, de-platform, demonetize, and put out of business, any publisher it doesn't agree with.DOMENECH: Well Dagen I want to first say it's great to be talking to you again, its great to be with you. I want to make a slight correction to what you said, which is that the way that NBC reported this initially.MCDOWELL: Sorry.DOMENECH: They said that this was because of content on our site, namely an article that we ran that was critical of the media generally, but also of NBC. And that's something that they did at the behest of a foreign based group. A tiny little thing that barely counts as being called a think tank that is designed to go after all types of sites who publish things that they disagree with. What we're really seeing here is the power that small groups have to weaponize these large internet entities against people that they don't like. It's the appeal of radical leftists going after people whose opinions they think don't just, you know, run afoul of their ideas, but shouldn't even see the light of day, or have the financial support to continue staying open. And I think that we're only going to see more of that.Google, in this case, I think, embarrassed by the whole situation, came up with the spin that it was because of our comment section. That's something that actually undercuts all of their arguments about section 230, which Attorney General Barr addressed with Maria this weekend in a way that I think clearly sets up a situation where that aspect of our law is going to be reformed.MCDOWELL: I'll point out that was the Communications Decency Act, that was two years before Google was even founded that they passed that into law.DOMENECH: Yeah.MCDOWELL: If you want to talk about how dated it is. Well, you brought up Maria talking to Attorney General Bill Barr on Sunday Morning Futures about big tech's influence over all platforms of free speech. I want you to listen to this and just react.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Google did select The Federalist, Zero Hedge, and try to cut off their advertising revenue. Senator Tom Cotton also told me that he got a call from someone at Twitter who said take down your Tweet immediately about the police needing the military to back them up, otherwise we're deleting your account entirely.WILLIAM BARR, UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL: Right. There's something, you know, very disturbing about what's going on. To some extent there was a bait and switch over the past couple of decades. These companies held themselves out as open to all comers. That's how they built up all their membership and their networks. Saying, you know, we have a wide variety of views, people can come in and post their views and their positions and their statements. And that's what led to people to join and then get the strong market position they have. Then, they've switched. Now they're being more selective, and they're starting to censor different viewpoints. But you have this concentration of these very large companies that have that kind of influence on the sharing of information and viewpoints in our society.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Ben, where does this go in terms of the government?DOMENECH: Well, what I think we're seeing right now a shift in the Overton window in terms of what people are talking about on Capitol Hill, both on the right and the left. I had calls from both Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill, Congressman and Senators about this subject, because they're deeply concerned about the outsized power of big tech. And frankly the ability of small woke leftist mob to target someone within the building, find someone who can flip a switch, and make arbitrary decisions that can ultimately bankrupt or end entire business platforms that exist and depend on these ad networks. We have never seen companies as powerful as this, and Attorney General Barr is correct when he says that this kind of bait and switch. That this was a situation that allowed for the growth of the internet, but now they're acting as if they're still the small scrappy upstarts when in reality they hold total dominant power over these ad networks, over the ability of companies to survive.MCDOWELL: But a lot of people saw this building over a period of years, as these companies got bigger and bigger and bigger. And the conservative narrative has always been free market, don't get in the way, government shouldn't pick and choose what companies could be bought by a larger corporation. In fact, I think it was about three years ago, on The Federalist website, you all published, its long, article called Cool It on the Google Monopoly Talk.DOMENECH: Yes.MCDOWELL: Was that part of the problem? Is that the narrative was always that government needs to step back or hands off? And now these corporations are dangerously large.DOMENECH: Well I think that there are two aspects at this. One is, of course, that we want to have companies that behave the right way. That are good actors within the marketplace. That are not trying to crush any kind of competition in ways that are underhanded or using government. On the other hand, that requires them to behave in certain ways that are responsible and not become the tools of these woke leftist mobs. If that kind of thing happens, and keep in mind, this is both right and left who have been criticizing these entities. Then inevitably you're going to see a political response. I actually think Google at this point, and a lot of these other companies should start to get their minds around the fact that 230 reform opening up the Communications Decency Act, as you made reference to, might end up being the moderate situation, because otherwise they might end up being viewed as public utilities, where people are completely over regulating them.We saw this happen, frankly with the railroads back in the day. Where because of their bad behavior, government stepped in because there was so much consumer outcry. I think at this point, you know, these entities really have to take a hard look at the way that their behaving and who they're actually listening to when they make such serious decisions.MCDOWELL: Have people talked about breaking these companies up? I think Elizabeth Warren has been pretty public about it, but is Google going the way of AT&T?DOMENECH: You know, I don't know about that. I think it's a little too early to say. But I will say that, you know, we're at a point now where it's kind of like do you want the Elizabeth Warren solution to this or do you want the Josh Hawley solution to this? Because, both right and left, when they agree on something in Washington, you know this Dagen, that's when companies should start to take notice. Because that's when things happen.MCDOWELL: Ben, are you going to be able to bring back the comments section? How's that going to work?DOMENECH: We absolutely will. You know, we had a completely unregulated comment section before. Because that's kind of my inclination. But we might to have to have a situation where people have to use a real name log in, or something like that in order to pass muster. We'll see, but we're going to bring back comments. I'm not actually all that big on comments section myself, because I don't think that they're all that productive, but we're not going to be pushed around by some big tech entity telling us what we can and can't do. Of course, now the comment section is essential.MCDOWELL: I think everyone should be very very upset, disturbed and afraid of what happened to The Federalist, regard..if you're anybody in this country, regardless of where you fall politically. Because it is a huge abuse of a great deal of power and manipulation. Ben, it was great to see you. Hey, Happy Father's Day. I'm a little late, but you know, that's on deck for you. Mr. Domenech.DOMENECH: Thank you so much Dagen.MCDOWELL: Really exciting for you.DOMENECH: Yes, it is.MCDOWELL: Please come back.DOMENECH: Thank you very much.MCDOWELL: Alright, take care.DOMENECH: Absolutely.MCDOWELL: Bye, Ben Domenech. Coming up, New York City bouncing back. One small business owner who defied state orders and opened his business early now able to legally reopen his business as New York City rolls into phase two. Plus, buying music history. Kurt Cobain's unplugged guitar fetching plenty at auction. We take a look ahead.MCDOWELL: New York City once the national epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak, coming back, trying to come strong. Restaurants and bars are now open for outdoor dining, while office spaces, in store retail, hair salons, barber shops can welcome people back with limited capacity. Joining me now, the Beard Barberia Founder, the Brooklyn business legally reopening after paying fines for defying lockdown orders last month. The move prompting swift action by the NYPD. Joining us now, the owner of Beard Barberia, Ilya Iskhakov. And I know I just butchered that, and I apologize. Ilya, what are your expectations for today? Do you have customers just on the books ready to come in and wear a mask?ILYA ISKHAKOV, OWNER, BEARD BARBERIA: Well, yeah, my customers are ready. They coming in as it is.MCDOWELL: Ilya, what happened with you trying to reopen when the NYPD came in and then shut you down? What happened with that?ISKHAKOV: Well, that was back in May. And they came they try to give a ticket and my customers as well. So, that's the reason why I closed, was because they were going to give my customers tickets. And I wasn't up for it.MCDOWELL: Right.ISKHAKOV: I told them to give me a fine, and they said they were going to summon you and your customers. So, that's why I closed. And then when I found out that Long Island was going to open June 10, the barber shops, I was going to risk my customers going to Long Island to get a haircut, because I was out of business for three months. And if I let that happen, then I probably would have been out of business.MCDOWELL: Ilya, how are you holding up financially? Were you able to get Paycheck Protection money? Tell us about that.ISKHAKOV: No, I didn't get no PPP, because I'm not even sure, but I wasn't qualified for it. But then I opened a small business loan, and now I got a small business loan, that's about it.MCDOWELL: Are you going to be able, what are your expectations for money coming in the door? Are you hopeful?ISKHAKOV: Well, we were the first ones open back in June 8th, so it was a high demand for haircuts, because nobody had haircuts for about three months. And we were very busy, so we were happy with that. But we'll see what's going to happen now.MCDOWELL: We wish you the best of luck. Ilya, I'm going to try this, my name Dagen gets mispronounced all the time, Iskhakov, did I get it right?ISKHAKOV: It's Iskhakov, close enough.MCDOWELL: With a southern accent, nothing sounds right, so, with respect, Ilya, of Beard Barberia, the best of luck to you sir. Coming up, owning music history. Kurt Cobain's unplugged guitar fetching a bundle on the auction block. We take a look.MCDOWELL: It's time for the morning buzz. First up a piece of rock and roll history. Kurt Cobain's guitar from Nirvana's iconic 1993 MTV unplugged appearance selling for, wait for it, $6 million dollars at auction. The sale, however, a bit controversial. Cobain's daughter, Frances Bean Cobain, lost the guitar to her ex-husband during their divorce. Big legal fight over it. Tom, your reaction.BEVAN: Well, I'm from Seattle, so I get it. Kurt Cobain, obviously a huge icon. But, $6 million bucks is an awful lot for a guitar. You know, Dagen I was also thinking about this story, Nirvana and Kurt Cobain, they hated the commercial aspect of the music business, so I was wondering what Kurt Cobain would think about this. Whether he would flattered by it, or horrified by the fact that his guitar sold for this much money.MCDOWEL: Well said. Next up, no need to cop out. With call to end police and crime related television shows growing, the Hollywood Reporter says that networks do rely on the genre for their programming. Last season, crime related shows made up 20 percent, 1/5 of all programming on major networks. In 2014 the genre made 29 percent of programming. Mitch.MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER AND BUSINESS DEVELOPER, PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS: As far back as I can remember, Dagen, I was watching cop shows on TV. Adam 12, Dragnet, Chips, they were sort of part of my TV upbringing, so I couldn't imagine TV without them, and I hope the cancel culture doesn't eliminate cop shows in television.MCDOWELL: Most definitely. And finally, talk about a dream job. Anheuser- Busch owned Devil's Backbone Brewery has created the position of Chief Hiking Officer. The lucky guy or gal will be paid to hike across 14 Appalachian Trail states next year where it will beer parties and document their journey on social media. Lee, what do you think of this? Listen, the Appalachian Trail is extremely, extremely, if you try to hike the whole thing, it is treacherous. But what do you, beer and hiking? Discuss.CARTER: Dangerous. But I do think it's an interesting strategy, because look, we're talking them. And this is probably a craft beer we might not have otherwise been talking about. So, I think it's good publicity to try and talk about a craft beer for a niche market. And, why not. But be careful, don't drink and hike too much.MCDOWELL: Broken ankle. Torn ACL. I could go down the list. Tom, what do you think of this?BEVAN: It's a, obviously, a gimmicky thing. And I think Lee's right, we're talking about, so in that sense it's a success. But yeah, I'm not sure that it's something that people are going be taking to necessarily drinking and hiking.MCDOWELL: Mitch, I could see you drinking some booze or beer and hiking. You know, to work off the calories.ROSCHELLE: Yeah, no, I could definitely see that. I also have college aged kids. I think there's going to be a whole lot of college aged kids looking for job so, that's who may be signing up. Of course, those who are 21, but those who will be signing up for jobs like this.MCDOWELL: Well, I'm with you. Still ahead, New York City entering phase two.

TikTok to retire in the coming days of Hong Kong and USA considers banning Chinese social networkCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 7, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 316 wordsBodyMusical social network TikTok said it will retire in the coming days of Hong Kong, while US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo slid that the U.S. government is considering banning Chinese enforcement.TikTok will no longer be available at Google Play and App Stores in Hong Kong, after The Beijing authorities passed the new National Security Act last week."In light of recent developments, we have decided to halt the operations of the TikTok app in Hong Kong," a spokesperson for the social network told Axios.ByteDance, TikTok's parent company as we know it in the rest of the world, has tried to distance itself from its Chinese equivalent. The company says TikTok has not shared or shared data with the Chinese government, which would be difficult to achieve under the new standard.For his part, Pompeo noted in an interview for Fox News that the United States is "studying" the ban on Chinese social media applications, including TikTok, reacationing that "we are taking this very seriously."The state secretary has warned Americans to be careful when using TikTok, as Pompeo has pointed out, his private information could remain "in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party."Pompeo's statements and TikTok's decision to withdraw the platform from Hong Kong comes after the Indian Government announced a ban on more than 50 applications from China on 29 June, including TikTok.India opens another battlefront with China and veda TikTok and other appsAs the Indian Ministry of Information Technology emphasized, the blocking of these applications is due to the "related nature of activities detrimental to India's sovereignty and integrity, its defense, and state security and public order."TECHNOLOGY Newsletter with the most important analysis and news, every Wednesday.

SENATORS OFFER BIPARTISAN PLAN TO KEEP IP THIEVES OUT OF THE COUNTRY AS CHINA EXPANDS ESPIONAGE CAMPAIGNStates News ServiceJuly 30, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 689 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Iowa Senator Charles Grassley:Amid reports of China's increased economic and research espionage, senators Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) introduced legislation making foreign nationals engaged in the theft of U.S. intellectual property and other sensitive proprietary information inadmissible to and deportable from the United States.The Stop Theft of Intellectual Property Act (S. 4370) makes foreign nationals deportable and inadmissible if they are found to have violated laws preventing the export of certain goods, technology or sensitive information, or laws related to economic espionage and the theft or misappropriation of trade secrets."For years, the Chinese Communist Party has sought to infiltrate, replicate and abscond with sensitive U.S.-based research and innovation to the detriment of our businesses and scientists. As the world races to develop a vaccine for the deadly coronavirus originating from China, the CCP is now targeting researchers in an apparent effort to either hijack or disrupt the vaccine development process. Their selfish and dangerous campaign is not welcome in this country," Grassley said."Attempts to hack a COVID-19 vaccine show just how high the stakes are when it comes to safeguarding America's intellectual property. Foreign nationals engaged in trade secrets theft and economic espionage must be held accountable, and more needs to be done to stop researchers working on American soil while in league with our adversaries," Whitehouse said.Last week, the Justice Department announced indictments of two Chinese computer hackers suspected of working with the Chinese government to breach networks in the United States and elsewhere to steal trade secrets and intellectual property, including COVID-19 testing, treatment and vaccine research. The State Department also recently ordered China to close its Houston consulate following rampant visa fraud and economic espionage, which the department said has accelerated since the coronavirus pandemic. The FBI recently arrested a Chinese woman who failed to disclose her connections to the Chinese military on her visa application to conduct research in the United States. Under the Stop Theft of Intellectual Property Act, foreign nationals targeting sensitive U.S. information in the public or private sector, including academia, would be prohibited from entering or remaining in the United States.Grassley has long warned about the risks to U.S. research, intellectual property and trade secrets posed by foreign nationals particularly from China. As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Grassley convened an oversight hearing on foreign threats to taxpayer funded research in June 2019. Grassley also wrote to the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, Health and Human Services Inspector General, and the Department of Defense relating to foreign threats to taxpayer funded research. A Government Accountability Office review, which Grassley requested, found that federal agencies need to be doing more to protect against foreign theft of U.S. research. Grassley is also seeking a GAO review of the government's use of conflict of interest policies regarding taxpayer funded research.China has leveraged its presence in American colleges and universities to spread pro-China propaganda and steal intellectual property. In March, Grassley encouraged all schools with an active Confucius Institute to seek an FBI briefing on how China uses the institutes to seed pro-China sentiments within U.S. academia. As a result of those letters, the FBI held a teleconference with 44 schools. On the call, the FBI echoed Grassley's warning and discussed how China is actively using its connections with U.S. research centers and potential cyber intrusions to monitor America's response to the coronavirus pandemic and research efforts to develop treatments.Grassley and Whitehouse are also examining ways to screen federal grant applicants to better identify researchers seeking to misappropriate intellectual propertyStop Theft of Intellectual Property ActLoad-Date: July 30, 2020End of Document

Trump Admin Is Seriously Considering Banning TikTok And Other Chinese Apps, Pompeo SaysThe Daily CallerJuly 7, 2020 Tuesday 04:36 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: DAILY-CALLER-NEWS-FOUNDATION; techLength: 603 wordsByline: Chris White, Tech Reporter, chris@dailycallernewsfoundation.orgChris is a Missourian trying to find news angles in the blank spaces of life. Also go Chiefs!Author ImageBodyLink to ImageSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said Monday that the Trump administration is strongly considering banning TikTok and other Chinese apps.“We are taking this very seriously. We are certainly looking at it,” Pompeo told Fox News after being asked about whether President Donald Trump is making a move against the company. His comments come as national security experts warn that TikTok, Huawei, and other Chinese tech companies are a threat to national security.“Whether it was the problems of having Huawei technology in your infrastructure we've gone all over the world and we're making real progress getting that out. We declared ZTE a danger to American national security,” Pompeo said, citing telecommunications companies Huawei and ZTE.“We have worked on this very issue for a long time,” he said. (RELATED: Report Reveals Role Huawei Had In Transporting US Tech To Iran)TikTok dismissed concerns about the company's connection to China, telling CNBC in a statement Monday that the social media app is helmed by a former Disney executive, Kevin Mayer. The company hired Mayer in May amid speculation that TikTok operated under the direction of Beijing.“TikTok is led by an American CEO, with hundreds of employees and key leaders across safety, security, product, and public policy here in the U.S. We have no higher priority than promoting a safe and secure app experience for our users,” a spokesperson said in a statement, according to CNBC.“We have never provided user data to the Chinese government, nor would we do so if asked,” the spokesman added.Link to ImageLogo of the social media video sharing app Tiktok (LIONEL BONAVENTURE/AFP via Getty Images)Pompeo holds a different view. He suggested during the Fox News interview that Americans should download the app “only if you want your private information in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.”In 2012, Chinese internet entrepreneur Zhang Yiming founded TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, which now has a number of apps including TikTok, where users create and share short dance, lip-sync and comedy videos.The social media app announced in March that it would stop using China-based moderators to monitor overseas content, which will require TikTok to relocate more than 100 China-based moderators to other positions inside the company. Sen. Josh Hawley and other lawmakers have scrutinized the company.Hawley, a Missouri Republican, warned in a March press statement that ByteDance “includes Chinese Communist Party members in leadership,” adding that, “TikTok has admitted that it has sent user data to China.”The U.S. Army banned the app on all devices over national security concerns, Hawley said during his “Dangerous Partners: Big Tech & Beijing” hearing in March.Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York has also asked the U.S. intelligence community to assess TikTok's national security risks, saying in a statement in October that such apps could be used to spy on US citizens or become targets of foreign influence campaigns.TikTok joined Twitter and Facebook in plans to suspend requests from Hong Kong officials to review user information after China imposed a law placing heavy regulations on the city's use of the internet.“In light of recent events, we've decided to stop operations of the TikTok app in Hong Kong,” a company representative said, according to CNBC.Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Microsoft is negotiating the purchase of Tik Tok, suspected of having ties to the Chinese regimeCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 31, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 606 wordsBodyUS technology company Microsoft is negotiating the purchase of Tik Tok, The New York Times reported on Friday. The talks took public status amid reports on the possibility of U.S. President Donald Trump ordering his current owner, The Chinese company Bytedance, to sell the app's operations in the country.The Trump administration, like lawmakers and representatives of both political parties in the country - believes that the popular application of short videos can be used as an espionage tool by Beijing, something Bytedance denies.It is unclear how advanced the negotiations are, but any agreement reached could help alter the ownership of Tik Tok, which is estimated to have 1 billion users.Trump told reporters Friday that banning the app is among the alternatives his administration considers: "Maybe we will," he said before moving to Florida. "Maybe we'll do other things too. There are some options. But a lot of things are happening, so we'll see what happens. We are considering many alternatives to Tik Tok," he said.Days earlier, Trump received a report on the national security risks posed by the social network. The presentation was made by the Foreign Investment Committee in the United States (CFIUS), a treasury-chaired panel dealing with the companies and acquisitions affecting this issue."TikTok is under review by the CFIUS and we will make a recommendation to the president this week," U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said. "We have a lot of alternatives," he added. At the time, Trump had made comments similar to this Friday's.Concerns about this transcend America's political polarization. On Thursday, two senators - one Democrat and one Republican - called on the Justice Department (DOJ) to conduct an investigation similar to that of the CFIUS, which also included the Zoom video calling platform.Lawmakers said in turn that companies seek to relativize the magnitude of their ties with China. "Based on numerous reports, we are extremely concerned that Zoom and TikTok have disclosed private information about the Americans to the (People's Republic of China) and participated in censorship on behalf of the Chinese government," Deputy Attorney General John Demers said in the letter.In parallel, another bill seeks to make it illegal for federal employees to use the app on government devices.Tik Tok, for his part, has sought to distance himself from the fact that he is owned by a Chinese company. With respect to the security of user data, it has ensured that it is stored in the United States, and that users have a backing in Singapore.In a blog post, Tik Tok Executive Chairman Kevin Mayer said: "We are not politicians, we do not accept political publicity and we do not have an agenda; our only goal is to remain a vibrant and dynamic platform for everyone to enjoy."The United States is not the first country to act on its concerns of this nature. At the end of June, and after recording a series of clashes with China on a diffusely delimited border, India banned implementation - as well as 59 other Chinese applications - claiming that they are involved in activities "damaging to India's sovereignty and integrity, Indian defense, state security and public order."Most of the applications were pointed out by Indian intelligence agencies in the face of concerns that they were collecting data from theand possibly also by sending them outside the country's borders.Learn more about this topic:Amid tensions with China, India banned TikTok and WeChat over security concernsU.S. senators asked Justice Department to investigate zoom and TikTok's ties to China threaten national securityLoad-Date: August 1, 2020End of Document

Trump mulls banning Chinese TikTok appCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 8, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 362 wordsBodyU.S. President Donald Trump said he was considering banning Chinese TikTok, amid strong tensions between Washington and Beijing."It's something we're seeing," Trump said in a television interview on Tuesday with host Greta Van Susteren."It's a big deal. Look, what happened to China with this virus, what they've done to this country and the whole world is disgraceful," he said, merely stating that the ban is "one of the many options" under study against China, which he accuses of a lack of transparency regarding the pandemic.His statements echo those of his Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, who this week stated that the United States "considers" banning Chinese social media apps, including TikTok, on suspicion that Beijing uses them to spy on users.On Wednesday, Pompeo told reporters that the U.S. government is evaluating "every instance" in which it believes that its citizens' data, on their phones, or in their health care records, are at risk."We want to make sure that the Chinese Communist Party doesn't have a way of easily accessing that," he said, noting that "measures that preserve or protect that information will be sought."Despite these threats, TikTok, who denies Washington's accusations, announced Wednesday the launch of a platform that allows SMEs to create app-specific advertising clips.TikTok, very popular with younger people thanks to its videos on humor, dance and music, belongs to the Chinese group ByteDance and has almost a billion users worldwide.The platform has often had to defend itself against its ties with China."TikTok is led by an American chief executive, with hundreds of employees and managers (...) here in the United States," said a spokesman for the group, cited by the Bloomberg news agency."We have never provided user data to the Chinese government and we wouldn't if asked to do so," he added.With regard to its new TikTok For Business platform, Tik Tok clearly hopes that "its community known for its creativity, inventiveness and good humor" will attract companies looking for a young audience.With this, TikTok could compete with its elders in this very profitable niche, whether with Facebook, YouTube or Twitter.Load-Date: July 9, 2020End of Document

Center for Strategic & International Studies: How Scary Is TikTok?Targeted News ServiceJuly 15, 2020 Wednesday 10:16 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1170 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Center for Strategic and International Studies issued the following commentary by James Andrew Lewis, senior vice president and director of the Technology Policy Program:After a long, untroubled slumber, the United States has awoken to the risks of China's massive espionage campaign. China's spies are inventive, tolerant of risk, and well resourced, making them formidable opponents. China has constructed the world's largest surveillance state and does not hesitate to use information technology to spy on its citizens and others. Anything that is Chinese and connects to the internet can create risk.So it is unsurprising that TikTok, the wildly popular entertainment app, has fallen under suspicion. If you have ever watched TikTok, you know it is a channel for short, homemade videos, usually young adults lip-syncing songs or copying some favorite meme, accompanied by the usual dog and cat videos that crowd the internet. This seems harmless. What are the charges against TikTok?There are four: Chinese intelligence services harvest useful information from TikTok; the personal information TikTok collects when you open an account can be exploited by the Chinese state; downloading the app gives access to Chinese malware; and TikTok is a vehicle for Chinese influence operations. None of these charges hold up to scrutiny.It is good that Chinese espionage and cybersecurity have become major topics of concern in the public discussion, but sometimes that discussion seems more like a robotic repetition of charges irrespective of probability rather than a careful assessment. If you have watched TikTok, you may find it addictive, but it contains nothing of intelligence value. If the Chinese services have been driven to attempt to find intelligence value in 15-second videos of lip-syncing teenagers, they are in desperate shape. So charge one makes no sense.Nor is the personal information (PII) supplied to TikTok useful. It is the kind of data collected by most apps--check out the permission you have given to some popular location apps. China does not need PII on young adults, since its 2015 hack of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) supplied it with the federal form (SF-86) used to apply for classified positions. These forms contain a wealth of personal information--marital arrangements, mental health, employment history, arrests, or military service. OPM was the largest of a series of Chinese hacks against medial insurance companies and travel services associated with federal employees and provided the Chinese with a trove of invaluable information for counter-intelligence purposes used to identify U.S. intelligence officers and their Chinese agents. The OPM data appears to have never been used for blackmail (the dating app Grindr would have been much better for that, and even it was never used for blackmail). In any case, TikTok stores PII outside of China and says it does not share it with the Chinese government, a statement that is probably credible as TikTok knows sharing PPI with China would kill its business. Charge two makes no sense.Getting a user to download a "poisoned" app is a good technique for surreptitiously installing malware, but it is also well known. With swarms of cybersecurity research scrutinizing TikTok for flaws, no malware has been discovered. Nor have there been outflows of information, which shows either admirable discretion from the Chinese as they perhaps wait for TikTok to reach one billion users or a complete lack of interest given the kind of information on TikTok and the nature of its users, neither of which could be considered prime targets for collection. Charge three is, at best, not proven, and it seems safe to reject it.Charge four reflects the growing Chinese efforts to influence Western politics to adopt attitudes more favorable to China. This is a difficult task for a Leninist police state, and Chinese influence operations have not been persuasive. Here is a video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCm3sbujB8g) of a Chinese rapper chanting about how Western media fabrications misrepresent China. It is dreadful. Here is another with a collection of Chinese pop stars crooning about the benefits of the social credit surveillance system. Even if it wasn't in Chinese, it is hard to see U.S. teenagers hypnotized into rushing out to buy a copy of Xi Jinping Thought (a bestseller in China but a bit dry). TikTok as a Chinese influence engine is outlandish.TikTok needs to do better on dealing with Chinese censorship. They, like many information technology companies, say they must respect the laws of the country in which they operate. This approach was not a problem when we did not recognize the worsening political conditions in China. It is not a problem unique to TikTok--Hollywood would never dare to make a film critical of China, given the importance of its market (the Chinese are under no such constraint, and films where Americans are the villains are not uncommon), and can at times pander to China. TikTok's best course would be to copy the practice of others. If it chooses to have one set of content for China and another for everyone else, it can create what is essentially an internal Great Firewall. But if TikTok must respect the laws of the countries in which it operates, it must respect the laws of the United States, which do not permit censorship. Chinese government requests to remove content should not apply in the United States, and the process for administering them must be transparent. The model here might be Google's reports on law enforcement requests or government requests to remove content.These problems are not uncommon for social media companies, all of whom wrestle with content control, and if anything TikTok's actions reflect a lack of maturity in company processes. This will improve over time. Beyond that, given official discomfort with TikTok, the company may need to change its ownership structure. TikTok is a U.S. company owned by a Chinese parent, ByteDance. ByteDance could accept being a passive investor in TikTok with no operational or management functions, or it could divest itself and sell TikTok the way that the Chinese company Kunlun was forced by the Committee on Foreign Investment to divest itself of Grindr.China continues to be hostile, meaning that there will be a messy and drawn out divorce between it and the United States. TikTok is caught in the middle, and some actions, while masked as security concerns, seem more intended simply to punish China. There are good reasons to be deeply concerned about China and espionage, but TikTok is probably not one of them. China's troubling behavior and the politics of the relationship mean that TikTok will need to assuage the concerns of the United States and other countries, and this may include divestiture, but as the company works through this problem, don't be afraid to let your teenager use one of their favorite apps.[Category: Political]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7175758 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: July 15, 2020End of Document

Divided West can do little as China tightens up on Hong KongAssociated Press InternationalJuly 1, 2020 Wednesday 12:55 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 956 wordsByline: SYLVIA HUI, Associated PressDateline: LONDON BodyLONDON (AP) — From Tokyo to Brussels, political leaders have swiftly decried Beijing’s move to impose a tough national security law on Hong Kong that cracks down on subversive activity and protest in the semi-autonomous territory.But the rhetoric has more bark than bite. For people in Hong Kong, the question is: Will international anger and statements of concern make any difference?Individual countries have little leverage over Beijing on human rights, experts say. A joint effort could make a difference, but coordinated action seems unlikely given strained ties between the Trump administration and many of Washington’s traditional European allies.“The U.S.A. and EU are moving in different directions in many areas. It is perhaps to China’s advantage that that should be so,” said Rod Wye, an Asia-Pacific associate fellow at the Chatham House think tank in London. In particular, Europeans do not want to be drawn into the U.S.-China trade war, he said.“Expressions of concern are certainly not going to change the Chinese intention one little bit,” he added.A joint U.S.-European report released this week on relations with China described “a deep sense of frustration, fatigue, and futility. The stronger China gets, the less willing it has become to even engage perfunctorily with the West on the issue.”The report — from the Asia Society, the Bertelsmann Stiftung and George Washington University — said that concern about human rights abuses in China remains deep, from the new security law in Hong Kong, which went into effect Tuesday night, to the repression of Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang region in western China.China routinely dismisses all such criticism as interference in its domestic affairs. One of the crimes in the Hong Kong security law explicitly outlaws receiving funding or support from overseas to disrupt lawmaking in Hong Kong or impose sanctions on the city.“This issue is purely China’s internal affairs, and no foreign country has the right to interfere,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said.Many fear the law will be used to curb opposition voices and see it as Beijing’s boldest move yet to erase the legal firewall between the mainland’s Communist Party system and Hong Kong, which was promised a high degree of autonomy and civil liberties under a “one country, two systems” principle.Britain called the law “deeply troubling” and said it “lies in direct conflict with China’s international obligations.” The U.S. warned that China’s repeated violations of its international commitments “is a pattern the world cannot ignore.” And the European Union warned that China risked “very negative consequences” to its reputation and to business confidence in the global financial hub.Steve Tsang, who directs the China Institute at London’s School of Oriental and African Studies, said that if the EU were to join forces on the issue with the “Five Eyes” alliance — the U.S., Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand — the group would have real economic clout. The EU is China’s largest trading partner.But he said it was “far-fetched” for either British Prime Minister Boris Johnson or U.S. President Donald Trump to work with the EU on the issue.“It is reasonable for Beijing to calculate that both the U.K. and U.S. are paper tigers,” Tsang said. “Boris is focused on Brexit. He is happy to cooperate with anyone except for the EU.”Chinese experts said the West isn't able to sway China because of fundamental differences in their views. The West stresses political rights, while China emphasizes economic rights, said Yu Wanli, an international relations professor at Beijing Language and Culture University.“It is not that China is trying to withstand pressure from the West, but it is that China’s own policies have achieved results,” Yu said. “China doesn’t need to care about pressure from the West.”Stressing a legal and moral duty to its former colony, Britain on Wednesday announced it is extending residency rights for up to 3 million Hong Kongers eligible for British National Overseas passports, allowing them to live and work in the U.K. for five years. In Brussels, the European Parliament last month passed a resolution calling on the EU to consider taking Beijing to the International Court of Justice.Reinhard Bütikofer, chair of the European Parliament’s delegation for China relations, said lawmakers are considering other measures, such as a ban on exports of “technology utilized to oppress Hong Kong citizens.” Other options include a “lifeboat” offer for Hong Kong democracy activists, and pushing for the United Nations to appoint a special envoy to the city.“The major burden is on the incoming German presidency to rally member states in following through in what they have indicated in the past, that this would not remain without consequences,” Bütikofer said.In the U.S., the Trump administration has said it will bar defense exports to Hong Kong, cancel policy exemptions that give Hong Kong special treatment, and impose visa restrictions on Chinese Communist Party officials “responsible for undermining Hong Kong’s autonomy.”Zhao, the foreign ministry spokesperson, said the U.S. will never succeed in blocking Hong Kong's national security legislation through sanctions.Wye, the Chatham House associate fellow, said the impact of such measures on China is likely to be marginal.“I don’t think Beijing has anything particular to fear because the sanctions they’re talking about are mainly withdrawing special status in particular areas of Hong Kong and treating it more like the rest of China,” he said. “So the people likely to be hurt are Hong Kong businesses and Hong Kong people rather than Chinese businesses and the Chinese government.”Load-Date: July 1, 2020End of Document

Former Chinese football star calls for downing Communist PartyCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 5, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 373 wordsBodyA Chinese football legend, Hao Haidong, came across censorship in his country after publicly protesting for the overthrow of the Ruling Communist Party in Beijing.Hao Haidong, 50, is the top scorer in the history of the Chinese national team, with 41 targets. Known for his strong character and explosive statements, he had a brilliant career in Chinese football from the mid-1980s to the early 2000s.He was part of the group with which China went to the 2002 World Cup, the only one that has played for now the Asian giant.In a video posted Thursday on YouTube, Hao Haidong criticizes the behavior of his nefarious judgment of political and sporting leaders during his playing career, noting that in the Chinese system he had no opportunities to develop his talent as he could."I think this Communist Party system should be removed from the scene of history," the footballer said, alongside a woman presented as his wife, former badminton world champion Ye Zhaoying."The specter of communism must not continue to plan on the world. It's the conclusion I've come to," he says.The account of Hao Haidong and his wife on the social network Weibo, where he has more than seven million subscribers, were inaccessible on Friday and no Chinese media collected the ex-member's statements.In his video, the footballer alludes to a "New China Federation," an imaginary Chinese regime that would replace the current "People's Republic of China", which is led by the Chinese Communist Party (PCC).That hypothetical regime was symbolically proclaimed by controversial Chinese millionaire Guo Wengui on Thursday, the anniversary of the bloody repression of the Tiananmen movement in 1989.Guo Wengui lives in New York, from where he regularly threatens the Chinese government with revelations about the corruption of that country's elites.He himself is accused of corruption by Chinese justice. Also known as Miles Kwok, he is a figure close to Steve Bannon, former president of US President Donald Trump.The AFP found that the person in the video is Hao Haidong, but could not determine when it was recorded.

It's another win for a company that went from making cables and antennas to AirPods, and its stock rose to 7 percent on Monday, while Wistron posted a drop of up to 10 percent.The introduction of a local Chinese star helps Apple score points with Beijing, at a time when Washington officials accused it of supporting the Chinese government.It also shakes Apple's supply chain by threatening to snatch the business from long-standing partners Hon Hai Precision Industry and Pegatron. The latter fell nearly 4 percent, while Hon Hai, also known as Foxconn, closed with a drop of 1.4 percent."Apple is introducing Luxshare into the iPhone assembly business to further reduce its costs, while this reflects that Taiwanese companies are starting to get rid of Apple's low-margin businesses," said Tsai Ming-fang, industrial economist at Taipei-based Tamkang University."This change can further drive Taiwanese companies to withdraw from China as margins continue to decline as contract manufacturing becomes more standardized," he explained.Apple, which exerts enormous influence on major changes among its major suppliers, has sought a mainland Chinese partner in part to expand its production sources during an intense U.S.-China trade war.From Foxconn to Pegatron and Quanta, manufacturers hired by the world's largest Taiwanese electronics brands are exploring ways to move production away from China, to avoid rising tariffs, and advance the value chain.The iPhone assembly requires hundreds of thousands of workers, who are often selected from a volatile and ever-changing group of migrant workers, which feeds on margins.What Bloomberg Intelligence saysLuxshare's announced acquisition of two Wistron factories in China can give you the ability to win iPhone assembly orders starting in 2023, according to our scenario analysis. This would greatly affect Pegatron and possibly reduce 3-4 percent of its sales, while Hon Hai's diversity will better insulate it from the coup, we believe.Wistron may have been facing difficulties competing. Its Kunshanplant, which mainly manufactures iPhones, achieved a net profit of just 0.2 percent in 2019, nomura analysts reported on a July 17 note. The Taiwanese company accounted for only about 5 percent of the totaliPhone assembly orders, they said.Luxshare, on the other hand, is one of China's largest fast-growing electronics companies and is receiving more and more orders from established firms such as Hon Hai. It has become the world's largest manufacturer of AirPods, one of the best-selling consumer accessories on the market, helping it record one of Asia's best stock results in 2019.The company agreed to pay about 3.3 billion yuan ($470 million) for two Wistron subsidiaries in eastern China. One of those units, based in Kunshan City, is Wistron's only iPhone manufacturing plant, according to people familiar with the company's business.The agreement is scheduled to be completed by the end of the year, following regulatory approval. On Monday CICC increased its target price on Luxshare by approximately 16 percent.Load-Date: July 21, 2020End of Document

KING COSPONSORS BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION TO DEVELOP 5G ALTERNATIVES TO HUAWEI AND ZTEStates News ServiceJune 4, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 996 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Maine Senator Angus King:Today, U.S. Senator Angus King (I-Maine), co-chair of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission (CSC), announced his cosponsorship of the Utilizing Strategic Allied (USA) Telecommunications Act, bipartisan legislation aimed to encourage and support U.S. innovation in the race for 5G, through significant investments in technological alternatives to the security risks posed by Huawei and ZTE. The bill would reassert U.S. and Western leadership by encouraging competition that capitalizes on US. software advantages, accelerating development of an open-architecture model (known as O-RAN) that would allow for alternative vendors to enter the market for specific network components, rather than having to compete with Huawei end-to-end."As we are seeing in this pandemic, America is asymmetrically cyber-connected compared to our rivals but that also makes us asymmetrically vulnerable we simply must ensure our networks are completely protected, and encourage U.S. competition with international providers," said Senator King. "With the vast majority of our critical infrastructure owned and operated by the private sector this bipartisan effort would help facilitate collaboration between our government and private sector to create 5G alternatives to Huawei and ZTE and lessen U.S. and international reliance on Chinese telecommunication companies. Our cellular networks are critical infrastructure, and we can't outsource that responsibility to dubious global entities."Heavily subsidized by the Chinese government, Huawei is poised to become the leading commercial provider of 5G, with far-reaching effects for U.S. economic and national security, and that of our allies and partners leading Senator King to make the statement in an Intelligence Committee hearing "Huawei can either be a global telecommunications provider, or an agent of the Chinese state they can't be both." With close ties to the Communist Party of China, Chinese state-directed technology companies present unacceptable risks to our national security and to the integrity of information networks globally. However, U.S. efforts to convince foreign partners to ban Huawei from their networks have stalled amid concerns about a lack of viable, affordable alternatives.The Utilizing Strategic Allied (USA) Telecommunications Act would:-Require the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to direct at least $750 million, or up to 5 percent of annual auction proceeds, from new auctioned spectrum licenses to create an O-RAN RandD Fund to spur movement towards open-architecture, software-based wireless technologies, funding innovative, 'leap-ahead' technologies in the U.S. mobile broadband market. The fund would be managed by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), with input from the FCC, Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA), and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), among others;-Create a $500 million Multilateral Telecommunications Security Fund, working with our foreign partners, available for 10 years to accelerate the adoption of trusted and secure equipment globally and to encourage multilateral participation, and require reports for Congress on use of proceeds and progress against goals to ensure ample oversight;-Create a transition plan for the purchase of new equipment by carriers that will be forward-compatible with forthcoming O-RAN equipment so small and rural carriers are not left behind;-Increase U.S. leadership in International Standards Setting Bodies (ISSBs) by encouraging greater U.S. participation in global and regional telecommunications standards forums and requiring the FCC write a report to Congress with specific recommendations;-Expand market opportunities for suppliers and promote economies of scale for equipment and devices by encouraging the FCC to harmonize new commercial spectrum allocations with partners where possible, thus promoting greater alignment with allies and driving down the cost of Huawei alternatives.As co-chair of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission and a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and Armed Services Committee, Senator King has been outspoken about international security threats to the U.S. government and critical information technology infrastructure.Last month, Senator King joined a bipartisan, bicameral group effort to encrypt phone calls between the House of Representatives and the Senate to protect communications against foreign surveillance. He also joined CSC commissioners to testify before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs and present the CSC's recommendations to establish a comprehensive, forward-looking security strategy and posture for the United States. Senator King has consistently raised the alarm about the threat that Huawei and ZTE post to U.S. national security. In July, the Securing Energy Infrastructure Act led by Senators King and Jim Risch (R-Idaho) a bill to protect the nation's energy grid from potential cyberattacks became law. In December, Senator King led a bipartisan group of senators on a letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) emphasizing the dangers of incorporating equipment manufactured by Huawei into the nation's critical infrastructure. Last year, Senator King sent a letter to the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) requesting information about NERC's efforts to protect the United States' bulk power system from supply chain vulnerabilities, particularly those posed by vendors from Russia and China. In February 2019, Senator King emphasized the need for urgent action, and questioned NERC President and CEO James Robb about the dangers of foreign equipment in America's energy grid. Later that month, he urged the Administration to protect U.S. electrical systems and infrastructure from potential cyberattacks by banning the use of inverters made by Huawei.Load-Date: June 4, 2020End of Document

Bromine Market - Growth, Trends, and Forecast (2020 - 2025); The global bromine market is expected to record a CAGR of over 4% during the forecast period. The primary factor driving the market studied is the increasing demand for clear brine fluids (CBFs) in North America.GlobeNewswireJuly 2, 2020 Thursday 10:47 AM PTCopyright 2020 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENTLength: 1279 wordsBodyNew York, July  02, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reportlinker.com announces the release of the report "Bromine Market - Growth, Trends, and Forecast (2020 - 2025)" - https://www.reportlinker.com/p05821474/?utm_source=GNW - The emergence of non-halogenated flame retardants is expected to hinder the growth of the market studied.- The shift towards energy storage is likely to act as an opportunity in the future.- Asia-Pacific dominated the market studied with more than 50% of the total volume of the market studied.Key Market TrendsIncreasing Demand for Flame Retardants- Flame retardants account for the largest share in the global bromine market. Despite, increasing regulations and ban on some of the bromine-based flame retardants, this segment is still dominating the market, owing to the effective characteristics of bromine in controlling the fire.- Polybrominated diphenylether, polybrominatedbiphenyl, decabromodiphenylether, hexabromocyclododecane, and tetrabromobisphenolare few of the examples of flame-retardant chemicals that are made using bromine.- There are around 80 different types of brominated flame retardants (BFRs), which have widely varying chemical properties, and are available in the market. Some of these types include brominated bisphenols, diphenylethers, cyclododecanes, bisphenyls, phenols, phenoxy ethanes, and phthalicacid derivatives.- BFRs are commonly used to prevent fires in electronics and electrical equipment, which accounts for more than 50% of their applications. For instance, these flame retardants are extensively used in the outer housings of TV sets and computer monitors, as the internal circuitry of such devices can heat up, and over time, collect dust. Short circuits and electrical or electronic malfunctions can occur.- Printed circuit boards also require flame retardanceproperties, which are often provided by a crosslinkedbrominated epoxy resin polymer, manufactured from tetrabromobisphenol-A (TBBPA).- In addition, BFRs are used in wire and cable compounds, for example, for use in buildings and vehicles and other building materials, such as insulation foams. They are also used in specialty fabric back-coatings for curtains, seating, and furniture, in transport and public buildings and domestic upholstered furniture.- Synergistic agents, such as antimony oxides, further increase the effectiveness of both brominated and chlorinated flame retardants, by enabling the halogen to stay in the flame zone for longer periods.- Furthermore, other applications include furniture foams, textiles, plastic casing employed in electronics, computers ,televisions, fridges, radios, and washing machines.- In recent years, legislation is concentrating on the restriction in the use of these compounds as flame retardants, all over the world. Some brominated flame-retardant producers voluntarily agreed to put restrictions on production, export, and import of their products in the European Union, in advance of legislation itself.- The federal government of the United States has regulations in place that restrict specific flame retardants, including TDBPP, PentaBDE, OctaBDE, DecaBDE, and HBCD, in specific applications.- Recently, European recyclers are lobbying for the reconsideration of a proposed EU legislation, which has lowered concentration limits for decaBDE, a brominated flame retardant, in substances and products.- Rising construction activities, across the world, is in turn boosting the demand for bromine compounds in the aforementioned applications.China to Dominate the Asia-Pacific Market- In the Asia-Pacific region, China is the largest economy in terms of GDP. The country witnessed about 6.1% growth in its GDP during 2019, even after the trade disturbance caused due to its trade war with the United States. The economic growth rate of China in 2020 was initially expected to be moderate as compared to the previous year.- However, due to the onset of COVID-19 in 2020, the economic growth of China is now expected to contract to a considerable extent. The IMF has cut the nation's GDP growth forecast to about 5.6%, on account of assumptions that the outbreak was only limited to China. However, as it is not the case currently, the GDP growth of the nation for 2020 is expected to decline further.- China is the fourth-largest producer of bromine, after Israel, Jordan, and the United States. Flame retardants are the largest application of bromine in China, followed by clear brine fluids and water treatment. Brominated flame retardants are used to hinder or suppress combustion for commercial and industrial applications, such as furniture, textile, construction, electrical, etc.- In China, the construction industry grew at a strong pace in 2019, even though the growth slowed down during the year, as compared to 2018. The construction sector has supported the economic growth in the country. Although this growth has been far less when compared to the average growth of construction sector over the past ten years.- Moreover, China has the world's largest electronics production base. Electronic products, such as smartphones, TVs, wires, cables, etc., recorded the highest growth in the electronics segment. The country serves not only domestic demand for electronics, but also exports electronic output to other countries. With the growing electronics and construction industry, the demand for the bromine-based flame-retardant application is expected to increase.- The enormous demand for organobromines, as a result of the growing need for zinc-bromine flow batteries and consumption of clear brine fluids in China, is driving the bromine market.- China is one of the major markets for zinc-bromine flow batteries, owing to the increasing electric vehicles market in the region. Although, the Chinese car market declined in 2019, the electric vehicle segment also witnessed a growth of 4.7% in 2019 with approximately 1.18 million plug-in electric cars were sold in China in 2019.- Clear brines are used as completion and drilling fluids by the oil drilling industry. China is the largest crude oil producer in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2019, the Chinese government directed Chinese state-owned oil and gas companies to increase the domestic production and reserves to improve the domestic energy security of the country.- As a result, increasing numbers of oil and gas upstream joint initiatives have emerged in the country. China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) is signing strategic cooperation agreements, which are a new and flexible method of jointly developing oil and gas fields. This is likely to drive the growth of the oil and gas industry, which, in turn, is likely to boost the demand for clear brine fluids.- Therefore, the aforementioned factors are expected to increase the demand for bromine in China over the forecast periodCompetitive LandscapenThe bromine market is a highly consolidated market, where the top four players account for more than 86% of the total global production capacity. The bromine market is primarily dominated by players, such as ICL, JBC (joint venture between Albemarle Corporation and Arab Potash Company), LANXESS, and Albemarle Corporation.Reasons to Purchase this report:- The market estimate (ME) sheet in Excel format- 3 months of analyst supportRead the full report: https://www.reportlinker.com/p05821474/?utm_source=GNWAbout ReportlinkerReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.

The true cost of a new confrontation with ChinaCNN WireJuly 2, 2020 Thursday 6:14 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1331 wordsDateline: (CNN) BodyEditor's note: Mark Hannah is a senior fellow at the Eurasia Group Foundation and host of its "None Of The Above" podcast. William D. Hartung is the director of the Arms and Security Program at the Center for International Policy. The views expressed in this commentary are their own. Read more opinion at CNN. (CNN) --  China's response to the coronavirus outbreak has provided a pretext for some in Washington to spar even more openly with Beijing. Top White House advisor Peter Navarro accused the Chinese government of exploiting the pandemic to advance its interests, and one senator even claimed that China is "trying to sabotage" America's search for a vaccine and is bent on "world domination." Steve Bannon, the mastermind of President Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, attributed the death of George Floyd, in large part, to China's misdeeds.This cartoonish depiction of villainy might be dismissed as campaign season hyperbole if it weren't informing real policy proposals. And if lawmakers wanted to find the most wasteful, counterproductive and inflammatory way to confront China, they couldn't do much better than the newly proposed Pacific Deterrence Initiative (PDI) -- a multi-billion-dollar defense-spending initiative aimed at countering China's rise. Misconceived as it is, this suite of hypersonic weapons, missile defense equipment and other tools of force projection enjoys bipartisan support and was recently included in the Senate Armed Service Committee's markup of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).Until now, much of the "new Cold War"-style mongering directed at China has been merely rhetorical. The US has not substantially increased its troop levels in East Asia as it once did in Eastern Europe, during the actual Cold War. There have been no clandestine efforts of late to topple unpalatable leaders in South Asia, as there once were in Latin America (as far as we know). But this new initiative could be a game changer. Rep. Mac Thornberry of Texas, the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, insists "it is time to put our money where our mouth is." Given the appetite that mouth has had for armed conflict in recent decades, this is a horrible idea.The PDI's financial costs are significant, but so are the costs of heightened confrontation with China -- as are those of launching another military endeavor that lacks the support of the American public. Eurasia Group Foundation polling shows a solid majority of US respondents support reducing America's military presence in Asia, not increasing it.How much money are we talking about, in this proposed buildup? If the Senate Armed Services Committee has its way, the plan will cost nearly $7 billion over the next two years and billions more in the years to come. To lawmakers who pour money into the Pentagon's existing $738 billion budget, which exceeds the levels reached during the Korean and Vietnam wars, $7 billion might seem like peanuts -- but it's real money.It would not be money well spent. The PDI is misguided and unnecessary. America's current military might, which also exceeds the peak of the Reagan buildup of the 1980s, is more than enough to address any military challenge posed by China. The US spends two and a half times more than China on its military, and there is no evidence China has ambitions to match or replace its global military machinery. China has made advances in military technology and has sparked concern among analysts with its assertive claims on islands, waters, and airspace in its vicinity, but the fact remains that China has enough problems at home. One analyst suggests that fully half of China's military is devoted to border or internal security, limiting its ability to project power beyond its borders.Throwing more money at tools of military confrontation is not only a waste of resources, but it likely invites blowback. A major military buildup in East Asia would needlessly antagonize China at a moment when cooperation with Beijing should be the focus, as it's clearly necessary to address the global recession, current and future pandemics, and climate change.Cooperation on these issues should not preclude assertive opposition to China's human rights abuses and its crackdown in Hong Kong. But a military buildup will not help the US make progress on those fronts. And it could discourage American allies in Asia from building up their own defenses, which could ultimately help China expand in the region.The PDI's plans to increase US missile defense capabilities in East Asia are particularly alarming. Despite their benign name, missile defense systems are destabilizing weapons. They undermine the logic of deterrence by allowing a nation to launch an attack with less fear of a retaliatory strike. China opposed a 2017 effort to place a missile defense system in South Korea, fearing it could be used to increase US capabilities to attack China's own retaliatory missiles rather than defend against North Korean strikes. They're stunningly ineffective, besides. A former head of the Pentagon's office of operational testing and evaluation himself testified about tests of missile defense systems, "These tests are scripted for success, and what's been astonishing to me is that so many of them have failed." Washington may view its actions as defensive, but China likely sees American efforts to increase missile defense capabilities as a precursor to attacks on its interests. For starters, the PDI's plans to improve "expeditionary airfield and port infrastructure" will be seen by Chinese leaders as a way for the US to conduct extended military campaigns in their backyard. This perception probably extends to ordinary Chinese. According to a study by the Eurasia Group Foundation, the one thing which would make American-style democracy most attractive to Chinese citizens is if "the foreign policy of the United States was more restrained." Unfortunately, the current political climate does not bode well for de-escalation. Domestic political factors steer policies on both sides of the Pacific. China's provocative rhetoric toward the US may be designed more to placate or provoke domestic audiences than to signal actual policy moves on security, trade, and the environment. And during a presidential election year in the US, when China-bashing is a perennial campaign strategy of both political parties, harsh rhetoric by President Trump is likely meant to stoke his political base. And the Biden campaign criticized the President for not being tough enough on China.The American public, however, has little appetite for this escalation. The leaders of the Senate Armed Services Committee claim the Pacific Deterrence Initiative will "send a strong signal to the Chinese Communist Party that the American people are committed to defending US interests in the Indo-Pacific." But there's little to suggest they are, especially with so much going on at home -- from the pandemic and the ensuing economic crash to demonstrations against police violence. According to another study by the Eurasia Group Foundation, a firm majority of Americans prefer to respond to China's rising influence in Asia by reducing, not increasing, the US military presence there while transitioning regional allies toward defending themselves. The most popular reason had to do with "eas(ing) the unnecessary burden on soldiers and taxpayers." Clearly and understandably, Americans think their country has overextended itself in recent decades. They appear uninterested in a new military misadventure in Asia even if they are warier of China in the aftermath of the pandemic.In the end, perhaps the biggest cost of a Pacific Deterrence Initiative is not that it would misread the geopolitics and security dynamics of Asia, but that it would mistake the security interests of America -- and misrepresent the political preferences of Americans.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

JOURNALISTS, FREE SPEECH ACTIVISTS 'AT RISK OF DYING' IN CHINESE JAILSStates News ServiceJuly 10, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 575 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:At least 10 free-speech activists are at risk of dying behind bars in China, a Paris-based press freedom group said on Friday, as the authorities continued their crackdown on online speech across the country.Three years after the death of Nobel peace laureate Liu Xiaobo, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) published a list of ten defenders of press freedom whose lives it said were "in grave danger" if they remained behind bars.Liu died on July 13, 2017 of an aggravated cancer after being denied treatment during detention.RSF said at least 114 journalists and press freedom defenders are currently locked away in Chinese jails, some under a life sentence.It said at least 10 are serving lengthy prison terms and are in danger of losing their lives owing to ill-health, including ethnic minority Uyghurs Ilham Tohti, 50, and Gulmira Imin, 42, who both edited websites targeted by the ruling Chinese Communist Party.Former Boxun, RFA, and Voice of American (VOA) journalist Zhang Haitao, 49, is serving a 19-year jail term for subversion after making comments critical of the Chinese government in overseas media, RSF said.Zhang had been "beaten and forced to wear heavy irons on [his] feet for six months, and denied sustenance," it said.Meanwhile, democracy activist and website editor Qin Yongmin, 66, "has grown weak after a total of 20 years spent in detention and labor camps in previous decades," RSF said. "His health has significantly deteriorated."Stepped-up warningsCensors at the social media platform Weibo were meanwhile stepping up warnings to platform users that they could be pursued for comments deemed to be "attacks on government departments or state media agencies."A user who gave only her surname Zhu said she knows of several people who have been summoned by police after making comments online."Anyone criticizing the government is a dissident in mainland China, and they are targeted for suppression," Zhu said. "You can't say anything about the government, because they are so fantastic and wonderful."A court in the northern port city of Tianjin recently sentenced NetEase service user Jin Shoukui for "insulting others, harming the image of the country and seriously jeopardizing the national interest online."Jin was jailed for nine months by the Nankai District People's Court, after it found him guilty of "picking quarrels and stirring up trouble," a charge frequently used to target peaceful critics of Beijing.RSF also cited concerns for the health of octogenarian publisher Yiu Man-tin, who is asthmatic and has suffered five heart attacks in prison, though repeated requests for medical parole have been denied.It said Swedish national and former Hong Kong bookseller Gui Minhai, 56, has symptoms of a serious neurological disease, but has been denied access to a doctor requested by the Swedish embassy.And free speech activist Wu Gan, 47, has lost 15 kilograms since being tortured and mistreated in detention, and suffers from cardiovascular problems as a result of electrocution, it said.Political cartoonist Jiang Yefei, 53, who was repatriated to China by Thailand despite being a U.N.-approved political refugee, has reportedly been tortured while serving his sentence in the southwestern megacity of Chongqing, with reports of vision loss in one eye, RSF said.Reported by Qiao Long for RFA's Mandarin Service.

It prohibits any "serious interference and obstruction" against the Chinese central government and Hong Kong's local government and any action that leaves them "inability to perform their duties normally."The contents of the text were kept secret until it was enacted on June 30. The local parliament was unable to intervene.This Chinese law aims to suppress subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces, acts that can be punished with life imprisonment. The content of the law leaves much room for interpretation and has generated a climate of fear throughout the territory, where the inhabitants were accustomed to expressing themselves freely.(With AFP information)MORE ON THIS TOPIC:Why Tech Giants Could Leave Hong KongVladimir Putin supported Xi Jinping in his efforts to "maintain national security in Hong Kong" following the passage of the controversial lawLoad-Date: July 15, 2020End of Document

The company has assured that TikTok has not shared or shared data with the Chinese government, which would be difficult to achieve under the new rule.For his part, Pompeo has noted in an interview for Fox News that the United States is "studying" the ban on Chinese social media applications, including TikTok, retouching that "we are taking this very seriously."The state secretary has warned Americans to be careful when using TikTok, as Pompeo has pointed out, his private information could remain "in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party."Pompeo's statements and TikTok's decision to withdraw the platform from Hong Kong comes after the Indian Government announced a ban on more than 50 applications from China on 29 June, including TikTok.As the Indian Ministry of Information Technology emphasized, the blocking of these applications is due to the "related nature of activities detrimental to India's sovereignty and integrity, its defense, and state security and public order."Load-Date: July 8, 2020End of Document

TikTok may undergo corporate changes to distance from China amid US scrutinyCNN WireJuly 9, 2020 Thursday 7:17 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 501 wordsDateline: (CNN Business) Body (CNN Business) --  The short-form video app TikTok could soon see a shakeup of its corporate structure as it confronts mounting criticism from politicians in the US over ties to its Chinese parent company. TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, is considering establishing a headquarters for the video app outside of China or a new management board to distance the service from the country, according to the Wall Street Journal, citing a source familiar with the matter.A TikTok spokesperson confirmed Thursday that its parent company is weighing changes to its corporate structure."As we consider the best path forward, ByteDance is evaluating changes to the corporate structure of its TikTok business," the spokesperson said in a statement provided to CNN Business. "We remain fully committed to protecting our users' privacy and security as we build a platform that inspires creativity and brings joy for hundreds of millions of people around the world. We will move forward in the best interest of our users, employees, artists, creators, partners, and policymakers."US politicians have raised concerns about TikTok as a potential national security risk, claiming that Chinese national security laws could give Beijing access to data on TikTok's American users. President Donald Trump said Tuesday his administration is "looking at" banning the app, affirming remarks on Monday by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.Last year, Reuters reported that the US government is conducting a national security review of ByteDance's acquisition of the US social media app Musical.ly. Lawmakers including Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley have introduced legislation that would ban TikTok from US government devices. TikTok has previously said it stores US user data on US-based servers that are not subject to Chinese law. It also recently hired an executive from Disney to become its CEO, a move that could burnish its US credentials.Skeptics say ByteDance, which is based in China, is nevertheless beholden to the Chinese government, but the case for TikTok as a threat to US security is not clear-cut.Like some other social media apps and technology companies, TikTok automatically gathers users' geolocation information, IP addresses, unique device identifiers and the content of in-app messages, according to its privacy policy. That is a lot of data, but far more sensitive information -- and potentially more damaging to national security -- was exposed by data breaches affecting the Office of Personnel Management, announced in 2015, and Equifax, disclosed in 2017, according to James Lewis, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Although TikTok's links to a private Chinese company are worthy of concern, said Lewis, the app simply wouldn't be that useful for espionage."It's right to be suspicious of the Chinese," he said. "But I'm not sure TikTok is a good intelligence tool for them."TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company. All rights reserved.Load-Date: July 9, 2020End of Document

The Nikkei average closed in Japan for a holiday, but the others, as you can say, fractionally moving overnight.Some of the top stories that we are watching this morning right now, a new coronavirus relief bill clearing a major hurdle.

The bill includes $16 billion for testing, $105 billion for helping to reopen schools, money for PPE, and another round of stimulus checks coming up.One key sticking point among Republicans, President Trump's push for a payroll tax cut; the extra $600 in jobless benefits running out just days from now.Unrest in America to report, President Trump announcing his administration is sending more federal agents to several U.S. cities to stop a growing outbreak of violence. It is called Operation Legend, named for a four year- old boy who was shot and killed while he slept in his Kansas City, Missouri home last month. The program now expanding to places like Chicago and Albuquerque.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, 45TH US PRESIDENT: The effort to shut down policing in their own communities has led to a shocking explosion of shootings, killings, murders and heinous crimes of violence. This bloodshed must end. This bloodshed will end.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, Portland has filed a temporary restraining order against federal agents already in the city, accusing those agents of detaining protesters without probable cause. New York City is threatening to file a similar suit if agents are sent to New York.The FBI is now accusing China of harboring a fugitive at its San Francisco Consulate. The biology researcher at the University of California, Davis now charged with lying about her links to the Chinese military.

And once football returns, prepare to mask up there as well at NFL Games, the spokesperson confirming the League's mask policy on Twitter, saying all fans are required to cover their faces at games this season.Tesla's second quarter earnings beat analyst expectations on both the top and the bottom line. That makes four straight quarters of profit. But now, this is exclusive - this week, we learned Elon Musk has become one of the richest people on the planet. So why isn't he paying his rent at his fancy showrooms that display Tesla cars? Sources tell me in an exclusive, Musk has tried to arrange a deferment of rent at some of his 80 showrooms here in the United States, at least one of them in New York. Said, "No, we cannot defer the rent." But instead of paying the full $700,000 in rent a month in the last four months, Musk has only paid half of that every month for the last four months, apparently promising he'll pay it off in August.Some are speculating it's a scheme to save as many millions as possible these last three months, so that Tesla could show a profit for the fourth quarter in a row this past quarter and be eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500. Tesla needs to show four straight quarters of profit for its stock to be eligible in the inclusion of the S&P 500. But his landlords are fuming, because they want to be paid. We will see if he pays up by August or faces lawsuits from Tesla landlords. Deferring half a million here and half a million there will certainly move the needle on earnings.The company reported net income last night, $104 million in GAAP earnings. Tesla also reported its first full year of profitability on a GAAP basis and that means it can now be considered for inclusion in the S&P 500 index. All of this has the stock up and it is up 280% this year.Joining me right now to talk more about all of that is ARK Invest analyst Tasha Keeney. Also joining the conversation this morning is Fox Business' Dagen McDowell; Strategic Wealth Partners' President and CEO Mark Tepper; and Fox News political analyst, author of 'Taken for Granted', Gianno Caldwell. Great to see everybody this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Thank you.MARK TEPPER, PRESIDENT & CEO, STRATEGIC WEALTH PARTNERS: Good morning.DAGEN MCDOWELL, CORRESPONDENT, FOX BUSINESS: Great to see you.BARTIROMO: Let's get into Tesla and I want to get your take, Tasha, on this story that we broke this morning. Elon Musk saying that he wants to defer the rent; he hasn't paid the full rent in four months. Did that impact earnings in your view? Is that why we're seeing $104 million in net earnings?TASHA KEENEY, ANALYST, ARK INVEST: Yes, so I think back in April, we had heard sort of some early discussions of - they were - Tesla was in talks about their rent, basically negotiating on costs during the coronavirus period while they're trying to manage costs and be careful on that side. I think I'll watch the story as it develops. This certainly isn't the first time that Tesla has been accused of fudging the numbers and past claims have been proven not to be false basically.I'll say the one thing that you can look at is deliveries, right? So, we know that deliveries beat on the quarter by nearly 20,000 cars ahead of expectations, around 90,000 cars. And in their investor report that they published, Tesla showed this graph of the deliveries in the first half of the year compared to other auto makers. I think you really can't take away the point that they have been delivering cars while everyone else has been much more impacted by the shutdowns.We're also seeing Tesla gaining market share. Their market share was about 26% year-to-date as of May, as opposed to 22% last year. So I think you really can't take those numbers away from the company. I mean they're a successful electric vehicle company and that's where the industry is going.BARTIROMO: Is there a growth story beyond cars at Tesla?KEENEY: Yes. In fact last night on the call, I was excited that Elon Musk talked so much about fully autonomous driving. Maria, we have been talking about this--BARTIROMO: Yes.KEENEY: --for years when I've come on, on the past. I think this is a major opportunity for Tesla. It's what gets us to our bull price target of $15,000 by 2024. And I think what was really interesting about last night's call is that, Musk has been more measured on these earnings calls. You can tell he's sort of hedging some of his statements. He's saying things like in my opinion.But last night, he seemed pretty confident that they were going to reach feature (ph) complete this year with a fully self-driving platform. He said that he would almost get from his house to work fully autonomously. This is a huge opportunity. It totally changes the business model; becomes a Software-as-a-Service like business model with Software-as-a-Service like margins.This is a recurring revenue stream--BARTIROMO: Yes.KEENEY: --as opposed to a one-off sale, right now, that Tesla gets with the vehicles. We've done some analysis to say that they could actually launch ride-hailing this year with human drivers even before full autonomy, and this could be extremely profitable for Tesla because they basically have a cost advantage over Uber and Lyft. It's cheaper to operate and they can vertically integrate finance and insurance.So, we think that they can be a really - a competitor to watch out for and that's even before--BARTIROMO: Yes.KEENEY: --they reach full autonomy. So we're excited for that.BARTIROMO: Well, look, the company, Elon Musk also said that the company's latest gigafactory will be built in Austin, Texas, five minutes from the airport and 15 minutes from Downtown Austin. Dagan McDowell, clearly Wall Street sees a real growth story in Tesla. But he has not paid a full month's rent for some of these showrooms in four months. You look at these earnings, it would be a very different quarter if he paid his rent.MCDOWELL: It would be a couple of things. A lot of companies whose businesses were shut down; retailers negotiated on rent or didn't pay their rent. Remember back in April, Equinox which is owned by Related, the giant property company, said we're not paying our rent. So Related wants their tenants to pay rent, but that tenant gets a free pass.So this has really been across the board, but to your point in The Wall Street Journal, in the Heard on the Street column today points out that profits did not actually come from selling more automobiles.In the most recent quarter, revenue was actually down 4% and the $6 billion in revenue that Tesla reported included $428 million from a regulatory credit sale to help these manufacturers meet emissions mandates. So in the numbers, if you're thinking about jumping into this high flying stock, you've really got to break it down to what the road ahead looks like.But, Tesla does have firm ground to stand on in this way. My father and I both have purchased or leased new cars in the last six months, one from an American auto manufacturer, not a Tesla, and one from a foreign auto manufacturer and they both broke down. My dad's twice in six months. Mine broke down after 10 days of ownership. So reliability is key and if Tesla can deliver on that, he can--BARTIROMO: Wait a second.MCDOWELL: --eat business, eat business from these other auto manufacturers.BARTIROMO: Are you telling me your Beamer broke down?MCDOWELL: After 10 days, yes.BARTIROMO: Oh my goodness!MCDOWELL: I did lease a BMW and it broke down after 10 days. Actually - it was the compressor on the air conditioner broke in a 100-degree heat.BARTIROMO: Okay.MCDOWELL: So I drove eight hours back to New York City on Sunday with no air conditioning. Driving on the I-95-BARTIROMO: Unbelievable.MCDOWELL: --New Jersey Turnpike with no air conditioner.BARTIROMO: Not good.MCDOWELL: They're taking care of it they say, Maria Bartiromo.BARTIROMO: Not good. Tasha, final word here. The stock is up 280% year-to- date. You want to buy this stock right here? Even though he's not paying rent - half the rent for the last four months. He says he's going to pay up in August, but these landlords are getting ready to sue him, Tasha.KEENEY: Yes, I think this has never been a stock that was free of controversy. So I look forward to sort of seeing the story develop. But again, we think that there is still a lot of room for the stock, especially if they reach full autonomy. This is a huge business opportunity. And we think it's really overlooked by the market.BARTIROMO: Alright, we will leave it there. Tasha Keeney, good to see as always. Thanks so much. We'll keep watching. Tesla's stock is up as is the markets. Stay with us, we'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Tensions between the United States and China boiling over. Now, the FBI says that China is harboring a wanted criminal at its Consulate in San Francisco. The biology researcher at the University of California, Davis, accused of falsely of her denying connections to the Chinese military, to obtain a visa into the country.Meanwhile, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo doubling down and ordering China to close its Houston Consulate by tomorrow. This comes after workers there reportedly burned secret documents in the Consulate's courtyard yesterday.Joining me right now is the author of The Coming Collapse of China and The Great U.S.-China Tech War, Gordon Chang. And Gordon, it is wonderful to see you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us. Let's talk first about this most recent, this latest comment from Pompeo on the San Francisco Consulate. What are these Consulates? Fronts for something else?GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, THE COMING COLLAPSE OF CHINA: Well, they certainly are. There's a list of things that you can do in the Vienna Convention if you run a Consulate. Well, harboring fugitives from the FBI is not one of them. But there is a simple solution to this, Maria. The United States can say, turn over Ms. Tong within 24 hours or you have 72 hours to close the Consulate.And while we're talking about closing Consulates, let's talk about the Consulate in the city where you are, New York. There was a diplomat from the New York Consulate along with China's Ambassador to the United States who were caught in Connecticut trying to illicitly recruit a microbiologist to steal information for China. I don't understand why the Chinese Ambassador Cui Tiankai is still in this country and why we have this diplomat in New York still running free?BARTIROMO: This is unbelievable, Gordon. I mean these Consulates are - they are spy headquarters and this espionage program coming out of China, it seems to be bigger and bigger than anybody expected. It's not just cyber intrusions; it's also getting graduate students and identifying people to steal information. Where is this partnership between the U.S. and China going in your view?CHANG: Well, it is certainly becoming more tense. On this issue of intellectual property theft, we have talked to Chinese officials for about three decades about this. We had the agreement with Chinese leader Xi Jinping and President Obama, which was announced in the Rose Garden in September, 2015, not to hack for commercial purposes. Well, that didn't work either.And then we had the Section 301 tariffs that are meant to be a remedy for the theft of U.S. intellectual property. They haven't deterred the Chinese. So yes, let's close the Consulate in Houston, but maybe we should be closing other Consulates as well because although this is unfortunate, Maria, we're not driving this; the Chinese are.BARTIROMO: Yes. Let me show you - we want to show our audiences disturbing footage which you tweeted about. This footage over Northern China showing shackled Uyghur Muslims being blindfolded and then herded onto trains. Gordon, when you tweeted this out, I retweeted and I was really happy that you had found this video.I want to point out that this video was shot in 2018. So it's not a new video, but this was shot in 2018 and it was broadcast in 2019, but it clearly shows this group of individuals blindfolded and led and walking somewhere. These Uyghur Muslims are locked up in camps. Tell me about this and whether or not you think people understand what's going on in this part of China with these camps.CHANG: Yes, this footage is authentic. Some people think it actually came from the Chinese government, although that's unverified. But we know a couple of things. We know that somewhere between 1.3 to 3.2 million Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other Muslim majority - Muslim adherents are deterred in essentially concentration camps.We know that the Chinese government has run a program that meets the definition of genocide. That's forced birth control, forced sterilization, forced abortions. And in addition to all of that, Uyghurs and other Muslims are being transported around China to work in factories that suggest slavery. And unfortunately, there is about 83 Chinese and international brands that have taken advantage of this slave labor, including a company called Nike.BARTIROMO: Unbelievable. It's unbelievable to see these pictures and then hear global investors want to go and invest there and open up their operations there with no mention whatsoever of these horrible human rights abuses. Gordon, thanks very much for being on this story for as long as you have been and thanks for joining me. We'll see you soon, Gordon. Thank you.CHANG: Thanks Maria.BARTIROMO: Gordon Chang. Stay with us, we'll be right back.(COMMERICAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Cracking down on crime, President Trump yesterday extending his federal actions high crime cities, announcing he would be sending agents to Chicago despite push back from Mayor Lori Lightfoot. More agents will also be sent to Portland which saw another night of clashing between protesters and police. Here's the President yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: The effort to shut down policing in their own communities has led to a shocking explosion of shootings, killings, murders, and heinous creams of violence. This bloodshed must end, this bloodshed will end. We will use federal law enforcement to vigorously charge federal crimes and support these besieged communities to the greatest extent possible. We want the American dream for American children and I will fight to deliver that dream every ounce - every single ounce of my strength, I will be fighting.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Gianno Caldwell, this is an incredible situation here. The federal government has a responsibility to keep its citizens safe. If the Mayors won't do it, of course the President is going to get involved here. I mean, look at these cities across the country, what's your reaction?CALDWELL: Well, first and foremost, I welcome the President's help. As everyone know, I'm from Chicago and I just discussing this here on Fox News Special on Sunday. I encourage people to go to my Instagram @giannocaldwell to check out that clip.But the President said in 2017 if Chicago doesn't fix this carnage, I'll send the feds. He is keeping his commitment to the people of Chicago, because as mentioned previously, Mayor Lori Lightfoot has failed, Mayor Rahm Emanuel had failed, and there continues to be a systemic failure in the City of Chicago with these local elected officials and the violence.We've seen over the weekend over 50 people shot, I think it might have hit the 60 number. Fourth of July weekend, over 80 people shot. When does this end. One-year-olds are being killed in the City of Chicago and senior citizens are being killed in the City of Chicago.They're not involved in gangs and violence, and innocent bystanders are losing their lives. So Chicago has proven that they cannot handle it. Therefore, the federal government must step in. As the President of the United States, he has an obligation to protect the United States citizens. And I applaud the President for doing this, and I hope that we're going to see some real reforms come out of this.BARTIROMO: Well, the Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot spoke with the President and she says that the President, "Got the message" that federal agents did not belong in Chicago, Dagen, he got the message.MCDOWELL: The federal government and the Trump administration do not need an invitation, do not need permission from any local leader, if this involves enforcing federal law.And if you want to dig into the roots of crime in these cities, if you look at gang activity, for example, this is from Andy McCarthy, up to 80% of gang activity involves narcotics and every single narcotics offense is a federal crime. That's how you get a permit, and that's how you have some of these federal law enforcement officers going into these cities.Also, if anything is related to a racketeering enterprise or organization, also a federal crime. And you can actually charge murder as a federal crime, if it's under a racketeering enterprise. So, there is legal cover for the federal government to be in these cities.And I just want to point out that it is disgusting that these leaders get a pass for basically their wilful blindness to the suffering of their own residents. They get a pass to their basically hatred of their own residents simply because they don't like Trump. If they hate Trump, then they get a pass from all the progressives across this country, and I find that appalling.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's right.CALDWELL: It is.BARTIROMO: Have you been to San Francisco lately? Look at the homelessness on the streets, and the needles, and the drug needles and the disgust on the street of San Francisco. This is Nancy Pelosi's district.What has she done? What's going on? I'll be speaking with the former-(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: What's Andrew Cuomo done? What's Andrew Cuomo, what's Mayor Bill de Blasio done, when people we work with are getting attacked on the way to work every morning?And he's more worried about a mural in front of Trump Tower. These people are a disgrace.BARTIROMO: Absolutely right.CALDWELL: They failed.BARTIROMO: I'll be speaking with former NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly on this coming up in the next hour, all of this unrest hitting Portland, President Trump's plan to send federal officers into the cities. Commissioner Kelly will join me at 7:30 a.m. Eastern this morning. Back in a minute, stay with us.(COMMERICAL BREAK)MARIA BARTIROMO, ANCHOR, MORNINGS WITH MARIA: The Commissioner Ray Kelly on this coming up in the next hour. All of this unrest hitting Portland, President Trump's plan to send federal officers into the cities. Commissioner Kelly will join me 7:30 a.m. Eastern this morning, back in a minute, stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, good Thursday morning everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, July 23rd. Tack a look at markets right now, 6:33 a.m. on the East Coast. Futures are looking to extend yesterday's big rally. Dow Industrials right now up 108 points, that's about half of a percent, the Nasdaq is up 99 and the S&P futures up 13 points.Optimism over coronavirus vaccine, the stimulus plan, also better-than- expected earnings driving the action today and yesterday. The Dow Industrials up 165 points at the close yesterday. Those are two-thirds of 1 percent, the Nasdaq was up 25, the S&P up 18. Global markets this morning also with a firmer tone, European indices higher across the board, take a look, FTSE 100 up 33, CAC Quarante up 27 and the Dax Index higher by 86.In Asia overnight, markets were mixed, Japan is closed for a holiday as you see, but the others were pretty much fractionally moving. Three people are behind bars this morning, connected to the shooting deaths of three friends on a Florida fishing trip. Jackie DeAngelis now with the headlines. Hi, Jackie.JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS: Good morning to you, Maria, that's exactly right. Police in Polk County say that Tony Wiggins also known as TJ, his girlfriend, Mary Whitmore and his brother Robert Wiggins are all charged in connection to the triple murder. According to police, TJ Wiggins is a convicted felon with more than 200 charges under his belt. Police say TJ accused one of the victims, Keven Springfield of stealing has truck and selling the engine.Springfield along with Brandon Rollins and Damion Tilman, they were found dead last Friday. And Wells Fargo back in the spotlight after a new report says that some customers say the bank paused their mortgage payments without their permission. Borrowers in at least 14 states accuse the bank of putting them into forbearance plans, aimed at helping customers who can't pay their mortgage due to the pandemic. Now, the bank tells "NBC News" in a spirit of providing assistance, we may have misinterpreted customers intentions in a small number of cases, and will make any necessary corrections to their accounts.Take a look at shares of Wells Fargo in the pre-market up, almost half a percent. And here's a look at what's trending this morning on foxbusiness.com. Nike says that it's going to cut some jobs and shake up its leadership structure to focus on e-commerce. The CEO said the changes were meant to make the company more efficient and were not driven by financial difficulties during the pandemic.Viking Cruises announcing a 136-day, 27 country world cruise vacation, that will start next year. It includes overnight stays in 11 major cities and costs $50,000 per person. And Los Angeles Dodgers star Mookie Betts signs a 13-year contract with more than $380 million, making it the second richest deal in baseball history. Los Angeles star Mike Trout currently has the biggest MLB contract, Maria.BARTIROMO: Wow, big numbers there, Jackie --DEANGELIS: Yes --BARTIROMO: All right, thank you so much. Meanwhile, we want to zero in on the Russia probe and the origins of that Russia probe. Legal activist group Judicial Watch filing a freedom of information lawsuit this week against the Department of Justice, the FBI, and the DNI office. The group is requesting all records of the Oval Office meeting in January 2017, where the Steele dossier and General Michael Flynn will discuss the meeting reportedly include President Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, National Security adviser, Susan Rice and FBI Director Jim Comey.Joining me right now is Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton, and Tom, it is great to have you this morning, thank you so much for joining us. And we know that --TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT, JUDICIAL WATCH: Good morning --BARTIROMO: That meeting took place on January 5th of 2017. And even then, Tom, January 17, the president had been elected, he's about two weeks away from his inauguration, they still had nothing. No evidence in terms of any collusion with Russia which was the story they had been going with for two years prior.FITTON: Well, that's right, and the day before the meeting, the FBI had concluded there was no there, there with General Flynn, yet that was kept open that investigation. They talked about it on January 5th, they not only talk about Flynn withholding information potentially from the incoming Trump administration on National Security issues. But they also talked about that dossier.The next day, Comey goes to President-elect Trump, confronts him with the dossier, not because he was warning him about anything, but because he was investigating him and spying on him after that meeting with President Obama. Joe Biden it turns out, he was talking about the Logan Act and General Flynn completely out to lunch in terms of any legal basis to investigate the incoming national security adviser. And then we have new e- mails last week --BARTIROMO: Yes --FITTON: From Peter Strzok that show that as soon as Trump gets into the Oval Office, he's talking about using counterintelligence briefings that the FBI's giving presumably Trump top officials at the White House to investigate them. Not to educate them, which is what the purpose of the briefings are, but as a vehicle to spy on team Trump in the White House. These documents, by the way, the FBI has had, obviously, for years and are just turning them over to us this week with this month.BARTIROMO: Well, that's right, and Lindsey Graham made it public. I spoke with the senator about a month ago, and he told me this was coming and here's what he said one month ago. Watch Lindsey Graham.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: If they knew in January of 2017 that the dossier was garbage and the guy from Russia who brought them, the dossier to Christopher Steele also disavowed of the dossier, and yet they still used it to continue --SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): Right --BARTIROMO: Getting re-warrant -- re-opt warrant for Carter Page, then that was fraud --GRAHAM: Yes --BARTIROMO: And that you think that could mean jail time?GRAHAM: Horowitz tells us, he found a memo in the file where the Intel analyst who interviewed the sub-source said that sub-source denied the details in the dossier. That he didn't provide all this. If the case agent, Intel agent told higher ups that this whole case is fallen apart and they kept going forward, then they're in trouble with the law.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Tom, you know what gets me is that all of these documents were sitting there, and what, Mueller didn't see them? I mean, for the whole Mueller investigation, none of these documents were given to Mueller?FITTON: Well, that's right, and General Flynn was being prosecuted by Mueller, even though they knew that he wasn't involved with the Russians. Look, in early 2018, they made these big announcements about these indictments of Russia, they were saying that there was no evidence in these indictments that any American knowingly colluded with the Russians. It's been known and not only by Mueller but by the people supervising him, Rod Rosenstein because he gave the briefing on it to the press.That there was no evidence that there was anything here. Look, when Page and Strzok talk about going just before Mueller's appointed, they say in their text messages, it looks like there's no big there, there. What has Durham been doing for 15 months is what I want to know.BARTIROMO: Yes, me too. I mean, this seems to be a whole scam. You know, a scam on top of a scam. You know, they get Mueller to do what they were doing based on nothing, and now we've got these concerns over mail-in voting, that's the next way I think that some of these skeptics are going to try to cheat going into this election. Fox News is reporting that recent weeks of mail-in voting has seen issues of lost ballots, slow delivery.Just this week, a memo from the United States Postal Service to its employees detailed budget cuts that could slow down mail delivery even further. Last month on "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES", AG William Barr talked about the risks in mail-in voting. Listen to what he said. Got to get your reaction.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Well, there's a big discussion right now about mail-in voting. Hillary --WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL, UNITED STATES: Yes --BARTIROMO: Clinton said it's fine. It's fair.BARR: Well, it absolutely opens the floodgates to fraud. Those things are delivered into mail boxes, they can be taken out. There's questions about whether or not, and even denies a secret ballot because a lot of the states have you signing the outside of the envelope so the person who opens this envelope -- the person who knows the envelope will know how people voted. There's no right now a foreign country could print up tens of thousands of counterfeit ballots and be very hard for us to detect which was the right and which was the wrong ballot.So, I think -- it can -- it can upset and undercut the confidence in the integrity of our elections.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Tom, I know you testified last month to the House Judiciary Committee about this issue. Your reaction.FITTON: Barr is absolutely right and has been supported by bipartisan analysis of this. You had the Baker Carter Commission, which is James Baker; the Republican and the former president talk about why voter fraud is more likely to occur with mail-in ballots. Millions of extra names on the rolls, they're going to get ballots -- if you want your vote to count, you need to go in person. That's the best way to do it and vote at the polling place.BARTIROMO: You know, Tom, the American people should be outraged -- the president's critics hate him so much, whether it'd be the media or the Democrats, that they are willing to just blow off all of our laws, blow off our constitution, you know, and it just doesn't matter to them, and they refuse to work with him at all. So I don't know, it's just extraordinary.FITTON: Well, I think they're going to -- we're going to have chaos on election day, and more likely to have chaos on election day. We won't know who won in many races, potentially the presidency. And we could have fights that go into January of 2021 where it's decided finally in the house who the president is. This is serious. We've got millions of ballots that are being mailed in an experiment to put it charitably, that's never happened before in American history, and who knows what's going happen on election day as a result.BARTIROMO: Unbelievable. Tom, we'll be watching, thanks very much for all your great work on this. Your FOIA request have unearthed so much. Thank you. Tom Fitton joining us --FITTON: You're welcome --BARTIROMO: There from Judicial Watch. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Opening new doors for all investors. One private equity firm now partnering with the Dream Exchange to create the first-ever minority-owned stock exchange in the history of the country. Here now to talk to us about that is the founder of the Dream Exchange, Joe Cecala. Joe, it's great to have you, thanks very much for joining us.JOE CECALA, FOUNDER, DREAM EXCHANGE: Very nice to meet you, Maria, thank you, love your show.BARTIROMO: So explain the need for a minority-owned exchange -- we've got several stock exchanges. Are you going to have the amount of volume that you think could actually sustain here?CECALA: Well, there's a number of different answers to that. Yes, we're hoping to. The need for the exchange really is our design and our philosophy is to reach down in a small cap market, and really generate a lot of listings. At one time, our country had close to 10,000 public companies, we have about 3,500 today, and the hardest hit is the 50 million and under IPO market.At one time, 70 percent to 90 percent of all IPOs were 50 million and under. And now, we have two or three a year. And that's our research. So we're really going to be dedicating ourselves to a small cap marketplace and a diverse marketplace. We're really going to go after seeing a minority community be able to participate in the equity markets, and we hope they'll be volume.I think the -- I think that as a national market exchange, there'll be plenty of trading volume for us to go around.BARTIROMO: And what have you seen so far, what's the reception so far?CECALA: So, the reception is tremendous. I mean, we actually -- we've been working and dedicating ourselves to actually creating another trading tier through the Main Street Growth Act for the last five years. And very recently, we've had a lot of support for trying to get that law through Congress. And the reception from the business community is enormous. Our webinars and educational processes are already packed, we're probably a year to 18 months away from really getting through the application process.But this is very needed. You know, 10 years ago, the Treasury Department conducted an IPO taskforce, and in that, they found that 92 percent of all job creation happens after the IPO. And then our research has been showing that in the history of the New York Stock Exchange or in stock exchanges, 230 years, we've had exchanges, we've only had one black-owned company ever listed on the New York Stock Exchange. So the math isn't hard to do. This is about creating opportunity and economics, clearly, there's civil learners and all kinds of other problems in our society.But we're attacking one that we think we can control which is stimulating people being able to have equity, to have -- to have stimulus into their businesses without the taxpayers paying for it. So private markets can shift into public markets, and we can get it underserved part of the community, clearly, the diverse segment of our society is underserved. And we want to attack the economic problem as best we can and certainly won't make any things worse if we economically empower that part of our community.BARTIROMO: Yes, well, I love the idea of supporting these mid-cap companies, that's where the growth is. That's where the jobs are and you certainly want to do as much as possible for that segment. Joe, we'll be watching, great to have you, best wishes, thanks so much.CECALA: Great to be here, thanks, Maria.BARTIROMO: Joe Cecala joining us there, stay with us, we'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, time for the Morning Buzz. First up, tap into beer school, brewery tour company LA Beer Hop is hosting its first virtual school full of history lessons and beer tasting all from home. The company wanted to find a way to support beer suppliers but also remain safe. Mark, is this a class for you?MARK TEPPER, PRESIDENT, STRATEGIC WEALTH PARTNERS: I love it. I mean, who doesn't love a good beer? My go to is IPA, but you know, when you look at California in particular, restaurants are open for outdoor seating only. Bars are closed throughout most of the state, so this virtual school that helps the students brew their own beers, but it also supports the small breweries that are shut down.And if you think about it, coronas and white claws, those things are still flying off the shelves in grocery stores, but it's the small craft breweries which were all the rage a year ago that are being left out in the courts, so it's a good cause.BARTIROMO: Yes, next up, work remotely from paradise. Bermuda is offering a one year residential certificate for travelers to work from there. It costs $263. You can live on the island without seeking employment, and also help increase economic activity. Gianno, this sounds good, what do you think?GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I've already packed my bag and I got my swimming trunks here, I haven't worn them -- you can see the tags there.(LAUGHTER)You know, what's interesting -- what people don't know is I've been on every continent, but Antarctica. So, when I read this story, I was excited. Another interesting fact about Bermuda is it receives a half a million visitors per year, pre-COVID, of course. Most of those folks come from the United States of America. So it's exciting, because such a beautiful place and I will definitely be interested in checking it out.BARTIROMO: That's good.

China says it's not trying to replace US, won't be bulliedAssociated Press InternationalJuly 17, 2020 Friday 3:09 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWS; POLITICAL NEWSLength: 463 wordsDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) — China isn't seeking to confront or replace the United States as the world's top technological power, but will fight back against “malicious slander" and attacks from Washington, a foreign ministry spokesperson said Friday, responding to a litany of recent accusations from the Trump administration.Hua Chunying said China's chief concern is improving the livelihoods of its citizens and maintaining global peace and stability, despite what critics say is an increasingly aggressive foreign policy that looks to expand Chinese influence in the military, technology, economic and other spheres.“As an independent sovereign state, China has the right to safeguard its own sovereignty, security and development interests, to defend the achievements made by the Chinese people with hard work, to refuse any bullying and injustice against China, and to fight back against malicious slander and attacks by the U.S. against China," Hua said at a daily briefing.Her comments came in response to a speech Thursday by U.S. Attorney General William Barr in which he cautioned American business leaders against promoting policies favorable to Beijing. He asserted that China at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic had not only dominated the market for protective gear, exposing American dependence on Beijing, but had also hoarded supplies and blocked producers from exporting them to countries in need.Barr also accused hackers linked to the Chinese government of targeting American universities and businesses to steal research related to coronavirus vaccine development, leveling the allegation against Beijing hours after Western agencies made similar claims against Russia.“The People’s Republic of China is now engaged in an economic blitzkrieg — an aggressive, orchestrated, whole-of-government (indeed, whole-of-society) campaign to seize the commanding heights of the global economy and to surpass the United States as the world’s preeminent technological superpower,” Barr said.Numerous Trump allies have issued strongly worded messages over China in recent days, coming at a time when bilateral relations have fallen to their lowest point in decades over issues from accusations of technology theft to China's claims in the South China Sea.Hua dismissed Barr's accusations of cybertheft related to vaccine development as “absurd."“Because everyone knows that China is in a leading position in the research and development of new coronavirus vaccines, we have first-class scientific research personnel, and we do not need to gain a leading position with theft," Hua said.Chinese companies have moved swiftly to develop a coronavirus vaccine, as countries compete for the prestige and profits that would come with being the first to bring such a product to market.Load-Date: July 17, 2020End of Document

Taiwan's Risks or Opportunities? -- Understanding Mergers and Acquisitions in a Global Push by a Rising ChinaPR NewswireJune 12, 2020 Friday 8:38 AM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 678 wordsDateline: TAIPEI, Taiwan, June 12, 2020 BodyPR NewswireThese days, the motives, targets, locations, and sectors for business acquisitions are becoming increasingly diverse. More and more strategic assets are now available for acquisition, with the aim to strengthen global portfolios and competences, and they remain pivotal in today's competitive business practices. In fact, what used to be considered "fair game" under the rules of modern capitalism has given way to the so-called "predatory behavior" of recent years, with ever increasing signs that various global powers are now looking to gain every advantage, whenever possible.Ever since China unveiled its latest national plan, which was dubbed "Made in China 2025", it has been working to aggressively transform itself from a manufacturing nation into a world-leading manufacturing powerhouse. At the same time, China has also been trying to raise its innovation capabilities, with plans to build a world-leading technological and industrial system. It is clear that the Chinese government is pushing hard to expand that nation's production and innovation in various areas in order to drive job growth and achieve its long-term strategic goals.Taiwan and China have long shared close ties. However, Taiwan's advantages, which have been built on decades of technical expertise in various fields, especially in the information technology (IT) industry, are now being undermined due to the direct hiring of Taiwanese experts by China-based companies and even the outright purchases of Taiwanese companies and technology by companies outside of Taiwan.In early June, the Taiwan Technology Law Institute (TTLI) and the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) co-organized a seminar in Taipei that featured Yung-Chin Hsu, the Vice Chairman of the Financial Supervisory Commission; Arati Shroff, the Deputy Economic Chief at AIT; the legislator Chia-Yu Kao; representatives from the Institute for Information Industry; the National Security Council; National Chiao Tung University; and experts from the business, civil, and government sectors for a discussion on the "Capital Market and National Security—Screening and Approval of Foreign Investment."The seminar mainly addressed the growing security concerns over the foreign exploitation of certain investment structures and the possibility of the Taiwanese government's extra-regulatory scrutiny, specifically the Taiwanese version of FIRRMA—the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, which was a US bill that was introduced in 2018 to block Chinese acquisitions.Echoing the US-China trade experiences shared by AIT, the Taiwanese legislator Kao stated that in recent years in Taiwan, reports and warnings about possible bids by foreign suitors, especially Chinese entities, have put the spotlight on a variety of industries, ranging from semi-conductors, real estate, online shopping platforms, and electronics manufacturing, among others. It was also shared that even more high-level activity involving high-tech Taiwanese firms, including purchases by foreign buyers, will likely take place. Overall, the main concern expressed was that Taiwan's position as a keystone in various supply chains will be rapidly eroded. Of course, in an increasingly globalized economy, all direct foreign investment carries risks, so it is very important to evaluate the economic climate thoroughly. The presenters at the seminar also expressed the importance of strengthening on-the-ground information gathering and sharing; increasing information-sharing through intensified dialogue; and standardizing processes in the government sector. It was also advised that the Taiwanese government tread carefully and weigh both the advantages and disadvantages of any actions in order to determine the best road to take.Media contact:George Hu241520@email4pr.com0919563599 View original content to download multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/taiwans-risks-or-opportunities---understanding-mergers-and-acquisitions-in-a-global-push-by-a-rising-china-301074699.htmlSOURCE Taiwan Technology Law Institute (TTLI)Load-Date: June 12, 2020End of Document

US consulate in Chengdu officially shuts in retaliation for Houston closureCNN.comJuly 26, 2020 Sunday 11:47 AM ESTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: ASIALength: 822 wordsByline: By David Culver and Ben Westcott, CNNDateline: Chengdu, China BodyThe United States consulate in the Chinese city of Chengdu officially closed Monday morning, amid worsening relations between Beijing and Washington.The American flag over the building was lowered at dawn, according to Chinese state-run broadcaster CCTV, and onlookers were moved back by police surrounding the consulate as it prepared to shut.Beijing ordered the US embassy to close on Friday in a tit-for-tat move, after Washington instructed China's consulate in Houston, Texas, to cease operations, claiming it had been involved in a US-wide Chinese espionage effort.The Chinese government gave the Americans the same 72-hour time frame to close their Chengdu mission as Beijing had been given in Houston last week.As that deadline expired, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement Monday that the Chengdu consulate closed at 10 a.m. "Relevant Chinese authorities then entered from the main entrance and took over," the ministry said in a statement posted on Chinese social media platform Weibo.A State Department spokesperson confirmed to CNN that the consulate closed at 10 a.m. local time due to the Chinese government's "withdrawal of consent for operation." The spokesperson said diplomats and their family who were posted at the consulate will depart China by August 27."The consulate has stood at the center of our relations with the people in Western China, including Tibet, for 35 years," the spokesperson said. "We are disappointed by the Chinese Communist Party's decision and will strive to continue our outreach to the people in this important region through our other posts in China."Over the weekend, hundreds of people had gathered outside the US consulate in the city of 16.5 million people, taking selfies and waving Chinese flags.On Saturday, the US insignia was taken down, while on Sunday removal work began on a plaque outside the embassy and shipping containers were loaded onto trucks, as staff prepared for the consulate to be closed.Chengdu, the capital of China's southwest Sichuan province, was an important diplomatic outpost for the US, covering a large swath of the country, including the controversial Tibetan Autonomous region.A video posted to Twitter by the US Mission in China on Monday morning featured images of the Chengdu consulate being opened by then-Vice President George Bush in 1985, before listing the areas covered by the diplomatic mission, such as Tibet."Today, we bid farewell to the US Consulate General in Chengdu. We will miss you forever," the mission's official post said.Espionage allegationsLast Tuesday, Washington told China to "cease all operations and events" at its Houston consulate, claiming that the mission had been coordinating espionage at a Texas research institution.US officials told reporters Friday that staff at the Chinese consulate "were directly involved in communications with researchers and guided them on what information to collect."According to a senior State Department official, the idea to close the Houston consulate emerged this spring after China interfered when US officials returned to the consulate in Wuhan to retrieve diplomatic materials.The Chinese Foreign Ministry called the closure of the Houston consulate an "unprecedented escalation" of ongoing tensions between the two countries."The current situation between China and the United States is something China does not want to see, and the responsibility rests entirely with the United States," the Chinese foreign ministry said in the statement.As the deadline to close the Chinese diplomatic mission expired on Friday, US federal agents entered the compound of the Houston consulate in black SUVs and white vans.US-China tensions riseTensions between the US and China have been strained by the ongoing trade war, allegations over the coronavirus pandemic and US criticism of human rights abuses in both Hong Kong and Xinjiang, which Beijing denies.But in the past two weeks, relations have deteriorated even further, amid the reciprocal consulate closures and the guilty plea of a Singaporean national who admitted to spying for Beijing in the US.Experts have warned that the downsizing of diplomatic avenues available for engagement leaves both countries vulnerable to misunderstandings and a further escalation of tensions.Speaking at the Nixon Library in California on Thursday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blasted what he said were decades of failed policy toward China."As President Trump has made very clear, we need a strategy that protects the American economy and indeed our way of life. The free world must triumph over this new tyranny," Pompeo said."The truth is that our policies -- and those of other free nations -- resurrected China's failing economy, only to see Beijing bite the international hands that were feeding it. We opened our arms to Chinese citizens, only to see the Chinese Communist Party exploit our free and open society."Load-Date: July 27, 2020End of Document

U.S. closes consulate in Chengdu, China, after Houston orderPolitico.comJuly 24, 2020 Friday 9:00 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 539 wordsHighlight: A statement from the State Department said that the consulate suspended operations at 10 a.m. on Monday.BodyCHENGDU, China - The U.S. closed its consulate in the southwestern Chinese city of Chengdu on Monday, a victim of the rising tensions between the global powers.China ordered the mission closed late last week in retaliation for a U.S. order to shut down the Chinese Consulate in Houston earlier the same week.The tit-for-tat closings marked a significant escalation in the multiple disputes between the two countries over a range of issues, including trade, technology, security and human rights.A statement from the State Department said that the Chengdu consulate suspended operations at 10 a.m."The consulate has stood at the center of our relations with the people in Western China, including Tibet, for 35 years," the statement said. "We are disappointed by the Chinese Communist Party's decision and will strive to continue our outreach to the people in this important region through our other posts in China."The U.S. has four other consulates in China and an embassy in Beijing.The American flag was taken down at the Chengdu mission at 6:18 a.m., China's state broadcaster CCTV said on its social media account.Police closed off a two- to three-block area around the consulate, cutting off virtually any view of the property including the flag. A few vehicles were allowed through after police checks, and others could be seen moving in the distance.Moving trucks arrived at the U.S. consulate the previous day and left a few hours later. Late Sunday night, flatbed trailers entered the complex. One later emerged carrying a large shipping container and a crane.Before the area was closed, the impending closure of the consulate drew a steady stream of onlookers over the weekend as Chengdu, like Houston, found itself in the limelight of international politics.People stopped to take selfies and photos, jamming a sidewalk busy with shoppers and families with strollers on a sunny day in the city of Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province. A little boy posed with a small Chinese flag before plainclothes police shooed him away as foreign media cameras zoomed in.Police had shut the street and sidewalk in front of the consulate and set up metal barriers along the sidewalk on the other side of the tree-lined road.Uniformed and plainclothes officers kept watch on both sides of the barriers after scattered incidents following the Chengdu announcement on Friday, including a man who set off firecrackers and hecklers who cursed at foreign media shooting video and photos of the scene.A man who tired to unfurl a large placard late Sunday that he called an open letter to the Chinese government was quickly taken away.Earlier, a bus left the consulate grounds and what appeared to be embassy staff spoke with plainclothes police before retreating back behind the property's solid black gates. It wasn't clear who or what was on the bus.Three medium-size trucks arrived and left a few hours later, and cars with diplomatic plates departed in between.The U.S. alleged that the Houston consulate was a nest of Chinese spies who tried to steal data from facilities in Texas, including the Texas A&M medical system and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. China said the allegations were "malicious slander."Load-Date: July 27, 2020End of Document

"So let's be clear: Daines' new talking points are nothing more than a desperate attempt to save his political career.

Biden Says Russia and China Are Trying to Undermine U.S. ElectionsNewsweek.comJuly 18, 2020 Saturday 4:19 PM ESTCopyright © 2020 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 506 wordsByline: Jocelyn GrzeszczakHighlight: "The Russians are still engaged in trying to delegitimize our electoral process. Fact," Joe Biden said. "China and others are engaged as well in activities that are designed for us to lose confidence in the outcome."BodyPresumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said Russia and China are actively engaging in attempts to undermine U.S. elections, citing intelligence briefings.Biden made the remarks during a fundraiser event Friday night, telling approximately 200 attendees that he is now receiving intelligence briefings again."The Russians are still engaged in trying to delegitimize our electoral process. Fact," Biden said. "China and others are engaged as well in activities that are designed for us to lose confidence in the outcome."Biden did not provide details on what he had seen in the briefings, which are now provided to him by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI).The Washington Postreported last month that the U.S. government is briefing presidential campaigns and the national parties about such election threats as part of the government's effort to ensure November does not see a repeat of the 2016 election."The ODNI has been providing robust intelligence-based briefings on election security to the campaigns, political organizations and Hill leaders," an ODNI official wrote in an email to Newsweek. Biden said Friday that he is most concerned about foreign interference when it comes to voting access, particularly his campaign's efforts to fight Black voter suppression."Frankly, this is the thing that keeps me up most at night," Biden said. "Making sure everyone who wants to vote can vote. Making sure that the vote is counted, making sure we're all trusting in the integrity of the results of the election."Newsweek contacted the Biden campaign for comment, but did not hear back in time for publication.The former vice president's worries are not unfounded.Google announced in early June that Chinese and Iranian government hackers targeted Gmail accounts of staffers working on Biden's presidential campaign and President Donald Trump's reelection campaign, respectively.Foreign adversaries have sought to access U.S. presidential campaigns in every election for more than a decade. Perhaps the most notable of these acts occurred in 2016, when the Russians interfered in the presidential election.Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller's two-year investigation into the matter eventually confirmed that Russia had engaged in activities meant to damage Democratic presidential candidate Hilary Clinton's campaign and improve Trump's chances of winning the election.Earlier this month, FBI Director Christopher Wray appealed to the American people during a panel discussion about China, stating that the greatest long-term threat to information and economic vitality in the U.S. is the Chinese Communist Party.Wray had outlined several ways the Chinese government is currently engaging in counterintelligence and economic espionage efforts, adding that the FBI is now opening a new China-related counterintelligence case about every 10 hours.Update (07/18/20, 5:45 p.m. ET):This article has been updated to include a comment from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Link to ImageGraphic Joe BidenChip Somodevilla/GettyDemocratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden leaves after speaking at the Chase Center July 14, 2020 in Wilmington, Delaware.

Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou's arrest by Canadian authorities:"Last week's announcement that the Chinese government indicted Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor on charges of alleged espionage after a year and a half of arbitrary detention and confinement in inhumane conditions is deeply troubling. The Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) political persecution and arbitrary detainment of these two Canadian citizens, while Canada continues to uphold the rule of law in the case of Meng Wanzhou, only reinforces the international community's concerns about the CCP's complete disregard for individual rights and the fair and just application of the law.

TikTok leaves Hong Kong for the new national security law that China applied in the former colonyCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 7, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 956 wordsBodyTikTok raises camp. The short video platform warned on Tuesday that it will stop operations in Hong Kong,joining other social media companies. The reason: the national security law that came into effect last week.The planned output of the short format video application is also given on various social media platforms and messaging applications, including Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram, Google and Twitter, as the possibility of providing user data to Hong Kong authorities.Social media companies say they are evaluating the implications of security law,which prohibits what Beijing sees as secessionist, subversive or terrorist activities or as a foreign intervention in the city's internal affairs. In the communist-ruled mainland, foreign social media platforms are blocked by China's "Great Firewall."Critics see the law as Beijing's boldest step in erasing the legal divide between the former British colony and the authoritarian system of the Communist Party of mainland China.TikTok said in a statement that he had decided to stop operations "in light of recent events." The company did not comment on the size of its operations in Hong Kong or any other matter.Operated by Chinese internet giant Bytedance, TikTok has tried to distance itself from its Chinese roots while striving for global appeal. He recently hired former Walt Disney executive Kevin Mayer to be his CEO.The company has said that all of your data is stored on servers in the U.S. E insisted that it will not delete the content,even if the Chinese government asks. Still, TikTok has still been regarded as a national security risk, and U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said Monday that he was looking to ban certain social media apps, including TikTok.Facebook and its Messaging app WhatsApp said Monday in separate statements that would freeze the review of government requests for user data in Hong Kong, "pending further evaluation of the National Security Act, including formal human rights due diligence and consultations with international human rights experts."Hong Kong convulsed with massive, sometimes violent anti-government protests for much of the past year when residents of the former British colony reacted to the proposed extradition legislation, since its withdrawal, which could have led some suspects to trial in mainland Chinese courts.The new law penalizes some pro-democracy slogans such as the widely used "Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time," which the Hong Kong government says has separatist connotations.The fear is that it erodes the special freedoms of the semi-autonomous city, which has operated under a framework of "one country, two systems" since China took control in 1997. This agreement has allowed the freedoms of the Hong Kong people not allowed in mainland China, such as public dissent and unrestricted access to the internet.Telegram's platform has been widely used to spread pro-democracy messages and information about protests. He understands "the importance of protecting the right to privacy of our Hong Kong users," said Mike Ravdonikas, the company's spokesman."Telegram has never shared anyHong Kong authorities in the past and does not intend to process any requests for data related to its Hong Kong users until an international consensus is reached on the ongoing political changes in the city," he said.Twitter also stopped all requests for data and information from Hong Kong authorities after the security law took effect last week, the company said, emphasizing that it was "committed to protecting people who use our service and their freedom of expression.""Like many public interest organizations, civil society leaders and entities and industry peers, we have serious concerns about both the development process and the full intent of this law," the company said in a statement.Google also said it had "paused production on any new request for data from the Hong Kong authorities."Although social platforms have not yet been blocked in Hong Kong, users have begun to clean up their accounts and delete pro-democracy posts for fear of reprisals. That retreat has spread to the streets: many shops that publicly stood back with the protesters have removed the pro-democracy sticky notes and works of art that adorned its walls.Under the rules implementing Article 43 of the National Security Act, which give the city police force broad powers to enforce legislation, platforms, publishers, and internet service providers may be ordered to remove any electronic messages that "are likely to constitute a crime endangering national security or is likely to cause the occurrence of a crime that endangers national security."Service providers who fail to comply with such requests may face fines of up to Hong Kong$100,000 ($12,903) and receive prison sentences of up to six months.People who post such messages may also be asked to remove it, or face similar fines and a one-year prison sentence.Hong Kong authorities moved quickly to implement the law after it took effect on June 30, and police arrested some 370 people.The rules allow Hong Kong EXECUTIVE Director Carrie Lam to authorize police to intercept communications and conduct surveillance to "prevent and detect crimes that endanger national security."Police can search for evidence without a court order in "exceptional circumstances" and seek orders that require people suspected of violating national security law to hand over their travel documents, preventing them from leaving Hong Kong.Written notices or restraining orders may also be issued to freeze or confiscate property if there are "reasonable grounds" to suspect that the property is related to a crime that endangers national security.By Zen so, Associated PressLoad-Date: July 8, 2020End of Document

Rep. Newhouse Condemns Cyber Attacks by Chinese NationalsTargeted News ServiceJuly 22, 2020 Wednesday 7:10 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 685 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyRep. Dan Newhouse, R-Washington, issued the following news release:Rep. Newhouse (R-WA) released the following statement after the Department of Justice announced the indictment of two hackers, both nationals and residents of the People's Republic of China (China)."This attack is yet another example of the Chinese Communist Party deliberately targeting U.S. intelligence and technology," said Rep. Newhouse. "These malicious cyber attacks, discovered on Department of Energy computers at the Hanford Site in Central Washington, threaten the security of our nation, the private information of our citizens, businesses, and agencies; and our world-class scientific research and development."We must continue to take a strong stance against China's state-sponsored illegal activities and retain our status as global leaders who abide by and enforce the rule of law," Rep. Newhouse continued. "As a Member of the House Appropriations Subcommittees on Homeland Security and Energy & Water, I have pushed for increased funding for federal cybersecurity programs and will continue to ensure our nation's security agencies are equipped with the tools needed to combat China's aggressions. I applaud the FBI, the Department of Justice, and Eastern Washington U.S. Attorney Hyslop for acting to bring these cyber criminals to justice."The 11-count indictment alleges LI Xiayou and DONG Jiazhi, who were trained in computer applications technologies at the same Chinese university, conducted a hacking campaign lasting more than ten years to the present, targeting companies in countries with high technology industries, including the United States, Australia, Belgium, Germany, Japan, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Spain, South Korea, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.Targeted industries included, among others, high tech manufacturing; medical device, civil, and industrial engineering; business, educational, and gaming software; solar energy; pharmaceuticals; defense. In at least one instance, the hackers sought to extort cryptocurrency from a victim entity by threatening to release the victim's stolen source code on the Internet. More recently, the defendants probed for vulnerabilities in computer networks of companies developing COVID-19 vaccines, testing technology, and treatments."The cybercrime hacking occurring here was first discovered on computers of the Department of Energy's Hanford Site in Eastern Washington. As the grand jury charged, the computer systems of many businesses, individuals and agencies throughout the United States and worldwide have been hacked and compromised with a huge array of sensitive and valuable trade secrets, technologies, data, and personal information being stolen. The hackers operated from China both for their own gain and with the assistance and for the benefit of the Chinese government's Ministry of State Security. This prosecution is occurring as a result of the combined unwavering efforts of the National Security Division of the Department of Justice, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Washington, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. We seek justice for these victims and others affected and we intend to prosecute these defendants for their alleged crimes," said U.S. Attorney William D. Hyslop for the District Eastern District of Washington.Click here https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-working-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion to read the Department of Justice's announcement in full.Background:In March of 2019, Rep.

The Leader Who Killed Her CityAtlantic OnlineJune 18, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 5743 wordsByline: Timothy McLaughlinBodyUpdated at 5:10 p.m. ETThe sunny, humid Saturday should have been a day of cautious relaxation in Hong Kong. The city had not tallied a new case of COVID-19 in a week, and people were returning to markets, restaurants, and the popular hiking trails that traverse its sylvan hills.But by that afternoon, social-media posts and alerts on messaging apps began to spread, initially in frantic, disjointed bits, raising alarm-not about new coronavirus infections, but about the movements of the Hong Kong police. Officers, it would become clear, were making their way across the city, arresting prodemocracy figures.In a coordinated sweep that day, April 18, police rounded up 15 people, spanning generations and ideologies: Martin Lee, Hong Kong's octogenarian "godfather of democracy," was greeted by seven officers at his door; the media tycoon Jimmy Lai was walked from his home, his glasses slipping from the bridge of his nose onto his blue surgical mask; and Margaret Ng, a veteran lawyer, made her way into a police station clutching in her arms a copy of the book, China's National Security: Endangering Hong Kong's Rule of Law?The arrests, police later explained, stemmed from the individuals having taken part in unauthorized marches held in August and October 2019, at            the height of the territory's           prodemocracy           protests, a movement sparked by a bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. Months of enormous, and sometimes violent, demonstrations in Hong Kong laid bare the fear and despondency of an identity and way of life being forcibly pulled away, as well as the rage toward a government and its overlords in Beijing who were unwilling to listen or compromise. Along the way, as the relationship between residents and the police fractured, Hong Kong's population grew familiar with the choking sting that follows the explosion of tear-gas canisters, and the severity of bruising inflicted by rubber bullets.[           Read: Lessons for American police from Hong Kong]The pandemic put the protests on hold as the city battened down to wait out the virus. The territory, gleaning lessons from            the SARS outbreak more than a decade ago, contained the spread enviably as deaths mounted elsewhere across the globe. But unlike            other leaders, who saw their political fortunes rise on their deft handlings of the outbreak, Hong Kong's success did little to help its chief executive, Carrie Lam. Residents continued to seethe as pro-Beijing lawmakers and mainland officials blatantly disregarded norms and            expedited China's chokehold on the city while the world largely turned its attention to the public-health crisis. The flurry of activity came to a stunning culmination this May, when Beijing announced that it would circumvent the territory's legislature to force a            national-security law on Hong Kong. The law has not been fully detailed but will target acts of subversion, secession, terrorism, and foreign interference in the city. The move ended 23 years of resistance to such regulations, and proved hollow the "one country, two systems" framework under which the city is supposed to be run until 2047.Officials in Beijing nowadays speak of Hong Kong in terms normally reserved for Xinjiang and Tibet, describing it as a restive city whose traitorous foreign-backed residents seek independence, language parroted by Lam herself. (Lam has said that            she has no evidence of these hidden hands from abroad, while polling shows that only a            small but boisterous minority of people in Hong Kong favor independence.)Lam's hard-charging attempt to sideline her own people to please her bosses in Beijing has had the opposite effect. The extradition bill, legislation pushed by Lam herself, catastrophically backfired, to the extent that she and her staff now appear entirely cut out of the loop by mainland officials who have taken the reins of Hong Kong's most important policy-making decisions. Her administration has been            unable to answer even the most basic questions about the national-security law, desperately trying to reassure people that things will be fine despite the litany of            warning signs to the contrary. Lam, in recent days, has pivoted from the pleasantries, referring to those who oppose the law as            "enemies of the people."Along the way, she has emerged as the perfect tool for Beijing: a convenient shield for those actually in charge, and so despised by her people that most have entirely given up on her.Lam is already the most unpopular and calamitous leader in Hong Kong's modern history, her decisions and failures of governance having borne consequences that are global in reach. Though yet to fully come into focus, even a truncated list of the repercussions of her leadership is staggering for its breadth and the speed at which they have unfolded.The past year of protests, and some 9,000 arrests stemming from the demonstrations-while telling figures of street-level unrest-do not begin to capture the full fallout. Even before the pandemic struck, Hong Kong had            sunk           into a recession. The city's police force, once lionized in big-screen films, is now widely viewed as            a marauding band of occupying enforcers, free to act with impunity. The            United Nations-as well as rights groups, business associations, and the city's legal community-is calling for an inquiry into their actions, though it will likely never materialize. Hong Kong has slipped in the            global business rankings prized by Lam. In local elections last year, seen as a referendum on her handling of the protests, prodemocracy candidates made            historic gains, while the scales of Taiwan's election were also tipped in favor of the            Beijing-skeptic incumbent due to the deteriorating situation in Hong Kong. The United States no longer believes the city to be            highly autonomous from China, and Britain is            overhauling its immigration policies to accommodate Hong Kongers. Even            LeBron James and the NBA,            video-game developers, and e-sports stars have not escaped the cascading ramifications of Lam's mistakes.[           Read: The end of Hong Kong]Pundits long speculated that Hong Kong would meet its demise if the People's Liberation Army came out of its barracks, but that no longer seems necessary. History will perhaps judge Lam as the leader who killed her city without needing any tanks.Because she is not directly elected, Lam, who is 63, does not carry a popular mandate, instead serving as Beijing's conduit. Through her decades-long career in government, Lam has excelled at pleasing those above her, swiftly transitioning from a hardworking colonial subject during British rule to China's loyal apparatchik. (Lam's office declined to comment for this story.)This transformation has been so all-encompassing that someone who has been friendly with Lam for almost two decades and worked closely with her said they would struggle to describe Lam's thinking, mindset, or behavior today-she has become so wholly unrecognizable. From the symbolic shedding of her "Margaret Thatcher"like suits" in favor of traditional Chinese cheongsams after the British left in 1997, she has now styled herself after a "very mainland-Chinese bureaucrat," this person, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said."Carrie Lam embraces this very valueless mindset," they told me of Lam's ability to seemingly serve those in power without question, "which is actually a colonial legacy."Carrie Lam and her new cabinet are sworn in by Chinese President Xi Jinping during an inauguration ceremony in Hong Kong on July 1, 2017.  (Keith Tsuji / Getty)There is no doubt that Lam's own personality and character have been significant factors driving the widespread discontent in Hong Kong. Over the course of interviews with more than two dozen people who know and have worked with Lam-from her days as a university student through to today-a picture emerged of someone who is highly intelligent and extremely diligent.But these people, some of whom asked for anonymity to speak freely, also described Lam as overly demanding, fiercely headstrong, and at times belittling. She is prone to the belief that she knows better than anyone else, and has a penchant for abruptly cutting people off if she is unhappy with their ideas. One official who worked with her said she was more feared than liked by her staff, and was now unwilling to delegate and largely unable to inspire those around her. Lam is a relentless micromanager who pores over the minute details of events and involves herself in seemingly trivial issues that could be handled by subordinates, two others who worked with her said. Last year, for example, she deployed copious resources to study the city's public toilets, convening a late-April meeting in which numerous officials crammed into her office to discuss the issue. The absurdity then appeared to dawn on Lam. "Maybe we shouldn't let people know how many of us are sitting here to discuss public toilets," she remarked.Once seen as personable and approachable, if not highly affable, since being elected chief executive she has become more formal, stubborn, and stiff, repeatedly making reference to China as the motherland, according to one business official who has dealt with her. "It is not easy for people to work happily on her team," Jasper Tsang, a former president of the city's legislature and a founding member of the territory's largest pro-Beijing party who has worked with all four chief executives, told me. Allan Zeman, a property developer and Lam adviser, described her as both "decisive" and "closed-minded." He continued, "If she believes in something, it is hard to change her mind."Yet if Lam is uniquely ill-suited to dealing with the kind of unrest gripping Hong Kong, it is also true that the city's uncommon system of governance is responsible for producing leaders like her. While a British colony, Hong Kong was "not so much ruled as administered," with government officials acting as the "eternal ruling party," according to The Civil Service in Hong Kong: Continuity and Change, a book by academics at the City University of Hong Kong. Under this system, "political figures are largely absent, and the functions of statesmen or politicians have failed to develop," the authors write. Eager to hold on to this executive-led style of governance (and to avoid riling a skeptical public) after Hong Kong was handed over to China in 1997, Beijing kept much of that structure in place.At that time, there were expectations in Beijing that Hong Kongers would            embrace Chinese patriotism, paving the way to full integration with the mainland. Instead, more and more of them eschewed Chinese identity, with a distinct Hong Kong one instead taking root. Groups promoting the safeguarding of Hong Kong's cultural sites and Cantonese language moved from the fringes toward the political mainstream, though some of this rhetoric tipped into xenophobia aimed at mainlanders. When Chinese flags rearranged to resemble the swastika appeared on the streets of Hong Kong last year, it became painfully clear that the younger generation in particular despises the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Beijing, and its supporters, at the same time, painted Hong Kongers as whiny, spoiled children. Hong Kong, in the mainland's view, has failed to keep up with China's growth, its usefulness as an international gateway diminishing by the day.[           Read: Hong Kong's revolutionary anthem is a challenge to China]The position of the chief executive is laid out in Hong Kong's mini constitution, the Basic Law, and modeled roughly on the colonial governorship system, with some updates to adjust to the realities of Chinese sovereignty: The city's leaders, once picked by London and accountable only to Britain, are now to be chosen by the CCP, with a thin veneer of democratic responsibility to the people of Hong Kong. None of the city's chief executives were politicians, none had experience in political parties, and none won a direct election. Hong Kong "never trained politicians before 1997; I don't think that we actually train politicians now," Bernard Chan, a businessman who served as a pro-Beijing lawmaker and is now a member of Lam's cabinet, told me.Three men preceded Lam in the chief-executive office. The first was a shipping tycoon who presided over a failed attempt to pass national-security laws, which sparked enormous protests and forced him to            step down. Then came a bow-tie-sporting civil servant who groused privately in comments captured in a diplomatic cable released by            WikiLeaks over the difficulty of the job, saying he would "never be able to please everyone here or in Beijing," and whose time in office was marred by corruption allegations that ultimately            landed him in jail. Lam's immediate predecessor, with whom she had a fraught relationship, faced numerous instances of unrest during his time in office, most notably the Umbrella Movement, a youthful prodemocracy campaign, in 2014.A product of this system, Lam is, similarly, not a politician by trade, nor is she a natural one. "Carrie Lam was a bureaucrat," said Zeman, the developer. "They think narrow rather than deep, and that has been one of the problems here." This lack of political acumen and leadership has been laid bare over the past year as she disappeared from public view for days on end, struggled to explain the extradition bill to foreign governments and businesses, and bounced from one poorly devised strategy to the next, before digging in and standing unwaveringly behind the police as they attempted to arrest away a problem that is at its core political. When the coronavirus outbreak hit the city, she was shaking hands at the World Economic Forum in Davos on a charm offensive, while conspiratorially            accusing foreign countries represented there of interfering to stoke anti-government hatred back in Hong Kong.This tension helps explain Lam's failings, but also points to a simple fact: There is no savior on the horizon, no replacement who can undo what has been done. Lam's flaws are a product of an inchoate system in which a city that has been promised autonomy is presided over by a repressive state; in which lawmakers and activists are beholden to a bureaucrat; and in which that bureaucrat is not accountable to her people, but to a faraway capital.The most pressing question for the Chinese government when it comes to the chief executive, according to James Tien, an honorary chairperson of the pro-establishment Liberal Party, is a simple one. "In crucial moments," he told me, "between Beijing and Hong Kong, which side do you stand on?" Lam has left little doubt as to how she would answer that question.Prodemocracy protesters march on a street as they take part in a demonstration on December 8, 2019 in Hong Kong. (Anthony Kwan / Getty)Three years after Mao Zedong's death, the University of Hong Kong students' union organized a trip to mainland China. The atmosphere was tense, and the job of building out the visit was a difficult one: how to balance the expectations of students, eager to see what life in cloistered China looked like post-Mao, with the restrictions imposed by Beijing, skeptical of the visitors' intentions. "You ask this, they say no; you ask that, they say no," Lee Wing-tat, then an HKU student leader, recalled. "I remember the pressure was so high."Lee ultimately tapped Cheng Yuet-ngor to juggle the various interests and demands. Cheng, an industrious student studying for a sociology degree, was widely respected on campus for her work promoting social-welfare causes. Cheng's role was taxing, liaising with representatives of China's Xinhua news agency, Beijing's de facto diplomatic mission in Hong Kong. Ultimately, the visit was a success-Lee remembers thinking that the actual head of the students' union operated as a "nominal president," shaking hands and attending lunches, because Cheng had done all the hard work.Cheng graduated the following year and soon joined Hong Kong's civil service. Over the course of a 40-year career, she held around            20 different roles and was sent to study at Cambridge University in England and work in the United States on a Fulbright fellowship, all of which culminated in            2017 with the ultimate promotion. She would be Hong Kong's fourth chief executive, and the first woman to get the job. By then, Cheng had            married a soft-spoken mathematician, had two sons, and was known by a new name: Carrie Lam.The years preceding Lam's elevation had seen turmoil roil Hong Kong repeatedly, from the outbreak of SARS to the fallout from the global financial crisis and the rise of the Umbrella Movement. Hong Kong's hyper-capitalist economic system produced staggering wealth for some, but property prices skyrocketed and wages remained largely stagnant. The rich lived in some of the            world's priciest homes, while others nearby languished            in apartments the size of coffins. China's growing power in relation to Hong Kong was deeply unsettling to residents, and worries over the clamping down on long-held freedoms were growing. In her            acceptance speech, Lam acknowledged a "serious divisiveness" in Hong Kong. The city had "accumulated a lot of frustration," she said. Her priority would be "to heal the divide and to ease the frustration--and to unite our society to move forward."[           Read: A glimpse of the coronavirus's possible legacy]It was an ambitious goal: All of Lam's predecessors had struggled to competently fill the role of chief executive, a position that requires overseeing one of the world's top trading economies while balancing Beijing's orders with the wants of Hong Kong's 7.4 million residents, two bodies that have grown progressively divergent in their views. "When interests and aspirations on both sides differ, it is very difficult for the chief executive to strike the right balance," Jasper Tsang told me.Lam was initially viewed favorably. Her technical skills were no doubt impressive, and many people were ready to move on from her abrasive predecessor. Lam's time abroad and fluency in the minutiae of Hong Kong's economy impressed the international business community, a significant power center. In the wake of the 2014 protests, activism subsided, and she focused her campaign on policies over politics. Her            popularity rating stood at nearly 64 percent shortly after she took office.Yet politics was never far off. After Lam took office, prodemocracy legislators were            disqualified from their elected positions, an obscure localist group advocating for independence was            deemed illegal-a first since 1997-and a foreign journalist was            expelled from the city. In early 2019, at Beijing's behest, lawmakers tried to push a law promoting the broadcast of China's national anthem. Then, last spring, Lam moved to pass a bill allowing extraditions to the mainland-triggering fears over an erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy. The decision, which Lam has insisted was hers alone, was the first in a series of enormous political miscalculations.The bill initially set off            peaceful mass protests during the spring and into early summer, with more than a million people taking to the streets. But Lam stood her ground, flippantly dismissing the voices of concern. Worsening            police violence against protesters, and the growing belief that Beijing was playing a greater role in the city's politics, hardened opinion against the legislation. By the time Lam            finally pulled the proposal in early September, supporters had largely abandoned her and demonstrators had collated their grievances into five core demands, including an inquiry into police violence and-more troublesome for Beijing-renewed calls for universal suffrage.A protester attempts to cover the Hong Kong emblem with a British colonial flag at the government headquarters in Hong Kong on July 1, 2019, on the anniversary of the city's handover from Britain to China. (Anthony Wallace / AFP / Getty)A recurring theme in my interviews was Lam's stubbornness and drive, characteristics that helped her rise to the position of chief executive and then helped ensure her failure once in the job. As a student at an elite Hong Kong Catholic girls' school, she had a seemingly endless appetite for work and has carried this through her career, often subsisting on only a few hours of sleep after toiling into the early hours. This work ethic has helped her rise from a modest upbringing in a city where members of tycoon families are typically preordained for the upper echelons of power. She is "painstakingly hardworking," said Judith Mackay, a doctor and longtime Hong Kong resident who has known Lam for years. (Two people, who asked not to be named, told me that Lam, a devout Catholic, can have a dry, even cutting, sense of humor, and she showed flashes of this early in her term.)That relentlessness became clear to the broader public from the 1990s, when Lam found a home in Hong Kong's treasury department. "I am not that good at mathematics, but I am not afraid of numbers," she told the South China Morning Post in an            interview that described her as having "long dazzled officials and journalists with her skill in handling figures." During Lam's nearly seven years there, she was part of a team that helped chart the economy's path after the handover, and pulled together an economic rescue package to respond to the 1997 Asian financial crisis. In an interview more than two years later, she recalled the exact date it was unveiled.Lam's reputation as an affectless bookkeeper was amplified when she transferred to the social-welfare department: She spoke openly about how she found the sector too emotional, and complained of the inability of social workers and NGOs to take blunt criticism, describing them as needing "to be pampered and cared for." She later said, on leaving the department, that it was impossible to "solve problems with emotions alone."Still, it is around this time that you can find some instances of Lam displaying a measure of political know-how. As SARS spread in Hong Kong, Lam decried the lack of urgency with which resources were being distributed and teamed up with three others to set up a collection drive. The            We Care Education Fund eventually pulled in millions of dollars in donations for children whose parents died of the disease and continues to pay out expenses. Lam visited orphaned children in the hospital and later recounted the sadness she felt as they told her about seeing their parents for the last time, softening her image.Then, in July 2007, Lam made her way to Queen's Pier, a historic harbor site occupied by protesters            hoping to stave off its demolition. Dressed in a pale-pink Polo shirt, Lam, by then the secretary for development, sat for hours delivering the government's message to the demonstrators. "She successfully made a very strong contrast by visiting the site and talking to ordinary citizens and protesters. It was something new to Hong Kong public life," Eddie Chu Hoi-dick, then a 29-year-old activist leading the protests, told me. The decision to demolish the pier was all but certain, so the content of the debate was not that interesting, said Chu, now a prodemocracy lawmaker. Rather, it was the gesture itself that made Lam's appearance noteworthy. Chu added, "It was the only time that she was so close to the people." Another activist, Katty Law, told me a similar story, of frequently exchanging emails with Lam past midnight but ultimately finding that she bristled at criticism and was "rather defensive." Those interactions were illustrative of Lam-endlessly hardworking, but arrogant and hardheaded.[           Read: Hong Kong's perfect crisis]As the 2017 chief-executive elections drew closer, Lam, then the city's second-highest-ranking official, told confidants that she had no interest in the top job. She had headed            failed efforts to reform Hong Kong's election process by putting into place a blueprint that would have allowed a direct vote for the chief executive, but with only prescreened, pro-Beijing candidates running. Instead of continuing in politics, Lam wanted to retire and spend her time between Hong Kong and Britain, perhaps even get involved in social-welfare projects, according to a person whom she spoke with about her plans, who asked not to be named discussing private conversations. But when Beijing            abandoned her predecessor-by then, Chinese leader Xi Jinping had been in power for several years, and the mainland was taking a harder line towards Hong Kong-she pulled an abrupt about-face.Her public persona at that point was set: diligent, stubborn, and admonishing. (In a televised debate with student prodemocracy leaders from the Umbrella Movement, she chastised them: "I hope you have the courage and wisdom to think of a way out of the current situation.") But on the campaign trail, she also proved to be prone to embarrassing gaffes. In one photo op, Lam donated money to an elderly woman            beggar later revealed to have been brought from the mainland against her will; she fumbled when attempting to use a            subway pass; and she said she struggled to find where to purchase            toilet paper when she moved out of government housing.She was nonetheless Beijing's early favorite and would remain so, a fact of which she was acutely aware. She was blunt when she met with a group to discuss health-care policy prior to the election, telling those gathered to speak with her that while she was interested in hearing what they had to say, they should remember that she didn't need their votes, a person familiar with the meeting told me. Hong Kong's chief executive is elected by a small group stacked with Beijing loyalists. In the end, Lam took 777 of 1,186 ballots cast. The Cantonese word for seven sounds similar to slang for penis, and Lam's vote total quickly led to            obscene puns-an inauspicious start to her tenure.People walk past a big screen replaying Lam announcing the formal withdrawal of the controversial extradition bill on September 4, 2019, meeting one of protesters' five demands after 13 weeks of demonstrations which became the biggest political crisis since Britain handed its onetime colony back to China. (Chris McGrath / Getty)In an alternate universe, Lam might have been remembered as a competent, if not inspiring, leader whose deference to Beijing marked a continuation of her predecessors' positions. Activism dipped in the early period of her term, and the chances of another Umbrella Movement"level protest seemed unlikely. But again, one of her defining characteristics-stubbornness-came through: Lam insisted on pushing the extradition bill, ensuring that her legacy would be one defined by the crisis that decision caused.At seemingly every moment since then, Lam has badly misread public sentiment and ignored or missed opportunities to de-escalate the situation. Over the spring, as opposition grew, she became frustrated and was determined "to ram this through no matter what," said one business official who met with Lam to discuss the legislation. The government struggled behind closed doors to convincingly explain the proposal to business leaders and diplomats. Members of numerous chambers of commerce gathered in mid-May in a cavernous meeting room in the government's offices. There, Lam, who was joined by other top officials, laid out her case, speaking for around an hour. She spoke emotionally of a young woman whose murder in Taiwan she said had gone unpunished because of a lack of such legislation, but she also took aim at foreign business groups voicing opposition to the bill, which she felt was an overstep, and she grew "very terse and angry" during the meeting, according to the business official.[           Read: Is this Taiwan's moment?]A telling moment of the government's blindness, or willful ignorance, came when Lam was questioned by Jack Lange, a lawyer and former chair of the American Chamber of Commerce, over whether it would really be possible for Hong Kong to negotiate extraditions with Beijing like it does with other countries. Teresa Cheng, the justice secretary, quickly leapt to Lam's defense, responding that it absolutely would be possible, despite Hong Kong's relationship with-and dependence on-Beijing. The response brought disbelief. "We are all sitting here thinking, what are you talking about?" an official who attended the meeting told me. Cheng's response, this official continued, "defied reality." Lange declined to comment on the meeting.After a million people took to the streets on June 9 of last year, many calling for her to resign, Lam            bizarrely thanked demonstrators but said the government would carry on with the legislation. Three days after the march, protesters stormed a road near the Legislative Council to keep the extradition bill from being read. Officers fired some 150 rounds of tear gas, stunning many and            shifting ire toward the police. Later that month, Lam summoned a group of younger staffers to Government House, a white mansion built in 1855 that serves as the residence of the official overseeing the city. She was uncharacteristically open and dismayed with the situation according to two people familiar with the meeting, talking about how the size of the protests had taken her by surprise and even saddened her."Carrie herself admitted to me in private that she couldn't cope with the political crisis," Jasper Tsang told me.           * "She said there are no politicians in the government." Lam dismissed a            July report that she had attempted to resign but was blocked from doing so by Beijing, but in an August recording            leaked to Reuters, Lam told a gathering of business leaders that she did want to quit. Lau Siu-kai, vice chairman of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, a semi-official advisory body set up by Beijing, told me he believed Lam would serve her full term. "Any concession  is a sign of weakness," he said.A string of mistakes, miscalculations, and public-relations disasters followed. Lam disappeared from public view for days on end, only to reappear at            Peoples' Liberation Army youth summer camps. As fury grew at the police, she visited officers and top brass to lend them support. On the streets, Lam was the target of disdain, derided as Beijing's puppet who had sold out Hong Kong. Posters plastered around the city showed her delivering a weeping television interview while            holding a pistol just out of the frame. Demonstrators carried signs of Lam's face overlaid with a sickle and hammer.In late September, after finally withdrawing the bill, Lam made an attempt at public outreach. As preparation for the            town hall"style event got under way, officials raised concerns that attendees would curse at Lam or even toss water bottles or their shoes at her, a person familiar with the planning told me. The event went ahead, with Lam enduring a stream of criticism while protesters gathered outside. She stayed inside the venue for hours before finally leaving under heavy police guard.The same month, Lam asked people at a closed-door listening session if they believed that a ban on wearing masks would hurt Hong Kong's rule of law. Nearly all of them raised their hands saying it would, a person with direct knowledge of the meeting told me. Lam still took the drastic step of invoking a            colonial-era emergency ordinance to implement a ban shortly afterward, which she argued would help curb violent protest. Lam dispatched her number two, Matthew Cheung, to explain the decision to diplomats. Pressed on why the government circumvented the normal lawmaking process, Cheung explained the Legislative Council building was            vandalized by protesters and it was impossible to hold a meeting elsewhere because building owners couldn't get insurance.[           Read: How Hong Kong did it]Though she did eventually kill the extradition bill, Lam has never fully pulled her backing for it, instead claiming that the bill was needed to plug a "legal loophole" and was only undone by a bad communications strategy. That argument-of poor messaging, misunderstandings, and legal loopholes-are a few of several familiar lines Lam has fallen back on in recent weeks, after Beijing announced that it would implement national-security laws in Hong Kong. Much of Lam's blame has also been directed at what she terms the            misdirected youth; to that end, she signed the            national anthem bill into law this month, and her government has            signaled school curriculums will need to be more Beijing-friendly. Both are efforts to instill what the government views as the appropriate type of patriotism, and force love of a motherland that many see as an oppressor.Many pro-Beijing figures and analysts I spoke with said mainland officials were keen on having Hong Kong's own national security laws in place and that Lam's extradition bill had initially looked to derail that effort. But now, with the protests offering convenient if unconvincing cover, Lam has finally, albeit inadvertently, delivered. She has said that the laws will only affect a "small minority" of people who commit the most serious of offenses. But Regina Ip, a pro-Beijing lawmaker and member of Lam's cabinet, told me that simply having the laws on the books would provide a "deterrent effect" to protesters, and that the fears of journalists and activists over the curtailing of freedoms were not "completely misguided."Asked in 2017 what her own            litmus test for her time in office would be, Lam replied, "I want Hong Kong people to be happy and possess hope." Ever the overachiever, fetishizing ranks and standings, Lam has failed by her own benchmark.Additional reporting by Rachel Cheung.

The country reporting growth after contracting nearly 7 percent in the previous quarter from China this morning. Nonetheless, the Shanghai Composite down this morning 4.5 percent. Sharp decline. They are the worst of the Asian markets overnight.Now, some of the top stories that we are watching this morning. Coronavirus deaths now topping 137,000 in the United States, as cases near 3.5 million, the most of any country. The CDC reported nearly 61,000 new cases just yesterday in the United States. That's nearly half of those coming from Florida, Arizona and Texas. All three states raising concerns over the lack of ICU beds as hospitalizations now are on the rise once again.Starting today, mask mandates are in effect in Alabama and in Montana. In Alabama, face coverings must be worn in public and when not social distancing. In Montana, masks are required in certain indoor spaces and for outdoor activities as well. But in Georgia, the Governor is banning cities and counties from requiring face coverings.Meanwhile, more retailers requiring shoppers to wear masks in their stores as well.

Pompeo adding China will be the Trump administration's national security priority if Trump is reelected.American Airlines warning up to 25,000 workers could be furloughed this upcoming fall, as coronavirus cases spike across the country. The move could affect nearly 30 percent of America's frontline employees. U.S. Airlines received $25 billion from the government in exchange for keeping workers on the job until the money runs out on October 1st.Travel demand is not expected to return to its 2019 highs for years. Take a look at shares of American Airlines this morning in the premarket. We are looking at a decline of four-and-two-thirds percent, this morning, on AMR.Massive Twitter hack, meanwhile. The social media platform hit with a wave of attacks on high-profile accounts. The hackers posted tweets asking users to donate money to cryptocurrency accounts. Joe Biden, President Obama, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, all among those targeted.Twitter released a statement saying this. "We detected what we believe to be a coordinated social engineering attack by people who successfully targeted some of our employees with access to internal systems and tools. Once we became aware of the incident, we immediately locked down the affected accounts and removed tweets posted by the attackers."The news sending Twitter shares lower in the premarket. We've got a decline right now of about 7 percent on Twitter.Joining me right now is the Cyber Guy, Kurt Knutsson. Also joining the conversation all morning is Strategic Wealth Partners President and CEO, Mark Tepper; Fox News Contributor and Columnist for The Hill, Liz Peek; and Chairman for The American Conservative Union, Matt Schlapp.Great to see everybody this morning. Thank you so much for being here.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (inaudible) Maria.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Good morning.BARTIROMO: Kurt, let me kick it off with you. How did a hack of this scale happen? What's your take? Should users be concerned about their own accounts?KURT KNUTSSON, THE CYBER GUY: Welcome back, Maria. Yes.BARTIROMO: Thank you.KNUTSSON: It is something to worry about. At this particular attack, if you look back in time, not long ago, was Jack Dorsey, Twitter CEO's account that got hacked into. And that was through a security hole in Twitter. They had patched that one up, not thinking it's related to this particular attack.What's happening right now in Twitter is a massive, massive violation of their own security. Somebody got the keys to Twitter and their administrative controls internally, the kind that the employees would use to control your account. And they went and changed. This is how it worked. They went into your profile, they changed who the person is that's in charge of your account as well as the e-mail. And at that point, they went ahead and started posting as you. This is a very, very intelligent coordinated attack. How they got into Twitter isn't clear yet. They're working on that.What we do know is that the most common way that your account can get hacked is through a phishing scheme, where you clicked something, it looked legit. It's not. You didn't know you got it. Now they get the keys to your computer to get into your account.The one thing you can do with that is you would normally notice what's called a new log-in alert that comes by text or by e-mail to you. You get a look at it, and you say, that wasn't me who logged on. You go and make sure that your account is still in good shape. And then if you enabled two- factor authentication, it's going to require you to get a text or authenticate it in another way if you're making any changes to your account. And that way, you're going to have much better control of your account.In this particular case, though, this is something that Jack Dorsey has a lot more explaining to do, not only to the market but also to consumers. Imagine, Maria, what would happen if all of a sudden, the President's Twitter account got taken over and he's talking about crazy, crazy, beyond crazy things in terms of what could jeopardize our national security by a hacker.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, that's the thing. I mean, the way that they did it to actually get into the system and change the person who is actually in control of your account, that means any of us are vulnerable.KNUTSSON: Absolutely there. This did happen, by the way, to really influencers, people who have large followings, accounts like yours that are verified, you reach a lot of people. These hackers were sophisticated. They knew what they were doing. I'm really curious about this investigation.I want to know who might have been involved inside of Twitter, not saying somebody was, but this is a highly unusual thing to happen to as large a social media concern as Twitter to actually lose the keys to your entire company for a moment.BARTIROMO: Well, what are the odds that this was a phishing expedition going toward Election Day. I mean, could these kinds of attacks become more common around the election? How vulnerable are Twitter users in that regard?KNUTSSON: Well, it certainly could influence a lot of decisions and minds, as social media does. Imagine this. Instead of pushing people to a fraudulent cryptocurrency scheme, which by the way the FBI is also investigating, they're also - imagine if they were pushing it to false information that could jeopardize a wave, start a wave of re-tweeting and re-reporting in other platforms and cause minds to reshape, as it did in previous elections.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's exactly right. All right. Kurt, we'll be watching. Really big story. Kurt Knutsson, thank you so much for that.And we are also looking at our panel to jump in here. What's your take on this, Liz Peek.LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR & COLUMNIST FOR THE HILL: Well, I think a lot of people who have been embarrassed by things they've said on Twitter in the past have claimed to have been hacked. I guess the question is, how novel is this? Hasn't it been the case always that we're vulnerable on Twitter?What strikes me about this is it was a money-making scheme, which is pretty weird. I mean, no one is going to really - none of the people in that list that you mentioned, Maria, are going to fall for such a blatant scam, I don't think. So it almost seems like a publicity stunt from someone who is maybe trying to undermine Twitter.BARTIROMO: Yes. But Matt Schlapp, we are right about 100 days away from the election. I'm looking at this as potentially sort of a warning sign or a phishing expedition to see what can be done around the election.MATT SCHLAPP, THE AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION CHAIRMAN: Yes. When I think of Twitter, you know what I think of, Maria? I think of realdonaldjtrump. I think of his Twitter handle and what he has done to revolutionize the way in which a politician talks to voters.And you know what Donald Trump did last night? He made a big campaign announcement on another platform. So what this really means for Twitter is that if people gravitate to Parlor, which is much more accepting of conservatives, and if really big accounts start to go to other platforms, guess what's going to happen to Twitter? It's going to dwindle. So this is actually an existential question for @jack.BARTIROMO: Yes. This is a really good point that he made the announcement on Parlor. And you're seeing Parlor get more activity. We'll see if it actually makes a dent in terms of market share.Real quick, Mark Tepper, on the economics of all of this. Twitter stock is down right now, almost 7 percent. And I also want to get your take on China reporting growth in the quarter. It's not moving markets, but apparently, the country is saying that they are actually seeing growth in the second quarter.MARK TEPPER, STRATEGIC WEALTH PARTNERS PRESIDENT & CEO: Well, when it comes to China, I really don't know what I should believe that that actually comes from them. I don't know if the--(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Exactly.TEPPER: --or not. No one really knows how they calculate it. China is not very transparent. And if you look at what's going on in the U.S. versus China, all this COVID talk is front and center in the U.S., it's scaring people, it's roiled the markets a bit. In China, no one is really talking about it. And I'm not saying it doesn't exist there. It might be just as bad or worse in China, but they're not talking about it over there. They're very secretive.As for Twitter--BARTIROMO: Right.TEPPER: --I would be buying this thing on a pullback. I think engagement is going to stay high. I do think Parlor is a potential competitive threat. But I'd be buying Twitter on a pullback here.BARTIROMO: All right. We will keep watching that.We're just getting started this morning. Coming up, Undersecretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy and the Environment, Keith Krach, is here on the United States confronting Chinese telecom giant Huawei, the very latest coming up out of China.And then Connecticut State Treasurer Shawn Wooden is here on the tax exodus out of Connecticut and other states. We will get into it.Plus, at 7:00 a.m. this morning, Johnson & Johnson's Chief Financial Officer, Joe Wolk, will join us on the company's quarter expected later this hour. Delta CEO Ed Bastian is here on the airlines' second quarter numbers as well and what is the state of travel today.In the 8:00 a.m. hour, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise will discuss the coronavirus reopenings and Joe Biden's plan. And Allianz Chief Economic Adviser Mohamed El-Erian will react to weekly jobless claims and retail sales.If you are worried about drinking too much wine, well, don't worry. A new study says a second glass could not hurt, but everything in moderation. You don't want to miss that. That's coming up as well. Stay with us right here.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Joe Biden pulling ahead in the latest polls once again, showing a majority of voters backing the Former Vice President. Biden is leading President Trump by 11 points in the Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. He's leading by 15 points in the latest Quinnipiac poll. The President only netting a 36 percent approval rating in that poll. President Trump demoting his Campaign Manager, Brad Parscale, yesterday, opting for GOP veteran, Bill Stepien.Joining us right now is Former California Congressman and current candidate for California's 50th District, Darrell Issa.Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thanks so much for being here.DARRELL ISSA, (R) FORMER CALIFORNIA CONGRESSMAN & CANDIDATE FOR CALIFORNIA'S 50TH DISTRICT: Well, thanks for having me on. And as you say, there's been a legitimate shake-up in the President's team, and a lot of it is based on the mistake that was made in Tulsa because, remember, before Tulsa, it was pretty easy to understand. One man was going out to talk to America presidentially, the other man was hiding in the basement.That's still true, and that's part of the message that I think the American people are going to see and hear going forward. One man in the basement reading in teleprompter, the other person leading the nation.BARTIROMO: Yes. I don't understand these polls, then. I mean, you don't see Joe Biden out and about. You don't really see - I mean, he did obviously release an economic plan the other day, but it's loaded with tax increases and spending on--ISSA: Yes.BARTIROMO: --on the green climate plan, and yet he's leading in these polls. What do you make of these polls? Are you buying it?ISSA: I'm not buying it. And I'm not buying it for a good reason. If you want to say, are you unhappy with the current environment, with the pandemic that is being handled differently in every state, in every city, of course, you are. It's one of the sad things. The President is limited in his authority. He can't simply preempt all the states and all the cities as much as he'd like to.But at the same time, if you ask people, who is trying to get my children back into school, who is, in fact, opening up the economy, who has a plan that's going to return us to prosperity, they're going to, without a doubt, if they're honest, be 100 percent, that's President Trump.BARTIROMO: What's the state of play in California? I mean, the number of coronavirus cases in California rising with more than 11,000 new cases on Tuesday alone. Hospitalizations currently on the rise. Governor Newsom re- closing businesses statewide. And now, many are looking to Congress for further stimulus. What's your take on this? A proposal is expected in the next few weeks, Darrell. But do you think we are going to see a fourth stimulus before Congress leaves again on August 8th?ISSA: Well, I'm afraid we might. I'm afraid that we might try to use printing money instead of addressing the virus in the appropriate way. Initially, some of the financial stimulus made sense, but let's be honest. Other than getting a vaccine, the fact is we're going to have to live through it.And the original intent, which Governor Newsom has seemingly periodically forgotten, which was to make sure that our healthcare system didn't get overtaxed, but at the same time, recognize that this, like the flu, like the measles, like the chickenpox, is a virus inevitably we will all get. We are only slowing the rate. And those who believe that we should stop it have missed the point. That's not going to happen. And we may never have a virus - like the flu, we may never have a virus vaccine that totally eliminates it.So, California needs to get back to the original message. Governor periodically does understand that it's about staying within limits, not simply trying to make everyone stay home. And I've had to fight the Governor at time over unconstitutional activities.BARTIROMO: Darrell, real quick. A leading super PAC working to elect Joe Biden is launching a multi-million dollar initiative to boost vote by mail ballots. Your expectation for mail-in votings this upcoming election. Real quick, Darrell. We've got to jump.ISSA: Unless we clean the rolls, a lot of dead people will be voting. And unfortunately, there's a tendency for the dead to vote democratically. It's just the Democrats seem to have an advantage with those who have passed on.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: OK. Tongue-in-cheek, but I think this is a serious issue and I think you do as well. Darrell, it is good to see you this morning. Thanks so much.ISSA: It is - it is a serious issue. And seriously, voter fraud is a challenge when you expand dramatically without cleaning the rolls properly.BARTIROMO: All right. We'll be watching. Darrell Issa.We'll be right back. Stay with us.Thanks, Darrell.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. No mask, no entry. Walmart, Kroger, Kohl's, and Sam's Club joining the growing list of companies requiring customers to cover their faces as coronavirus cases spike across the country. The National Retail Federation is now pushing for a nationwide mask policy saying this. "Shopping in a store is a privilege, not a right. If a customer refuses to adhere to store policies, they are putting employees and other customers at undue risk."Mark Tepper, what's your take on this? Masks could soon become a real policy across the country.TEPPER: Yes. And unfortunately - yes, I'm not a big fan, but I think they're here to stay for a while. Ohio just jumped on board yesterday. I'm not sure Governor DeWine mandated it, but he definitely held a press conference in the evening to ask every single Ohioan to start wearing them.Now, I was just in Newport Beach for a few weeks for a family vacation, and they were already doing it everywhere, even outside. Restaurants were only outdoor seating. I think the issue here is, I think people may be willing to do this for a finite period of time, but if this becomes an indefinite mandate where there's no end in sight, people will eventually revolt. Nobody wants to do this forever. People want to live their lives.BARTIROMO: Yes. Alabama is the latest state to require it. They're requiring facial coverings. Meanwhile, in Georgia, Governor Brian Kemp is prohibiting towns across the state for mandating masks to be worn in the public, Liz, because you're getting so much pushback, saying that is impacting my rights.PEEK: I think it's ridiculous, Maria, that this has become a political issue. And I would just say to all the Trump supporters out there, this could be the most important thing you can do to reelect the President. Because people are scared of this surge in cases we've seen around the country, there is no proof that you or me wearing a mask on the sidewalk is going to make much of a difference. But the truth is, it could make a difference. And so why not do it?If you're on a ranch and you've got 30 acres, there's nobody around, fine. I get that. You don't have to wear a mask. But otherwise, for heaven's sakes, people, let's be sensible. Let's try and stop the spread of this thing, so the economy can reopen and that fewer people get sick and die. This just seems elementary to me.BARTIROMO: Yes. It's unbelievable. I mean, everything has changed.We will take a break. When we come back, clamping down on Huawei. The Trump administration tightening the hold on the Chinese telecom giant. We've got the very latest coming up.And then, fleeing high-taxed states. I'll be speaking with the Connecticut State Treasurer on how his state is handling the exodus.You're watching Mornings with Maria live on Fox Business.MARIA BARTIROMO, ANCHOR, MORNINGS WITH MARIA: Welcome back, good Thursday morning everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, July 16th. Markets this morning at 6:30 a.m. Eastern under some selling pressure. Take a look at futures indicating a decline at the start of trading this morning.

The Dow at 4 O'clock on Wall Street, yesterday was up 227 points. The Nasdaq was up 61 and the S&P was up 29.European markets this morning are lower along with Wall Street, we are standing by for the European Central Bank decision in the next hour, we are expected -- rates expected to stay unchanged. New data from the U.K. meanwhile shows nearly half a million workers were furloughed in the month of May, that was in response to the pandemic shutdown.The FTSE 100 this morning is down 43, the CAC Quarante is down 42 and the Dax Index in Germany is lower by 84. In Asia overnight, red across the board there as well, despite the Chinese government releasing data which shows that the country did show growth in the second quarter and expanded 3.2 percent after contracting nearly 7 percent in the previous quarter. Of course, there's always questions about the data coming out of China. Shanghai Composite was down 4.5 percent overnight.And as you see there, worst performer in Asia. Body-cam footage leading up to George Floyd's death has now been released. Cheryl Casone with those details right now. Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS: That's right, Maria. However, the judge is only allowing it to be viewed by appointment only. The footage taken from the cameras of former officers Thomas Lane and J. Keung, and they show Floyd yelling, I can't breathe more than 20 times as former officer Derek Chauvin pressed his knee into Floyd's neck. And this comes as Floyd's family has filed a lawsuit against the city of Minneapolis and the police department. Lawsuit alleges that the department trains its officers and quote, "warrior training" and encourages the use of deadly force in non- deadly circumstances.Well, we're paying for the retail sector from the COVID-19 pandemic. J.C. Penney will cut 1,000 jobs and close 152 stores as it works to exit bankruptcy protection. Layoffs are going to affect corporate-filled management and international positions. And an apartment of justice lawyer monitoring Neiman Marcus' bankruptcy, says the company must prove that up to $10 million in executive bonuses boosted the company's earnings. Under U.S. bankruptcy law, the lawyers have so-called paid stay bonuses, it cannot be used as incentive to keep Neiman Marcus' CEO and other top executives from leaving.And finally, here's a look at what is trending this morning on foxbusiness.com. Hyundai recalling more than 272,000 cars in the United States because the electrical socket in the dash board can overheat and cause fire. Chase Elliot bypassed Kyle Busch to land his first NASCAR All- Star race victory and the million-dollar prize at Bristol Motor Speedway. And 157 acre private island off the Irish coast recently sold for the equivalent of more than 6.2 million, it's got 7 homes, 3 sandy beaches and a few farming pastures, Maria. And those are your headlines from here. We are waiting on earnings from J&J, Bank of America, we'll bring them to you as soon as they come in. Back to you.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Cheryl. Meanwhile, tough talk on China once again. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in an interview yesterday with "The Hill" said that China will pay a price for covering up the COVID-19 pandemic. This comes on the same day as the U.S. announced visa restrictions on Huawei, another Chinese technology companies. Joining me right now is State Department Undersecretary for Economic Growth, Energy and the Environment, Keith Krach.And Keith, it is great to have you this morning, thanks so much for joining us. The State Department obviously putting out more warnings there. Assess the situation for us, give us the biggest national security issues around China?KEITH KRACH, UNDERSECRETARY, STATE DEPARTMENT: Well, I think there's a multiple of issues around, Maria -- and by the way, thanks again for having me back on your show. I think what you've seen recently is the human rights atrocities in Xinjiang, you've seen that there's debt transparency all over the world, you know, and I think the citizens are waking up to China's 3- prong strategy of concealment, corruption and coercion. The pandemic is a result of the concealment of the virus, citizens of the world are realizing that the supply chains are entangled in the economy, these corrupted.And then also, you look at China's so-called face-mask diplomacy which is coercion and seduction to get countries to do what they want them to do. And then throw on top of that, what's gone on in Hong Kong where the freedoms and autonomies have just been eviscerated, and Gestapo-likes national --BARTIROMO: Yes --KRACH: Security forces are coming in and taking everything away. They've really stepped up their aggression.BARTIROMO: Yes, Keith, the Trump administration is now contemplating a possible travel ban for members of the Chinese Communist Party and their families. The plan would also limit travel to the United States for executives at state-owned enterprises and members of the People's Liberation Army. How likely is this ban -- we know what has taken place in terms of the Uyghurs being locked up, a million of them at the overreach in Hong Kong. The administration wants to go after specific individuals behind these things.KRACH: Maria, I don't want to get ahead of the president on this issue. But I can tell you that we're holding China accountable. They've attacked in Hong Kong, freedoms of the press, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, rule of law, they've attacked human rights in Xinjiang. So we've made the comment, we'll use all tools available. And United States --BARTIROMO: Yes --KRACH: Has taken the strongest action of any country to protect those human rights and those freedoms, and you would think that CCP would somewhat be apologetic for what they've done with the virus --BARTIROMO: Yes --KRACH: And it should have never happened, and I think this is a big issue and we're dealing with that, and we're seeing countries in the world joining us.BARTIROMO: Let me ask you, Keith, do companies today understand the national security risk? I mean, the Chinese President Xi Jinping has written a letter to major international CEOs, and he's talking directly to the CEOs, urging them to be part of China's economic expansion. In the letters to members of the Global CEO Council, Xi Jinping writes this, "you've made the correct choice of putting down your business roots in China to seek development."Meanwhile, you've got pension funds and university endowments invested in Chinese companies through various emerging market indexes, some of these companies are already on the sanction list. They are -- they are already being sanctioned for things like, you know, working with the Uyghurs and tracking the Uyghurs, hide vision using that video camera to do that or building equipment for the -- for the Chinese military. What's your take on communicating to American CEOs who what AG Barr said to me a couple of weeks ago was they're interested in a short-term profit of selling their widgets to 1.4 billion people versus the long-term issues of national security.KRACH: By the way, I also think that CEOs and businesses around the world are also waking up. You know, when I hosted Secretary Pompeo out in Silicon Valley for four days in January, one of the things he said is, you know, I said guys, look, we always said corporate responsibility, social responsibility, but it's also national security, and I think they understand that China's aggression is really an urgent threat to freedom all over the world.But it's also real and urgent threat for their businesses because they just don't want to compete, they want to put them out of business, and they ask -- and they're all free traders. But they also understand when somebody doesn't play by the rules, the market is no longer free. And you know, as you know --BARTIROMO: Yes --KRACH: I sent a letter to all CEOs and boards across America based on what's going on in Xinjiang. And what I said is that, look, it's incumbent on the board to put together governance principles that deals with these human rights. And it's also incumbent that you analyze your supply chains, put the financial institutions -- I think it's also incumbent to take a look at those Chinese companies that you're invested in. You know, let's face it, the average bond holder in the United States has financed the Belt and Road Initiative, the surveillance state, and I think it's -- these boards and the CEOs' moral responsibility and fiduciary duty either to divest but at a very minimum to disclose. And --BARTIROMO: Yes --KRACH: You know, you see what's going on in the stock market, and this is a huge risk to American investors, you saw Luckin Coffee, it also disadvantages American businesses and, you know, it's going to road our goal standards over financial markets.BARTIROMO: Well, it's interesting because many of those companies that you're referring to, some of them trade on the New York Exchanges like, you know, Alibaba, et cetera, but those companies are not required to follow the U.S. accounting rules. So, you know, that's -- people didn't understand the story in Luckin Coffee. So the president has proposed that the thrift fund not invest in things like the MSCI index which is home to many of these companies in that index or even the railroad workers, a 401K plan.Do you think he will be able to stop that money from going into those indexes? Real quick, Keith.KRACH: Well, and by the way, I think educating everybody, I think at the end of the day, the power is in the citizens because they can speak with their pocketbook and, you know, the Chinese companies don't have to do surveys, Ozie(ph) is a guy who took 3 companies public, you know, that's not fair, but that's my personal problem. But the danger is to those --BARTIROMO: Right --KRACH: Investors. And I think -- I think you're going to see some movements in terms of university endowments. I think pension funds because they're at risk, and they are financing --BARTIROMO: OK --KRACH: The surveillance state.BARTIROMO: Yes, for sure. All right, Keith, great to have you this morning. Thanks very much, come back soon.KRACH: Thanks --BARTIROMO: Keith Krach joining us there from the State Department, good to see you, sir, as always. We have more breaking news, more second quarter earnings hitting the tape. Cheryl Casone with those numbers now, Cheryl.CASONE: We're getting Johnson & Johnson right now, we're still waiting on Bank of America. We have a beat on the earnings per share, the expectation, 27 cents, the company came in at $1.67 -- excuse me, the estimate was for a $1.49. That is on the earnings per share, the revenue story, a little bit of a miss here, 18.3 billion, we were looking for 22.0 -- we were looking for 17.61 billion, it is a beat for J&J, we're coming in at 18.3 billion. So, again, we're looking at those numbers right now. We're waiting on Bank of America, a couple of things they're raising their full-year guidance for the year.They're also saying that their sales and earnings per share guidance is going to be raised. They're giving us a range. Operational sales slightly down, but overall, really strong numbers coming in on J&J. They're focused on advancing a vaccine which is key for investors right now to address the pandemic. And, again, they are giving us a few more headlines, and they're giving us again more guidance.Sales declined a little bit on the operational side, but overall, worldwide sales for medical devices and for their products, Maria, were strong. Again, a double-beat for J&J as you can see on your screen, and we're waiting on Bank of America, I'll send it back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, J&J shares are up about half a percent, of course, J&J has been rising on its efforts toward a vaccine, another major milestone for that company. We're going to speak with the CFO of J&J coming up. Coming up, fleeing high taxes, I'll be talking with the Connecticut State Treasurer on how his state is dealing with an exodus of people because of that tax-rate level.And then have that glass or wine or ice cold beer. The medical study shedding light on the potential health benefits of drinking in moderation - - yes, you're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, breaking news on Bank of America earnings right now. Cheryl Casone with the numbers, Cheryl.CASONE: Double beat, Maria, here we go. The estimate earnings per share, 27 cents, they came in at 37 cents, so a healthy beat on the earnings per share. As you can see, the stock is slightly up, revenue a slight beat as well. The revenue estimate 22.01 billion, they came in at 22.3 billion. They are setting aside $5.1 billion for potential credit losses, so this is a company that's talking about that 5.1 billion as a provision in case there are credit losses and there's a 4 billion -- within that, there's a $4 billion reserve bill.And this is some of the things that we saw the banks tell us in the last quarter, we're seeing that once again as well. Looking for some trading revenue data which I don't quite see yet, but I will tell you that loan and lease balances in a lot of their business segments rising 96 billion, that's about 11 percent, that's not too bad. Also, they have right now -- they ended the quarter, record deposits, Maria, $1.7 trillion.But they're talking about the reserve bill, they're talking about COVID-19 and the pandemic and the economy and saying basically, this reserve is because of a weaker economic outlook related to COVID-19, BOFA right now, Maria, unchanged. Back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, yes, all of the banks have been setting aside increased money just in case you see a loan default later on, we will be watching that. The stock was positive initially when Cheryl started talking, it is now down 3 quarters of a percent. All right, tax money moves, Americans increasingly leaving high-taxed states like New York and Connecticut for greener pastures with lower tax burdens like Texas, Florida and Nevada. But what about the states they're leaving behind and how are they handling this exodus?Joining me right now is the Connecticut State Treasurer, Shawn Wooden. And Treasurer Wooden, it is great to have you this morning. Thanks very much for being here. Connecticut has had --SHAWN WOODEN, STATE TREASURER, CONNECTICUT: It's great to be with you --BARTIROMO: Its own fair share of budget problems even before this pandemic. Can you give us the state of affairs right now in terms of Connecticut and what you're seeing with money leaving the state and what that means for the budget?WOODEN: Yes, so Connecticut, we have a beautiful state with lots of great things to offer. The tax discussion has been a longstanding one and a necessary one in our state. With that said, we have some of the highest- quality schools and communities. We have a highly trained and developed workforce. There are lots of reasons to be in Connecticut, and there are lots of things that our resources go to fund that aid and a higher quality of life. Some of the places you mentioned, I assure you, Connecticut residents are not fleeing to Florida right now.For example, in fact, as you may have reported on, there's an influx of people relocating to Connecticut as we speak, that's in part driven by the state's strong management around COVID-19, and the fact that we are one of two states that have seen a steady decline in the number of COVID-19 cases. And so that type of sound management, following public health officials and the science towards our reopening are very strong indicators, and show what a great state we have.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's a great point that you make because people are leaving New York City for the suburbs, and that has actually helped Connecticut. And do you think that's going to be a long-standing situation? Will people leave one state and stay in Connecticut because of these worries over COVID?WOODEN: I think so. When you see home purchases that gives you an indication that it's longer than renting a house for a month, and that maybe the shift will be more long-lasting, and I think we'll see a lot of shifts out of this pandemic in terms of the way business is conducted, the way people live, yes. I think it's longer term.BARTIROMO: Shawn, you wrote a great op-ed, we want to have you back to talk about that. Talking about corporate America doing the right thing, please come back soon, we so appreciate your time this morning, Shawn, thank you. Shawn --WOODEN: I'd love to come --BARTIROMO: Wooden joining us. And we will be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, time for the Morning Buzz. First up, a new treat for your feet. Zappos allowing customers to buy either a single shoe or a pair in two different sizes. It hopes to help amputees or people with different size feet, Nike, New Balance and Converse all participating here. Matt, what do you think?MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, THE AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION: You know, as I get old and my body starts to change including my feet, Maria, I actually know people who play tennis with two different size shoes, so I'm all for it. Let freedom reign.BARTIROMO: All right, you're in. Next up, bring your girls, "The Golden Girls" house selling on the market for $3 million, the show was set in Miami, remember, the home is actually in Brentwood, California. Liz, it's up for sale, your reaction.LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR & COLUMNIST FOR THE HILL: Yes, $3 million is sort of a nostalgia mess, I guess, Maria, but don't get too sentimental because this isn't really the house that was filmed year-after-year during "The Golden Girls" run, and that was actually reincarnation of this house, it was built absolutely, perfectly to scale in Florida when they actually did produce a show. But this is sort of a nice parking back to a simpler and gentler time.BARTIROMO: Yes, it sure is. All right, how about this one? Google wants to tattoo you. The technology giant working on temporary tattoos which will turn your body into a virtual touch pad. Users can poke, squeeze and prod the so-called skin marks to control different smart objects, Mark, what do you think?MARK TEPPER, PRESIDENT & CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, STRATEGIC WEALTH PARTNERS: I've seen all these movies, and I think Tom Cruise stars in all of them. You know, "Minority Report" where he's flipping through everything. Look, I think it's just the way for Google to get more data on how people interact and what their tendencies are -- I don't watch big -- I don't want big brother watching there --(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: There you go, all right, yes, you're probably right. We'll be right back, stay with us.Load-Date: July 16, 2020End of Document

UK belies Donald Trump over its influence in Huawei case and China says they have let the property 'scam'CE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 15, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 530 wordsBodyThe consequences of yesterday's decision by the United Kingdom to exclude Huawei from its 5G network are taking its course and today, at a three-way statement between Washington, London and Beijing, the debate on the real motives that have led to the veto on technology has been reopened. "I did it myself, I have the highest share of responsibility. If they want to do business with us they can't use their technology," the president of the United States said this morning. The Chinese government, for its part, has accused the British of letting themselves be "scamming" by the Americans, while sending a new threat: "A price will have to be paid."Meanwhile, from the UK, where Trump's words have been very bad, as it makes them seem malleable to the Republican's opinion, they justify the decision based on technical and non-diplomatic criteria. "We all know what it's like (Trump), don't we? But in this case we are talking about a rather sensitive issue," British Health Minister Matt Hancock replied irritatedly. "Many people will try to appropriate this decision, but the truth is that it was based on the technical advice of the National Cybersecurity Center, which aims to ensure that we have the highest possible quality of 5G in the future."Still, the Chinese understand this British shift from Huawei, which in January had been guaranteed 35% of the network, as a rapprochement towards Washington, a first step toward an end to equidity and alignment with the United States in the current trade war. "Beijing will take the necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate interests of Chinese companies. The UK made a wrong decision that seriously undermines the interests of our companies,as well as mutual trust between Beijing and London," they said from their Foreign Office.Meanwhile, the Chinese ambassador to the British capital, Liu Xiaoming, has directly pointed to the US president's influence in this decision. "Listening to all the rhetoric about it, it is clear that the UK has succumbed to the hawks and opponents who are against China," the diplomat criticizes. "We're not asking you to take sides in China or the United States, what we do is ask them to choose the right decision. The UK can only be big when it has an independent foreign policy."According to yesterday's announcement, the purchase of Huawei components for the 5G network from next year will be prohibited from all telecommunications companies, and any device that is already installed must be replaced within a maximum period of seven years. The company, which continues to insist on its independence and is not linked to the Government of the Asian country, is a leader in its sector worldwide, and points to the inability of American companies to compete with them as one of the reasons for this campaign.The problem for the British is that China has already announced that there will be "consequences" within its own market. "This is a test of where the country is going to steer its market from the time it consumes Brexit, and we'll see if British companies in China are given an open, fair and discrimination-free ecosystem," says Zhao Lijian, spokesman for Chinese Foreign Minister.Load-Date: July 16, 2020End of Document

How the Trump administration could  ban  TikTokiCrowdNewswire (English)July 10, 2020 Friday 7:06 PM GMTCopyright 2020 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1240 wordsBodyIllustration by Alex Castro / The Verge The Trump administration is apparently considering a ban on Chinese social media apps, including the popular video app TikTok.

Continue reading How the Trump administration could  ban  TikTokIllustration      by Alex Castro / The VergeThe Trump administration is apparently considering a ban on Chinese social media apps, including the popular video app TikTok. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo mentioned the possibility on      Tuesday, saying it was  something we re looking at  in a Fox News interview with Laura Ingraham.Pompeo offered few specifics, and the comment could easily have been bluster. But he also compared TikTok to Huawei and ZTE, two companies that have suffered very real consequences after      drawing US government ire. With tension rising between the US and China, Trump trying to ban TikTok isn t out of the question   and while it s not nearly as simple as Pompeo and Ingraham make      it sound, it could still cause trouble for the company and its users.The most intense app bans happen at the network level, blocking any communication between the targeted servers and users in the country. That s the approach taken by China s Great Firewall, and      it s how India enforces its recently implemented TikTok ban. (Australia, which is considering a similar ban, would likely take the same approach.) But American law doesn t have any precedent      for blocking software in that way, so it seems unlikely that the White House would be able to follow through on that kind of heavy-handed network censorship.TikTok doesn t have the same vulnerabilities as Huawei or ZTEPompeo compared the administration s TikTok plans to its crackdown on Huawei and ZTE, which included locking them out of government contracts. It s true that TikTok has been banned from many      government employees  work phones, including members of the US military, and some lawmakers are pushing for an even broader restriction. But Huawei and ZTE sold components to telecom operators      who, in turn, worked with government agencies. TikTok is a consumer app, so that s a much less serious punishment.  Huawei and ZTE are used by enterprises,  says Samm Sacks, a senior fellow at      Yale Law School s Paul Tsai China Center.  TikTok is used by so many people in the US. A more likely target is the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which oversees mergers and investments involving non-US companies. CFIUS opened a national security      investigation into TikTok last year, citing similar concerns to Pompeo, and there s enough evidence against the company to build a plausible case.TikTok is a subsidiary of Beijing-based company ByteDance, and critics have raised several issues around both its overall privacy practices and its potential ties to the Chinese government.      Leaked moderation guidelines discouraged criticism of events like the Tiananmen Square protests. Although TikTok says it stores American user data in the US, there s a persistent concern that      it could pass information to Chinese state agencies. (TikTok has repeatedly denied that it shares information this way, and it says the moderation guidelines are no longer used.)  The Chinese      government has a history of gaining control over nodes in the information system,  Freedom House analyst Sarah Cook told The Verge in an interview last year.If CFIUS decides Chinese ownership is a problem, the council could cause a lot of trouble for TikTok. In recent years, CFIUS has rejected some high-profile merger and acquisition plans        including a Chinese company s purchase of gay hookup app Grindr, which it nixed on national security grounds. The council could make TikTok restructure in a way that further separates its US      presence from its Chinese one, or even make ByteDance sell off Musical.ly, the American app it acquired to help cement its presence in the US. It s still not precisely a  ban,  though   and it      certainly doesn t generalize to all Chinese social media apps.Even if the government can t ban TikTok, it could try to deplatform itTo really take TikTok off Americans  phones, the government would have to do something like make Apple and Google sever their ties with ByteDance (along with any other Chinese app makers).      Getting removed from the iOS App Store and Google Play Store would vastly reduce TikTok s appeal, even if you could still access it through a sideloaded app or website. Apple, in particular,      keeps tight control over iOS devices; its App Store policy is so restrictive that it s spurred antitrust lawsuits. The government would essentially be ordering companies to deplatform TikTok        and deplatforming can be extremely powerful.To do this, the Trump administration could repeat a tactic it used with Huawei: have the Commerce Department put TikTok on the  entity list  that limits its commercial ties to US companies. The      administration doesn t need congressional approval to do this, and it can cite any US company that does business with them (barring special exemptions) for violating sanctions. The entity list      has stopped Google from working with Huawei on Android phones, and if TikTok were successfully added to the list, Apple and Google would have a hard time keeping them in the App Store.James Lewis, director of technology policy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says putting TikTok on the list would be extreme, unusual, and legally dubious.  They could      sanction them, but usually the sanction is tied to trade violations or espionage or proliferation or intellectual property theft. You can t just do it because you re mad at a company,  says      Lewis. Unlike TikTok, Huawei is facing actual US criminal charges for racketeering and trade secret theft. The claims about TikTok are still suspicions, not legal complaints. Even an unrelated      lawsuit for unlawfully collecting children s data was settled almost immediately.Trump often isn t overly concerned with whether his orders are lawful. If he issues an executive order that purports to  ban  TikTok or other Chinese apps, it will probably get challenged      immediately in court, but it will still create uncertainty and reputational damage. The White House is already trying to warn investors away from Chinese companies, and even intermittent app      store problems would slow its user growth and hurt advertising revenue. And many users might not realize Trump can t legally shut down TikTok   so they could abandon it before anything even      happens.None of these options would constitute a literal banning of TikTok   that is, a block that cuts US users off from TikTok s network. Similar to President Trump s threats of shutting down      Facebook and Twitter, Pompeo s discussion of banning TikTok obscures the real limits of US government power. Even so, it could foreshadow genuinely troubling attempts to limit how Americans can      use the internet.See Campaign:https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/9/21315983/trump-pompeo-ban-tiktok-bytedance-chinese-social-media-national-security-censorship-methodsContact Information:Adi RobertsonTags:, Artificial Intelligence Newswire, Wire, United States, EnglishLoad-Date: August 17, 2020End of Document

Satellite images from China suggest coronavirus began spreading in October, researchers sayPhilly.comJune 9, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Distributed by Tribune Content AgencySection: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWSLength: 628 wordsByline: Tom Avril, The Philadelphia InquirerBodyJune 09--Satellite images of hospital parking-lot traffic suggest the coronavirus may have originated as early as October, two months earlier than in the official account from Chinese authorities, according to scientists at Boston Children’s Hospital and Boston University.That conclusion was further supported by an analysis of internet search traffic for the Chinese words for cough and diarrhea, the authors wrote.The research has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, and therefore should be viewed as preliminary. But the use of these two kinds of traffic -- automobile and internet -- is a plausible approach, said Paul Digard, professor of virology at the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved in the study.“Using search engine data and satellite imagery of hospital traffic to detect disease outbreaks is an interesting idea with some validity,” he told Science Media Centre, a science communications nonprofit.Chinese officials, who have been accused of being slow to disclose information about the virus, rejected the findings. At a news briefing Tuesday, a spokesperson for the country’s foreign ministry called the analysis “incredibly ridiculous," Reuters reported. The first known case occurred in early December, the government says.Still, the country’s original accounting was flawed in at least one respect, the head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention told the Wall Street Journal in late May: the virus does not appear to have jumped from animal to human at the live-animal market in Wuhan. While most of the initial cases were identified in patients who had spent time at the market, 14 had no direct connection.Boston Children’s epidemiologist John S. Brownstein, senior author of the new satellite study, agreed.“That Wuhan market may have been an innocent bystander,” he said.The scientific consensus remains that the virus jumped to humans from a wild animal, not as the result of an accident with laboratory animals in China, as some U.S. government officials have alleged. Genetic evidence suggests the virus spread from a bat to an intermediate species before infecting humans, though its true origin may never be known with certainty.A clearer picture of the timeline, on the other hand, may be within reach. Researchers have tackled that question in various ways, such as analyzing the genetic code of various strains of the virus. Several studies suggest it originated weeks before the Chinese government says it did, in early December.Brownstein and his colleagues analyzed commercial satellite images of six hospital parking lots in the Wuhan area.The number of parked cars increased markedly in early October, as compared with the same month a year earlier said Brownstein, who also has an appointment at Harvard Medical School. Vehicle volume then dipped below normal in January and February, coinciding with China’s coronavirus lockdown, he said.Internet search traffic for cough and diarrhea also increased during the fall, he and his coauthors found. Searches for cough coincided with a rise in influenza, but there is no known explanation for a rise in diarrhea besides COVID-19, he said.Digard, the Edinburgh professor, cautioned that a more thorough analysis would have included satellite images and search traffic from elsewhere in China. Another limitation: satellite images were not available prior to 2018.Brownstein agreed that more research is needed.“The idea of this study was to try to add another data element to try to help build the story,” Brownstein said. “It’s not definitive, but it provides this new area of evidence to dig deeper into.”___ (c)2020 The Philadelphia Inquirer Visit The Philadelphia Inquirer at www.inquirer.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.Load-Date: June 10, 2020End of Document

ROB'S RUNDOWN: WEEK OF JUNE 29 JULY 3, 2020States News ServiceJuly 3, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 10370 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Ohio Senator Rob Portman:Happy July 4th Weekend. This week, Portman released a new video highlighting his recent visit to Bruns General Contracting in Tipp City, where he met with company leadership and employees and learned how their Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan kept the business afloat so they could keep their workers on payroll and continue operations. The PPP loan was made possible thanks to the bipartisan CARES Act, which Senator Portman supported and President Trump signed into law.On Thursday, Portman delivered remarks on the Senate floor stressing the need to continue our efforts to combat the drug addiction epidemic devastating communities in Ohio and across the nation in the wake of increased overdoses during the COVID-19 pandemic. During the coronavirus pandemic, social distancing guidelines have disrupted traditional addiction treatment services and necessitated the use of telehealth services to help individuals with recovery. That's why Senator Portman has introduced legislation entitled the Telehealth Response for E-Prescribing Addiction Treatment Services (TREATS) Act to make permanent a number of temporary waivers for telehealth services and to bolster telehealth options for addiction treatment services. Specifically, it will allow for a patient to be prescribed lower scheduled drugs like through telehealth on their first visit. Current law requires an in-person visit to receive any controlled substance, but this is a deterrent to patients in crisis and urgent need of treatments from Schedule III or IV drugs.In addition, Portman introduced the Rural Broadband Acceleration Act, bipartisan legislation that will bolster efforts to expand access to rural broadband nationwide and speed up the distribution of the Federal Communication Commission's (FCC) Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF). Portman also penned an op-ed for the Toledo Blade highlighting his bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act which will help rebuild Ohio's national park sites and our national parks' infrastructure by addressing the more than $12 billion backlog in long-delayed maintenance projects at the National Park Service (NPS) and support more than 100,000 jobs over the next five years.Finally, Portman introduced a bipartisan resolution with Senator Sherrod Brown to honor the life, legacy, and achievements of Annie Glenn, a passionate advocate and philanthropist, a loving mother, and wife of 73 years to the former U.S. Senator John Glenn.For a more detailed look at Senator Portman's week, please see the following:Monday, June 29, 2020Portman, Hassan, Cornyn and Peters Introduce Bipartisan NDAA Amendment to Bolster Cybersecurity at All Levels of GovernmentSenators Rob Portman (R-OH), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), John Cornyn (R-TX), and Gary Peters (D-MI) today introduced a bipartisan amendment to the Senate's FY 2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to require the Department of Homeland Security to establish a Cybersecurity State Coordinator position in every state. Each state would have its own federally funded Cybersecurity Coordinator, who would be responsible for helping to prevent and respond to cybersecurity threats by working with federal, state, and local governments as well as schools, hospitals, and other entities. This amendment mirrors the Cybersecurity State Coordinator Act that the Senators introduced earlier this year which the Homeland Security Committee unanimously approved in March."Cybersecurity for state and local governments is just as important as federal cybersecurity, and frequently, they lack the resources, technical know-how, and situational awareness to secure their systems, or respond in the event of an attack," said Senator Portman. "I'm glad to join my bipartisan colleagues in introducing an amendment to the NDAA that would create a Cybersecurity State Coordinator position to facilitate the cybersecurity relationship between the federal government and state and local governments. This amendment is based on our bipartisan bill, the Cybersecurity State Coordinator Act and I urge all my colleagues to join us in supporting it."Portman, Brown Introduce Amendment to Require Report on Youngstown Air Reserve Station Specialty MissionSenators Rob Portman and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) introduced an amendment to the Senate's FY 2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to require the Department of Defense (DOD) to provide Congress with a report on the cost and benefits of maintaining a specific number of primary aircraft for each type of Air Force squadron, particularly those that fly specialty missions flown by the Air Force Reserve units, like the 910 th at the Youngstown Air Reserve Station (YARS).In February, the administration stripped funding from the C-130J aircraft for the Air Force Reserve. Senators Portman and Brown wrote to the administration about this.The report should help illustrate the need to increase the number of primary aircraft at YARS and increase funding for C-130 aircraft." YARS, which employs 1800 personnel and is the largest employer in the Mahoning Valley, plays an important role in the economy of the region," said Portman. "More importantly, it has deployed its resources to those in need across the globe, and defended the values we hold dearest as Americans. As the home of the 910th Airlift Wing Division, which maintains the only large area fixed-wing aerial spray capable fleet in the country, it must always have the quantity and quality of aircraft needed to respond to major disasters like oil fires, disease-carrying insect plagues, and invasive vegetation spread. That's why I'm pleased to introduce this amendment requiring a study to ensure the squadrons of the 910th have the aircraft needed to carry out their important mission. I will continue to support Ohio's military installations so that they have the resources they need to keep us safe."Portman, Brown Introduce Amendment to Require Report on Department of Defense Partnering With Facilities Like Plum Brook on Hypersonic ResearchSenators Rob Portman and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) introduced an amendment to the Senate's FY 2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to require the Department of Defense (DOD) to study partnering with existing government facilities, like NASA's Plum Brook Station in Sandusky, Ohio, to perform research and testing on hypersonic devices."Plum Brook houses world-class facilities in Sandusky that have conducted critical and innovative ground tests for the international space community. I'm pleased that the bill already includes language highlighting the importance of hypersonic technologies to our national security, and that the Department of Defense (DoD) should take actions to improve ground-based test facilities, such as wind tunnels," said Portman. "However, this amendment takes that a step further and requires DoD to do a report that examines all avenues for testing, including non-DoD facilities. Together, this bill and amendment send a strong signal that Plum Book should be considered a prime candidate for increased ground-based hypersonic test facilities in the future. I will fight to ensure Plum Brook is considered to be the site of increased testing."Tuesday, June 30, 2020Preeminent Universities and Leading Tech Companies Announce Support for Bipartisan, Bicameral Bill to Develop National AI Research CloudSeveral leading research universities engaged in artificial intelligence (AI) research, technology companies deploying AI technologies, and others announced support for the bipartisan and bicameral National AI Research Resource Task Force Act, which establishes a task force to develop a roadmap for a national AI research cloud.The National AI Research Resource Task Force Act was introduced by U.S. Senators Rob Portman and Martin Heinrich (D-NM), founding co-chairs of the Senate AI Caucus, and in the House by Representatives Anna G. Eshoo (D-CA), Anthony Gonzalez (R-OH), and Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ). The legislation will convene a group of technical experts across academia, government, and industry to develop a detailed plan for how the U.S. can build, deploy, govern, and sustain a national AI research cloud."The widespread support for the National AI Research Resource Task Force Act from our country's preeminent research universities and leading technology firms demonstrates how critical the legislation is for our country to retain our global lead in AI research," said the members . "We thank the universities and companies supporting our bill, and we call on Congress to act on this legislation as soon as possible."Portman Introduces FY2021 NDAA Amendment to Assess the Surge Capacity of Defense Industrial Base ManufacturersSenator Rob Portman introduced an amendment to the Senate's FY 2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to require the Department of Defense (DoD) to assess the surge capacity of defense industrial base manufacturers compared to that of our adversaries. As the COVID-19 pandemic has made clear, the United States often lacks the capacity to produce critical supplies during periods of crisis when there are surges in demand for critical items. It is crucial that our domestic industrial base have the capacity to quickly ramp up production in times of crisis, so that we are not overly dependent on foreign products."In wartime or times of crisis in our nation, it's important that the Department of Defense has a clear understanding of defense industrial base manufacturers' capacity to produce equipment for our military," said Portman. "There are many large and small businesses in my home state of Ohio that possess the capability and capacity to meet DoD equipment requirements during times of national emergenciesit is important for these businesses and DoD to know what the requirements are and which companies can fulfill them. I introduced this amendment to ensure that the DoD has a full understanding of what manufacturers are able to provide, especially during war or a crisis when there is a surge in demand for product."Portman, Whitehouse Introduce Bipartisan Legislation to Increase Access to Telehealth Services for Substance Use Disorder TreatmentSenators Rob Portman and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) introduced the Telehealth Response for E-prescribing Addiction Therapy Services (TREATS) Act to support the expansion of telehealth services for substance use disorder treatment. The bill would build upon the Trump Administration's action to waive regulatory restrictions for accessing care in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. While the temporary waivers provide a necessary reprieve for patients so that they may continue their treatments and counseling virtually, they are time limited and will ultimately expire at the conclusion of the Public Health Emergency.The TREATS Act would extend these telehealth flexibilities by making permanent key waivers, including the ability to prescribe Medication Assisted Therapies (MAT) and other necessary drugs without needing a prior in-person visit and the ability to bill Medicare for audio-only telehealth services. By taking these steps, the TREATS Act will increase overall access to MAT and support telehealth needs in rural communities where broadband may be needed."The COVID-19 pandemic has affected every aspect of our lives and the increase in overdoses we're seeing only increases the need for additional flexibility to help those suffering from addiction. I've had the opportunity to hear about the successes of telehealth in treating substance use disorder directly from behavioral health providers who have continued their fight against the addiction epidemic amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic," said Portman. "The roll out of telehealth waivers has both helped patients maintain access to care safely at home and increased access to care for those that didn't otherwise have access to in-person treatment. As we move forward and look to life beyond this pandemic, we must make sure that the advances to care and access that telehealth is currently providing is not lost and that's exactly what this bill will do. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this common-sense legislation to make telehealth a permanent part of substance abuse disorder treatment."Portman Announces 420 Percent Increase in Federal Security Resources for Faith-Based and Nonprofit Institutions Across OhioPortman announced that the Department of Homeland Security's Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP), through their allocation for FY 2020, will distribute $2.4 million to synagogues, churches, religious education facilities, and charity organizations across Ohio, divided between 32 organizations. This funding level marks a 420 percent increase over last year's amount of $450,000, which went to six Ohio organizations. The NSGP provides grants to faith-based and other nonprofit organizations to help secure their facilities against a potential terrorist attack and acts of hate."With a 420 percent increase in funding, it's clear that Ohio is benefiting from the bipartisan work we've done in Congress to ensure that more and more synagogues, religious and cultural institutions, and nonprofit organizations have the resources and training they need to secure their facilities," said Portman. "I'm proud to have led the effort in Congress to both authorize the Nonprofit Security Grant Program and significantly increase its funding. Threats to houses of worship and other religious community sites have been increasing and we must do everything we can to protect them in Ohio and across our country."At Hearing, Portman Urges IRS Commissioner to Prioritize Getting Individuals Delayed Stimulus Checks and Tax RefundsAt a Senate Finance Committee hearing, Portman urged the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Commissioner Charles Rettig to prioritize issuing delayed stimulus checks to individuals who have not yet received them, especially those who are un-banked or did not have up-to-date information on file. The CARES Act, which passed earlier this year as a rescue package for those affected by the coronavirus, provided direct financial assistance to families in need, including $1,200 for individuals making less than $75,000 and $2,400 for couples making less than $150,000. While the overwhelming majority of individuals, including over six million Ohioans, have received their payments, there are still more Americans waiting on this much-needed relief. In addition, Portman urged the commissioner to address the issue of millions individuals who have not received their tax refunds for this year, even though they filed their returns before the deadline.Excerpts of the hearing can be found here and a video can be found here.Portman Announces $1.6 Million in Federal Resources for Security Efforts on Ohio's Northern BorderPortman announced that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), through their allocation for FY 2020 for FEMA's Operation Stonegarden Grant Program, will distribute $1.6 million to help fund Ohio's security efforts along Ohio's northern border. This funding supports cooperation and coordination among state, local, tribal, territorial, and federal law enforcement agencies in a joint mission to strengthen security efforts along our borders. Ohio's northern border is important to Ohio's economy and it's vital that it remains secure, while allowing legitimate trade and travel to flourish. This funding may be used to support the integration of technology to ensure effective communication, to encourage local capabilities and operations to enhance National and State Homeland Security Strategies, provide intelligence-based operations to ensure the safety of state and local law enforcement participating in the program, and to increase operational, material, and technological readiness of state and local law enforcement agencies who work along Ohio's northern border."This $1.6 million in funding is great news for the state of Ohio. This funding will help as the state continues to secure its northern border to protect against acts of terrorism and facilitate international trade and travel," said Portman. "I'm proud to support this crucial funding and I will continue to keep doing everything I can to protect the citizens of Ohio."Portman Washington Examiner Op-Ed: Make FAST-41 PermanentIn an op-ed for the Washington Examiner, Portman highlighted the importance of making his FAST-41 legislation permanent. In 2015, Portman sponsored the Federal Permitting Improvement Act , which Congress ultimately enacted into law as Title 41 of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act . That bill, now known as FAST-41, significantly reformed the federal infrastructure permitting process while leaving environmental protections in place, and created the Permitting Council.Currently, FAST-41 will expire in 2022 . Senator Portman, however, has introduced legislation, the Federal Permitting Reform and Jobs Act, to lift the sunset on FAST-41, which will ensure that the Permitting Council can continue its work to make the infrastructure permitting process more efficient and reduce unnecessary delays. A more efficient permitting process supports the creation of new jobs, which will help the nation recover from the COVID-19 crisis. The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs approved the bill in July 2019, and it is now awaiting a vote by the full Senate. In May, the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council released its annual report to Congress which highlighted the creation of more than 127,000 temporary construction jobs and more than 3,000 permanent jobs across the United States over the last year and the Council's success in reducing unnecessary delays in government approvals for large infrastructure projects by 1.5 years on average. Excerpts of the op-ed can be found here and the full op-ed can be found at this link.At Hearing, Portman Secures Commitment from Nominee to be OMB Deputy Director to Support Bipartisan Safeguarding American Innovation Act and FAST-41At a Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC) hearing, Portman secured a commitment from the nominee to be the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Deputy Director that he would support Portman's bipartisan Safeguarding American Innovation Act and also support the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council created through Portman's FAST-41 legislation.Portman, as chair of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI) introduced the bipartisan Safeguarding American Innovation Act which will crack down on the theft of intellectual property at federally funded research institutions and universities by China and other foreign governments. A recent NIH investigation resulted in the resignation or firing of 54 scientists for ties to foreign governments. Portman led a year-long PSI investigation into this issue culminating in a bipartisan report and hearing that detailed how American taxpayers have been unwittingly funding the rise of China's military and economy over the last two decades while federal agencies have done little to stop it. Starting in the late 1990s , through its "talent recruitment programs," China began recruiting U.S.-based scientists and researchers to transfer U.S. taxpayer-funded research and IP to China for their own economic and military gain. The Safeguarding American Innovation Act is the product of that investigation and will ensure that the federal government is taking decisive action to safeguard American innovation.In addition, Portman highlighted the importance of making his FAST-41 legislation permanent. In 2015, Portman sponsored the Federal Permitting Improvement Act , which Congress ultimately enacted into law as Title 41 of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act . That bill, now known as FAST-41, significantly reformed the federal infrastructure permitting process while leaving environmental protections in place, and created the Permitting Council.

Portman, a former U.S. Trade Representative, played a leadership role in helping the Trump administration move the agreement through the House and Senate. He issued the following statement:"Today's a historic day for the trade relationship between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. I applaud President Trump and U.S. Trade Representative Lighthizer for their persistence and determination in getting USMCA across the finish line. USMCA will increase market access for our exporters, and it is a significant improvement over NAFTA that will benefit American workers, farmers, and manufacturers. According to the independent International Trade Commission, it will create tens of thousands of new jobs here in the United States."Canada and Mexico are Ohio's top two trading partners, making this agreement particularly good for Ohio. This agreement expands market access for Ohio farm products, incentivizes more auto production in the state, and makes online sales easier for Ohio companies. Now that this agreement has been fully implemented, these provisions will be in other agreements, which will help America's economy compete on a level playing field as we continue to safely reopen our economy. If our trade is fair, America can compete, win, and create more jobs and better wages."Bringing this agreement into force is going to add a nice shot in the arm to our economy and it's going to be great for Ohio. Thanks to the hard work of the Trump administration, American workers, small business owners, manufacturers, and farmers will benefit from healthier trade relationships with two of our biggest trading partners."VIDEO: Portman Visits Tipp City Business Kept Afloat By Paycheck Protection ProgramIn a new video, Portman highlights his recent visit to Bruns General Contracting, where he met with company leadership and employees and learned that their Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan kept the business afloat so workers stayed on payroll and operations continued at their Bruns General Contracting division and area job sites. The PPP loan was made possible thanks to the bipartisan CARES Act , which Senator Portman supported and President Trump signed into law.A transcript can be found below and the video can be found here.Senators Portman, Shaheen and Reps. Kennedy, Graves Introduce Bipartisan Legislation to Reauthorize Peace Corps Commemorative ProjectSenators Portman and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Representatives Joe Kennedy III (D-MA) and Garret Graves (R-LA) introduced bipartisan legislation to reauthorize the Peace Corps Commemorative project. In 2014, Senator Portman's and Rep. Kennedy's bipartisan Peace Corps Commemorative Act was signed into law to create a commemorative in Washington, D.C.'s National Capital Area to celebrate the mission of the Peace Corps and the ideals on which the Peace Corps was founded. This bipartisan legislation designated the Peace Corps Commemorative Foundation as the lead nonfederal sponsor for the project, and prohibits the use of public funding. The current authorization for the project is set to expire in January 2021.Senators Portman and Shaheen and Reps. Kennedy and Graves' legislation would extend the authorization for the project for an additional seven years, to January 2028, in order for the project to secure the necessary design approvals and raise the funding for construction."For more than 50 years, the Peace Corps has served as a powerful vehicle for volunteers who wish to use their talents to carry America's humanitarian values to other parts of the world ," said Portman. "By reauthorizing this project, we can ensure the Peace Corps Commemorative Foundation can finish this important project and honor those Americans who have donated their time and talent to serving others."Additional Ohio Conservation Leaders Praise Passage of Portman Legislation to Fund Maintenance Backlog at America's National ParksLast month, the Senate passed Senator Portman's bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act, which will help rebuild our national parks infrastructure by addressing the more than $12 billion backlog in long-delayed maintenance projects at the National Park Service (NPS) and support more than 100,000 jobs over the next five years. The Restore Our Parks Act is a part of a broader package, the Great American Outdoors Act -- landmark bipartisan legislation to address the deferred maintenance backlog across the federal land management agencies and to provide permanent funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The Restore Our Parks Act would help tackle the more than $100 million maintenance backlog at Ohio's eight national park sites. Ohio and national conservation leaders have praised the passage of this historic legislation and President Trump has voiced his support for this legislative effort.Portman introduced the Restore Our Parks Act with U.S. Senators Mark Warner (D-VA), Lamar Alexander (R-TN), and Angus King (I-ME) and has pushed the Senate to pass the bipartisan legislation over the last several years. The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee approved the bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act in November 2019. Portman worked with his colleagues to expand the Restore Our Parks Act to address the more than $20 billion in deferred maintenance backlog across all land management agencies in the Great American Outdoors Act . This legislation provides $1.9 billion per year for five years into the "National Parks and Public Land Legacy Restoration Fund" from half of unobligated revenues from on and offshore energy development on federal lands. Recently, Portman announced that a new National Parks Service (NPS) study of the Restore Our Parks legislation found that the legislation will support an average of 40,300 direct jobs and a total of 100,100 direct and indirect jobs over the next five years to help address the delayed maintenance backlog and rebuild our national parks infrastructure. An additional National Park Service (NPS) study showed that in 2019, visitor spending in communities near national parks resulted in a $41.7 billion benefit to the nation's economy and supported 340,500 jobs.Here are the conservation leaders across Ohio that support the legislation.Portman, Brown Introduce Resolution Honoring Life, Legacy and Achievements of Ohio Native Annie GlennSenators Rob Portman and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) introduced a bipartisan resolution to honor the life, legacy and achievements of Annie Glenn, a passionate advocate and philanthropist, a loving mother, and wife of 73 years to former U.S. Senator John Glenn. The introduction of this resolution was made possible with the support and involvement of Annie Glenn's family and loved ones.Having overcome a severe stutter, Glenn was a leading advocate on behalf of children, the elderly, and people with disabilities. At the age of 53, Glenn overcame her stutter through an intensive speech program at Hollins University, later becoming an avid public speaker and an award-winning advocate for those struggling from communication disabilities."Annie Glenn was a strong woman with a gracious nature, and a dear friend of Jane's and mine," said Portman. " Her service to our state and advocacy on behalf of people with disabilities, particularly those with speech disabilities, combined with John's legacy as an American hero and Ohio's longest-serving United States Senator have made them a couple that will live forever in Ohio history. I'm proud to join Senator Brown to introduce this resolution honoring the life of this remarkable woman."Thursday, July 2, 2020Portman: June Jobs Report Shows Need for Return to Work Bonus ProposalPortman released the following statement regarding the June jobs report showing 4.8 million net new jobs last month, and why his return to work bonus proposal remains necessary:"Today's jobs report is more encouraging news for our economy and our workers. It showed that some of the temporary job losses due to the COVID-19 health care and economic crisis are starting to come back, and hopefully they will continue to return as economy continues to reopen. While this report is certainly a cause for optimism in terms of our economic recovery, we're not close to being out of the woods yet. Even with the job gains from this month, the 11.1 percent unemployment rate is still more than three times what it was prior to this crisis. Further, the unemployment rate for Blacks and Hispanics is even higher at 15.4 percent and 14.5 percent respectively, meaning that communities of color continue to face disproportionately larger effects from this crisis. And this jobs report does not reflect the last two weeks of June, where some parts of the country have needed to slow their reopening to continue to combat the coronavirus. It is clear, though, that the combination of federal relief programs like the PPP and the fact that many states are continuing the process of safely and slowly reopening has allowed many Americans to get back into the workforce to help bolster our economic recovery."Moving forward, it is critical that we have a workforce that's ready to step safely into their old jobs or newly available jobs as the states continue their respective reopening strategies. Right now, individuals receiving unemployment benefits are getting $600 per week on top of their respective states' unemployment benefit thanks to the CARES Act. Given that more than 10 million unemployed Americans are still categorized as 'temporary layoffs,' we need to be sure that there's no financial disincentive for these individuals to get back into the workforce when those jobs become available again. That's why my return to work bonus proposal is more important than ever. This proposal will provide $450 a week for individuals returning to work, meaning they'd receive their wages plus this $450 bonus. This would encourage folks to continue safely returning to their old jobs or newly available jobs while bolstering the economy. I will work with my colleagues to include this measure in the next legislative COVID-19 response package."Portman Announces Federal Grants to Help Health Care Facilities Across Ohio Provide Telehealth ServicesPortman announced that the Federal Communications Commission's Wireline Competition Bureau awarded over $415,000 in telehealth grants to four health care facilities in Ohio that will use this funding to provide telehealth services targeted at low-income patients so that they can receive medical care in more flexible settings. The exact funding amount and details of the facilities telehealth services can be found below.This grant award follows previous announcements of telehealth grants for Ohio, including one announced in April for the Health Partners of Western Ohio located in Lima, Ohio. Earlier last month, three facilities received nearly $1 million in funding and four facilities received nearly $800,000 in funding, earlier this month six facilities received $1.8 million in funding, and an addition six facilities received $1.1 million. Last month, $3.46 million was distributed to facilities in Ohio. These grants come from funds accessible thanks to the bipartisan Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which Portman supported and President Trump signed into law. Portman released the following statement:"These new federal grants are good news for folks in Ohio . During this ongoing coronavirus pandemic, telehealth has become a vital service for Ohioans to receive the health care consultations they need without having to leave the safety of their homes. I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure Ohioans have the resources they need during these uncertain times."Portman Announces Additional $1.1 Million in Federal Aviation Administration CARES Act Grants to Assist Ohio Airports Impacted By COVID-19Portman announced that the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) awarded an additional $1.1 million in federal grants to Ohio airports to help provide economic relief for lost revenue because of COVID-19. A list of airports can be found below.In late April, Portman announced that the FAA awarded Northeast Ohio airports with more than $46.5 million in federal grants. In addition, Portman announced 28 Ohio airports received more than $42.1 million in federal grants, and Portman also announced additional FAA grants. In May Portman announced $782,000, $3.1 million, nearly $1 million, $189,000, $310,000, and $119,000 in FAA grants to Ohio airports to help address the impacts of COVID-19. Finally, last month Portman announced $60,000 in grant funding. In total, Ohio airports have received over $112 million in federal grants.These grants come from funds accessible thanks to the bipartisan Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which Portman supported and was signed into law by President Trump. Portman released the following statement:"A functioning and effective aviation industry is critical to our U.S. economy. During this ongoing coronavirus pandemic, travel has significantly changed leaving the aviation industry in a tough economic position. I'm pleased to see this CARES Act rescue money helping Ohio airports so they can continue to serve Ohio, and beyond this assistance, I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure Ohioans have the resources they need during these uncertain times."Portman Toledo Blade Op-Ed: An Important Victory for National ParksIn a new op-ed in the Toledo Blade, Portman highlights his bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act, which passed the Senate last month by a bipartisan vote of 73-25, which will help rebuild Ohio's national park sites and our national parks' infrastructure by addressing the more than $12 billion backlog in long-delayed maintenance projects at the National Park Service (NPS) and support more than 100,000 jobs over the next five years. The Restore Our Parks Act is a part of a broader package, the Great American Outdoors Act -- landmark bipartisan legislation to address the deferred maintenance backlog across the federal land management agencies and to provide permanent funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The House of Representatives is expected to consider the legislation later this month and President Trump has committed to signing it into law.Portman introduced the Restore Our Parks Act with U.S. Senators Mark Warner (D-VA), Lamar Alexander (R-TN), and Angus King (I-ME) and has pushed the Senate to pass the bipartisan legislation over the last several years. Portman worked with his colleagues to expand the Restore Our Parks Act to address the more than $20 billion in deferred maintenance backlog across all land management agencies in the Great American Outdoors Act . This legislation provides $1.9 billion per year for five years into the "National Parks and Public Land Legacy Restoration Fund" from half of unobligated revenues from on and offshore energy development on federal lands. Recently, Portman announced that a new National Parks Service (NPS) study of the Restore Our Parks legislation found that the legislation will support an average of 40,300 direct jobs and a total of 100,100 direct and indirect jobs over the next five years to help address the delayed maintenance backlog and rebuild our national parks infrastructure. An additional National Park Service (NPS) study showed that in 2019, visitor spending in communities near national parks resulted in a $41.7 billion benefit to the nation's economy and supported 340,500 jobs.The full op-ed can be found at this link.Portman, Hassan Introduce Bipartisan Legislation to Modernize Federal Government's Use of Latest TechnologySenators Rob Portman and Maggie Hassan (D-NH) introduced the bipartisan Modernization Centers of Excellence Program Act to accelerate the adoption of the latest technologies by government agencies. This legislation expands upon Senator Portman's bipartisan Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Government Act which codifies an AI Center of Excellence (CoE) within the General Services Administration to provide technical expertise to relevant government agencies; advises agencies on the procurement of AI technology; and promote U.S. competitiveness through agency and industry cooperation. Inspired by Senator Portman's legislation, GSA created the AI CoE last year. The Modernization Centers of Excellence Program Act lays out the responsibilities that all of GSA's CoEs should have and harmonizes their roles to strengthen the government's technology expertise beyond just AI."As technology continues to change and advance, it's important that the federal government understands the significant impacts it will have on our country, economy, and society," said Senator Portman, Co-Chair of the Senate AI Caucus. "Ensuring that our government has the capabilities and expertise to help navigate the impacts of the latest technology will be important in the coming years and decades. This bipartisan legislation will ensure our government agencies have the insight and resources they need to better understand the benefits and pitfalls of this technology."Portman, Brown, Braun, Bennet, Jones, Upton and Clyburn Introduce Bipartisan, Bicameral Legislation to Accelerate Broadband Access NationwideSenators Rob Portman, Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Mike Braun (R-IN), Michael Bennet (D-CO), and Doug Jones (D-AL) introduced the Rural Broadband Acceleration Act , bipartisan legislation that will bolster efforts to expand access to rural broadband nationwide and speed up the distribution of the Federal Communication Commission's (FCC) Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF). The RDOF will allocate $20.4 billion to building rural broadband in two phases and this legislation will ensure that some of that money is distributed to communities much faster than the original deadline. The Rural Broadband Acceleration Act also directs the FCC to adhere to the Universal Service requirement in federal law, which is a joint responsibility for the federal and state governments. The Universal Service requirement states that all people in rural areas must have access to telecommunications and information services that are reasonably comparable, in both speed and price, to the services in urban areas. Thus, this legislation will allow rural America to have the same level of broadband service enjoyed by cities and suburbs across the country. Representative Fred Upton (R-MI) and House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (D-SC) have introduced companion legislation in the House of Representatives."In today's technology-dependent world, with many people still working from home during the pandemic, we must do more to bring high-speed internet and stronger grid infrastructure to the rural areas of our country. Rural America deserves the same level of access to broadband and this legislation will help to get it to them faster. Without this legislation, many rural Americans would not have access to reliable internet and thus would not be able to safely telework, use telehealth services, or attend virtual classrooms. In today's economy, limited access to broadband is hurting our efforts to promote economic development and job creation across rural Ohio and America. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this common-sense, bipartisan legislation," said Senator Portman.Portman Joins Grassley, Colleagues to Introduce Updated Prescription Drug Pricing BillSenators Rob Portman (R-OH), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Steve Daines (R-MT), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Susan Collins (R-ME), Martha McSally (R-AZ), Mike Braun (R-IN), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) today reintroduced legislation, the Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act of 2020 , to crack down on high prescription drug prices. This piece of legislation was approved by the Senate Finance Committee last September by a bipartisan 19-9 vote, including all committee Democrats."I'm proud to be joining my colleagues on a meaningful effort to reduce prescription drug costs. From commonsense ideas like my REFUND Act to an out-of-pocket cap on spending in Part D, these are real reforms that can save Americans money at the doctor's office or at the pharmacy counter, and applaud Chairman Grassley for his leadership on this bill. I'm disappointed that Senator Wyden and Senate Democrats have chosen to play politics with what was a bipartisan bill less than a year ago. In order to make progress on this issue we must come together to address the skyrocketing costs of prescription drugs," Portman said.Portman, Cardin Introduce Bipartisan Resolution Supporting U.S. Leadership at, and Reform of, the World Trade OrganizationSenators Rob Portman and Ben Cardin (D-MD) introduced a bipartisan resolution expressing support for U.S. leadership in the World Trade Organization (WTO) while also calling for reform to parts of the institution. The resolution describes the long history of productive American leadership at the WTO, as well as the ways in which the WTO has failed to address new trade barriers and market distortions by countries like China. The resolution also offers specific reform proposals of the WTO including (1) expanding the use of multi-national trade agreements between countries to ensure that only countries party to the trade agreement get the benefits of membership; (2) restoring the intended meaning to trade remedy provisions that, thanks to the WTO's judicial activism, have limited the ability of the United States to crack down on foreign trade cheats; (3) beefing up rules against currency manipulation; and (4) creating new rules to discipline subsidies and state-owned enterprises."As a former U.S. Trade Representative, I understand the value and usefulness of the United States involvement in the WTO," said Portman. "However, there has been a consistent bipartisan critique of certain aspects of the WTO, such as judicial activism of the Appellate Body and the lack of rules and norms that address non-market practices like forced technology transfer and industrial subsidies. I am pleased that President Trump and Ambassador Lighthizer have continued to pursue reforms to ensure a level playing field between the United States and the rest of the world. By identifying the problem and suggesting some potential solutions, this bipartisan resolution is a start to addressing and fixing some of the shortcomings of the WTO in order to support American workers against unfair foreign trade practices and enhance the ability of American farmers, workers, and businesses to access foreign markets."Portman Joins Bipartisan, Bicameral Letter On Chinese Government Atrocities In XinjiangSenator Rob Portman joined 77 of his bipartisan colleagues from the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives in sending a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin regarding the ongoing atrocities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) against Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities. The letter urges the administration to issue a formal determination of the atrocity crimes, including crimes against humanity and genocide, and presses them to impose sanctions against Chinese officials responsible for these heinous policies."These human rights abuses demand a response from the United States as well as the international community because evidence strongly indicates that the Chinese government is intentionally working to destroy and essentially wipe out Uyghur families, culture, and religious adherence and encouraging violence against women. Therefore, we urge you not only to condemn this heinous policy but also to sanction those Chinese officials responsible for these crimes. Furthermore, we ask that the Administration make an official determination as to whether the Chinese government is responsible for perpetrating atrocity crimes, including genocide, against Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other Muslim ethnic minorities," the members wrote .Joining Portman on the letter were Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), John Cornyn (R-TX), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Ed Markey (D-MA), Ben Sasse (R-NE), Gary Peters (D-MI), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), John Boozman (R-AR), Bob Casey (D-PA), Todd Young (R-IN), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Steve Daines (R-MT), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Pat Toomey (R-PA), Chris Coons (D-DE), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Josh Hawley (R-MO), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Susan Collins (R-ME), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Kelly Loeffler (R-GA), John Thune (R-SD), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Rick Scott (R-FL), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), James Lankford (R-OK), Mike Braun (R-IN), Mike Rounds (R-SD), and Mitt Romney (R-UT), as well as Representatives Christopher Smith (R-NJ), James P.

Though hospitals have started resuming elective procedures, and patients have begun returning to seek care, there is concern that as a result of this year's slowdown, some hospitals may not meet the required inpatient admission threshold to remain in the program for the following year. This legislation would ensure that any previously eligible hospital will be deemed eligible for any cost reporting period during which the public health emergency occurred."The 340B drug pricing program has been an important tool for Ohio's hospitals throughout the years, providing them with the flexible resources needed to meet the ongoing needs of their communities without a penny from the federal government," said Portman. "As the ongoing pandemic disrupts our health care system, we must ensure that programs like the 340B program can be there to support our hospitals and our communities. I'm proud to support this bill so that we can ensure that our hospitals can continue to use the program throughout and after the pandemic."On Senate Floor, Portman Highlights Troubling Increase in Drug Overdoses Due to Coronavirus PandemicOn the Senate floor, Portman shared sobering statistics highlighting how the ongoing coronavirus health and economic crisis has caused a marked increase in drug overdose deaths in Ohio and nationwide.While the United States still suffers from the most annual drug overdose deaths in the world according to a recent U.N. report, legislation like Senator Portman's Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) and the 21st Century CURES Act have provided unprecedented federal resources to respond to the addiction epidemic in America, particularly with regards to the epidemic of opioid use. As a result, the CDC reported that in 2017, nationwide fatal drug overdoses fell for the first time since 1990, with Ohio seeing one of the most significant declines in overdose deaths of any state. However, according to a recent Washington Post report, new data from the collaborative Overdose Detection Mapping Application Program show that fatal and non-fatal overdoses were 18 percent higher in March of this year than March of 2019, 29 percent higher this April, and 42 percent higher this May.During the coronavirus pandemic, social distancing guidelines have disrupted traditional addiction treatment services and necessitated the use of telehealth services to help individuals with recovery. That's why Senator Portman has introduced legislation entitled the Telehealth Response for E-Prescribing Addiction Treatment Services (TREATS) Act to make permanent a number of temporary waivers for telehealth services and to bolster telehealth options for addiction treatment services. Specifically, it will allow for a patient to be prescribed lower scheduled drugs like through telehealth on their first visit. Current law requires an in-person visit to receive any controlled substance, but this is a deterrent to patients in crisis and in urgent need of treatments from Schedule III or IV drugs.The bill will also allow Medicare to bill for audio-only, or telephone, telehealth visits if it's not a patient's first visit. In-person visits or telehealth visits with video components are important, because they can allow for more robust checkups and evaluations, but due to distance or access to broadband, these types of appointments aren't always possible.Transcript can be found here and a video can be found here.On Senate Floor, Portman Discusses Wins for Ohio and Nation in Senate FY2021 NDAAOn the Senate floor, Portman highlighted provisions in the Senate FY 2021 National Defense Authorization Act that are victories for both Ohio and our national security.Senator Portman worked to secure billions of dollars in funding for Abrams Tanks, Stryker Vehicles and the Maneuver Short Range Air Defense system - all of which are produced at the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center (JSMC) in Lima. He also fought to include tens of millions of dollars to support Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, as well as $15 million for the construction of a new Guard Readiness Center in Columbus, Ohio. He also strongly advocated for the three percent pay raise for the brave women and men of our armed forces--a benefit that is greatly deserved. And thanks to Senator Portman's leadership as co-chair of the Senate Ukraine Caucus, the FY 2021 NDAA confirms America's commitment to Ukraine by authorizing $250 million in security assistance to fund additional training, equipment, and advisory efforts for Ukraine's forces. Of this $250 million, $125 million will specifically set aside to provide lethal aidsupport which is required to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression. In addition, the bill includes a Portman proposal to require DoD to develop a new, multi-year strategy to support the development of Ukraine's military forces, increasing its capability and capacity and providing a resource plan for US security assistance.A transcript of his remarks can be found here and a video can be found here.On Senate Floor, Portman Voices Frustration Over Lawlessness Co-opting Peaceful Demonstrations Across the CountryOn the Senate floor, Portman addressed the lawlessness that has erupted in cities throughout the nation and emphasized that the violence was undermining the cause of the peaceful demonstrators and further dividing an already polarized country.In June, Portman spoke on the Senate floor about the hurt and anger being felt across the country in response to egregious examples of police brutality against people of color. He highlighted the need to work together to address the long-standing racial disparities and injustices that continue to occur in our country. Portman strongly supports the right of those who are peacefully protesting and also made clear that those rioting, looting, and destroying businesses and other properties are co-opting the moment of pain in our country.A transcript of the speech can be found here and a video can be found here.SOCIAL MEDIAMake FAST-41 permanentWhile our country continues to work to respond to the unprecedented coronavirus crisis, there is a bipartisan consensus in Washington that we must also cooperate to get our economy going again and help people get back to work safely.I believe infrastructure must be part of that conversation. This has long been a priority for both parties and the president, and there is no better time than right now to come together around a solution.We know that the United States needs more smart, large-scale infrastructure projects that will create jobs, grow the economy, and make our country run better. From ports and waterways to promote international trade, to natural gas pipelines and windmills to bolster our energy security, to expanding broadband coverage to rural parts of the country, these projects are critical to our economic future.As we work to recover from the pandemic, these kinds of projects represent an important opportunity to get people back to work and restore our economy to the historically strong performance we saw only a few months ago.But as is often the case, one of the biggest barriers to these kinds of improvements is Washington red tape and bureaucracy, which can slow down the permitting process on these important projects for years. This is a significant problem. In 2019, the World Bank ranked the U.S. 26th in the world in green-lighting infrastructure projects, behind countries such as Lithuania and Tonga.Compounded with a crumbling national infrastructure that received a "D+" grade from the American Society of Civil Engineers, it's clear that these delays undermine our economy and cost jobs.That's why, in 2015, I introduced the Federal Permitting Improvement Act, which Congress ultimately enacted into law as Title 41 of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation or FAST Act. That law, now known as FAST-41, significantly reformed the federal infrastructure permitting process while upholding environmental protections. It also created the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council, a government body composed of representatives from 17 government agencies, which reduces inefficiencies in the permitting process for some of the largest infrastructure projects.Once FAST-41 became law, it quickly began making a difference. In just a few short years, the permitting council saved projects more than a billion dollars. First Solar, a company developing solar power projects in Nevada and California, testified to the subcommittee chair last year that the law has made a difference.According to First Solar, which employs more than 1,000 workers at its manufacturing facility in Perrysburg, Ohio, "FAST-41 and the Permitting Council have played an important role in addressing timely permitting of infrastructure projects and should expand its role to further improve inter-agency collaboration and streamlining of the environmental review and approval process."We received more good news recently when the permitting council released its annual report to Congress. The report found that FAST-41 led to the creation of more than 127,000 temporary construction jobs and more than 3,000 permanent jobs across the U.S. over the last year.What's more, it showed how the council has succeeded in cutting through the red tape and eliminating unnecessary delays, shortening the government approval process for large infrastructure projects by an average of one and a half years.This report demonstrates that FAST-41 is delivering real results. That means more certainty when it comes to these kinds of infrastructure projects from start to finish, for project sponsors, for investors, for workers, and for people in the U.S. In fact, the National Association of Manufacturers has called for increased investment in the permitting council as part of its new "American Renewal Action Plan."Right now, however, this program is set to expire in 2022, meaning that we will lose the improved coordination between federal agencies and increased certainty for project sponsors if we don't act soon. That's why last year, I introduced legislation called the Federal Permitting Reform and Jobs Act, which will lift the sunset provision on FAST-41 and allow the permitting council to continue its great work into the future.As we work to recover from this coronavirus crisis, it will be essential to help the nearly 40 million people who have lost their jobs get back to work. Large infrastructure projects have been shown to be a great source of jobs and economic growth. I believe they represent an important part of any recovery effort moving forward.That's why this permitting council report is so significant it shows that these projects can move forward in an efficient and merit-based manner, meaning that we can start breaking ground and seeing the benefits of these investments even faster.Our legislation to lift the FAST-41 sunset provision has already passed the committee level and now awaits passage on the Senate floor. I'm committed to getting it passed this year so that we can continue to make sure more infrastructure projects get done on time and under budget.Portman: An important victory for national parksTHE JUNE 29 Blade editorial titled "Preserve the Parks," argued that my legislation to help our national parks would be a good investment for our public lands and our economy. They couldn't be more right. The legislation will help repair and preserve for future generations the eight national parks here in Ohio and will help all of the spectacular national parks around the country.Many know that for a long time the parks have suffered from a lack of funding for upkeep and repairs to things like trails, parking lots, visitors centers, and other important facilities, creating an ever-growing backlog of long-delayed maintenance projects that now have a cost of $12 billion.I have seen this firsthand at places like the Perry's Victory and International Peace Memorial at Put-In-Bay. It's an incredible site that commemorates Adm. Oliver Hazard Perry, the War of 1812, and all its veterans, and the enduring relationship between Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom.But the seawall that protects the memorial is crumbling as time passes and the Lake Erie water level rises. With this comes sinkholes and other hazards that threaten the monument. In all, the monument needs about $48 million worth of repairs against a budget that is a fraction of that amount.I still believe that our parks must be preserved for future generations. That's why, in my time in public office, I've worked to fix these kinds of problems and ensure our national parks get the treatment they deserve.In 2007, as the director of the Office of Management and Budget, I initiated the Centennial Challenge for the parks, a public-private partnership to leverage federal dollars with private investment to repair our parks ahead of the 100-year anniversary of our park system.As a member of the Senate, my efforts continued. In 2016, we passed my National Park Service Centennial Act, which codified the Centennial Challenge program to provide more funding to our parks through public-private partnerships.To date, the Centennial Challenge program has provided $128.5 million in federal dollars with an additional $167 million in nonfederal partner investments for our parks. But there was still more to do.That's why, more than three years ago, I introduced the first version of what later became the bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act, which would use revenue the federal government receives through offshore and onshore energy development to establish a parks restoration fund. This fund, which would run for five years, would help us address the most pressing repairs at our parks and public lands so that the American people can continue to enjoy them for decades to come.Last month, I'm pleased to say that we finally reached a breakthrough in this important work. The Senate voted to pass the Restore Our Parks Act by an overwhelming bipartisan margin. Once this important bill passes the House and is signed into law by President Trump, who has voiced his support for the measure, the Perry Memorial will finally be able to get the repairs it needs to stand the test of time.This bill is not just important for our parks but our economy, too. The National Park Service estimates it will support more than 100,000 jobs over the next five years as these repair needs are addressed. It's a good long-term investment, too as of 2019, visitor spending in communities near our national parks resulted in a $41.7 billion benefit to the nation's economy and supported 340,500 jobs.I'm proud that the Senate came together as Republicans and Democrats to support this important initiative. These repairs were a debt unpaid, and we are finally addressing them at no cost to taxpayers.Our parks have stood tall for more than a century as the embodiment of American history and our commitment to stewardship of our magnificent lands.Thanks to the Restore Our Parks Act, we will be able to ensure that they stand for centuries more, as well.Load-Date: July 3, 2020End of Document

Trump Told Xi Jinping He Was 'Greatest Leader In Chinese History': Bolton MemoirThe Daily CallerJune 17, 2020 Wednesday 08:28 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: DAILY-CALLER-NEWS-FOUNDATION; politicsLength: 479 wordsByline: Thomas Catenacci, Contributor, tcatenacci@dailycallernewsfoundation.orgBodyLink to ImagePresident Donald Trump told Chinese President Xi Jinping that he was the “greatest leader in Chinese history” at the 2019 G-20 summit in Osaka, Japan, according to an excerpt of former National Security Adviser John Bolton's book published in The Wall Street Journal.The allegation that Trump praised Xi is among many damning allegations put forth by Bolton in his memoir, “The Room Where It Happened,” which is set to be released by Simon & Schuster next week. “Trump's conversations with Xi reflected not only the incoherence in his trade policy but also the confluence in Trump's mind of his own political interests and U.S. national interests,” Bolton writes.Bolton alleges that Trump turned the conversation to the upcoming U.S. presidential election at the 2019 Osaka meeting, and went on to ask Xi for help in ensuring his victory. Trump alluded to China's economic capability when asking for Xi's help, according to Bolton.Trump also encouraged Xi to continue building concentration camps, according to Bolton. Trump allegedly said it was the “right thing to do.” (RELATED: Trump Administration Sues John Bolton To Delay Publication Of White House Tell-All)China has continually repressed its Muslim Uighur population by sending them to concentration camps, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. Several global organizations, such as the UN, have called on the Chinese government to stop this abuse of human rights immediately.Link to ImageChina President Xi shakes hands with President Trump on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Osaka. (Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images)Trump also interfered with Department of Commerce penalties on Chinese tech firms ZTE and Huawei for his own political gain.“In 2018, for example, he reversed penalties that [Secretary Wilbur Ross] and the Commerce Department had imposed on ZTE.” Bolton writes. “In 2019, he offered to reverse criminal prosecution against Huawei if it would help in the trade deal-which, of course, was primarily about getting Trump re-elected in 2020.”Bolton also accuses Trump of an unwillingness to publicly address China's human rights violations for the sake of his own gain. For example, Bolton says that on the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests, Trump elected not to issue an official White House statement.“That was 15 years ago,” Trump inaccurately said, according to Bolton. “Who cares about it? I'm trying to make a deal. I don't want anything.”Meanwhile, the Trump administration is suing Bolton to delay the release of his memoir. Justice Department lawyers claim it includes classified information.Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Chinese hackers would have stolen covid-19 vaccine information: U.S.CE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 21, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 272 wordsBodyTwo Chinese hackers have been charged with allegedly stealing information about covid-19 vaccine projects and violating the intellectual property of companies in the United States and other countries, the US Department of Justice reported Tuesday.Li Xiaoyu, 34, and Dong Jiazhi, 33, are also charged with attacks on U.S. and Hong Kong human rights activists, National Security Attorney John Demers' assistant at a press conference in Washington said.The hackers, who are allegedly based in China outside the reach of the US police, sometimes acted "for their own personal benefit" and in for the Chinese State Security Ministry, detailed Demers.Read further: They criticize the first act of Kanye West's campaign and question its mental stability"Cybercrime led by The Chinese government's intelligence services threatens not only the United States, but also the other countries that support fair play, international standards and the rule of law," said FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich.Federal Prosecutor William Hyslop, for his part, said hackers attacked companies around the world."The IT systems of many companies, individuals and agencies across the United States and around the world have been hacked and compromised, and there are a lot of sensitive and valuable trade secrets, technologies, data and personal information that have been stolen," Hyslop said.The Department of Justice explained in turn that the attacks targeted "hundreds of companies, governments, non-governmental organizations and dissidents, democratic and human rights clerics and activists in the United States and abroad, including Hong Kong and China."Load-Date: July 22, 2020End of Document

They report that the Vatican was hacked by ChinaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 29, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 409 wordsBodyIn recent months, China received several accusations of hacking and cyber theft. It happened in the race to find the coronavirus vaccine ? and now another possible scandal has come to light. According to a US publication, this time the Chinese hacked into the Vatican, in the preview of a key negotiation.The alleged hack was led by a group called RedDelta and began in May with a view to negotiations in September on the interim agreement on the appointment of bishops,a report released Tuesday by Recorded Future, a US-based group that monitors cyberattacks by state entities. Before, the hack was reported by the New York Times.The monitoring group assured that the Hong Kong Mission for Relations with China, a major binding body between the Holy See and the Beijing government, and the Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions, were also hacked."The alleged intrusion into the Vatican data would give RedDelta an idea of the Holy See's negotiating position before the renewal of the agreement," the document says. He adds that China could also gain "valuable intelligence" on the positions of Hong Kong Catholic entities towards the mass protests that occur there.According to the report, cyberattacks continued until at least July 21. In their journey, they also included an apparent attempt at "phishing" with a document with the official seal of the Vatican Secretariat of State addressed to the director of the Hong Kong Mission for Relations with China.Upon publication of the report, the Vatican declined to comment on it, while China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied being involved, calling the report "unfounded speculation". A few days ago, the United States had also involved the Chinese government in network attacks against laboratories working on the hunt for the Covid-19 vaccine.In China, the 12 million Catholics in the territory are divided between the faithful to the official Catholic Patriotic Association, independent of the pope's mandate, and the faithful to the Vatican, who operate underground. Parish priests and priests of the underground church are often detained or harassed by the government.In 2018, the Vatican and the Chinese authorities agreed on appointments of bishops to unite the flock, normalize the status of seven bishops who were not recognized by Rome, and reduce decades of cold relations between China and the Vatican. Now, the negotiations are looking to renew those agreements.With AP information.Jpe?Load-Date: July 30, 2020End of Document

BARRASSO OP-ED: CHINA IS MISLEADING THE WORLD ON CORONAVIRUS AND CLIMATE CHANGEStates News ServiceJune 24, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 360 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works:By: U.S. Senator John BarrassoJune 23, 2020Chicago TribuneThe political left is quick to blame U.S. air emissions for both the severity of the coronavirus pandemic and climate change. China is the primary culprit for both, and the Chinese Communist Party is attempting to mislead the world.In April, Harvard University researchers released a study that claimed people who lived in areas with more air pollution stood an increased chance of dying from the coronavirus. The study caused a media sensation, and Democratic politicians publicly embraced its findings. However, the study was not peer-reviewed. Experts questioned its results. Harvard has since rolled back the study's dramatic claims.The idea that U.S. pollution is responsible for the spread of the pandemic is simply false. From the time the disease emerged, Chinese authorities have engaged in a comprehensive disinformation campaign.Communist Party leaders destroyed evidence and misled the world about the outbreak.When Dr. Li Wenliang, a physician at Wuhan Central Hospital, attempted to alert the public, he was forced to recant. He died of the virus weeks later. Chinese authorities censored journalists and blocked social media sites.According to Johns Hopkins University, over 8 million individuals have contracted the virus worldwide and the death toll is over 400,000. The Chinese government has tried to avoid accountability.A closer look at China's pollution data also shows deception. Chinese authorities have routinely underreported emission totals and pollution levels. An audit found hundreds of Chinese power firms had falsified emissions reports.The data China shares is likely woefully inaccurate yet still staggering. Over the past two decades, as U.S. emissions have fallen, China's have grown.China, not America, lied about its contributions to the spread of the coronavirus and a changing climate. It should be held accountable for both.Sen. John Barrasso, a Republican from Wyoming, is an orthopedic surgeon and chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.###Load-Date: June 24, 2020End of Document

Launch Program Helps Companies Start Selling Direct to Consumers in China Via Cross Border E-CommerceSend2PressJune 3, 2020 Wednesday 11:10 AM GMTCopyright 2020 ASC Services II Media, LLCAll Rights ReservedSend2PressCopyright 2020 Send2PressLength: 848 wordsByline: ABC Showcase USADateline: LOS ANGELES, Calif., June 3, 2020 Body ABC Showcase USA, a leading provider of cross border e-commerce services, international trade and logistics fulfillment, established in 2018, announced expansion of a comprehensive solution to help U.S. companies sell directly to consumers in China and S.E. Asia.Cross border e-commerce is dramatically transforming the way foreign brands penetrate the Chinese market. In 2019 more than $200 billion dollars in commerce was transacted through cross border e-commerce in China and more than 600 million active online consumers are expected by 2023. Perhaps even more exciting, U.S. companies can start selling their products in China without needing to first commit to costly regulatory approvals, re-labeling or modifications.The rise of cross border e-commerce has brought with it an unprecedented opportunity for American companies to tap sales directly from Chinese consumers. Even with the specter of protracted trade friction between the United States and China, cross border e-commerce offers U.S. brand holders a sensible work around to sell their products in China avoiding high tariffs.New-to-export companies can begin selling their brands direct to consumers in China including in highly regulated product categories such as health supplements, beauty products, pet food, and packaged foods with no need to directly ship their inventory overseas and thus bypassing a traditional stocking distributor. The Chinese government has recently lowered duties on most consumer goods sold through cross border sales to 9.2 %. Coupled with the expanded Chinese individual personal exemption, consumers can now import up to 5000 RMB($720.00) duty free.The team at Showcase USA has simplified the cross-border e-commerce process to offer companies a customizable solution to help quickly launch their products rapidly in China. Since the start of 2018, Showcase USA has managed the successful launch of U.S. apparel, beauty, packaged foods, supplements, and innovative consumer goods on Kaola.com and other leading cross border platforms. According to Mark Matsumoto, company co-founder,  The expansion of cross border e-commerce has been a game changer for U.S. companies hoping to reach the vast China consumer market. We have developed a turn-key selling model that reduces risk and gives companies assurance dealing with a U.S. based company.â€Leveraging the backbone of ABC Depot Logistics who established the 3PL and procurement arm for Netease/Kaola in North America, the ABC Showcase USA model provides brand holders a simple method to manage all aspects of the cross-border process selling on leading platforms including, Kaola.com, Pinduoduo, WeChat and others.The ABC Showcase USA Store Program provides brand holders the following bundled support:Platform authorization and launch within 30 DaysProduct registrations with China CustomsTranslated product listings on ABC Showcase USA StorefrontManagement of inventory and logistics from Los Angeles or New Jersey WarehousePayment collection from Chinese consumersCoordination of platform promotion, including facilitation of in-country social media campaigns and participation in live streaming events.24/7 customer service support in ChinaCalifornia based companies can inquire about opportunities to leverage the California Export ICEP Program that may fully subsidize participation in the ABC Showcase USA Pilot Program   a 6-month trial to on board and start selling products on three of the leading cross border e-commerce platforms.Donâ€™t miss your chance to leverage the biggest online shopping day in the world: Singlesâ€™ Day on 11/11 which is expected to exceed $60 billion dollars.

TikTok, the lights and shadows of the popular appCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 19, 2020 SundayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1245 wordsBodyWith videos from 15 seconds to a minute of dance, song and music challenge synchronizations, the app not only "hypnotized" Generation Z, but also the more adults. Since its launch in 2016, TikTok had several changes that allow it to currently have more than 500 million monthly active users, being the most downloaded platform in the world, surpassing tech giants such as Facebook and Google. But why does the fashion app complicate some governments?"We are considering restricting users' access to the TikTok app because of concerns that Beijing is using it as a means of monitoring," US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters. And in an interview with Fox News, he added that citizens should only use TikTok "if he wants his private information to be in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party."In order for the platform - which in the "Chinese version" is called Douyin - to fit into the foreign market during the first raids in September 2017, the company decided to name its Western version as TikTok. During the first few weeks it was among the most downloaded applications from Japan, Thailand and other Asian powers.However, early international concerns about possible interference by the Chinese government in TikTok's success came when the company acquired Musical.ly - a similar app that allowed musical imitations - to begin operating on U.S. territory. At the time, President Donald Trump's administration expressed concern at a potential "threat to national security" over the handling and storage of the data of the millions of users, including personal and cell phone information such as contacts and location. For this reason, he initiated an investigation in November 2019.That same year, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission fined the company $5.7 million for accusations of illegally compiling personal information from children under the age of 13 without parental consent under the Online Privacy Protection Act.The U.S. fear crossed its borders and lies in China's National Intelligence Act of 2017, which "forces individuals and businesses to help the government by providing access, cooperation, or support for intelligence-gathering activities."In that vein, some U.S. government entities, such as the Army, banned installing the app on work phones. They're not the only ones, though.ABC revealed e early this year that Australia's Defence prevented workers from using TikTok. The hacking group Anonymous even made a call via Twitter explaining what it believes to be "a malware operated by the Chinese government that executes a massive espionage operation."The last to join this measure was Amazon, which last week asked all its workers to remove the platform from any mobile device that has "access to the company's email for security risks." However, hours later, the company issued a statement that they warned that the email was "sent by mistake. There are no changes to our policies at this time regarding TikTok."Despite criticism, Zhang Yiming, the mind behind the social media boom, continues to make a profit from success. This 37-year-old entrepreneur is named the "Chinese Mark Zuckerberg" after creating In 2012 ByteDance, an artificial intelligence startup that launched several applications inChina, such as FlipChat and Duoshan, which is valued at more than $75 billion. A Bloomberg analysis suggests that the figure could reach up to $105 billion due to the take-off of its main product.After completing his studies in Software Engineering at Nankai University in Tianjin, Zhang Yiming began his technological journey. One of his first works was a travel page and then toutiao emerged, a news service that reached great popularity among young Chinese. However, the stroke of luck came in 2016 with the origins of TikTok. In the first year, the app, whose grace is that it allows to create nanovideos, had 100 million users and one billion views per day.Little is known about the personal life of the "father of TikTok". He is the son of an official and a nurse. In early press interventions he noted "he doesn't know how to use" TikTok, but after the popularity achieved, one of the rules of the company is that workers have and use the application, otherwise they risk as "punishment" performing abs in the office. In a speech at his university, he noted that during his student days he helped his fellow students with computer problems and thus met his wife.According to the newspaper El País, workers and ex-managers classify the founder of ByteDance as a "man of conciliatory tone, with art to exercise softpower (mandar without being noticed)". In 2019, Zhang Yiming was for the first time on Time magazine's list of the 100 most influential people in the world. According to Forbes, the young entrepreneur is the ninth richest person in China and debuted on the list in 2018 with a $4 billion estate. Application monitoring firm Sensor Tower argues that TikTok has been downloaded more than two billion times, with an increase in the pandemic.Veto a TikTokTo the accumulated suspicions of possible interference, one of the "unforgivable" situations for the Trump administration was what happened at the Republican's June campaign event in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where nearly a million people applied for tickets to the event as an organized joke on TikTok. However, the stadium did not complete a third of the capacity of 19,000 people. In that line is that next week the Senate Committee on National Security and Government Affairs will address the "No TikTok on Government Devices Act" project, driven by Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, which seeks to ban the app among federal employees. The initiative coincided with a massive fall in TikTok this week, which boosted #TikTokBan and #SaveTikTok campaigns in the face of user fears.Among the "opponents" of the app also emerged india's prime minister, Narendra Modi, who in July banned 59 Chinese applications, including the popular short video platform, which has 661 million downloads in that country, which corresponds to 30% of the world market. The reason the authorities put forward is that apps are "damaging to the sovereignty and integrity of the country." Also, days ago, Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison noted that "it is right for people to have a greater awareness of where these platforms originate and the risks they pose."Coinciding with the vetoes imposed in recent months, the Guardian newspaper published internal documents that would show that the application "censored political content that would annoy the Chinese government." Suspicion arose in the absence of videos of the protests in Hong Kong last year. However, the company has noted that "none of the moderatorsChina-based service," but they store the information in Singapore and no government has asked the platform for censorship.In another setback and in the face of the implementation of the Chinese Security Act in Hong Kong, TikTok joined the decision of Facebook, Twitter and Google, which ceased to function in the area in the face of the request to hand over user information to the police under the new legislation. "TikTok's decision to stop operations in Hong Kong seems unusual, but it is strategic. The company has fought to combat suspicions that it operates under Chinese law or under the control of Beijing. That's why TikTok has struggled to change its global image, and this movement could be another step toward it," concluded Karishma Vaswani, the BBC's Asia analyst.Load-Date: July 20, 2020End of Document

Washington states that Huawei and other Chinese companies are controlled by the People's ArmyCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 25, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 303 wordsBodyThe Donald Trump Administration has linked the Chinese Army to a number of Asian giant companies, including Huawei, making China even more difficult to enter sensitive U.S. technology sectors and opening the door to new sanctions. This is revealed by a Pentagon document to which Reuters and the Financial Times, whose authenticity have been confirmed by anonymous sources of the Administration, which ensure that the report has been sent to Congress.The document contains a list of 20 Chinese companies that, according to Washington, are owned or controlled by the People's Liberation Army. In addition to telecoms giant Huawei, which Washington accuses of cyberespionage for Beijing, the list includes the Hikvision group, which provides video surveillance technology to internment camps in the Xinjiang region, where the Chinese government detains the Uighur Muslim minority. China Mobile and China Telecommunications, two companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange, as well as aeronautical manufacturer Aviation Industry.In 1999, the U.S. Congress commissioned the Pentagon to draft this list, but it had not been made until now. Rising tensions between Washington and Beijing, both in trade, technology and politics, have increased pressure on the Pentagon by lawmakers from both parties to publish the list.The mere fact that the Pentagon states that they are controlled by the Chinese Army does not directly imply the imposition of sanctions, but the same law in which the list was ordered authorizes the president to declare a national emergency that would allow him to sanction the companies on that list operating in the United States. The most belligerent with China hope that the single inclusion of companies on the list will serve as a deterrent to U.S. investors considering doing business with them.Load-Date: June 26, 2020End of Document

Rights group says Zoom shut down its account after Tiananmen Square anniversary eventCNN WireJune 11, 2020 Thursday 11:54 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 832 wordsDateline: HONG KONG/SAN FRANCISCO (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG/SAN FRANCISCO (CNN Business) --  A US-based group supporting human rights in China says it is "outraged" that the video conferencing company Zoom temporarily shut down its account after it held an event on the platform in remembrance of the Tiananmen Square massacre.Humanitarian China, an organization based in California that provides "relief for political prisoners and activists" in China, said in a statement that it was not able to access its account on Sunday, a week after it held the virtual meeting. The group said more than 250 people worldwide joined the Zoom conference, while others streamed it on social media."The Zoom account used for this conference displayed a message that it had been shut down," the organization said. "Zoom has not responded to our requests for an explanation."The Tiananmen Square crackdown is a matter of extreme sensitivity for China's ruling Communist Party. On June 4, 1989, Chinese troops entered Tiananmen Square in Beijing and fired on civilians protesting for democracy after several weeks of demonstrations. Estimates of the death toll range from several hundred to thousands.Zhou Fengsuo, a former protest leader in Beijing who leads Humanitarian China, said his May 31 event included the Tiananmen Mothers, a group set up by those who lost children in the massacre. The group also said the event featured writers, scholars and former student leaders. "A significant proportion of attendees were from China," the group said in its statement. "Our conference provided many the opportunity to connect with activists abroad for the first time."News of the account closure was first reported by the news website Axios.Zoom said in a blog post later on Thursday that it was informed by the Chinese government about four separate Zoom gatherings to commemorate the June 4 anniversary that were being publicized on social media."The Chinese government informed us that this activity is illegal in China and demanded that Zoom terminate the meetings and host accounts," the company said.Zoom allowed one of the meetings to proceed after determining it had no participants from mainland China, but ended the other three and suspended the host accounts --- two in the United States and one in Hong Kong. All three accounts have since been reinstated, it said. "We regret that a few recent meetings with participants both inside and outside of China were negatively impacted and important conversations were disrupted. It is not in Zoom's power to change the laws of governments opposed to free speech," the spokesperson added.Humanitarian China said that it was "outraged" that Zoom, a US company, appeared to have acted according to Chinese law in shutting down the organization's account. In its statement, the group accused Zoom of being "complicit in erasing the memories of the Tiananmen Massacre in collaboration with an authoritarian government."Zhou confirmed that his account had been reactivated, but said his team wanted answers on why its service was suspended."We haven't heard from Zoom. We want to know why," Zhou told CNN Business. In the blog post, Zoom said it currently does not have the ability to block individual meeting participants by country and chose to shut down the meetings instead, which it described as a "mistake." The company said it will develop technology to block individual participants in the coming days. "Going forward Zoom will not allow requests from the Chinese government to impact anyone outside of mainland China," the company said.A spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry said earlier on Thursday that she had not "heard about that and [had] no information to offer." "This is not a diplomatic issue," the spokesperson told reporters at a media briefing.Zoom is based in California, but it has ties to China that are increasingly becoming a liability. Earlier this year, its encryption was discovered to be inadequate and some of its data was found to be routed through Chinese servers. It later said that paid customers would be able to prevent their data from being routed through servers in specific regions.The company has utilized Chinese developers from its onset --- its research and development department in China has over 700 employees --- a practice that Zoom warned in its annual report "could expose us to market scrutiny regarding the integrity of our solution or data security features." CEO Eric Yuan acknowledged to CNN Business earlier this year that as tensions between Washington and Beijing rise, Zoom might have to adjust its ties to China. Zoom has already announced plans to open new research and development centers in Arizona and Pennsylvania.Yuan suggested Denver, Ohio or Virginia as other possible sites for a relocated Zoom research and development center. "If things get worse, we do have a plan," he said.--- CNN's Isaac Yee, Ben Westcott and Jon Sarlin contributed to this report.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

The app, which is not available in China, has been trying to distance itself from its Chinese roots to appeal to a global audience.Pompeo's statements also come amid rising tensions between Washington and Beijing over the handling of the coronavirus outbreak, Chinese actions in former British Hong Kong colonies, and a nearly two-year trade dispute between the two countries.(Report by Humeyra Pamuk and Daphne Psaledakis; edited in Spanish by Carlos Serrano)Load-Date: July 9, 2020End of Document

TikTok's withdrawal from Hong Kong mitigates questions about the platformCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 10, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 587 wordsBodyThe withdrawal of Hong Kong's TikTok viral video platform is a trade initiative that allows it to defend against accusations of collusion with China, but fails to completely dispel doubts, several analysts believe.The platform, owned by Chinese group Bytedance, announced Tuesday the suspension of enforcement in the former British colony, days after Beijing enacted a new national security law that gives more powers to the police, especially in surveillance.A few hours earlier Facebook, Google and Twitter announced that they were no more responding to requests for information about their users filed by the government and Hong Kong authorities.The decision to withdraw from Honk Kong should help TikTok get off "the China-controlled and data-sharing company label with the Chinese government," says Zhu Zhiqun, a professor of political science at Bucknell University in the United States.It allows you to improve your reputation, without losing many users, given that you have "relatively few in Hong Kong," according to Severine Arsene of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.It will also allow you to focus on the U.S. market, which brings you more and more revenue. "(TikTok is) now primarily concerned about its survival in the United States," explains expert Elliott Zaagman, who collaborates with the Lowy Institute think tank in Australia.The Douyin app, also developed by Bytedance and mainly disseminated in mainland China, will recover, he adds, a part of TikTok users.Douyin - which shares user data with the Chinese government - is not officially available in Hong Kong, but Bytedance is in support of it being used in this city of seven million inhabitants."The company does not intend to make Douyin available on the Hong Kong App Store, but Douyin has local Hong Kong users who have downloaded it in mainland China," ByteDance spokesperson told the AFP.TikTok and Douyin are one of the most popular applications in the world, with more than 2.2 billion downloads, according to the US research agency SensorTower.They propose a lot of video clips from 15 to 60 seconds, often fun and humorous, as well as makeup tutorials and choreography.- On the target of the United States -The U.S. government closely monitors TikTok due to its growing popularity in the country.In a context of great crunch with China for the way he managed the Covid-19 pandemic, President Donald Trump declared this week that he plans to ban it.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also claimed that Washington is considering banning a number of Chinese applications, including TikTok, amid suspicions of espionage.India - where TikTok is very popular - recently blocked the platform alleging national security grounds after a border confrontation between its Chinese soldiers and military.TikTok categorically denies the accusations of espionage. "We have never provided data about our users to the Chinese government, and we wouldn't if you asked us to," a spokesman said Wednesday.TikTok is also suspected of outlawing some images of the demonstrations in Hong Kong, in an attempt to appease the Chinese government.Searches this week in TikTok with the labels #democracy and #independence in Hong Kong did not connect to any video, the AFP checked. Others, such as #nationalsecuritylaw and #HongKongindependence, yielded results.A spokesman for Tiktok denied there was censorship. "We do not apply any restrictions to political content unless they violate Community rules, such as hate speech," he told theAfp.bur-je/fox/kma/sl/oaa/erl/afLoad-Date: July 11, 2020End of Document

A report details how China's hack into the Vatican and its offices in Hong KongCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 31, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 386 wordsBodyThe Vatican and the Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong were hacked by agents linked to the Chinese regime before negotiations on the resumption of an agreement on China-Vatican relations, a monitoring group reported.The alleged hack was led by a group called RedDelta and began in May with a view to negotiations in September on the interim agreement on the appointment of bishops, a report released Tuesday by Recorded Future, a US-based group that monitors cyberattacks by state entities. The hack was initially reported by the New York Times.The Vatican declined to comment on this. China's Foreign Ministry denied being involved, calling the report "unfounded speculation."Recalled Future said the Hong Kong Mission for Relations with China - a major binding body between the Holy See and the Beijing government - and the Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions were also hacked.The attacks continued until at least July 21 (REUTERS/Kacper Pempel) (Kacper Pempel/)"The alleged intrusion into the Vatican data would give RedDelta an idea of the Holy See's negotiating position before the renewal of the agreement," the document says, adding that China could also gain "valuable intelligence" on The positions of Hong Kong Catholic entities towards protests there.The attacks continued until at least July 21. They included an apparent attempt at "phishing" with a document with the official seal of the Vatican Secretariat of State addressed to the director of the Hong Kong Mission for Relations with China.China's 12 million Catholics are divided between the faithful to the official Catholic Patriotic Association of China, independent of the pope's mandate, and the vatican faithful, who operate underground. Parish priests and priests of the underground church are often detained or harassed by the government.The Vatican and the Chinese government reached an agreement in 2018 on appointments of bishops to unite the flock, normalize the status of seven bishops who were not recognized by Rome, and reduce decades of cold relations between China and the Vatican.(With AP information)MORE ON THESE TOPICS:The European Union imposed sanctions against china, Russia and North Korea entities linked to cyberattacksAfter banning 12 opposition candidates, China postponed legislative elections for a year in Hong KongLoad-Date: August 1, 2020End of Document

Why Tech Giants Could Leave Hong KongCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 12, 2020 SundayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 980 wordsBodySeveral tech companies announced last week that they would temporarily stop processing requests for user information by Hong Kong police.This decision arose after a new security law was implemented in the region whereby Hong Kong police may require online platforms and communications providers to remove content that can be considered a threat to China's security or restrict access to its services.Facebook, Twitter, Google, Telegram and Microsoft said they would pause requests for data processing from Hong Kong authorities until they finish reviewing the implications of the new measure."When the law came into effect, we stopped the production of any new requests for data from the Hong Kong authorities," a Google spokesman told The Verge, adding that they will continue to "review the details of the new law.""Our teams are reviewing the law to assess its implications, particularly because some of the terms of the law are vague and without a clear definition," they said from Twitter to The Washington Post.03/07/2017 China's President Xi JinpingPOLITICA INTERNACIONALpicture alliance / Wolfgang Kumm / DPA (picture alliance / Wolfgang Kumm/)Telegram stated in a statement that it does not intend to process "any request for data related to its Hong Kong users until an international consensus is reached on the current political change in the city," according to The Wall Street Journal."As we would any new standard, we are reviewing the new law to understand its implications," a Microsoft spokesman said in a statement.For their part, Facebook also said they will continue to evaluate the regulations and added, "We believe that freedom of expression is a fundamental human right and we support people's right to express themselves without fear of their safety or other repercussions," CNN said.Several specialists say that companies are likely to take a while longer to analyze the consequences of this legislation and then assess whether it is appropriate to stop providing services altogether, as announced by Tik Tok, owned by the Chinese company ByteDance. This can be interpreted as a strategic gesture by the company seeking to defend itself against accusations that they say is under the control of the Chinese government. The gesture is not enough, according to several analysts.Facebook, Google and Twitter, some of the companies that announced that they stopped responding to requests for user data by Hong Kong (REUTERS) (REUTERS FILE PHOTO/)India, in fact, decided to ban the application a few weeks ago on the grounds that it shares data with the Chinese government. It's not the first time she's been accused of anything like this. In fact, from the United States has long been warned about the security risks involved in the handling of user data by Chinese applications such as Tik Tok since in that country the law urges domestic companies tocooperate with the intelligence work carried out by the ruling party"We are considering restricting users' access to the TikTok app because of concerns that the Beijing government is using it as a means of monitoring," said Mike Pompeo, US Secretary of State.Since Tik Tok, for their part, they have reiterated on several occasions that they do not share user information with the Chinese government or that of any other foreign government. The decision they have now made to withdraw from Hong Kong surely seeks to give strength to this idea.It should be noted that in China the application, which has more than 2 billion downloads worldwide, is still valid and works but under another name: Douyin.Carrie Lam, Hong Kong Chief Executive (REUTERS/Marko Djurica/File Photo) (Marko Djurica/)What China's new security law says and how it affects Hong KongHong Kong is a special administrative region in China. This means that while it is part of China, it enjoys some autonomy from China. This arises from an agreement signed between China and Britain in 1997, when China returned the region to China, under the principle "one country two systems". In this context, it was agreed to safeguard the freedoms and rights of its residents.This is why Hong Kong has enjoyed significant independence from China, but Xi Jinping's government began implementing greater controls and restrictions in that region, which led to a wave of protests in Hong Kong last year.This new regulation seeks to impose more control in that region. Security law empowers law to empower law enforcement to intercept private communications and even require platforms to remove content without a court order.This regulation directly affects sites such as Google, Facebook or Twitter that provide services there and that can be a place where users can express themselves free or find information they want.It should be noted that these platforms, which do operate in Hong Kong, have been banned for years in China where the "Great Firewall" or Firewall governs, as it is called acts of surveillance and censorship from the government. That's why Hong Kong was always regarded as a kind of safe harbor within China but that could soon be over.This new law allows China to limit political dissent against the Communist Party. According to this new regulatory framework, it is considered illegal to participate in "secession, subversion, organization and perpetration of terrorist activities, and collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security".In this context, many technology companies may end up leaving Hong Kong. We'll have to see how this thing ends up unfolding. For now, several computer giants decided to pause and analyze what their next steps will be in the region.MORE ON THIS TOPIC:Japan launched a "smart mask" and will rule out those made in ChinaNeo-Nazi music groups take advantage of Facebook to spread hatred and racismIsrael's army launched smart map designed for counter-terrorismLoad-Date: July 13, 2020End of Document

HSBC, Standard Chartered publicly support China's national security law for Hong KongCNN WireJune 4, 2020 Thursday 7:17 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 731 wordsDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  Two of Hong Kong's biggest banks are backing a controversial national security law that would drastically broaden China's power over the financial hub.HSBC and Standard Chartered on Wednesday signaled support for the bill drafted by Beijing that will be imposed upon the city in coming months. The lenders joined other major businesses in Hong Kong voicing support for the law. HSBC posted a photo on Chinese social media showing Asia Pacific CEO Peter Wong signing a petition supporting the law's implementation. HSBC's London press office confirmed the authenticity of the post."We respect and support laws and regulations that will enable Hong Kong to recover and rebuild the economy and, at the same time, maintain the principle of 'One Country, Two Systems'," the post said, referring to the governing principle that gives the city political and legal freedoms unavailable in mainland China. HSBC is headquartered in London, but was founded in Hong Kong and has a major business presence in China. The bank's statement comes nearly a week after former Hong Kong chief executive Leung Chun-ying blasted HSBC for its silence. Leung took to Facebook on Friday, calling on HSBC to publicly voice its support for the law. He said the bank should know "which side of the bread is buttered." Hong Kong and China are by far HSBC's biggest moneymakers. Last year, the divisions pulled in enough money to wipe out losses in the United Kingdom and keep the company profitable. HSBC's Hong Kong listed shares rose 1.6% on Thursday, outperforming the city's broader Hang Seng Index, which slumped 0.1%.Fellow UK-based lender Standard Chartered also weighed in on Wednesday, saying in a statement that China's proposed national security law for Hong Kong "can help maintain the long-term economic and social stability" of the city.The proposed national security law would ban sedition, secession and subversion against Beijing in Hong Kong, which last year was roiled by anti-government protests calling for greater democracy and more autonomy from mainland China. Last week, China's rubber-stamp parliament approved a proposal to impose the law on the city's behalf, bypassing Hong Kong's legislature via a rarely used constitutional backdoor. The law also would enable Chinese national security organs to operate in the city "to fulfill relevant duties to safeguard national security in accordance with the law."Leaders in the United States and Britain have criticized the introduction of the law as undermining Hong Kong's autonomy. The proposal also briefly rattled markets last month, sending the city's benchmark Hang Seng Index to its worst day since 2015. And US firms have expressed concern about what the law could mean for the city's future as a global business hub, particularly after Washington responded by signaling an intent to end its special economic and trading relationship with Hong Kong.Even so, HSBC and Standard Chartered are among a growing list of top businesses in Hong Kong that have come out in a show of support for the contentious legislation. Jardine Matheson, one of Hong Kong's oldest British trading houses, issued a full-page advertisement on Wednesday in pro-Beijing newspapers Ta Kung Pao and Wen Wei Po, which have strong ties to the Chinese government."Establishing the legal framework that upholds national security is very important. It ensures that Hong Kong continues to attract investment, enhance employment opportunities and protect people's livelihood," the company said. Swire Pacific, one of Hong Kong's richest family-owned business empires, and billionaire Li Ka-shing, founder of telecom and retail conglomerate CK Hutchison, have also voiced support for China's move. Swire said that "the enactment of national security legislation will be beneficial for the long-term future of Hong Kong as a world-leading business and financial centre." "It is within each and every nation's [sovereign] right to address its national security concerns," Li, of CK Hutchison, said in a statement issued last week."Meanwhile, [Hong Kong] has the mission-critical task to fortify its citizens' faith and maintain international trust in the constitutional principle of 'One Country, Two Systems,'" he added. -- Alexandra Lin contributed to this report. TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

US: Chinese hackers attacked developers working on coronavirus vaccineCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 21, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 426 wordsBodyThe U.S. Department of Justice on Tuesday accused two Chinese hackers of stealing trade secrets from companies around the world worth hundreds of millions of dollars and more recently attacking companies that develop a coronavirus vaccine.Special channel. All published on coronavirusThe indictment, which the authorities hoped to detail at a press conference, argues that hackers had detected vulnerabilities in the computer networks of companies known for their work in developing vaccines and treatments in recent months.ChargesThe allegation against hackers includes charges of theft of trade secrets and conspiracy of electronic fraud. According to federal prosecutors, they stole information not only for themselves, but also knowing that it would be of interest to the Chinese government.It is believed to be the first time that foreign hackers have been accused of attacking coronavirus-related scientific innovation centers, although intelligence agencies in the United States and other Western countries have warned for months about such attempts. Last week, for example, us authorities in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom accused a group of hackers linked to Russian intelligence of trying to steal information from investigations into the disease."China has now taken a place, along with Russia, Iran, and North Korea, in that shameful club of nations that provides safe haven to cybercriminals in exchange for such criminals being "willing" to work for the benefit of the state, in this case to fuel the Chinese Communist Party's insatiable hunger for intellectual property gained by US and non-Chinese companies , including the Investigation into covid-19'', Deputy Prosecutor John Demers, the chief Justice Department official for national security, said in a statement.There was no immediate indication that the hackers actually obtained any valid information about Covid-19 treatments, despite efforts to spy on the companies that develop them, but according to prosecutors, the defendants reviewed in January the computer network of a Massachusetts biotechnology company known for investigating a possible vaccine. They also looked for vulnerabilities in a Maryland company's network less than a week after the firm said it was doing similar scientific work.The case was filed earlier this month in federal court in Washington state and was revealed Tuesday.AP sent an email to the Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C., requesting comment on the charges, but headquarters did not respond for the time being.Advertising       Load-Date: July 22, 2020End of Document

TikTok's under pressure from the US government, and competitors like Snapchat, YouTube, and Instagram are capitalizing on the app's uncertain future (FB, GOOGL, SNAP)Business Insider USJuly 14, 2020 Tuesday 06:05 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 679 wordsByline: pleskin@businessinsider.com,  (Paige Leskin)Highlight: The Trump administration recently said it's considering placing a ban on TikTok, sending creators into a panic. But competitors are taking advantage.Body• The Trump administration recently said it's considering placing a ban on TikTok, the viral app with ties to China through its parent company, ByteDance.• In the wake of the threatened ban, competing short-video apps - like Dubsmash, Byte, and Triller - have seen an uptick in their download numbers as TikTok users prepare to migrate to other platforms.• The situation has also opened a window for tech companies, including YouTube and Instagram, to roll out new formats and features reminiscent of TikTok in the hopes they can eat into the app's dominance. • Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.The imminent threat of TikTok disappearing from the US thanks to the Trump administration's suggestion of a ban has signaled panic among users, and tech companies are taking advantage of the chaos to lure the app's loyal following to their competing platforms.In just the past week, up-and-coming platforms such as Byte - a product of Vine's cofounder - and Dubsmash, best known for housing the original "Renegade" dance, have risen to the top of app charts. And more established tech giants including Snapchat and YouTube have debuted new features - all which heavily borrow from TikTok's short-form video and scrolling format. The day President Trump threatened to ban TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, for what he said was punishment for the coronavirus, competing apps that have historically dwindled in TikTok's mainstream shadow saw their download numbers spike dramatically. Byte saw an 126% jump in downloads on July 8, and took No. 1 on the App Store's charts, after generating an average of 1,000 new downloads a day, according to data from app analytics firm Sensor Tower. Data provided to Reuters showed noticeable spikes in downloads for Dubsmash, Triller, and Likee. Established tech companies no longer see TikTok - with an estimated US userbase at as high as 80 million - as a rising startup, and instead recognize it as a worthy competitor. Big names like Facebook and Google had toyed with creating TikTok competitors in the past, but have only just recently started rolling out viable products. YouTube has started testing its in-app feature for short-form video with a "small group" of people, and developers have discovered Snapchat could be switching out its horizontal swiping motion for TikTok's signature vertical swipe.Instagram, meanwhile, is currently testing a new TikTok-like format inside of Stories, called Reels, in select countries. Although Reels is not yet available in the US, Instagram told Business Insider it rolled out the feature last week in India - a country that makes up 30% of all TikTok downloads, and where the government recently banned new TikTok downloads amid a border dispute with China.Although a ban on TikTok in the US may be nothing more than a threat, creators have formulated contingency plans, and are encouraging fans to follow them to other platforms. A timely glitch last week that briefly made video views and like counts reset to zero only added to the panic. Since TikTok came to the US in 2018, it's been a dominant force, outperforming US-based apps that have attracted younger audiences, like Snapchat and Instagram. The app has since faced scrutiny over how much access and influence the Chinese government is afforded over user data and content moderation. TikTok has been able to brush off lawmakers' calls for investigations and national security experts' warnings. In June, TikTok appointed a US-based CEO in June to try to distance itself from its Chinese roots.NOW WATCH: We tested a machine that brews beer at the push of a buttonSee Also:• Inside the rise of TikTok, the viral video-sharing app that US officials are threatening to ban due to its ties to China• Democratic and Republican parties warn staff not to use TikTok over security concerns• TikTok users are reporting that all their video views and like counts have reset to zeroSEE ALSO: Inside the rise of TikTok, the viral video-sharing app that US officials are threatening to ban due to its ties to ChinaLoad-Date: July 14, 2020End of Document

Shanghai Composite nonetheless up a fraction overnight.Some of the top stories that we are watching this morning right now and in just a few hours police reform will take center stage on Capitol Hill. Senator Tim Scott said to reveal the GOP's JUSTICE Act today. Leading Senate Democrats already slamming the plan even before seeing it. They claims it falls short of meaningful reform. House Democrats are unveiling - they unveiled their Justice in Policing Act last week. The GOP plan comes a day after President Trump signed an executive order on police reform which bans choke holds in all but the most extreme cases and improves information sharing to address mental health issues as well.The Fulton County, Georgia District Attorney expected to announced whether to charge the officers involved in Rayshard Brooks's death. Three charges are being considered against now fired Atlanta Officer Garret Rolf including felony murder.

McConnell calling that idea a bridge too far.China is forcing people into quarantine as Beijing goes into a coronavirus lockdown once again. The country making the move due to a serious new outbreak at a wholesale market. The owner claims COVID-19 was spread by imported salmon. The Chinese government says there is no evidence of that. To help contain the spread, though, Beijing cancelled many flights, granted refunds for train tickets and stopped certain taxi services and bus routes. Officials blocking off neighborhoods as well and shutting down schools in Beijing.The Trump administration is suing former National Security Advisor, John Bolton, to block the release of his new book.

Dow Industrials up as you can see. Futures indicating a gain at the start of trading by 32 points on the Dow, 29 points higher on the Nasdaq, and the S&P up 5 points. Stocks soared yesterday after a record jump in retail sales that we told you about on this program. Dow Industrials were up 526 points at the close yesterday. Joining me right now is Laffer Tengler Investments Chief Investment Officer, Nancy Tengler. Also here this morning, Fox Business's Dagen McDowell, UBS Financial Services Private Wealth Adviser, Alli McCartney, is here, and former presidential candidate, former Arkansas Governor, and Fox News Contributor, Mike Huckabee. Great to see everybody this morning. Thank you so much for being here.Nancy, let me kick it off with you. We had those retail sales numbers yesterday on top of a very good jobs number last Friday. Markets up 500 points yesterday, flirting around with record territory once again even in the face of everything else going on with coronavirus. Your reaction, and would you allocate capital to stocks here after these moves?NANCY TENGLER, LAFFER TENGLER INVESTMENTS CIO: You know, Maria, thank you for having me and good morning. This is probably the most difficult market I've had to navigate in my long career. It - you know, the draw down was the easy part. Putting money to work when the market's up as dramatically and quickly as it's - as it's moved has been very difficult.That said, we did at a 7 percent correction. Typically you get a 10 percent correction after a bear market rally. And so, we have kept our hedge on to keep us clear-eyed, and we're still long stocks. We're actually moving our portfolio to more of a focus in growth names. So it's not that we're allocating more capital necessarily but that we're changing our focus. We think as you come out of this recession you're going to wan to be exposed to growth stocks because we think after the initial economy recovery growth will be a little bit slower with all the money that the Fed has put into the system and taken away from private markets.BARTIROMO: Alli McCartney -ALLI MCCARTNEY, UBS FINANCIAL SERVICES PRIVATE WEALTH ADVISER: That seems a - I'm just wondering. It seems a little counter to the rhetoric that you're hearing from a lot of Wall Street saying that growth has run and it's time for value. How do you - how do you think about that right now?TENGLER: Well, as a traditional value manager I would love to agree with them. We look at relative growth and relative value as a way we play the market. So I'm not talking about growth at any price. I'm talking about growth at a reasonable price. If growth - if we're right and growth becomes scarce in the economy, investors will go back into those stocks. And you know, even if you look at some of the usual suspects, the earnings - the revenue growth because that's really what we're looking at right now, earnings are a little suspect, the revenue growth has been - it continues to be pretty dramatic, and the multiples are not crazy. I mean, this is not, you know, the 2000s or 1999. So we still are finding places to put money, but I'm not - I'm not talking about chasing Amazon at these levels or Zoom. I'm talking about stable companies that have strong earnings growth prospects coming out the other side.BARTIROMO: What did you make of Jay Powell yesterday? Federal Reserve Chairman, Jay Powell, is gearing up for day two of his semiannual congressional testimony today. Here's what he said yesterday about the economy. Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)JAY POWELL, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN: The path - the last thing I'll say is it's all quite uncertain, but we appear to be entering that second phase of the economy reopening and businesses reopening and spending increasing. In the long run, I am confident that we will have a full recovery. The fact is we've had the largest economic shock in living memory and the economy's going to recover from that, but we just have to be a little patient with it.(END VIDEOCLIP)BARTIROMO: Nancy, he's reinforcing previous comments just from last week after the FOMC meeting that the Fed is ready to do whatever it takes to support these markets, but he is appearing to look for more stimulus from Congress, Nancy.TENGLER: Yes, he's definitely pushing on that string. I was on a call with Larry Kudlow yesterday or day before, and you know, I think the administration has the right idea in terms of fiscal stimulus instead of just handing out money, so the payroll tax cut's interesting. The infrastructure bill that the president is apparently proposing would be bullish for productivity and CapEx growth. So I think the Fed has done their job by providing markets with calm and liquidity. M2's up 23 percent, 24 percent. That has largely driven this market. I do expect to see choppiness. And so, I think the redder (ph) over the summer and then - you know, then the election takes over. So I do think the Fed has provided the necessary back stop for investors and for the credit markets. So I think Powell's done a darn good job given the circumstances.BARTIROMO: Do you think we're going to see a V-shaped recover? In other words, it will bounce back, a snap back? We had Nancy Lazar on yesterday and she says don't fight the Fed. It's looking like the recovery has begun and it is appearing like a V-shape. What do you think?TENGLER: Yes, so I'm not as smart as Nancy. I love her work and I use her work. I think, you know, we see it in copper. We've seen it with oil prices stabilizing, growing consumer confidence, business confidence is up. I've referred to it as a stair step recovery because, you know, there will be blips. This next earnings season, which is going to take over the headlines in a few weeks, it will be telling because last quarter you could get away with just about anything suspending guidance. This quarter you're going to need to seek companies providing guidance, and I think there's going to be some disappointments.But that said, in Arizona things are booming again and traffic is crazy and it's the middle of summer for goodness sakes. So I do think things are going to be better and continue to be better than expected, the jobs numbers, the retail sales numbers. Those have all been positive surprises. I'm optimistic.BARTIROMO: Sure. All right, Nancy. Great to see you this morning. Thanks so much. We, of course, will be watching. Nancy Tengler joining us there. We are just getting started this morning. We've got a lot coming up. Later this hour I'll be speaking with Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross, as the Trump administration looks to renegotiate its tariff commitment to the World Trade Organization. We'll also talk about Huawei. Next hour, Georgia Congressman and House Judiciary Committee member, Doug Collins, is here weighing in on the politicization of the Justice Department. And the Atlas Organization's founder, Dr. Jonathan Ward, is here as China and India face off in their worst border dispute in decades. 20 people dead.At 8 a.m. Eastern this morning, former White House Press Secretary and Fox News Contributor, Sarah Sanders, joining me giving us her take on bias in the media and then I'll speak with Vista Equity Partners's founder, Chairman, and CEO, Robert F. Smith, on taking action against police, violence, diversity, in small business funding and a lot more. He's focused on small businesses minority owned, so we'll talk about that.Quick break first and then keeping the country safe. President Trump signs and executive order addressing police misconduct as Republican senators prepare to unveil their police reform bill. We're breaking it all down. What can you expect coming up? And then fresh backlash over media bias. Controversy swirls around NBC News after it forced Google to remove conservative advertisements. Stay with us.(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Americans believe we must support the brave men and women in blue who police our streets and keep us safe. Americans also believe we must improve accountability, increase transparency, and invest more resources in police training, recruiting, and community engagement.(END VIDEOCLIP)BARTIROMO: President Trump yesterday in the Rose Garden before signing a sweeping executive order on police reform. Senate Republicans led by Tim Scott of South Carolina ready to reveal their own reform package later this morning as House Democrats plan to vote on the bill next week. Joining us right now is Fox News Political Analyst, author of the book "Taken for Granted", Gianno Caldwell. Gianno, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks so much for being here.GIANNO CALDWELL, "TAKEN FOR GRANTED" AUTHOR: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Your reaction from what you heard from the Democrats' plan and what you're expecting from Tim Scott.CALDWELL: You know, I know we've been talking about this qualified immunity that has a non start (ph) with the GOP and not understanding completely. I think that we need to have more teeth when it comes to the qualified immunity whereas there can be some decisions made by the prosecutor which could break then shield (ph) if necessary.Now, what I got to say in terms of President Trump's executive order, President Trump does not get the credit in which he deserves for the actions he has taken on behalf of the African Americans. President Obama and any other Democrat could have done this. No one has done this. President Trump deserves a lot of credit for what he's doing. We have to move this country forward.I came up with a piece in The New York Post that published on Sunday where it talks about how we cannot defund the police. We need to really in some cases increase the budgets for some of these police departments if you look across the country. In the city of Philadelphia, shootings up 66 percent. If you look in the city of Chicago, my hometown, May 31, the highest killings on death - on record in the city of Chicago. Over 65,000 calls to the 911 center.These are things that we need to take measured approaches and make sure that there's proper training being done by the police and ensure the citizens can really be safe, but we can't take political measures to this because this is not a political issue.BARTIROMO: Yes, what did you think of Valerie Jarrett's ideas? Yesterday I spoke with the former Senior Advisor to President Obama and Valerie Jarrett talked about police reform. Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)We really need all hands on deck from the local governments to the federal government. Tell me where you see the needs right now. What should the government be doing today to regain trust in our police force?VALERIE JARRETT, FORMER SENIOR ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well so I think we need training - far more training than we have both in terms of de- escalation but also in terms of implicit biases which we know we all have. And when people swear to serve and protect and we give them a badge and a gun, there is a higher duty of expectation for how we are treated, which means we have to also make sure they have the skill set necessary to do that very difficult job.(END VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: What about that, Gianno, training? What kind of training would you suggest?CALDWELL: Well, that was quite the interesting response and unexpected from Valerie Jarrett when she says we all have these implicit biases. I was the former spokesperson for the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, and racial training, race sensitivity training is something they often pushed. Use of force standards, (inaudible) that's another great idea.At this time, I think President Trump has been absolutely correct. He has said, hey, some of the training has been out of date. Banning chokeholds. These are just really great and strong ideas. I just think that when it comes to Democrats and some of their proposals we have to make sure that we're not politicizing this issue, and I've seen them do that very thing. They're politicizing the issue. We're in and election year -(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Yes, you're absolutely right.CALDWELL: -- and they're trying to push an agenda here. So when Senator Tim Scott comes out with this proposal, I look forward to seeing it. President Trump has done a tremendous job in at least providing some sets of goals for this executive order, but Congress must act and they must act now.BARTIROMO: All right, we'll be watching. Gianno, great to get our insights this morning. Thanks so much. We will see you soon.CALDWELL: Thank you very much (ph).BARTIROMO: Gianno Caldwell joining us there. Stay with us. A lot to come. More mornings with Maria right after this.Welcome back. NBC News controversy. The organization's verification center forced to backtrack after allegedly pushing Google to ban ads on a conservative website. NBC had reported that the technology giant planned to demonetize both Zero Hedge and The Federalists over racist content, but NBC had alerted Google to The Federalist themselves. Google reviewed the issue and stated on Twitter, "The Federalist was never demonetized. We worked with them to address issues on their site related to the comment section. As the comment section has now been removed, we consider this matter resolved and no action will be taken.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST: You have a news organization or in the case of NBC News a so-called new organization trying to essentially shut down another. Think about that for a second. This is activism. It is not journalism. And let's talk about the NBC News, quote, "verification unit", working in coordination with the U.K. Center for Countering Digital Hate, which Federalist co-founder, Sean Davis, describes as a left-wing foreign group to de-platform.This in essence was NBC News trying to prevent The Federalist because of a comment section under certain articles from generating ad revenue. So what is going on here? Sean Davis was one - the co-founder was on Tucker Carlson's show last night and he said this is - I'm paraphrasing. This is a terrifying example of the unholy union of corrupt media and monopolistic tech oligarchs. It raises issues particularly involving a foreign group or organization of is it election interference? That was a hot butting topic four years ago, three years ago, two years ago. Censorship, and is it a violation of the law. And by the way, NBC with this report that The Federalist never got a formal notice from Google, they never got any notice from the advertising team at Google. They learned about it because this NBC News, quote, "reporter," unquote, emailed a general information account at The Federalist that Google was demonetizing them. That's how all this played out -(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Unbelievable.MCDOWELL: -- and I know that you've got information about - from Senator Ted Cruz. This also raises the issues of the liability -(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: That's right.MCDOWELL: -- waiver that Google and all the other giant tech companies have under the 1996 Communications Decency Act where they aren't liable for generated content but no The Federalist is liable for that? Oh, the irony, and the hammer is going to come down from Congress because the right and the left are looking at breaking up these giant tech companies, and it's probably going to come down from the Justice Department, so they all better buckle up.BARTIROMO: Yes, and I'll tell you there was some playing down of the looting that had gone on in the media. Senator Ted Cruz calling on Google to provide communications between the company and NBC. He says he wants it by next week. He wrote a letter to Google and Alphabet CEO, Sundar Pichai, and he writes this. "Google's decision to target The Federalist is transparently politically motivated. Numerous progressive media outlets allow comments. Any objective review would no doubt demonstrate at least as many profane, racist, or indefensible user comments on these other sites.The other thing is The Federalist ahs been really seeking truth. I mean, they were among the most accurate on what to place in terms of the Russia probe. They're reported honestly on really what's going on. Governor Huckabee, do you think the senate is going to be able to hold this company accountable, Google?MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well I hope they can, and if they don't I hope the Justice Department will. I do think antitrust action is going to be needed, but the silliness of this is staggering. I mean, the simple fact is this is like saying to a rival newspaper we don't like the letters to the editor section because somebody wrote something that is offensive to us. That's the whole point of having a comment section. It's the whole reason that you have letters to the editor.The best way to counteract speech you don't like is to invite other speech and let people have a differing point of view, some of which is going to be very offensive. Welcome to America. That's what we're supposed to be about, and the most defensive speech is its own worse enemy because people look at it and say that's awful and we don embrace it. And that's why I find this so revealing but also revealing.MCDOWELL: And by the way, it goes deeper than that.BARTIROMO: It's also quite dangerous. It's dangerous, Dagen.MCDOWELL: Yes, it goes deeper than that - and this is Sean David, again. One of the cofounders along - of The Federalist, along with Ben Domenech. You literally have phony journalists, a phony news organization trying to destroy critics of that very news organization working in cahoots with a tech monopoly. That's what's going on. Very, very dangerous really to our constitutional right, and what are they going to do about to down in Washington?BARTIROMO: Absolutely. That's right. All right, well we'll keep watching this. It is incredibly dangerous. Coming up, addressing trade imbalances. The Trump administration expects it to push forward with plans to renegotiate World Trade Organization tariffs. I'll get reaction from Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross coming up next. Then I'll also get his take on the China tech threat from Huawei. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.

Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: That's right Maria, good morning. Hilton is cutting 2,100 jobs worldwide, or about 22 percent of the workforce following the collapse in travel from the COVID-19 pandemic. Hilton is also extending corporate pay cuts, furloughs and reduced ours for up to three more months. Hilton CEO says this is the first time in the company's 101 year history that a global crisis has virtually halted travel and he's devastated that he had to make this move, but they need to protect the busines. Hilton has more than 6,100 properties in 188 countries and territories. Taking a look a the stock, it is unchanged in the premarket. Down though, about 30 percent this year.Well, beginning today, US Facebook user are going to have the option to completely turn off all political advertising on their feed. After the company announced they would not fact check or moderate the ads. In a post Mark Zuckerberg said for those of you who have already made up your minds and want the election to just, well, be over, we hear you. Facebook also launched a new push to register voters. Users are going to see a voting information center on their feeds. The goal register four million they say. There's the stock in the premarket. It's up about half a percent.Well here's a look at what is trending this morning on foxbusiness.com. Apple is reopening more than 70 stores in the US this week after the coronavirus pandemic forced a mass shutdown in March. Elon Musk says SpaceX is developing offshore floating space ports to launch travel to the Moon, Mars and hypersonic travel. And finally this, NBA players who choose not to play when the season resumes reportedly won't face disciplinary action. They've got until June 24th to decide. And those are your headlines from the newsroom, Maria. Back to you.BARTIROMO: Alright, Cheryl. Thank you so much. Addressing trade imbalances this morning. US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer set to testify before the House Ways and Means Committee later this morning. The USTR reportedly expected to call for a global reset in tariff's as the Trump administration wages battle with the World Trade Organization. Joining me right now is Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. Mister Secretary, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks very much for joining me.WILBUR ROSS, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF COMMERCE: Thank you for having me on, Maria.BARTIROMO: What are you trying to do in terms of tariff's now with the World Trade Organization?ROSS: Well the President has always had the idea that tariff's should be reciprocal. If some country charges us X, we shouldn't only chart them a fraction of that. His real purpose, though, is to bring them down everywhere. So, reciprocal is important, low is important, and I think you'll hear Trade Rep Lighthizer talking about structural reforms to the WTO itself.BARTIROMO: Have you gotten any response on any of this? Do you expect that we will see tariff's go lower across the world?ROSS: Well, it's a very much more complicated story, because every country is a little bit different. But US historically has been, and remains today, the lowest, less protectionist country. And we have the trade deficits to show for it. So, the real problem is getting the other countries to be less protectionist.BARTIROMO: Secretary I want to switch gears, ask about Huawei. We were all very surprised yesterday to learn the news that the Commerce Department is now allowing American companies to work with Chinese telecom giant Huawei on setting 5G standards. Will this normalize, will this move normalize and elevate a company that has ties to the Chinese government we know that this is a state run company. And that there back doors and the data goes back to the Chinese Communist Party. Why the change?ROSS: Well, the change is really simply a clarification. It isn't that we're doing something to help Huawei. What we're doing is something to make it easier for global standards to be symmetrical. If our companies are not allowed to participate in the setting of standards, you'll have the same kind of problem that occurred many years ago when cell phones were early. You couldn't have a cell phone that worked in Japan and also worked in Korea, because they hadn't adopted a common standard. So, the idea of this is to make sure that standards are symmetrical, that they're worldwide and that with 5G, they facilitate the interconnectedness of everything. Every person, everything, every factory, every process, that's the whole idea of 5G. So, this is not anything to help 5G in Huawei, this is to help make sure we have ubiquity in 5G.BARTIROMO: Well, I mean, is there any reason that there should be vulnerabilities here by the use of Huawei and just the work with American companies? Should we be worried that there is a vulnerability and the opportunity to spy, given the Huawei connection?ROSS: Well, we are very opposed to the use of Huawei for 5G, and we've been explaining our purposes to countries all around the world. And they're gradually getting to realize it. There really is a vulnerability with 5G that's much more severe than it had been with 4G, 3G, 2G. So, we think it's very important, as you know, FCC is banning the use of Huawei in this country.BARTIROMO: Yeah.ROSS: Many other countries are limiting the use of it, and the problem with the security issue on Huawei is you'll never really know if there was a back door until they decide to open it, and that's far too late.BARTIROMO: Right, sure. What about this subcommittee of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee? Recently concluding an investigation, Secretary, into four Chinese Communist Party telecom companies for pretty much operating in this country, spying on American telecom companies for a long time, using their access to American carriers to conduct essentially unchecked espionage against the US. How worried are you about these four Chinese telecom companies that apparently have been embedded in US companies for decades?ROSS: Well, as you know, the FCC is taking action against them. And I think that's the correct thing to do. It's clear that one of the reasons that Huawei is so aggressive in its pricing is that it has motives, perhaps other than just providing commercial service. That's what we have great concern about. And that's what FCC is dealing with. You look at Huawei is under Federal indictment for several serious offenses, that's why the CEO's daughter, who is also the Chief Financial Officer, has been under house arrest in Canada, for well over a year, because she's trying to fight extradition to the United States, so she can be tried.BARTIROMO: Yeah.ROSS: Among the things she is being charged with is bank fraud.BARTIROMO: Well, you, I know this administration has been very tough and severe on this issue, but these companies, I'm talking China Mobile, China Telecom, China Unicom and ComNet. Three of those are actually traded on the New York Stock Exchange. So, I mean, some people have made the case that we're actually paying the CCP to spy on us, given that they're raising dollars, they're raising funding by being listed on our exchanges, and yet, their business is to spy on American companies.ROSS: Well, where stock is traded has very little to do with these other issues. But the President has directed the government to look into the accounting procedures that Chinese companies use, because many of us feel that those procedures are not adequate, they're not adequate to protect American investors.BARTIROMO: Okay.ROSS: Their whole concepts of auditing and financial principals in accounting are not the same as ours, so that's a whole separate issue, but the spying is a very real issue.BARTIROMO: Absolutely.ROSS: Very real issue.BARTIROMO: It's a real issue. Yeah, I mean that's why I want to make sure to communicate it, because our audience needs to know this. Real quick before we go. Let me squeeze in this question about potential $1 trillion dollar infrastructure package being spoken about by the administration in an effort to boost the economy. 5G wireless infrastructure would be part of that package. Is this something the administration is considering?ROSS: Well, President Trump, way back in the campaign days was very much in favor of big infrastructure bill. We've already taken many measures to reduce the time it takes to get an infrastructure project approved. It had been where it could take 10 years to get the approvals in themselves. It had been where it could cost almost 40 percent of the total project just for consultant fees, lawyer fees, things like that. We've gotten rid of a lot of that regulatory morass. Now what we need is funding to do a very significant program for infrastructure. We need rural broadband. We need our airports to be fixed. We need our highways to be fixed. We need our ports.BARTIROMO: Yeah.ROSS: We need our water infrastructure. We need our electrical grids.BARTIROMO: Might we see that this year? Will we see that this year Secretary?ROSS: Well, we'll see. It all depends on whether the Congress can get together and decide what activities, how many dollars, how to pay for it, and whether to just keep it a pure infrastructure bill, which is what the Senate wants, or whether they're going to load it up a bunch of goodies, which is what the initial draft from the House said.BARTIROMO: Sure. Yes, we understand. Secretary, it's good to see you this morning. Thank you so much. We will keep following all of that.ROSS: Thank you Maria. Good to be here.BARTIROMO: Very important conversation. We'll see you soon. Have a good day. Secretary Wilbur Ross. Stay with us, we'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A possible game changer in the fight against coronavirus. A new study shows the inexpensive steroid Dexamethasone can reduce death rates by 1/3 for the most seriously ill patients. Joining us right now is family medicine doctor Mikhail Varshavski, aka, Doctor Mike. Doctor Mike, great to have you. Scientists are calling this a major breakthrough, is it?DOCTOR MIKHAIL VARSHAVSKI, FAMILY MEDICINE DOCTOR: Good morning Maria, thank you so much for having me. I think this is a potential huge deal. It's not going to be a cure. It is going to be a very very helpful treatment for those who are on ventilators or on supplemental oxygen. That's where we've seen the biggest benefit in this study. However, Maria, I do have to say that I approach this with a bit of skepticism. At least healthy skepticism, because, I have not seen the full study. None of us has seen the full study. We're getting all this information essentially from press releases by the authors of the study and I'm inclined to trust them, but we have seen in the past few weeks studies coming out, at least preliminary reports to these studies, that were promising, but once the actual studies were released in peer reviewed journal, we found that they weren't exactly as promised. So, I will hold completely until I see the full study published in the coming weeks.BARTIROMO: Do you know if the drug has been used to treat COVID-19 patients in the United States yet?VARSHAVSKI: Yes, Maria. So, Dexamethasone is a commonly used steroid, both oral and IV, and we use it in several cases, not just in COVID-19 where we have a lot of inflammation going on inside a patient's body. Think sepsis, when you have an infection that potentially starts as a pneumonia and then starts spreading throughout the body through the blood. We use Dexamthasone in these cases. I know several ICU physicians who've used Dexamethasone in COVID-19 cases specifically, in fact one of the spokespeople for Northwell Health, which is one of the biggest providers here in New York, said that they've been using this medicine. So, it's not something that's foreign to physicians, but it's nice to have quality evidence to back up that type of treatment.BARTIROMO: Yeah, really good Op-ed in the Journal this morning from the Vice President that there is no second wave of the coronavirus. He's talking about 23 million tests being taken already, and that we're in a much better shape, much better place than we were just four months ago. Worth a read there. Doctor Mike, it's good to see you this morning sir. Thanks so much. We will see you soon. Mike Varshavski. Stay with us, we'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Time for the morning buzz. First up, don't stand too close. Amazon reportedly testing a new wearable device int it's fulfilment centers to tell workers when they are not social distancing. The clear plastic sleeve has a flashing light and flashing lights and beeping alerts to tell you to move farther away from somebody. Governor Huckabee, what do you think?HUCKABEE: I love it. I want to get one. I don't want to work in an Amazon warehouse. It's not that. But I would just like to wear one so that if somebody comes up and wants to be close talker, the alarm goes off. If somebody wants to mug me, the alarm goes off. I think this is great. Everybody ought to have one. It could change the world. It could be a lot of fun watching people step back when they've gotten too close, so way to go Amazon. Another great product.BARTIROMO: Alright, next up, a new look for Tom Brady. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers releasing the first look at the famed quarterback in his new uniform. There he is. Brady joining the team after spending the first 20 seasons of his career with the New England Patriots. Nice uniform Dagen, what do you think?MCDOWELL: I'm very happy for Tampa Bay. It will give, lift people's spirits down in that beautiful part of Florida, but if that's a white jersey, the other color, Florida is really steamy, I would say, well, 12 months out of the year, and you wear those dark colors out in the hot summer Florida sun, or even the winter sun. Man, watch out.BARTIROMO: It's hot. Finally this, Boston Dynamics putting its four legged Spot robot up for sale. It's one of the business in the United States. This robot is used mostly for surveying and data collection but could be used for other tasks as well. Spot comes at price tag of $74,000, roughly the same cost as a Tesla model S, Alli, what do you think?MCCARTNEY: I think I'll take two as long as it'll help me clean my house during this quarantine pandemic.BARTIROMO: You need spot.MCCARTNEY: Yes. I need lots of spots. Help me with my kids, my work, everything.MCDOWELL: It's called a Rumba Alli. You've got to buy a Rumba. You don't have a Rumba or like eight Rumba's roaming around your house, come on.BARTIROMO: Rumba. I've seen that Rumba, but no, I don't have that either. So, I'm with you.MCDOWELL: If you've got dogs, they will freak out.MCCARTNEY: I have a dog. I've got a puppy and a blind dog. So, it feels like we have a Rumba all the time.BARTIROMO: There you go. Still ahead, I'll speak with Georgia Congressman, House Judiciary Committee Member Doug Collins, he's up, coming up on the politization of the Justice Department, next hour, Morning with Maria right here, stay with us.Load-Date: June 17, 2020End of Document

Trump puts Bolsonaro in an awkward place against China, its main trading partner, by HuaweiCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 29, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 398 wordsBodyThe U.S. government on Wednesday lobbied Jair Bolsonaro's executive in Brazil on Wednesday warning that the country will suffer "consequences," such as the loss of investors, if it opts for Chinese telecommunications company Huawei to install the 5Gnetwork.In an interview published by the newspaper O Globo, U.S. Ambassador Todd Chapman was categorical. "Iwouldn't say retaliation, consequences yes,"he responded when questioned about brazil's sanctions should he allow the use of Huawei material, accused by Donald Trump's administration of serving the spying of the Chinese Communist government."Each country is responsible for its decisions. The consequences we are seeing in the world are that of misgivings from IP-based companies in countries where that property is not protected," he added."Atany time, the Chinese government can ask Huawei to send you the information"in the countries where it was implanted," Chapman warned."By investing, you decide where. Whoever invests in drugs, in software, observes that. Our economy is service-based. America's biggest export is intelligence, intellectual property. We have to protect our intellectual property," the diplomat insisted.The award of the fifth generation of mobile technology (5G) was to be made this year in Brazil, which will be one of its main markets, but was postponed by Bolsonaro due to the coronavirus pandemic.The network's deployment became an important chapter in the China-U.S. trade war, Brazil's first and second trading partner respectively. It has even had its chapter in other latitudes, as was the case in the UNITED Kingdom where Boris Johnson'sexecutive, following pressure from Washington, rectified and banned Huawei's participation in its 5G.When the tender is made, scheduled for 2021, the Government of Bolsonaro, a Trump ally - of whom the Brazilian president declared himself a fan - must opt for China's Huawei or its rivals, including European Ericsson and Nokia,supported by Washington.Chapman stressed that he does not see the issue as a trade issue. "We don't even have an American company on the bid. It's a matter of national security," he emphasized.As another pressure mechanism, he added that the United States would be willing to provide financing to Brazil for the 5G facility, through the International Development Finance Corporation, to "whoever buys products from reliable suppliers."Load-Date: July 30, 2020End of Document

The move marked "the first time the Chinese government's state security apparatus has been permitted to operate in Hong Kong, marking a milestone in officials' efforts to dismantle the firewall that separated the city from the authoritarian mainland." The Wall Street Journal (7/8, Strumpf, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) says the swift arrival of China's secret police highlights how quickly Hong Kong is changing.Hong Kong Bans Protest Song, Other Political Expression In Schools.The New York Times (7/8, Mullany, 18.61M) reports Hong Kong's education secretary on Wednesday "banned students from singing the protest anthem 'Glory to Hong Kong,' posting slogans with political messages or forming human chains, saying 'the schools are obliged to stop' such activities." To the Times, the statement by Secretary Kevin Yeung "ratcheted up the pressure on the pro-democracy movement."WSJournal: US Should Not Weaponize Dollar To Undermine Hong Kong Currency.A Wall Street Journal (7/8, Board, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) editorial argues that while the Administration is mulling its response to China's actions in Hong Kong, one idea should not be under consideration: weaponizing the US dollar to undermine Hong Kong's currency.Load-Date: July 9, 2020End of Document

Police corral crowds as movers leave US Consulate in ChinaAssociated Press State & LocalJuly 26, 2020 Sunday 11:08 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWS; POLITICAL NEWS; STATE AND REGIONALLength: 377 wordsByline: SAM McNEIL, Associated PressDateline: CHENGDU, China BodyCHENGDU, China (AP) — Moving trucks and vehicles with diplomatic plates pulled out of a U.S. Consulate in southwest China on Sunday, as its impending closure over rising bilateral tensions drew a steady stream of onlookers for the second straight day.People stopped to take selfies and photos, jamming a sidewalk busy with shoppers and families with strollers on a sunny day in the city of Chengdu. A little boy posed with a small Chinese flag before plainclothes police shooed him away as foreign media cameras zoomed in.The capital of Sichuan province, along with Houston in Texas, has found itself in the limelight of international politics as China and the U.S. exchanged tit-for-tat orders last week to close each other's consulates in the two heartland cities.Police in Chengdu have shut the street and sidewalk in front of the consulate and set up metal barriers along the sidewalk on the other side of the tree-lined road.Uniformed and plainclothes officers kept watch on both sides of the barriers after scattered incidents following the Chengdu announcement on Friday, including a man who set off firecrackers and hecklers who cursed at foreign media shooting video and photos of the scene.A man who tired to unfurl a banner or sign late Sunday that he called an open letter to the Chinese government was quickly taken away.Earlier, a bus left the consulate grounds and what appeared to be embassy staff spoke with plainclothes police before retreating back behind the property's solid black gates. It wasn’t clear who or what was on the bus.Three medium-size trucks arrived and left a few hours later, and cars with diplomatic plates departed in between.China ordered the closing of the Chengdu consulate in retaliation for a U.S. order earlier in the week to close the Chinese Consulate in Houston.The U.S. alleged that the Houston consulate was a nest of Chinese spies who tried to steal data from facilities in Texas, including the Texas A&M medical system and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. China said the allegations were “malicious slander.”The consulate closings were a significant escalation in the tensions between the two countries over a range of issues, including trade, technology, security and human rights.Load-Date: July 26, 2020End of Document

WRIGHT IN WASHINGTON TIMES: STOPPING CHINA'S TRAVEL ESPIONAGE IN ITS TRACKSStates News ServiceJune 26, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 889 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, D.C. BodyThe following information was released by the office of Texas Rep. Ron Wright:Congressman Ron Wright penned an op-ed in the Washington Times regarding the importance of passing the bipartisan AIR Security Act. Click here and see below for his piece.Washington Times: Rep. Ron Wright: Stopping China's travel espionage in its tracksJune 25, 2020Although many Americans continue to see Russia as the United States' greatest foreign policy challenge, I believe the Communist Party of China (CCP) poses a far greater threat to our national security in the long run. Over the last decade, the Chinese government has ramped up its espionage efforts, predatory economic practices and strategic technology development in an attempt to directly challenge America's status as a global superpower.The United States has sounded the alarm on China's Belt and Road Initiative investments in Africa, Southeast Asia and Europe, but we have largely turned a blind eye to China's nefarious activities in our own backyard. Congress enacted important enhancements to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) and our export controls in 2018, but we must do more to prevent China from infiltrating our critical infrastructure systems and supply chains.To get a better sense of the seriousness of this threat, look no further than the disastrous impact of allowing the China Railway Rolling Stock Corp. (CRRC) to enter the U.S. market. CRRC, which has used its CCP financial backing to become the world's largest rail-car producer, has been undercutting other passenger and freight rail-car manufacturers with unfairly low bids for projects across the United States.Beyond making it impossible for American and other companies to compete, CRRC's infiltration of our rail transportation infrastructure comes with serious counterintelligence and privacy consequences given the high-tech nature of new rail cars.What's worse is that many of the transit agencies were using taxpayer dollars to do business with the CRRC, meaning we were subsidizing the CCP's efforts to spy on us and put American companies out of business. Thankfully, lawmakers took note and passed legislation prohibiting the use of federal funds for the purchase of rail cars and buses from CCP-owned, controlled or subsidized companies and requiring transit agencies to adhere to cybersecurity guidelines in future procurements.Unfortunately, the CCP is not just targeting our rail infrastructure, but has also turned its focus to our aviation industry. Over the past few years, CIMC-Tianda, a Chinese-owned company convicted of industrial espionage in federal court, has repeatedly tried to partner with major U.S. transportation hubs, including Houston, Dallas, Miami and Boston, to sell its airplane passenger boarding bridges.Like rail cars, passenger boarding bridges increasingly feature technologies, such as facial recognition, with serious national security implications that necessitate greater scrutiny of foreign investment. Furthermore, if we allow CIMC-Tianda into our aviation supply chain, we can be sure that, like CRRC, they will undercut domestic producers at every turn in hopes that these American companies will eventually be forced to close shop.With Americans, domestic companies and major airports at risk, I teamed up with my fellow Texans, Sen. John Cornyn and Rep. Marc Veasey, to introduce the Airport Infrastructure Resources (AIR) Security Act. This critical legislation will ensure our hard-earned taxpayer dollars are not used to purchase passenger boarding bridges from companies that have previously violated intellectual property (IP) rights, as nearly all CCP-affiliated companies have, and are simply looking for yet another opportunity to put American companies out of business and steal from and spy on the American people.If anything, the COVID-19 pandemic has called attention to China's relentlessness and the need for America to secure its supply chains and critical infrastructure. On top of downplaying the severity of the virus, CCP leaders instituted new policies that restricted companies, such as 3M and Honeywell, from distributing much needed personal protective equipment (PPE) to the United States without prior approval. Chinese officials used these policies to hoard respirators, masks, gloves and other PPE equipment, all while putting on a facade of global unity.As we continue to integrate technology into our infrastructure, we must be wary of and resilient against attempts by China to infiltrate critical systems and carry out espionage and IP theft. After the last few months, we would be fools to think the CCP would not weaponize access to our critical infrastructure against us. We simply cannot afford for China to dominate our transportation supply chains the way we have empowered it to control PPE and pharmaceutical ingredients.Given the financial uncertainty facing many industries and risk that struggling American companies will be snapped up by opportunistic Chinese ones, I believe we must be especially vigilant. I applaud the president for his recent executive order, which will further protect the United States from IP and technology theft. Nevertheless, we must continue to implement additional safeguards in the months to come. Passing the AIR Security Act would a good place to start.Load-Date: June 26, 2020End of Document

He said the new measure was a gross interference by the United Kingdom in Chinese internal affairs.Pompeo called the talks in London "constructive" and "frank," saying they covered "from 5G telecommunication to our negotiations for a bilateral free trade agreement."Pompeo will meet with Johnson Conservative Party leaders who blocked plans to give Chinese telecoms company Huawei an important role in the new high-speed telephone network.The United States has pressured its allies to marginalize Huawei, because it argues that the Chinese government could use the technology to spy on Western nations. Huawei rejects the accusations and accuses Washington of seeding protectionist measures.Britain, along with the United States, Australia and Canada, suspended extradition agreements with Hong Kong, which became a special administrative region of China when the United Kingdom handed over control of the territory to Beijing in 1997.Load-Date: July 22, 2020End of Document

Tesla downgrades deposit for Customers in China to just $143CE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 22, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 222 wordsBody(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. has cut down the deposit that customers in China have to pay to buy their cars, in order to maintain the momentum of sales in the face of intensified competition and cuts in government subsidies for electric vehicles.Tesla now requires a 1,000 yuan (US$143) non-refundable deposit for the Model 3 sedan, the Model X SUV as well as the Model S, said a company representative in China on Wednesday. Previously, buyers were asked to pay a refundable deposit of up to 20,000 yuan.The U.S. company has expanded its advantage in China's electric vehicle market in recent months, but competition is intensifying. Chinese electric vehicle company NIO Inc. has received a capital injection from a regional government and a new line of credit from six banks, while other global competitors such as BMW AG and Daimler AG, the Mercedes-Benz manufacturer, are removing new models.The cut in deposits coincides with china's most recent reduction in subsidies for electric cars, a move that to all effects raises the price of some vehicles. Tesla lowered the price of its basic model 3 manufactured locally in April to meet the strictest subsidy criteria, but some of its models can no longer receive aid from the Chinese government.Original Note:Tesla Slashes Deposit for China Customers to Just $143©2020 Bloomberg L.P.Load-Date: July 23, 2020End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 27 of 305Twitter closed thousands of accounts linked to China, Turkey and Russia regimes used to make disinformation propaganda  Page 29 of 305US CYBERFIRM SAYS VATICAN TARGET OF CHINESE HACKERS, NY TIMES REPORTS  Page 31 of 305Chinese press did not mention the military confrontation that left at least 20 Indian soldiers dead  Page 33 of 305U.S. accuses Chinese 'hackers' of stealing information about Vaccines against Covid-19  Page 35 of 305US: Chinese hackers attacked vaccine developers  Page 39 of 305China hawks eye a new target: Airport jet bridges  Page 41 of 305U.S. state official testifies China is working to steal U.S. COVID-19 technologies  Page 57 of 305Hogan Gidley is Interviewed About The Barr Hearing And a Stimulus Plan; New York's Real Estate Market, Stimulus Battle; Interview with Sen.
