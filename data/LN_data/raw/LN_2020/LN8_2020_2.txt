U.S. opens new fronts in China lobbying strategyCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 7, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 838 wordsBodyNew York, 7 Aug (EFE).- The U.S. on Friday moved its lobbying strategy to China, with sanctions on Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam and warnings about Chinese naval movements near Taiwan, thus widening tensions following the threat of banning the popular Chinese-capital TikTok and WeChat applications declared a danger to national security.The Treasury Department today sanctioned eleven senior Hong Kong government officials, including Lam, the chief executive, whom it pointed out to an unprecedented extent for "implementing Beijing's policies of the suppression of freedoms and the democratic process," especially after adopting China's national security law, which allows for the suppression of independence expressions and contrary to the communist regime.This step is an increase in pressures against China by the Donald Trump Administration, which on Thursday gave 45 days to the popular social video app TikTok and the messaging service WeChat, owned by China's ByteDance and Tencent, respectively, to disassociate the property from their matrix and move on to have American capital or face their total ban.Trump signed Thursday night an unprecedented executive order banning the operations of TikTok, which has undergone a meteoric rise in the country to 100 million users, and of the lesser-known WeChat, the "Chinese WhatsApp," which has been noted on numerous occasions, both by intelligence services and by independent organizations, to assist in censorship operations of the Chinese regime."Like TikTok, WeChat automatically collects large amounts of data from its users. This data collection threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to personal data and owned by Americans," explains the executive order, which in the case of WeChat adds that it can be used to spy on Chinese citizens visiting the U.S. "and enjoy the benefits of a free society for the first time in their lives."TIKTOK, THE GIANTThe case of TikTok, whose value could end up exceeding $30 billion, may create a dangerous precedent for the internet industry, as its popularity in the United States is similar to that of Instagram or higher than that of Twitter and the company, acquired by China's ByteDance in 2017, has taken steps to assure regulators that it respects privacy laws and is not intervened by the Chinese government.Microsoft is negotiating to purchase TikTok, whose bulk of app activity and base of operations is in the U.S., before the end of Washington's 45-day deadline, which has threatened to take hold of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to force TikTok out."There is no security justification for banning an app merely because it is owned by a Chinese company. Allegations of security risk must be supported by evidence. U.S. tech companies could end up losing significant global market share if other countries follow the same path and decide to block U.S. tech companies," the Washington-based Information Technology and Innovation Foundation said today.In his order, Trump argues that both apps are a threat to national security and are exposed to pressure and collaborating with the Chinese Communist Party (PCCh), which THE head of American diplomacy, Mike Pompeo, turned the target of all of Washington's anger into a tough speech last month.That intervention, which Pompeo made shortly after forcing the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston, Texas, for industrial espionage, formed a new frameworkfor itself complicated bilateral relations with Beijing in which he called for the international isolation of the PCCh, which he claimed was making the same mistakes of the Soviet Union during the "Cold War."MULTIPLE PROVOCATIONSPentagon chief Mark Esper on Thursday called his Chinese counterpart, National Defense Minister Wei Fenghe, to convey his concern about "destabilizing" movements near taiwan waters and in the South China Sea, where Beijing maintains expansionist ambitions.For an hour and a half, both attempted to call for containment and dialogue, and, as a Pentagon spokesman pointed out today, Esper called for more transparency and information on sarS-CoV-2 coronavirus, detected and isolated for the first time in Wuhan, China.In recent months, China has increased its military activity in Taiwan's neighborhood, prompting complaints from the island's authorities, whose sovereignty Beijing claims.The United States has not contributed to a de-escalating, announcing that Health Secretary Alex Azar will visit Taiwan this weekend, representing a highest-level visit since 1979 by an American politician to the island.Azar's visit also has the COVID-19 pandemic as a backdrop and the repeated statements of President Trump, who blames China for not containing the new coronavirus and ultimately responsible for the nearly 160,000 deaths that have been spent in the United States.In addition, Washington last year approved the $2 billion sale of military equipment to Taipei, something that angered the Asian giant, which threatened to impose sanctions.Jairo MejíaLoad-Date: August 8, 2020End of Document

Trump's actual goal is to ban TikTok, ByteDance CEO saysCNN WireAugust 4, 2020 Tuesday 1:33 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 396 wordsDateline: LONDON (CNN Business) BodyLONDON (CNN Business) --  The Trump administration wants to ban TikTok, the CEO of the popular app's parent company wrote in a memo to employees Tuesday.Zhang Yiming said it "feels like" the US government's goal is "not necessarily a forced sale" of TikTok, "but given the current macro situation, a ban or even more," according to a translation of the memo sent to China-based employees provided by the company. Microsoft has confirmed it is in talks to buy TikTok from ByteDance after President Donald Trump said he was looking to ban the app. Trump said he is giving the two companies until September 15 to strike a deal, otherwise he'll go forward with a ban. US government officials have repeatedly expressed concern that TikTok could pose a threat to national security should the data it collects on its American users end up in the hands of the Chinese government. Under Chinese law, companies can be compelled to comply with government requests. TikTok, though, has said it stores its data outside of China and that it would resist any attempts by Beijing to seize the information.Zhang did not directly address the talks with Microsoft, instead focusing on thanking employees for enduring a wave of criticism he and the company had received on social media in recent days. "Many people are angered by some of the actions of the current US government, and this results in a lot of personal criticism of me. However, many people misunderstand the current, complex situation," he wrote. Addressing what he called anti-Chinese sentiment, Zhang went on to say employees should know that the company has to accept "misperceptions in the market, and we have to be patient and not let short-term frustrations get in the way of our long-term success." "In countries, such as the United States, in the current environment some politicians have forcefully attacked China, and in turn, Chinese companies, making it difficult to have a thoughtful and nuanced conversation about complex situations," he wrote.He urged employees to continue to focus on improving the app, embrace transparency and protect customers' security."This helps us win trust around the world with users, and also helps people better understand our complex and unique story as a global company with Chinese founders," Zhang wrote. TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

American Action Forum: New Executive Order Starts the Clock on Potential TikTok BanTargeted News ServiceAugust 8, 2020 Saturday 1:17 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1500 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe American Action Forum issued the following news release:Last night President Trump signed executive orders that will prohibit any U.S. person or company from transacting with the parent companies of the popular apps TikTok and WeChat in 45 days, effectively banning their use in the United States. While consumers should be cognizant of these apps' ties to China and the data collection practices they use, potential national security risks could have been alleviated in more targeted ways, contends AAF's Director of Technology and Innovation Policy Jennifer Huddleston. Banning an app via executive order has the potential to splinter the internet and to set concerning precedent for government action in this market, she argues.An excerpt:* The latest executive order attempts to respond to concerns about national security. Consumers should carefully consider if they are comfortable with the unique risks involved with TikTok when choosing whether to use the app. Nevertheless, a more targeted policy approach would be better than a complete ban. Such an approach would balance the potential national security risks while continuing the competitive approach to technology that has allowed innovation to flourish and new entrants to compete with existing tech giants.* * *InsightAugust 7, 2020New Executive Order Starts the Clock on Potential TikTok BanJennifer HuddlestonExecutive summary* New executive orders from President Trump would ban any U.S. person or company from transacting with Chinese company ByteDance (including its popular social media product TikTok) and Tencent (the company behind chat app WeChat).* While consumers should be aware of the ties to China and the data collection practices of the social media they use, there are less severe ways to resolve national security concerns surrounding TikTok.* Banning an app via executive order is novel in the United States, and this move could splinter the internet and set concerning precedent for government action in this market.AnalysisLast night, President Donald Trump signed executive orders that would ban Americans and American companies from transacting with Chinese technology companies Tencent (aimed at the app WeChat) and ByteDance, including the increasingly popular app TikTok, in 45 days. These orders would effectively ban the use of these apps in the United States. To do so, these executive orders invoke authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and state that additional steps must be taken to deal with the "national emergency" posed by these apps. This action follows many statements by President Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and members of Congress about the potential national security risks posed by TikTok. These potential risks could have been alleviated in more targeted ways, however.Over the past few months, TikTok has become an increasingly popular social media platform particularly with teenagers and young adults. Currently the app is the sixth largest social network and the most downloaded app of 2020. But as its popularity has grown, so have concerns about the app's ties to China and whether the data of its American users could be accessible to the Chinese government.The exact risk of TikTok data being made available to China is not known. Because its parent company ByteDance is based in China, many have expressed concerns that the Chinese Communist Party would be able to pressure the company to turn over user data including information on American users, based on China's National Intelligence Law. This scenario is highly concerning given the Chinese government's use of data to limit and control its own citizens as well as the risk of what information the Chinese government might be able to obtain from other parts of the world via user data. These data include information about a user's device, network, and location as well as the photos and other information contained in the content uploaded. As TechFreedom's Ashkhen Kazaryan wrote, "We should call a spade a spade: TikTok is a Chinese company, and its track record and immense data collection presents a danger to Americans and democracy. We know what it does with data collection in its own country--it violates human rights in part by operating a mass censorship and surveillance apparatus against its own people."TikTok has attempted to distinguish itself from its parent company to alleviate some of these concerns. Both TikTok and parent company ByteDance have said that they are not providing data to the Chinese government and would not comply with such requests. But other actions give more validation to national security concerns. For example, in a recent class action lawsuit, the company argued that while it is currently not sending biometric data on its users to servers in China, it could transfer any of its data to its servers in Beijing at any time without violating the law. Such actions would make this data more vulnerable to request from the Chinese government. And while the company shut down its Hong Kong operations rather than comply with China's new data collection and national security law for the city, its content moderation practices block conversation on numerous topics offensive to the Chinese Communist Party including suspending the account of a U.S. teenager who criticized the Chinese government's treatment of Uighur Muslims .But there are many ways that policymakers could address these concerns without completely banning the app. For example, both the Army and the Navy banned the use of the app on government-issued devices in late 2019 over these security concerns. Earlier this week, the Senate unanimously passed legislation that would ban the app from all government devices. These more targeted approaches can minimize the national security concerns until more information is known about the actual risks of data being accessed by China or until changes to the company structure might alleviate these concerns. Such actions would be aligned with the response to similar security concerns regarding Huawei. Private companies could take similar actions to protect their own networks and data if they felt the current security risks posed by TikTok were serious enough.Recently it has been indicated that Microsoft would be acquiring at least certain elements of TikTok's operations and allow the app to still be available to American users. This transaction might alleviate many of the national security concerns, but it is not a clear cut or easy answer. Microsoft would only acquire a regional portion (including the United States) of the social network, and it is unclear how that division would impact interactions with other portions (including Europe) and the feasibility of such a split. It is also unclear if this division would exacerbate concerns over the balkanization of the internet as countries decide to ban or allow specific apps or practices. Furthermore, this could result in effectively de facto data localization requirements and their unintended consequences if to continue operations such apps are not only prohibited from storing data in Beijing but face farther requirements. splintering of the internet as countries decide to ban or allow specific apps or practices. Furthermore, to enforce such a split could result in de facto data localization requirements and their unintended consequences if, to continue operations, such apps are not only prohibited from storing data in Beijing but face further requirements regarding their data storage.The effects of a TikTok ban may extend far beyond just the app itself. Overly broad responses such as a complete ban on Americans using the app could call into question America's hands-off approach to technology that has allowed a free market to flourish. As Axios reporter Scott Rosenberg notes, a TikTok ban could undercut reputational advantages and "squander the U.S.'s high ground as a champion of fair markets and networks." The Electronic Freedom Foundation argues a ban on TikTok and WeChat has potential First Amendment concerns for both the users and the app stores on which it is distributed. And following other executive orders and statements, such an action increases concerns about the degree to which the government is seeking to intervene in social media.The latest executive order attempts to respond to concerns about national security. Consumers should carefully consider if they are comfortable with the unique risks involved with TikTok when choosing whether to use the app. Nevertheless, a more targeted policy approach would be better than a complete ban.

Too big, too invasive," Trump said, approving Microsoft's talks with ByteDance.Used by about a billion people around the world to make 60-second videos on their cell phones, TikTok is the latest front in the political and trade battles between Washington and Beijing that have marked the Trump administration.While the company denies that its users' data is handed over to the Chinese government, ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming acknowledged Monday being under pressure and noted that they work 24 hours a day "to get the best possible exit.""We are always committed to ensuring the security of user data as well as the neutrality and transparency of the platform," Zhang told employees in an internal statement, according to Chinese media.However, he said, TikTok faces "increasing complexities across the geopolitical landscape and significant external pressure."And he noted that the company must face the challenge of the U.S. and Trump security forces, though "without giving up exploring any possibility."As a possible alternative measure, ByteDance plans to move TikTok's global operations to the UK, The Sun reported Monday.Also on Monday, China's Foreign Ministry rejected U.S. pressure,calling Washington a hypocrite for demanding the sale of TikTok."The United States is using an abusive concept of national security and, without providing any evidence,is making presumptions of guilt and issuing threats to relevant companies," said spokesman Wang Wenbin."This goes against the principle of the market economy and exposes the hypocrisy and double standards typical of the United States in defending so-called fairness and freedom," he added.Very popular with the world's youth, Tiktok allows users to create and share videos of up to a minute, often funny but also serious and even artistic.TikTok denies being a tool for Chinese intelligence and says that the data of its international users is kept on servers outside China.But Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday that the information companies like TikTok are getting about Americans "could be their facial recognition pattern; information about your residence, your phone numbers, your friends, who you're connected to."On Monday, Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer said on Twitter that "an American company should buy TikTok so thateveryone can continue to use it and their data is safe.""With TikTok in China, it is subject to chinese Communist Party laws that may require the delivery of data to your government. A safe way must be found for TikTok to continue" operating in the United States, he said.From the White House, Trump said he preferred a "very American" company to buy all of TikTok, rather than just a large stake.But he also said that some of the money involved in that deal should go to the U.S. Treasury for making it possible.Trump said last week that he would ban the app,which caused great concern among users in the United States, especially content creators making money on the platform.Many have posted links to their Instagram or YouTube accounts to avoid losing followers if TikTok eventually crashes.Source: AFPLoad-Date: August 5, 2020End of Document

Meet The Politician Who Lives on TikTokPolitico.comAugust 14, 2020 Friday 9:44 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 1405 wordsHighlight: Minnesota state Sen. Matt Little has built a national Gen Z following by embracing the app that other politicians shun.BodyWhen reports began surfacing that President Donald Trump's plans to ban the video app TikTok wouldn't go into effect immediately, Minnesota State Sen. Matt Little responded in typical fashion - by lip-syncing along to DJ Khaled's 2010 hit "All I Do Is Win" in a TikTok video.The 35-year-old Little is a rarity: A politician who fully embraces the Chinese-owned social media site, which is taboo to many in Washington because of concerns that it could be used as a data-collecting tool for the Chinese government.Unafraid to look goofy, the tousle-haired Little leads a tiny cadre of politicians, almost all Democrats, who have defied calls for a ban and used the app to reach young voters.The best-known by far is Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey, who is in the race of his life against an opponent three and a half decades his junior, Rep. Joe Kennedy III. Though Markey is one of the Senate's most prominent voices on tech issues, the footprint of his official account is small - just under 9,000 followers. By contrast, Little has more than 140,000, making him, according to a POLITICO analysis, easily the most followed American politician active on the hugely popular app.For the handful of politicians who've embraced it, TikTok fills a couple of important voids. For one, it's among the few vehicles guaranteed to attract one of the most elusive demographics - Generation Z, the very youngest voters. And at a time when Covid-19 makes door-to-door connections unlikely, Markey's campaign manager John Walsh sees it as a way to connect directly, and informally, to voters.A Markey video shows the septuagenarian senator in khakis draining free-throws on a basketball court while a speech extolling the virtues of the Green New Deal plays in the background. The campaign says the hashtag #edmarkey has reached over 800,000 people on the app."We go where people are, and young people are there," Walsh said of the app. "It's a bunch of teenagers and a 74-year-old United States senator."Both Little and the Markey campaign downplayed any concerns about TikTok presenting a national security risk."Ed Markey recognizes that TikTok as a platform is far from perfect when it comes to privacy and he has called for the Federal Trade Commission to increase its attention to the dangers that minors encounter online, including the use of their personal data for advertising dollars," Paul Bologna, Markey's digital and creative director, said in a statement in response to questions over the app's security concerns.Little put it this way: "I think TikTok's getting singled out because it's been the younger generation's tool for politics," he said, citing other popular Chinese-based apps like gaming app PUBG that don't receive similar attention."If they want to see my Google Maps running back and forth to the Capitol or going out campaigning, they can see that," Little added, noting he uses the app on his personal phone and not on any government property.But most politicians, across party lines, are far more skittish - shunning TikTok almost entirely. Markey posted a video touting the endorsement of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), but Ocasio-Cortez herself, though known for her social-media savvy and her 6 million Instagram followers, does not post on TikTok.In March, Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.) authored legislation that would ban TikTok from the phones of TSA workers. She said in a statement that lawmakers using TikTok concern her, as politicians can be the target of intelligence operations and their accounts can inadvertently send the message that the app is "completely harmless.""When it comes to cybersecurity and protecting the privacy and data of the American people, our government - including elected officials - should set an example for the public," Spanberger, a former CIA officer, said. "As representatives, we should always be looking for ways to communicate with our constituents, but we cannot lose sight of risks associated with certain tools, especially when they can be manipulated by foreign adversaries."The issue has also struck a chord among GOP lawmakers wary of Chinese influence on American lives. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), the most outspoken TikTok critic in Congress, labeled TikTok "a surveillance apparatus for Beijing" and "a Trojan horse" in a statement.Hawley has co-authored legislation with Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) that would further ban the Chinese-owned app from the phones of government employees - a measure the Senate passed on August. The Missouri Republican also wrote a letter with Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) urging the Justice Department to open an investigation into the social media platform."TikTok not only captures the videos that you upload, but it also monitors your keystrokes, what websites you visit, your contact list - all when it's just running in the background," Hawley said in a statement. "Not only does TikTok scoop up that data, but its parent company ByteDance is based in China where Chinese law requires companies to share sensitive data with the Chinese Communist Party."TikTok officials dispute the notion that the app represents anything more nefarious than any other social-media site, arguing TikTok is unfairly targeted due to its Chinese origins. They say they follow U.S. law and point to their pledge to employ thousands of Americans as evidence of TikTok's role as "responsible and committed members of the American community."Meanwhile, millions of American teenagers and young adults have flocked to the social media app, sharing short videos, dancing along to hit songs and circulating viral memes. A 2018 analysis found 41 percent of the app's users are 16 to 24 years old, and TikTok's popularity has only ballooned in years since.TikTok prioritizes authenticity, something young voters often find in short supply among politicians, and so succeeding on TikTok can be like breaking a complicated code. That's why Little, for one, insists that it's such a valuable tool.He launched his TikTok account in January, aiming to gain 2,000 followers. Now, the state lawmaker - a lawyer and former union official who was little known outside his district of around 80,000 south of the Twin Cities -- has seen his hundreds of videos garner over two and a half million likes in total. Users flood him with comments noting his uncanny resemblance to "Parks and Recreation" character Ben Wyatt, urging Little to run for president and lamenting the fact that some can't vote for him due to their location.In one TikTok video, Little sums up his legislative priorities while lip-synching to "Exactly How I Feel" by local artist Lizzo. With each repetition of the chorus, Little points to text popping up on the screen: "Prescription drugs should be affordable." "We need affordable college." "Paid Family Leave." "Affordable childcare." "Automatic voter registration." "Campaign Finance Reform."While the Democratic state senator peppers his policy views throughout his hundreds of videos, his jokes reign supreme: The nearly 8,000 likes on Little's policy-oriented video are dwarfed in comparison by the 316,000 likes on a clip that features another politician checking in to see if Little is "still using TikTok.""Oh hi, thanks for checking in," Little sings along, while sitting on his office floor. "I'm still a piece of garbage!""The stuff that does well is the self-aware TikToks - I know the reputation of politicians," Little said. "It's hard to be yourself all the time on these apps, but this one really allows me to do that."There are early signs that political organizing on the app can achieve tangible results. In July, Little's account posted a video urging users to Venmo his campaign account small donations to "defeat the Super PACs trying to beat me."Three days later, Little said the campaign had raised $3,500 from around 700 people, driven by Venmo donations.But Little said his TikTok account mainly aims to ease the burden of a tough calendar year."I think people have enjoyed the positivity, the humor, the relief from the typically divisive nastiness that politics comes with," Little said.Little acknowledged that TikTok isn't for everyone, and suggested that many politicians shun it not out of national-security concerns but because they can't handle the demands for authenticity."This app fits my personality," Little said. "But if you get on there and do it wrong, you're just going to get roasted." Load-Date: August 19, 2020End of Document

The week in GRC: SEC approves Reg SK changes, and Storebrand divests over corporate lobbyingCorporatesecretary.comAugust 28, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 IR Media Group, LTD All Rights ReservedSection: COMPLIANCELength: 1667 wordsByline: Ben MaidenBody-The Wall Street Journalreported that, according to data provider MyLogIQ, 87 percent of companies in the S&P 500 opted for a virtual AGM this year compared with 23 percent of meetings held remotely in 2019. Companies are finding virtual AGMs to be cheaper and less time-consuming, but some shareholders complain they don't get as much time to ask their questions.Remote investor events held by companies in the S&P 500 this year ran for an average of 32 minutes, seven minutes shorter than in-person shareholder meetings in 2019, according to a recent study of more than 90 annual meetings by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Executives allocated less time for business updates and for answering shareholders' questions compared with in-person meetings in 2019, the study noted.- TikTok said it planned to file a lawsuit on Monday against US President Donald Trump's executive order prohibiting transactions with the short video app and its Chinese parent ByteDance, Reuters reported. TikTok said it had tried to engage with the US administration for nearly a year but faced 'a lack of due process' and that the government paid no attention to the facts.Trump issued an executive order on August 14 that gave ByteDance 90 days to divest the US operations of TikTok. 'To ensure the rule of law is not discarded and that our company and users are treated fairly, we have no choice but to challenge the executive order through the judicial system,' the company said in a statement.A representative for the White House did not respond immediately to a request for comment.- The Guardianreported thatNordic hedge fund firm Storebrand has dropped its stock in some of the world's biggest oil and mining companies for lobbying against climate change action.Storebrand made the divestments as part of a new climate policy targeting companies that use their political clout to block green policies.The asset manager is one of many major financial institutions divesting from polluting industries but is thought to be the first to drop shares in companies that use their influence to slow the pace of climate action.Storebrand CEO Jan Erik Saugestad said corporate lobbying activity designed to undermine solutions to 'the greatest risks facing humanity' is 'simply unacceptable.'- CNBC said that, as Wall Street firms prepare for more traders and bankers to return to offices next month, JPMorgan Chase is making a change that could have lasting implications for the industry. Workers in the firm's corporate and investment bank will cycle between days at the office and days at home, keeping the ability to work remotely on a part-time basis, according to Daniel Pinto, head of the division and co-president of the bank.'We are going to start implementing the model I believe will be more or less permanent, which is this rotational model,' Pinto said. 'Depending on the type of business, you may be working one week a month from home, or two days a week from home, or two weeks a month.' The announcement by JPMorgan could pressure other financial firms to offer similar arrangements.- Five US regulatory agencies have warned that banks and financial institutions need to assess money-laundering risks and conduct appropriate due diligence when dealing with foreign public officials and their families or associates, according to the WSJ. People who are considered politically exposed may pose higher risks because their funds may be the proceeds of corruption or other illicit activities, the regulators said in a joint statement. But they added that risks associated with politically exposed individuals vary and not all of them are automatically higher risk.'The risk depends on facts and circumstances specific to the customer relationship,' said the statement issued by the Federal Reserve Board, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, US Department of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, National Credit Union Administration and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.The agencies clarified that there are no regulatory requirements or expectations for financial institutions to have unique, additional due-diligence steps for clients who are considered politically exposed. But they said banks must 'identify and report suspicious activity, including transactions that may involve the proceeds of corruption.'- According to CNN, Trump's threat to ban WeChat could become a problem for US companies operating in China. An executive order issued earlier this month would prohibit Americans and US firms from 'any transaction that is related to WeChat' - an escalation of the technology dispute between the two countries that has already resulted in sanctions and threats against other Chinese companies.WeChat's Chinese parent company Tencent did not respond to a request for comment. It said previously that it was seeking clarification of the order and has emphasized that the international version of WeChat is separate from the Chinese app, which is also known as Weixin. Its website says Tencent uses data 'in strict accordance with applicable laws and regulations.'- The WSJsaid the SEC voted 3-2 to approve a proposal expanding its definition of accredited investors to include holders of an entry-level stockbroker's license, 'knowledgeable employees' of non-public firms and others. This gives them greater access to the largely unregulated world of private equity firms, hedge funds and business start-ups. Such investors will not need to meet the SEC's existing wealth-based threshold of at least $1 million in net assets - not counting their home - or at least $200,000 in annual income.The existing system 'is fundamentally unfair, unequal and unjustified,' said commissioner Elad Roisman. Both dissenting votes came from the SEC's Democratic commissioners, Caroline Crenshaw and Allison Herren Lee.- TikTok CEO Kevin Mayer said he is leaving the social media platform after being in the post for about three months, as the company comes under increasing pressure from the White House over its ties to China, according to the WSJ. In a letter to staff, Mayer said the political environment had sharply changed in recent weeks and the role of CEO would be altered significantly after the expected sale of TikTok's US business.The Trump administration has pressed TikTok's owner, Chinese technology company ByteDance, to sell its US operations after targeting the app over national security concerns. US officials say they are concerned TikTok could pass on data it collects from US citizens to China's authoritarian government. TikTok has said it doesn't share data with the Chinese government and wouldn't do so if asked.Zhang Yiming, founder and chair of ByteDance, sent an email to staff thanking Mayer for his contribution and saying he understood how political circumstances had led to the decision. Mayer said he decided to step down after considering the corporate structural changes that would be required if the US business was sold.- The SEC said it was closely monitoring the impact of Hurricane Laura on investors and capital markets. The agency's divisions and offices that oversee companies, accountants, investment advisers, mutual funds, brokerage firms, transfer agents and other regulated entities and investment professionals would continue to track developments and would evaluate the possibility of granting relief from filing deadlines and other regulatory requirements for those affected by the storm, it said.- The WSJreported that, according to securities filings, the SEC sent letters in June to Coca-Cola and Boeing requesting more information about how they use supply-chain finance, essentially a form of short-term borrowing to pay for goods and services. Although similar to loans, supply-chain financing is often not clearly disclosed on a company's financial statements. Companies usually record the transactions as accounts payable, leading some to say they portray overly optimistic financial health.The SEC has increased scrutiny of the practice over the past year and a half. Coca-Cola said it hadn't previously disclosed the supply-chain finance program, begun in 2014, because it hadn't materially affected liquidity and wasn't likely to in the future. In a later response to the SEC, the firm said it would make disclosures about the program in future filings. A Coca-Cola spokesperson declined to comment further.Boeing responded to the SEC that it didn't consider supply-chain financing to be material to its overall liquidity, and said it would disclose in future filings the amounts included in accounts payable as a result of the supply-chain-finance programs as well as the impact on operating cash flows each period. A Boeing spokesperson declined to comment.- The SEC voted to give companies more flexibility in disclosing risk factors and legal proceedings in their financial statements by approving amendments to Regulation SK, the WSJreported. Under the revised rule, companies must provide a summary of no more than two pages if their risk factor section exceeds 15 pages. Including many general risks in that section tends to add to the complexity of statements without giving investors much additional insight, according to the agency.As part of the changes, companies no longer have to provide a description of the general development of their business over the past five years. They will need only provide an update focusing on material developments since the last time they fully discussed it in financial statements.- CNN reported that the New Zealand government has ordered one of its spy agencies to investigate a cyber-attack that originated overseas and disrupted the country's financial markets for a fourth consecutive day on Friday. Finance minister Grant Robertson said the Government Communications Security Bureau has been instructed to help New Zealand's stock exchange, NZX. The National Security System has also been activated, requiring government agencies to work together, he told reporters.Link to ImageLoad-Date: August 28, 2020End of Document

Bannon's Chinese host an irritant to Communist PartyAssociated Press InternationalAugust 21, 2020 Friday 9:38 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 568 wordsByline: JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) — The self-exiled Chinese tycoon on whose 150-foot (45-meter) yacht President Donald Trump’s former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, was arrested is a high-profile irritant to the ruling Communist Party.Guo Wengui left China in 2014 during an anti-corruption crackdown led by President Xi Jinping that ensnared people close to Guo, including a top intelligence official. Chinese authorities have accused Guo of rape, kidnapping, bribery and other offenses.A former civil servant turned real estate developer, Guo has rankled the ruling party by launching accusations of corruption on social media. From his base in a Manhattan luxury apartment, he has been especially critical of Vice President Wang Qishan, a Xi ally and key figure in the party's anti-corruption drive.Bannon, who was arrested on Thursday, was charged along with three others with defrauding online donors in the name of helping build Trump’s southern border wall. Bannon pleaded not guilty at a hearing Thursday in Manhattan.In June, Guo and Bannon announced the founding of the “Federal State of New China,” an initiative to “overthrow the Chinese government.”Guo, also known as Miles Kwok, was one of China’s richest businesspeople, with a fortune estimated by Forbes magazine at $1.1 billion in 2015. His most prominent asset was Pangu Plaza, an office-and-hotel complex overlooking Beijing's Olympic Stadium.Guo paid $67.5 million in 2015 for his 9,000-square foot (850-square meter) apartment above Central Park and joined Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.The status of Guo’s fortune is unclear. Assets in China have been frozen or confiscated. He is trying to sell his Manhattan apartment; the asking price was cut this year to $55 million. His yacht, the Lady May, is for sale for nearly $28 million.Guo told The Associated Press in 2017 his goal was to win the release of family members, employees and assets in China, not to undermine the Communist Party.Also in 2017, however, his lawyer said Guo had applied for political asylum in the United States. Even if the claim is ultimately rejected, that might let Guo stay in the country for years while it is reviewed and during possible appeals.That came after Beijing asked the international police agency Interpol to issue a “red notice” asking other governments to arrest Guo.In the first criminal proceeding stemming from accusations against Guo and his companies, three employees were sentenced to prison in 2017 on charges they carried out Guo’s orders to falsify financial documents in order to obtain loans from a state bank.The official Xinhua News Agency said other Guo-related businesses were suspected of bribery, embezzlement, illegal detention and forced transactions.The former deputy chief of the Chinese intelligence agency, Ma Jian, was convicted in December 2018 of taking bribes to help Guo. The charges included conspiring to blackmail a Beijing city official who blocked a Guo development project.In 2017, Chinese developer SOHO sued Guo in New York after he accused the company of improperly obtaining regulatory changes to boost the value of its properties. Guo countersued. SOHO dropped its complaint in 2018. A judge dismissed Guo’s suit the following year.A separate lawsuit filed by a Chinese woman in New York accused Guo of raping her and holding her prisoner for three years after hiring her as his assistant. Guo denied the allegations.Load-Date: August 21, 2020End of Document

Tik Tok files a lawsuit against the U.S. ban.CE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 25, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 857 wordsBodyChinese-owned TikTok sued the U.S. government in federal court Monday, saying it protects its users' data and challenging President Trump's executive order that would effectively ban the video-sharing app if it doesn't find an American buyer for its U.S. operations.In the lawsuit, filed in federal court in the Central District of California, TikTok's attorneys said the company has "taken extraordinary steps to protect the privacy and security of TikTok users' data in the U.S." And he has explained those efforts to the federal government during a recent national security review."By banning TikTok without notice or opportunity to be heard (either before or after the fact), the executive order violates the protections of the due process of the Fifth Amendment," the complaint reads.U.S. officials say they are concerned that Beijing-based TikTok may transmit the data it collects from Americans who broadcast videos to China's authoritarian government. TikTok has said that it has not been asked to share data with the Chinese government and would not do so if requested.TikTok's platform, filled with fun music and dance videos created by users, has been downloaded more than 180 million times in the US, according to market research firm Sensor Tower.Earlier this month, Trump issued an order asking the Chinese owner of TikTok to get rid of the US video-sharing app's operations, setting a 90-day deadline for the transaction to be completed.Microsoft Corp., Oracle Corp. and Twitter Inc. have discussed an acquisition and several investment firms are also involved.Although TikTok is in talks to sell its U.S. operations, the lawsuit was filed in part to buy more time for a sale to end or to resolve any unforeseen circumstances that may arise, depending on a person familiar with the situation.Trump has also suggested that parties to the deal pay a fee to the U.S. government for facilitating the deal. In the lawsuit, TikTok's lawyers said the fare is unnecessary and points out that the regulatory measure is politicized."The president's payment demands are unrelated to any conceivable national security issues," the lawsuit says.The White House declined to comment and referred the questions to the Justice Department, which did not comment either.In his lawsuit, TikTok asks the court to invalidate the executive order."When the ban takes effect, it could wipe out the entire TikTok business by preventing it from attracting new users; leading current users to competing platforms; and destroying TikTok's ability to partner with other companies and attract and retain employees," demand says.Commerce is still determining the precise parameters of the ban. The lawsuit says TikTok plans to seek a preliminary injunction "once commerce issues its regulations and understands the full extent of the impact of the illegal executive order."The lawsuit also claims Trump has abused federal law that gives him extraordinary powers to act when national security concerns arise in the telecommunications sector. Last year, he expressed hisconcern about threats in that field and called for additional regulations.TikTok's lawyers said in the complaint that the company is not a telecommunications provider and "does not provide the types of technology" in question in the regulations that followed.In a blog post titled "Why We're Suing the Administration," TikTok said Trump's Executive Order of August 6, which launched a 45-day period for TikTok to find a buyer for its U.S. operations, was made "without any evidence to justify such extreme action, and without due process."The company said it fully disagreed with the management's position that TikTok is a threat to national security and had expressed these objections before."Now is the time to act. We do not take lawsuits against the government lightly; However, we feel that we have no choice but to take steps to protect our rights and the rights of our community and employees."Analysts say China's national security law imposes broad obligations for citizens and corporations to assist in such research, a category that includes political and ideological threats in China. This means that ByteDance, as a Chinese company, will have trouble rejecting such data requests.In a letter to staff on August 4, Zhang Yiming, founder and president of ByteDance, spoke out against the actions of the U.S. government. In the letter, Zhang did not challenge the legal authority of the U.S. Foreign Investment Committee to try to undo the Chinese acquisition of a predecessor application, Musical.ly, which led to TikTok's expansion in the U.S. but questioned the Trump administration's motives."Many people have misunderstood the heart of the problem. The problem is not that Cfius has forced TikTok to sell its operations in the U.S. due to the threat to national security of the acquisition of musical.ly (it is not fair, but it is still in the legal process and as a corporation we have no choice but to follow the law.)," he wrote. "But this is not the goal of the other party. In fact, the other party doesn't even want this to happen, because the real reason is a total ban."Load-Date: August 26, 2020End of Document

Chinese official press accuses United States of wanting to steal TikTokCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 5, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 458 wordsBody       "Washington's rules are anything to go," said the Global Times, the English-language newspaper of the People's Daily group, the official body of the PCC."The U.S., as a powerful country, not only makes the rules, but also intentionally adopts arbitrary measures that violate the rules," he added. "Other countries can just keep the rules in mind and accept these infractions."The debate over the future of TikTok, owned by Beijing-based technology company ByteDance, came about over the weekend when U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to ban the application from operating in the United States.Members of the U.S. Congress have expressed concern that TikTok could pose a threat to national security if the Chinese government accesses U.S. user data.TikTok, however, recalled that it stores the data collected outside China and would resist any attempt by Beijing to access information.On Monday, Trump said he would be open to allowing a U.S. company to buy TikTok, though with the caveat that any deal would have to include a "substantial amount of money" earmarked for the U.S. Treasury.Microsoft, which is headquartered in the U.S. state of Washington, has emerged as a potential buyer.Several U.S. media outlets or social networks, including Facebook, Twitter or Instagram, or search engine Google, are banned from the Chinese network, the world's largest, with more than 710 million users.The Global Times assures, however, that U.S. policy toward TikTok "is not reciprocal," claiming that "China offers conditions under which U.S. technology companies can operate in the Chinese market", on condition that they comply with China's laws and regulations."The U.S. ban on TikTok is an arbitrary executive order. [Washington] refused to offer conditions for TikTok to continue operating in the U.S.," the Global Times recalled.The state-run China Daily considered a possible sale of the application as a "destroy and grab" tactic orchestrated by the U.S. Government."The U.S. Government's bullying of Chinese technology companies stems from data being the new source of wealth and wanting everything in its vision of 'America First'," China Daily wrote in an editorial.In an internal memo sent to employees on Monday, ByteDance CEO and founder Zhang Yiming acknowledged that "the past few months have been a period of challenge for everyone.""We have begun preliminary discussions with a technology company to help pave the way for the continuation of TikTok in the U.S.," Zhang wrote.The Guangming Daily newspaper recalled that the debate over TikTok is "emblematic of the kind of experience" that can await other Chinese companies planning to expand beyond mainland China."Who is TikTok dancing to," the newspaper said in an editorial.Load-Date: August 6, 2020End of Document

Zoom doesn't want to follow in TikTok's footsteps: suspended sales of its products with ChinaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 3, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 546 wordsBodyThe Zoom video calling platform said on Monday that it will stop selling new or updated products directly to customers in China,and will instead only offer its services through the company's external partners, in another move that aims to take away from the conflict between the United States and the Asian giant.Zoom began notifying customers in China on Monday about the change, which will take effect on August 23, 2020, according to information raised by the CNBC chain."In the past, our marketing model in China included direct sales, online subscription and partner sales. Two months ago, we stopped offering online subscriptions," the letter said. We are now moving to a partner-only model with Zoom technology built into partner offerings, which will provide you with better local support.""Users in mainland China can continue to join Zoom meetings as participants," a source added.China-based partners Bizconf Communications, Suirui Zhumu Video Conference and Systec Umeetare the three companies that Zoom recommends asian customers to take as a reference. That means customers will no longer be able to purchase services directly from Zoom. Instead, they will have to purchase products offered by these third parties that use some of the platform's technology.While it is not yet clear what caused Zoom's movement, the recent US conflict with the Chinese TikTok app is yet yet to show more of the tensions between the two powers.Zoom's origin and its controversial relationship with ChinaWith the explosion of video calls during the coronavirus pandemic?, Zoom was one of the companies criticized for its ties to China.Earlier this year the company admitted that it had mistakenly sent some meetings through servers hosted in China.In June, the company closed the account of an activist holding an event on the videoconferencing platform to commemorate the crackdown on China's Tiananmen Square, a politically sensitive issue for the central government.After the incident, platform sources said they would not allow Chinese government requests to affect anyone outside mainland China.While Zoom is a company founded in the United States, its creator Eric Yuan is a Chinese immigrant from Tai'an, Shandong, a province 540 kilometers from Beijing. After applying for a Visa at the embassy and receiving eight rejections, the engineer achieved his job only in the ninth, in mid-1997, when he managed to become a U.S. national.However, the company's development team is "largely" based in China, according to Zoom's regulatory filing earlier this year.Technology companies with some ties to China are closely followed in the crosshairs by lawmakers in Washington.The Beijing-based TikTok social media app, owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, faces in recent weeks accusations from the Donal Trump administration that it is collecting data from US users to send to the Chinese government."[TikTok] will close on September 15 unless Microsoft or another company is able to buy it and get a proper deal so that the U.S. Treasury makes a lot of money," the representative said on Monday, as published by The Boston Globe.For its part, TikTok repeatedly assured that it stores its data outside China and that it would resist any attempt by Beijing to appropriate theInformation.Load-Date: August 4, 2020End of Document

Qingdao is together with all Chinese enterprises in taking the big test of COVID-19PR NewswireAugust 30, 2020 Sunday 12:17 PM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 541 wordsDateline: QINGDAO, China, Aug. 30, 2020 BodyPR NewswireThe 16th Summer Summit of Yabuli China Entrepreneurs Forum 2020, themed "Chinese Enterprises under the Big Test," kicked off in Qingdao on August 28. Wang Qingxian, member of the Standing Committee of CPC Shandong Committee and Secretary of CPC Qingdao Committee, addressed the opening ceremony.In his speech, Wang said the COVID-19 pandemic is causing accelerated changes worldwide, and the global industry chain, supply chain and value chain are being restructured at a fast speed. Therefore, the Chinese government has put forward the new economic strategy of establishing a "dual circulation" development pattern, in which domestic and foreign markets can boost each other and "domestic circulation" is the mainstay. Under such a circumstance, the summit of Chinese elite entrepreneurs embodies Yabuli China Entrepreneurs Forum's role in supporting the country's economic development, and is of remarkable significance for Qingdao to develop into a modern international metropolis and build a new international platform for cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative.During his speech, Wang recalled his attendance to the 1st Yabuli China Entrepreneurs Forum at Harbin in the winter of 2001. Themed "New Millennium, New Economy," the event came following China announced to join WTO, and the Chinese entrepreneurs were then excited and also some anxious about the opportunities and challenges in the globalization. However, being an attendee to the 2020 forum, Wang said China, the world's second largest economy, has seen dramatic changes over the past 20 years and therefore the topics at today's forum have changed from those about how to keep in line with the trend of globalization to those about how to cope with de-globalization.Wang offered four suggestions for Chinese entrepreneurs to respond to the test of COVID-19: enhancing awareness of innovation-driven strong development; improving enterprises' quality, strengthening willpower; being highly motivated to embrace industrial Internet.He also clarified the tasks that Qingdao can fulfill alongside the entrepreneurs: first, jointly building Qingdao into a new strategic pivot in the regions north of the Yangtze River for national opening-up; second, jointly ensuring Qingdao can give full play to its role as a domestic and international exchange platform in driving "domestic circulation;" third, jointly building an innovation base for new-round high-quality development in the northern part of China; fourth, jointly developing the Jiaodong Peninsula economic circle into a new growth pole for national economic development.Photo -https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1245707/Wang_Qingxian_Yabuli_China_Entrepreneurs_Forum_2020.jpgPhoto -https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1245708/Yabuli_China_Entrepreneurs_Forum_2020.jpgLogo -https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1245709/Qingdao_Logo.jpgContact: Ms. Zhu YilingTel: +86-532-85911619Web:http://www.qingdaochina.orgFacebook account:https://www.facebook.com/qingdaocity Twitter account:https://twitter.com/loveqingdao View original content to download multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/qingdao-is-together-with-all-chinese-enterprises-in-taking-the-big-test-of-covid-19-301120723.htmlSOURCE Stadt QingdaoLoad-Date: August 30, 2020End of Document

The War for TikTok: China News Agency's Hard ColumnCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 6, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 719 wordsBodyChina's official xinhuanews agency released a categorical column against the launch of a "Clean Network" held Wednesday by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, which he called a further step in the "repression of Chinese tech companies.""Although Pompeo talks about a 'clean network', the ideas he encloses and the means he has used to obtain it are dirty,"said the Chinese government's news company, which argued that the U.S. plan is "doomed to failure."Below is the full column of Xinhua:"Pompeo's dirty 'clean network'"U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday announced the launch of an expansion of efforts under the "Clean Network" program with the goal of "protecting the essential infrastructure of U.S. telecommunications and technology," thus taking another step in the crackdown on Chinese tech companies.As set out in the program's five new axes, Washington will try to remove Chinese apps it considers "unreliable" such as TikTok and WeChat from the country's software stores, limit the ability to access cloud systems in the country from Chinese service providers such as Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent, and ensure that China does not "sabotage underwater cables to gather intelligence information."The essence of this measure is the current decoupling in these areas between China and the United States, and also other countries that Pompeo has lobbied to support Washington. Although Pompeo talks about a "clean network," the ideas he encloses and the means he has used to obtain it are dirty.There is no reason to justify these actions. Pompeo's excuses are that Chinese companies steal U.S. technology, collect data, and threaten U.S. national security, even though he has so far shown no convincing evidence.On the contrary, the United States has a well-known reputation for spying on everyone, even its allies. Perhaps Pompeo has misrepresented the accusations against Chinese companies based simply on his own experience because, as he once said in a speech, "we lie, deceive and steal."Such actions will have serious consequences and Chinese firms will not be the only ones to suffer them. Companies in other countries, including the U.S., will also face losses due to disruption of global supply chains and international scientific and technological cooperation.Such actions will also harm the interests of consumers of technological products. Political scrutiny and the threat of expulsion or forced sale of popular short-video apps like TikTok by the US government has been met with strong opposition from young Americans and widespread criticism inside and outside the country.Such actions, on the other hand, will continue to discredit the investment and business environment in the U.S., as analysts have warned in the case of TikTok, which has been assimilated as an act of piracy.Pompeo boasted that more than 30 countries and territories are on their side, committed to exclusively using "reliable sellers" in their Clean Networks. It is obvious that he is trying to weave a global network to wipe out Chinese technology companies and hinder China's development.But his scheme is doomed to failure. These countries mentioned by Pompeo will eventually realize that they lose by rejecting Chinese technologies. If you look at China's development in recent decades, you can clearly see that Pompeo's tricks will hardly hinder thepace of development in the Asian country.The United States has long been a standard-bearer of the free market principle and fair play in international trade, but is now killing them with its own hands. As the world's only superpower, the United States is intimidating any country, company, or individual it sees as a potential challenge, without respecting international rules and regulations.Comments recently published by many American media outlets have called Pompeo "the worst secretary of state" of modern times, and even of all time, mainly because of his unsused sense of supremacy and his challenge to diplomatic etiquette in bilateral and international relations.According to a recent AP-NORC survey, 80 percent, a all-time high, of Americans say their country is heading in the wrong direction.This is no surprise, as under the leadership of politicians like Pompeo in the White House it is impossible for the country to go in the right direction.Load-Date: August 7, 2020End of Document

U.S. blacklists 24 Chinese firms, escalating military and trade tensionsPolitico.comAugust 26, 2020 Wednesday 10:37 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 370 wordsHighlight: The move is the latest push by the Trump administration to combat China.BodyThe Commerce Department on Wednesday blacklisted 24 Chinese companies, saying that they are helping the ruling Chinese Communist Party construct artificial islands in the South China Sea, which the U.S. sees as a military provocation.Issue at stake: Commerce said that since 2013, the Chinese government has built more than 3,000 acres of islands in the international waters off its southeastern coast, including "air defense and anti-ship missile features."This appears to be the first time the administration is targeting China's actions in the South China Sea, which has provoked U.S. partners in Southeast Asia like Taiwan and the Philippines. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has recently stepped up criticism of China's claims of outposts in the area. In 2016, the tribunal at The Hague said China's claims violated international law.Who's targeted: The 24 companies will be placed on the agency's "entity list," preventing the export of U.S. goods to Chinese companies. The firms are largely dredging, shipbuilding, infrastructure and technology companies.The blacklisted firms include the state-owned China Communications Construction Company, one of the leading contractors in China's Belt and Road Initiative, the Communist Party's global infrastructure investment program."The PRC must not be allowed to use [China Communications Construction Company] and other state-owned enterprises as weapons to impose an expansionist agenda," Pompeo said in a statement on Wednesday.Context: Commerce last week put 38 affiliates of Chinese telecom giant Huawei, which the U.S. says enables Communist Party espionage, on the entity list.The department previously put 37 Chinese enterprises on the entity list for engaging in or enabling human rights abuses in the northwestern province of Xinjiang, home to an ethnic minority of Muslims.What's next: The move comes amid deteriorating relations with Beijing, which the president has blamed for the coronavirus pandemic to deflect from his unpopular handling of the virus at home.Republicans are ramping up rhetoric against China at their convention this week, and Pompeo said the U.S. "will act until we see Beijing discontinue its coercive behavior in the South China Sea."Load-Date: August 27, 2020End of Document

The US has lots to lose and little to gain by banning TikTok and WeChatThe Conversation - United StatesAugust 28, 2020 Friday 12:22 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Conversation Media Group Ltd All Rights ReservedLength: 1271 wordsByline: Jeremy Straub, Assistant Professor of Computer Science, North Dakota State UniversityHighlight: Banning the Chinese-owned social media platforms raises free speech concerns and could worsen the US-China trade war.BodyThe Trump administration's recently announced bans on Chinese-owned social media platforms TikTok and WeChat could have unintended consequences. The orders bar the apps from doing business in the U.S. or with U.S. persons or businesses after Sept. 20 and require divestiture of TikTok by Nov. 12.The executive orders are based on national security grounds, though the threats cited are to citizens rather than the government. Foreign policy analysts see the move as part of the administration's ongoing wrestling match with the Chinese government for leverage in the global economy.Whatever the motivation, as someone who researches both cybersecurity and technology policy, I am not convinced that the benefits outweigh the costs. The bans threaten Americans' freedom of speech, and may harm foreign investment in the U.S. and American companies' ability to sell software abroad, while delivering minimal privacy and cybersecurity benefits. National security threat?The threats posed by TikTok and WeChat, according to the executive orders, include the potential for the platforms to be used for disinformation campaigns by the Chinese government and to give the Chinese government access to Americans' personal and proprietary information.  The U.S. is not the only country concerned about Chinese apps. The Australian military accused WeChat, a messaging, social media and mobile payment app, of acting as spyware, saying the app was caught sending data to Chinese Intelligence servers.Disinformation campaigns may be of particular concern, due to the upcoming election and the impact of the alleged "sweeping and systematic" Russian interference in the 2016 elections. The potential for espionage is less pronounced, given that the apps access basic contact information and details about the videos Americans watch and the topics they search on, and not more sensitive data.But banning the apps and requiring Chinese divestiture also has a national security downside.  It damages the U.S.'s moral authority to push for free speech and democracy abroad.  Critics have frequently contended that America's moral authority has been severely damaged during the Trump administration and this action could arguably add to the decline.Protecting personal informationThe administration's principal argument against TikTok is that it collects Americans' personal data and could provide it to the Chinese government.  The executive order states that this could allow China to track the locations of federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail and conduct corporate espionage.  Skeptics have argued that the government hasn't presented clear evidence of privacy issues and that the service's practices are standard in the industry. TikTok's terms of service do say that it can share information with its China-based corporate parent, ByteDance.The order against WeChat is similar. It also mentions that the app captures the personal and proprietary information of Chinese nationals visiting the United States. However, some of these visiting Chinese nationals have expressed concern that banning WeChat may limit their ability to communicate with friends and family in China.While TikTok and  WeChat do raise cybersecurity concerns, they are not significantly different from those raised by other smart phone apps. In my view, these concerns could be better addressed by enacting national privacy legislation, similar to Europe's GDPR and California's CCPA, to dictate how data is collected and used and where it is stored. Another remedy is to have Google, Apple and others review the apps for cybersecurity concerns before allowing new versions to be made available in their app stores.Freedom of speechPerhaps the greatest concern raised by the bans are their impact on people's ability to communicate, and whether they violate the First Amendment.  Both TikTok and WeChat are communications channels and TikTok publishes and hosts content.  While the courts have allowed some regulation of speech, to withstand a legal challenge the restrictions must advance a legitimate government interest and be "narrowly tailored" to do so.  National security is a legitimate governmental interest. However, in my opinion it's questionable whether a real national security concern exists with these specific apps.In the case of TikTok, banning an app that is being used for political commentary and activism would raise pronounced constitutional claims and likely be overturned by the courts.  Whether the bans hold up in court, the executive orders instituting them put the U.S. in uncomfortable territory: the list of countries that have banned social media platforms. These include Egypt, Hong Kong, Turkey, Turkmenistan, North Korea, Iran, Belarus, Russia and China. Though the U.S. bans may not be aimed at curtailing dissent, they echo actions that harm free speech and democracy globally. Social media gives freedom fighters, protesters and dissidents all over the world a voice. It enables citizens to voice concerns and organize protests about monarchies, sexual and other human rights abuses, discriminatory laws and civil rights violations. When authoritarian governments clamp down on dissent, they frequently target social media.[Deep knowledge, daily.Sign up for The Conversation's newsletter.]Risk of retaliationThe bans could also harm the U.S. economy because other countries could ban U.S. companies in retaliation. China and the U.S. have already gone through a cycle of reciprocal company banning, in addition to reciprocal consulate closures. The U.S. has placed Chinese telecom firm Huawei on the Bureau of Industry Security Entity List, preventing U.S. firms from conducting business with it.  While this has prevented Huawei from selling wireless hardware in the U.S., it has also prevented U.S. software sales to the telecom giant and caused it to use its own chips instead of buying them from U.S. firms. Over a dozen U.S. companies urged the White House not to ban WeChat because it would hurt their business in China.  Other countries might use the U.S. bans of Chinese firms as justification for banning U.S. companies, even though the U.S. has not taken action against them or their companies directly.  These trade restrictions harm the U.S.'s moral authority, harm the global economy and stifle innovation.  They also cut U.S. firms off from the high-growth Chinese market.  TikTok is in negotiations with Microsoft and Walmart and an Oracle-led consortium about a possible acquisition that would leave the company with American ownership and negate the ban.Oversight, not banishmentThough the TikTok and WeChat apps do raise some concerns, it is not apparent that cause exists to ban them.  The issues could be solved through better oversight and the enactment of privacy laws that could otherwise benefit Americans.  Of course, the government could have other causes for concern that it hasn't yet made public. Given the consequences of banning an avenue of expression, if other concerns exist the government should share them with the American public. If not, I'd argue less drastic action would be more appropriate and better serve the American people.Jeremy Straub is the associate director of the NDSU Institute for Cyber Security Education and Research and a Challey Institute Faculty Fellow.

New problems arise for TikTok: you can't sell your assets without China's approvalCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 30, 2020 SundayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 589 wordsBodyByteDance will need to seek the approval of the Chinese government to sell the U.S. operations of its TikTok application under the new restrictions Beijing imposed on the export of artificial intelligence technologies, according to a person familiar with the matter. Artificial intelligence interface technologies, such as speech and text recognition, and data analysis to make personalized content recommendations, were added to a revised list of export control products published on the Ministry of Commerce's website on Friday night. Government permits will be required for transfers abroad in order to "safeguard national economic security," he said. The new restrictions cover the technologies that ByteDance uses in TikTok and will require the company to seek government approval for any agreement, according to the person, that requests not to be identified because the details are not public. The new rule aims to delay the sale and is not an absolute ban, the person said. President Donald Trump's administration has said that ByteDance should sell the US operations of its popular video-sharing app due to alleged national security risks. Microsoft and Oracle have submitted rival offers to ByteDance to acquire TikTok's U.S. business, while Centricus Asset Management and Triller are said to have made a last-minute launch Friday to purchase TikTok's operations in several countries for $20 billion.China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ByteDance said in a statement that the company was aware of the new restrictions and would "strictly comply" with Chinese regulations on technology exports. Company executives are working to understand the new rule, and the attempt to please two governments that already disagree could make logistics for any deal more challenging, depending on a person familiar with the situation. ByteDance should study the new export list and consider "seriously and cautiously" whether it should stop negotiations, Cui Fan, a trade expert and professor at Beijing University of Economics and International Business, told the official Xinhua news agency. Additional approval in Beijing is likely to be delayed and could undermine any transaction. Because the Chinese government's review will take time, the TikTok agreement may be delayed until after the US election in November, the familiar person said.  The revised rules would cover cross-border transfers of restricted technologies even within the same company, while the impact and consequences of not performing the right applications would be very different if an international company were to split up, Cui said separately in an interview with Bloomberg. Technologies related to drones and some genetic engineering methods and procedures were also added to the revised export control list, while others were removed in areas such as medical equipment. Reviewsthey are intended to promote China's technological advancement and international cooperation, and "safeguard national economic security," a representative of the Ministry of Commerce said in a separate statement on Friday.  Technology exports cover several transfers outside China, including through trade, investment and patents, according to the statement. Any export of restricted technology will require letters of intent to export permit from the Chinese authorities before negotiations can take place, while final permits are required before any transfer occurs.  With the assistance of Zhang Dingmin and Miao Han.Load-Date: August 31, 2020End of Document

International Republican Institute: Report Exposes China-Linked Disinformation Targeting Taiwan's Presidential Election and COVID-19 ResponseTargeted News ServiceAugust 26, 2020 Wednesday 9:00 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 687 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK BodyThe International Republican Institute issued the following news release:Graphika, Institute for The Future's Digital Intelligence Lab and The International Republican Institute issued a joint report revealing the tactics and strategy behind an information operation directed at Taiwanese democratic processes. The report, Detecting Digital Fingerprints: Tracing Chinese Disinformation in Taiwan, uncovered a series of campaigns by CCP-linked and domestic actors targeting Taiwan's 2020 presidential election and its response to COVID-19 with narratives crafted to advance Beijing-strategic interests. Key findings include the discovery of new campaign tactics such as the use of Malaysian content farms, coordinated cross-platform campaigns and attempts to instigate U.S. participation."The Taiwanese presidential election was a seminal moment for Beijing's strategic political interests," said Melanie Smith, Head of Analysis, Graphika. "However, the emergence of information operations around COVID-19 makes it abundantly clear that disinformation in Taiwan is a persistent threat, not limited to election cycles."The report also indicates resilience to disinformation in Taiwanese society and political culture. "Taiwan is a model of successful mobilization against false information through its use of innovative civil society groups, as well as strong and consistent communication between government and the tech industry," said Nick Monaco, Director of the Digital Intelligence Lab at Institute for the Future."The Chinese disinformation apparatus is evolving, and we are learning more about how its use is strategic to geopolitical priorities," said Amy Studdart, Senior Advisor for Digital Democracy at the International Republican Institute. "This report should provide a model by which other nations can understand the threat of disinformation on their democratic processes."Key Findings2020 Presidential Elections* Disinformation frequently targeted the voting process and Taiwan's Central Election Commission (CEC) prior to the election, some of which alleged CIA intervention to manipulate results.* A Malaysian content farm emerged promoting pro-CCP narratives. Stories displayed links to mainland China through vocabulary choices, similarities with content attributed to Chinese government information operations and content copied from state-owned media outlets.* Disinformation was distributed across social media platforms including Facebook, Instagram, Line, PTT, Twitter and YouTube, with dozens of domains impacted.* The volume of disinformation increased after the election. A network of domestic Taiwanese accounts drove a cross-platform campaign to question the validity of Tsai Ing-wen's PhD post-election, generating two petitions to demand U.S. government investigations.COVID-19* Disinformation related to COVID-19 was used to discredit Taiwan's government and had links to mainland China. Accounts revealed their Chinese origin due to overlap with previous Chinese netizen-led disinformation campaigns targeting Taiwan and a poor grasp of linguistic differences between Taiwanese and Chinese Mandarin.* A coronavirus disinformation campaign propagated by Chinese accounts targeted Taiwan, as well as the international community, with false information.* The same network of Malaysian content farms originally disseminating presidential election disinformation pivoted to promote several false stories alleging that COVID-19 originated in the U.S.The report was developed using a blend of qualitative and quantitative analysis, including 17 interviews with Taiwan disinformation experts, from journalists and academics, to government officials and technologists, and analysis of social data from September 2019 through April 2020.Read the full report here (https://www.iri.org/sites/default/files/detecting_digital_fingerprints_-_tracing_chinese_disinformation_in_taiwan_0.pdf).Read the executive summary here (https://www.iri.org/sites/default/files/detecting_digital_fingerprints-key_findings.pdf).[Category: Political][Category: TNSlinxC]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7217758 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: August 26, 2020End of Document

Tik Tok sale is at risk over new restrictions in China for technology exportCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 31, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 653 wordsBodyChina announced new limitations on technology exports that could complicate the sale of U.S. operations of the TikTok social network.On Friday, the country governed by Xi Jinping updated the list of technologies subject to export restrictions and included computer systems, data processing, text analysis, content recommendation and speech recognition, as published by the Wall Street Journal.This means that Chinese companies that want to export technologies mentioned in that list, which had not been updated since 2008, will have to obtain a government license. Among the items in the list are products that offer personalized recommendation based on data analysis.This directly impacts Tik Tok, a social network whose algorithm offers suggestions to the user based on the information he collects about his use and behavior. Like most social networks and platforms of all kinds, data is used to make suggestions or display content that is more relevant to those who use it.On Saturday, China's official Xinhua news agency quoted a government trade adviser as saying ByteDance should study the new export list and consider it "seriously and cautiously" whether or not it should stop its sales negotiations.Tik Tok and WeChat are affected by the executive order that President Donald Trump signed on August 6 (Reuters)On Sunday, ByteDance said it had taken note of export regulation and in this regard clarified that "the company will strictly comply" with the laws, CNBC published."We are looking at the new regulations that were published on Friday. As with any cross-border transaction, we will follow applicable laws, which in this case include those of the US and China," ByteDance's General Counsel Erich Andersen said in another statement, as reported by byteDance.The list of exports of restricted technology includes cryptography, chip design, laser and other areas that impact the pharmaceutical and agriculture industry among others. The standard seeks to regulate the export of technologies it considers sensitive, information and developments that seek to protect security and sovereignty in China.This update to the restrictions is part of a geopolitical confrontation between China and the United States that takes more than two years. On August 6, Donald Trump signed an executive order banning "any" transaction with the company that owns the TikTok mobile app, ByteDance. The order would take effect next month, 45 days after its signature. On 14 August that restriction was extended to 90 days.In response, TikTok sued the U.S. government last week for that executive order, arguing that the ban prevents the company from having due process, as guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment.It is also mentioned that the company took extraordinary steps to address the concerns of the U.S. government, and in that regard stored data of U.S. users outside China, in the United States and Singapore.It should be remembered that all this arises in the midst of some companies such as Oracle, Microsoft and Wallmart having already expressed interest in acquiring Tik Tok's operations in the United StatesByteDance is not the only company that the UK government has considered to pose a security risk to your country. WeChat, Tencent's messaging app, faces the same banTikTok application, for national security reasons. With this same argument, the Trump administration limited the deployment of 5G by Chinese company Huawei. And it has also alerted other governments around the world to refrain from using this type of technology on the grounds that it could lead to cyberespionage by the Chinese government.In turn, last year, the U.S. government imposed restrictions on other Chinese companies that purchase technology from that country: these users must acquire a license in order to perform these transactions.MORE ON THIS TOPIC:Data from 235 million YouTube, Instagram and Tik Tok users were exposed on the webLoad-Date: September 1, 2020End of Document

Several government agencies have already banned TikTok on federal government devices due to cybersecurity concerns and possible spying by the Communist Chinese government. The Administration also recently announced it is considering a ban on Chinese social media apps, including TikTok, following reports the app shared data with the Communist Chinese government.Senator Rick Scott said, "Today, the U.S. Senate sent a powerful message to all companies controlled by the Communist Party of China. Companies like TikTok, under the control of Communist China, are obligated to spy, steal user data and censor any content the government wishes."We've watched the Communist Party of China use drones to spy on our citizens, now they are using apps like TikTok to surveil us. We must protect all Americans from this risk. I'm glad the Senate agreed to pass my bill with Senator Hawley today to ban this app on government devices, eliminating a threat to U.S. networks and to national security."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7201622 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: August 7, 2020End of Document

CONSERVATIVE INDUSTRIAL POLICY AND THE "CHINA THREAT"States News ServiceAugust 28, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 745 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Cato Institute:By Scott LincicomeThe Washington Post reports that many conservatives are ditching their "free market orthodoxy" due in large part to Chinese industrial subsidies that allegedly threaten critical parts of the American industrial base:Since the Reagan years, Republicans have taken the opposite view that government should stay small and out of the way and not engage in what has been derisively referred to as picking winners and losers. But China's rise is forcing them to rethink that.China's central and regional governments are investing heavily in high" tech fields such as aircraft and electric" car manufacturing, semiconductors and robotics, by some estimates providing hundreds of billions of dollars to domestic companies through subsidies and other support.As evidence of this shift, the Post cites to recent federal legislation, passed overwhelmingly by both chambers of Congress and praised by Republican industrial policy advocates, that provides billions of dollars in new subsidies to U.S. semiconductor manufacturers. As I noted a few weeks ago in a lengthy and skeptical blog post on the bill, the primary basis for these subsidies according to its sponsors and other supporters (and confirmed by the Post) was the aforementioned China threat, in this case the billions of dollars that the Chinese government is spending to develop a globally" competitive semiconductor sector. To its credit, the Post briefly notes my skepticism before quoting many others at length who are supportive of the semiconductor plan and broader U.S. industrial policy efforts (one of whom rejects "naive" libertarian views about government involvement in the economy).However, the Post unfortunately omits much of my argument against the new U.S. subsidies, most notably the numerous reports (including a lengthy U.S. International Trade Commission analysis in 2019) that China's semiconductor sector, despite all of those subsidies, was hardly a threat to the thriving and in many respects globally dominant American semiconductor industry. Today from the South China Morning Post comes further evidence of that fact:At an idle construction site in western Wuhan, China's steep climb to semiconductor independence is clear for all to see.The partially" built factory, owned by Wuhan Hongxin Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (HSMC), was meant to be a key part of a US$20 billion investment that turned the province into a chip manufacturing hub.But two years after it was started, construction has ground to a halt, with little evidence of progress beyond a few cranes, workers' dormitories and steel frames jutting into the air.The project, which the local Dongxihu district government said in July had stalled due to underfunding, is the latest example of a Chinese chip factory hitting the rocks because of poor planning or funding shortfalls.Earlier this year, a US$100 million manufacturing plant set up by US chip giant GlobalFoundries and the Chengdu city government ceased operations after remaining idle for almost two years. In the country's east, a US$3 billion government" backed chip plant owned by Tacoma Nanjing Semiconductor Technology went bankrupt in July after failing to attract investors.Be sure to read the whole thing, which details the HSMC project's many (sometimes humorous) problems and again indicates that China's grand semiconductor plans and massive subsidies are not nearly as threatening as U.S. politicians and industry lobbyists make them out to be.The semiconductor episode also permits two broader lessons. First, it shows that the mere presence of foreign government subsidies is rarely, if ever, a good reason for American ones especially when they're going to a profitable U.S. industry with billions in domestic capital expenditures (and billions more cash on hand). Second, it provides another good example of why some libertarians remain skeptical of U.S. industrial policy plans. All too often even (or especially) in the case of "national security" and China (or Japan before it) ideas that sound good and necessary on paper are revealed upon closer inspection to be corporatist giveaways that counter imaginary threats and end up doing more harm than good. Maybe the U.S. government can overcome these obstacles in the future, but both the semiconductor subsidies and numerous other examples indicate that it's not the skeptical libertarians who are being naive here.Load-Date: August 29, 2020End of Document

Argentina, among the 21 countries affected by U.S. sanctions on Chinese giant HuaweiCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 18, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 594 wordsBodyAn Argentina subsidiary is, along with 37 other international subsidiaries of Chinese giant Huawei among the firms sanctioned by the United States, that would not be able to do business with that country.Donald Trump's administration announced Monday that it will expand its sanctions against the Asian group to block its access to chips and other technologies.Commerce added 38 Huawei subsidiaries worldwide to its blacklist, stating that the company used subsidiaries to evade sanctions that prevent the export of U.S. technology. These firms include Huawei Cloud Argentina and other Huawei companies in 21 countries, including China, Chile, Brazil, France, Germany, Singapore, Thailand and Great Britain."These actions that are effective immediately will block Huawei's attempts to circumvent control of U.S. exports," Commerce said in a statement.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Huawei and its affiliates "have used third parties to use American technology in a way that undermines U.S. national security and its foreign policy."The U.S. government argues that Huawei is a risk to national security because of its ties to the Chinese government, an accusation the company denies.This tightening of sanctions comes in line with rising tensions between the United States and China due to Washington's accusations that Chinese companies are used for espionage.Trump wants to ban the popular TikToksi app this is not separated from his Chinese matrix ByteDance.Speaking to Fox News on Monday, Trump stated that Huawei "comes out and spies into our country; this is a very intricate thing, microchips, things you can't even see."Huawei did not immediately respond to a comment request.The Trump administration banned Huawei from using 5G wireless networks in the United States and has pressured its allies to do the same.Meanwhile, Huawei became the world's largest smartphone manufacturer in the last quarter, largely due to sales in the Chinese market, even when Washington acts to deny it access to much of Google's Android system.Mean by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, he said the United States "sees Huawei for what it is: an arm of the chinese Communist Party's watchful state."He added that the new sanctions were imposed "to protect America's national security, the privacy of our citizens, and the integrity of our 5G infrastructure from Beijing's evil influence."What are the sanctionsThe measures prevent companies from purchasing software or technology produced in the United States that is used in goods or components."The new rule makes it clear that any use of U.S. software or U.S.-made equipment to produce things through Huawei is prohibited and requires a license,"Ross told Fox Business Network."So it's really about closing fissures to prevent a bad actor from accessing American technology, even when they try to do it in a very indirect and very misleading way," he added.U.S. officials said that exemptions to sanctions, which had been allowed to minimize inconvenience, will not be extended.That could mean that those who own Huawei phones may not have access to updates to Google's Android operating system. Updates would also not be allowed for wireless networks using computersHuawei.A Commerce Department official told reporters that the only exception will be for cybersecurity-related updates, although it did not clarify for which equipment or software.Commerce will review any license application "to determine whether it will involve a breakthrough in our national security interests," the official said.With information from AFPNeLoad-Date: August 19, 2020End of Document

State Dept.'s Strayer: Technical measures insufficient to assess security risks from Chinese tech productsInside Cyber SecurityAugust 4, 2020Copyright 2020 Inside Washington Publishers All Rights ReservedLength: 682 wordsBody July 31, 2020 | Charlie Mitchell State Department cyber official Robert Strayer says "geopolitical" considerations as well as technical assessments are necessary to understand the security risk from information and communications technology built in China or other countries, while citing progress in bringing allies on board for a ban on products by Chinese firms Huawei and ZTE.Tech companies' ability to remotely update or patch both hardware and software on a continuous basis means source-code reviews and other one-time assessments are inadequate, Strayer said. "There also needs to be a geopolitical review" to assess how a foreign government's policies -- and the politics of the moment -- are affecting the security of such products, he said.Use of Huawei or ZTE products heightens the risk of both espionage and telecom system disruption, Strayer said, reiterating U.S. charges that Huawei's ownership "is not transparent" and that the Chinese government exercises substantial influence over both firms. The companies dispute these charges and say U.S. security arguments are a smokescreen for efforts to undermine them in the global ICT marketplace.But Strayer said Chinese government support and subsidies for Huawei and others allows them to sell at below-market rates, which complicates efforts to counter uses of their products. "We're discussing both [the economic and security] sets of issues," Strayer said. "I think they're complementary. We want 5G and future-generation development on a level playing field."Strayer is deputy assistant secretary for cyber and international communications and information policy. He spoke Thursday on a 5G security policy forum hosted by the Telecommunications Industry Association, along with Eiji Makiguchi from Japan's Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications and Daniela Bršnstrup from Germany's Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy.The participants all stressed the promise of technologies like Open Radio Access Networks -- O-RAN -- to broaden the supply base for 5G products and services beyond Huawei and a handful of others, as well as the critical role of standards-making bodies, and the need for complementary if not identical policies among democratic allies.Strayer said the State Department is focused on "Pillar Four" of the White House's National Strategy to Secure 5G, released in March. That "line of effort" is intended to "promote responsible global development and deployment of 5G."In particular, Strayer cited encouraging adoption of the "Prague Principles," identifying and expanding "trusted" 5G suppliers, and other aspects. He said 32 countries have signed on for the principles on "common standards" for 5G security and said another "Prague conference" is expected this fall, perhaps as a hybrid in-person/virtual event."The tide is turning against Huawei," he said, calling this "welcome news."Germany is expected to reach a decision this fall specifically on the fate of Huawei equipment, which is prevalent in its telecom system. The United Kingdom, which recently announced a ban on purchasing Huawei products, is also dependent on such equipment and gave itself until 2027 to remove products already on the system.German official Bršnstrup pointed to her country's "catalogue" of security requirements that focuses on trustworthy suppliers, repeated testing and diverse suppliers. European Union countries are also working on implementing "a unified approach" and ensuring member-states' laws are in alignment.Germany's approach is neutral on technology and countries-of-origin for products, she said, "consistent with free trade" principles. "The government doesn't interfere in the day-to-day approach of operators but is serious about fulfilling our [security] responsibility."Makiguchi noted that Japanese officials recently released a "roadmap beyond 5G," with an expectation of 6G networks by 2030. The Japanese government will host annual international "beyond 5G" conferences, he said. "We don't have much time" for this next transition, he said. -- Charlie Mitchell (cmitchell@iwpnews.com)Load-Date: August 5, 2020End of Document

Donald Trump decrees suspension of Operations of Chinese owner TikTok in 45 daysCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 7, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 428 wordsBodyIn a further breakthrough against TikTok to expedite its sale in the United States, President Donald Trump issued a decree on Thursday night banning any business with ByteDance,the Chinese owner of the mobile app, within 45 days. The measure, which is a nod for Microsoft, also affects the WeChat platform."The spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned by companies in the People's Republic of China continues to threaten U.S. national security, foreign policy, and the economy," the representative warned.Thus, the White House leader accused TikTok, created by ByteDance and WeChat, conducted by Tencent, of spying on its American users for Beijing, against a backdrop of trade and political tensions with China."Like TikTok, WeChat automatically captures huge swathes of information about its users, threatening to give the Chinese Communist Party access to personal information from Americans," the decree notes.He adds: "The collection of data (from TikTok)to allow the Chinese Communist Party to access Americans' personal and private information,potentially allowing China to track the locations of federal employees and contractors, create personal information records for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage."Trump's decision, which promised to kick TikTok out of the U.S. before September 15, is a nod to Microsoft. It is that tension triggered rumors of the sale of the company's subsidiary on American soil, with Microsoft as one of the main interested in acquiring it at a price of between $10 billion and $30 billion.On Thursday, the U.S. Senate also passed a billprohibiting the download and use of TikTok on any device of government employees or members of Congress."TikTok poses a major security risk and has no place in government devices," Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, co-author of the text, tweeted.Secretary of State Mike Pompeosaid Wednesday that Washington is expanding its Clean Network program to China, and that it not only plans to ban TikTok but also other applications from China companies that are considered a national security risk.Used by about a billion people around the world to make 60-second videos on their cell phones, TikTok is the latest front in the political and trade battles between Washington and Beijing that marked the Trump administration.While the company denies that its users' data is handed over to the Chinese government, ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming acknowledged Monday being under pressure and noted that they work 24 hours a day "to get the best possible exit."Source: AgenciesLoad-Date: August 8, 2020End of Document

THE LESSON OF TIKTOKStates News ServiceAugust 7, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1502 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Cato Institute:By Huan ZhuThere are not that many things that excite both teenagers and policy wonks at the same time, but TikTok has found a way to do so. The fate of this Chinese" owned social media company that has become a phenomenon in America is now in the spotlight. Because of concerns over data security, it appears that the company must either be sold to Microsoft (or some other American company) or be forced to shut down in the United States.Although there may be some legitimate concerns here, the administration's unilateralist approach creates a bad precedent. A better way to address the concerns of data security would be for the United States and others to create a set of international rules to govern data protection, which would foster a safe, fair, and stable environment for both businesses and consumers.My colleague Julian Sanchez offered some good background on the TikTok ban here. In brief, TikTok, a popular short" video app used widely by teenagers, is owned by a Chinese company. In 2017, the Chinese company ByteDance acquired Musi cal .ly, a video service popular in the Americas and Europe, and later merged it with TikTok, a similar app that was more popular in Asia. Since then, TikTok has become one of the world's most popular social media platforms and has 80 million active daily users in the United States alone.The unexpected growth in popularity in recent years, along with the growing tensions and distrust between the United States and China, raises concerns that TikTok will send the data of U.S. users to its parent company in China, ultimately allowing the Chinese government to access the information. (There are also concerns over how TikTok censors its content, but data security seems to be dominating the conversation for now.)Because ByteDance acquired Musi cal .ly, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has jurisdiction here. CFIUS is an agency set up to review foreign investments in the United States. It was created by President Ford in 1975 through an Executive Order. In 1988, the Exon" Florio Amendment to the Defense Production Act of 1950 authorized the president to block foreign investment, and the CFIUS review process was later codified by the Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007. The law authorizes the President to block foreign "mergers, acquisitions, or takeovers" when there is a threat to U.S. national security. The law further clarifies that national security "shall be construed so as to include those issues relating to 'homeland security', including its application to critical infrastructure" and "critical technologies."ByteDance's acquisition of Musi cal .ly did not lead to a CFIUS review, probably because it appeared to carry few national security risks at the time. However, the level of risk the U.S. is willing to take is now lowered, triggering a reevaluation of the ByteDance's acquisition, after the passage of the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 (FIRRMA), as part of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019. FIRRMA broadened CFIUS' s jurisdiction to cover more transactions and adds more factors to consider, including the risk of " expos [ing] personally identifiable information, genetic information, or other sensitive data of U.S. citizens to access by a foreign government or person that may exploit that information to threaten national security," when determining whether a transaction poses a threat to national security. This gives CFIUS the authority to review investments that involve personal data.TikTok is not the first Chinese investment to trigger a CFIUS review because of data security concerns under FIRRMA. The administration has in the past used its authority to force Chinese companies to divest for data security reasons. In 2019, the administration ordered Chinese company iCarbonX to divest its stake in PatientsLikeMe, which was a health tech start" up, to protect user data collected by the company. In the same year, Chinese gaming company Kunlun was forced to divest its investment in Grindr, a gay dating app, due to concerns over data safety. Earlier this year, the administration requested Chinese company Shiji, a leader in hotel technology, to divest its holdings in StayNTouch because the Chinese company "might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States." Judging from these existing cases, the scope for CFIUS intervention on the basis of securing personal data can be very broad.CFIUS has been investigating the ByteDance purchase since last year. Although the investigation is still pending, last week President Trump announced that he would ban the app. After a strong backlash from TikTok users, President Trump put the ban on hold until mid" September. This delay is designed to give Microsoft, or some other U.S. company, time to negotiate the purchase of TikTok from ByteDance. If successful, TikTok will then be wholly owned in the United States and its Chinese roots will be completely cut off. If a deal cannot be reached by mid" September, TikTok will be banned in the United States, because of the national security threat it poses to the United States, according to an Executive Order issued yesterday.Without more information from the administration, it is difficult for outsiders to judge how much of a threat TikTok poses to national security. TikTok says that it stores its data in the United States, with a backup located in Singapore. According to one analysis, TikTok does not appear to gather more user data than U.S. tech companies, such as Facebook, and there is no proof that it is sharing data with the Chinese government.Of course, there is always a possibility that ByteDance will be forced by the Chinese government to hand over data in the future. The administration's fear of Americans' personal information falling into the hands of another government is legitimate, but without evidence, the decision to ban TikTok appears to be excessive. And the response may be expanded as time goes on. For now, the administration is targeting Chinese companies, but it could extend the approach to companies that have minimal ties to China or that are simply deemed to be providing inadequate data protection.Coincidentally, the Court of Justice of the European Union recently invalidated the Privacy Shield framework between the United States and the European Union, which allowed more than 5,300 companies to freely transfer data across the Atlantic. The court ruled that the framework lacked adequate protection of EU citizen's privacy from the U.S. government. Applying the same logic used to ban TikTok, the EU and other countries could ban U.S. companies, such as Google, Facebook and Twitter.The TikTok case also has the potential to fuel tensions and additional distrust between Washington and Beijing. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo already warned that more actions will be taken to deal with other Chinese companies that fall into the realm of the Clean Network program. Details of these actions remain unclear, but President Trump has broad authority to take actions under a variety of statutes, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, as he stated in one Executive order that bans another Chinese social media app WeChat. Citing data security and national security, Beijing could quickly adopt this U.S. practice (as in the trade remedy regime) and use the same logic to conceal protectionist actions. One could argue that China already bans social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook, so there is little room for Beijing to retaliate. However, there are many more American companies that have access to Chinese consumers' information in China. Right now, Beijing requires most data to be stored domestically. Beijing could follow the U.S. precedent and start banning these Americans companies or force them to sell their business to a Chinese firm. The scale of vulnerable companies would be massive. As Tom Braithwaite f rom the Financial Times pointed out, "The great uncoupling would cause huge economic pain to hundreds of US tech companies."Data security is not just a concern of the United States. Many others, including the European Union, are just as concerned. Instead of taking unilateral actions against companies and creating instability in the market, governments should agree on a set of international rules and find a forum for adjudicating potential violations. A possible platform is the e" commerce negotiations at the World Trade Organization. While major economic powers like the United States, European Union, and China are still at odds on what issues should go into the agreement and what the rules should be, the fate of TikTok should serve as a reminder that without a set of common international rules governing data, we will face a fragmented world, rife with uncertainty, that hurts both companies and consumers.Load-Date: August 8, 2020End of Document

Senate Bill Aimed At Chinese Stocks Isn't Derailing EMQQ ETFBenzinga.comAugust 18, 2020 Tuesday 2:30 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Accretive Capital LLC d/b/a Benzinga All Rights ReservedLength: 417 wordsByline: ETF ProfessorBodyWhile the MSCI Emerging Markets Index is flat on the year, some consumer- and internet-heavy emerging markets strategies are accelerating to the upside.What Happened: Take the case of the EMQQ Emerging Markets Internet & Ecommerce ETF(NYSE: EMQQ). Up almost 47% year to date, EMQQ is easily one of 2020's best-performing emerging markets exchange-traded funds.The fund tracks the EMQQ The Emerging Markets Internet & Ecommerce Index and while it's not a dedicated China, stocks from the world's largest internet market account for 61% of the fund's weight.Why It's Important: EMQQ is higher by almost 31% over the past 90 days, a period including the passage of S. 945 - Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, which was passed by the Senate in May. The aim of that bill is to put Chinese companies listed in the U.S. on a level playing field with other firms and to avoid prevent Luckin Coffee-style frauds from happening again.Recently, that legislation moved to the back burner, but with Election Day drawing closer, the bill could take center stage again, particularly as President Trump makes holding China accountable a cornerstone of his reelection bid.Currently, there are 156 U.S.-listed Chinese companies under review, including 11 that are classified as state-controlled enterprises. Of the remaining 145, 100 are considered penny stocks, though the bulk of those names do trade on a major U.S. exchange.What's Next: Breathing new life into the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act could mean a near-term pinch for EMQQ, but it's not all bad news. Public Chinese companies that do not adhere to U.S. accounting rules or disclose government ownership or control, especially by the Chinese Government or Communist Party, run the risk of being de-listed from U.S. securities exchanges if the bill becomes law,  said Kevin Carter, EMQQ founder.  With the US Presidential elections coming up later this year, and growing tension between the US and China, the chances of this happening are increasing. If the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act gets signed into law at some point, a benefit would be it would get rid of some of the dubious Chinese stocks listed in the U.S. while allowing investors to focus on legitimate, quality ideas, including EMQQ holdings. However, investors should welcome this as it could flush-out several  bad-actors  in the space and help validate the rest,  said Carter.© 2020 Benzinga.com.

New Chinese rules could complicate a sale of TikTok's US businessCNN WireAugust 31, 2020 Monday 12:50 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 818 wordsDateline: HONG KONG/ATLANTA (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG/ATLANTA (CNN Business) --  China appears to have complicated efforts to sell TikTok to an American company by introducing new rules that could allow Beijing to veto any potential deal.The twist in the TikTok saga stems from notices published by the Chinese government on Friday, when officials revised rules that govern the sale of certain kinds of technology to foreign buyers. The updated list includes data processing, speech and text recognition --- the kind of tech that experts say is used by the popular short-form video app.The announcement marked the first time those rules have been revised since 2008. China's Ministry of Commerce and Ministry of Science and Technology said the changes were meant to "formalize the management of technology export" and "protect national security." The notices did not name TikTok or its Beijing-based owner ByteDance, but experts have pointed out that the rule change would likely require ByteDance to obtain government permission before it could sell TikTok to a foreign company. State-run news agency Xinhua, for example, this weekend cited trade expert Cui Fan as saying that the revisions would cover a sale of TikTok. ByteDance should "seriously and carefully consider whether it is necessary to suspend substantive negotiations" on a potential deal given the new rules, Cui, a professor at the University of International Business and Economics, told Xinhua.ByteDance General Counsel Erich Andersen said in a statement that the company is studying the new regulations."As with any cross-border transaction, we will follow the applicable laws, which in this case include those of the US and China," he added. Talk of a sale began as President Donald Trump issued executive orders this month threatening to ban the app unless ByteDance sells its US operations in the coming weeks. Trump and other US politicians have said the app poses a threat to national security. TikTok has denied the allegation and sued the Trump administration over one of the orders, calling it "heavily politicized."The app already has a handful of prospective buyers, including Microsoft and Walmart, which have said they are pursuing a joint bid. The tech firm Oracle is reportedly interested as well. Pressure on TikTok right now is immense. Last week, CEO Kevin Mayer resigned after less than four months on the job, citing the "sharply changed" political environment. China's changes to its export control rules are a way for the country "to exert some leverage over the situation," according to Anupam Chander, a law professor at Georgetown University. "It will cause any bidder to pause and wonder how to proceed," he added. Microsoft, Walmart and Oracle declined to comment on the new regulations from China. China has repeatedly pushed back against the Trump administration's treatment of TikTok, calling it "blatant bullying" in the name of national security. The latest move could be posturing by Beijing, said Elena Chachko, lecturer on law at Harvard Law School, who added that the government may be engaging in "a tit-for-tat dynamic."But China is also "making clear that the United States doesn't have full control over the future of US TikTok operations and a potential TikTok sale," she added. The wildly popular app is known for its endless scroll of dancing videos, lip syncing routines and comedy sketches. But there is also valuable technology of global importance that drives the light-hearted content, according to Nathaniel Rushforth, a cybersecurity and data compliance specialist and lawyer with Da Wo Law Firm in Shanghai. "While we're talking about an app that's for cat videos and dancing, there is some interesting underlying technology that any country would want to protect," he said, such as the advanced artificial intelligence algorithms that help make TikTok's feed so addictive. "Beijing wants to protect its ascending status in global technology," said Shirley Yu, visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and founder of an eponymous company that assesses strategy, business, and political risk for companies working in China. If the United States succeeds in forcing TikTok to sell key tech to an American company, "China would be concerned that, as its technology companies continue to ascend, more Chinese companies ... might be targeted by the United States in a similar way," she said. China's desire to protect homegrown technology, however, is not going to prevent the Trump administration from banning TikTok. It could also make it really difficult for ByteDance to sell the app.If the technology underlying TikTok cannot be sold, nobody is going to want to buy it in the United States, Rushforth said."ByteDance and TikTok are really between a rock and a hard place now," he added. -- Steven Jiang and Selina Wang contributed to this report.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

U.S. universities to implement strategies in their courses on China to protect students and professors from the regime's safety lawCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 19, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 662 wordsBodyThe new National Security Act instituted by China criminalizes criticism of the regime - particularly those that call for sanctions or call for Hong Kong independence - even if they are made outside the Asian giant or the former British colony. That's why U.S. universities, including Harvard and Princeton, have anticipated their willingness to design different strategies to ensure that their Chinese policy courses can be developed safely for both students and teachers. As assigned by The Wall Street Journal, those who are part of these courses at Princeton will use codes instead of names to protect their identities; at Amherst, a teacher considers holding classes in anonymous chat rooms so students can argue freely; and Harvard Business School could enable students to excuse themselves from discussing certain topics if they are concerned about possible retaliation. The potential risks of sanctioning Chinese regime law are exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. Considering that many universities will give their courses virtually, at least during the first semester, students in China or Hong Kong would be available to the authorities if material in which they made criticisms ended up in their hands. A student reads under a tree on the Harvard University campus in Cambridge, USA. EFE (CJ GUNTHER/)The possibility of this happening is not nil. In late July, U.S. senators asked the Justice Department to investigate whether the Tik Tok and Zoom applications - widely used to conduct video conferences during the pandemic - shared private information with the regime. "We believe it is imperative that the Department of Justice investigate and determine whether business relationships, data management practices, and operational connections with China from Zoom and TikTok pose a risk to Americans," said Senators Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, and Richard Blumenthal, Connecticut Democrat. In addition, Zoom representatives acknowledged in June that they folded into Communist Party demands and closed the accounts of pro-democracy militants based in the United States and Hong Kong who wanted to use their videoconference application to mark a new anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown. After the reviews were shed, the app assured that it did not provide user information.Nearly 370,000 Chinese students and about 7,000 Hong Kongers enrolled in American universities in the 2018/2019 academic year. The former are at the top of the list of foreign students attending the institutions. According to the aforementioned medium, students often take courses on Chinese politics, culture and law to better understand their country and how the world sees it. The Chinese regime began implementing the law immediately after its passage and has already arrested numerous pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. He has also pointed out of borders: The Wall Street Journal also reported on August 7 that Samuel Chu, a naturalized American Hong Konger, was included in a fugitive list after he advocated for the US Congress to impose sanctions on China for undermining the autonomy of the former British colony. The leader of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping. Photo: DPA (Marcos Correa/Palacio do Planalt/)A student at the University of Minnesota, meanwhile, was sentenced to six months in prison on his return to China, after being found guilty of "provocation" for writing a series of tweets mocking Communist party leaders.  Rory Truex, a professor at Princeton University, said he will rename students to a code to prevent them from being linked to the opinions expressed during their course. "If as a community teaching about China we stop teaching about Tiananmen, Xinjiang or any other sensitive issue that the Chinese government doesn't want us to discuss out of fear, then we're lost," he said.Learn more about this topic: What is China's security law imposed in Hong KongFive alarming aspects of China's new security law in Hong KongLoad-Date: August 20, 2020End of Document

MEKONG RIVER: CHINA PLEDGES TO SHARE DATA ON YEAR-ROUND FLOWStates News ServiceAugust 24, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 909 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:China's prime minister assured five of its Mekong neighbors Monday that Beijing would share year-round data on water flows into the river, a pledge welcomed by the Southeast Asian countries that have received information during the rainy season only and are increasingly impacted by drought and upstream dams.Prime Minister Li Keqiang told a virtual meeting of leaders from Mekong River countries that China had moved cooperation on the river to a "fast track." His announcement followed a report earlier this month from four of the countries that called for increased sharing of information about dams along the waterway."We need to take our cooperation in water resources to a new high. The legitimate rights and interests of all countries in developing and utilizing their water resources as appropriate should be fully respected," Li said according to the text of his speech posted by China's state-run Xinhua news agency."China is ready to provide more help to the best of its ability for the Mekong countries to make better use of water resources. Starting from this year, China will share Lancang River's hydrological data for the whole year," the prime minister said, using the Chinese name for the river.The Mekong, the world's 12th-longest river, stretches through six nations before draining into the South China Sea. Its waters flow from China past Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam, affecting more than 60 million people who depend on the river and its tributaries for food, transportation, and water.Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-o-cha, who participated in Monday's Third Lancang-Mekong Cooperation (LMC) Leaders' virtual meeting, praised the announcement."Premier Li's remark reflects China's genuine commitment to materialize the partnership with the lower Mekong countries," Prayuth said."We are pleased that China has offered to systemically exchange information on full-year water management and the member countries are considering a mechanism to establish information exchanges on the matter," he said during the meeting."Thailand supports China's initiative and wishes to monitor and assess the water management scheme from upstream to downstream, which will leverage practical cooperation and is beneficial to the people along the Mekong in all countries."Meanwhile, the director of Thailand's Office of Natural Water Resources said China was offering to share much more information than it has in the past."They normally share the data during rainy season (May to October), understandably for flood awareness due to rapid changes in tides," Somkiat Prajamwong told BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service. "We never had full-year data and I don't know how they will share it with us and when."Somkiat said China previously provided data every other day during the rainy season.Failure to speak outCambodian prime minister Hun Sen, participating in the meeting, meanwhile failed to speak out over the harm caused to his country by the regulation of water flows by China and Laos on the upper Mekong, experts told RFA following the meeting."Hun Sen kept silent and dared not complain or publicly blame China or Laos," environmental activist and founder of the Mother Nature group Alejandro Gonzales-Davidson said. "And yet he has regularly warned and threatened his own Khmer compatriots, including union leaders and environmental and political activists.""This is merely because he and his ruling Cambodian People's Party owe a huge debt to the Chinese government. This is a huge problem for Cambodia," he said.China is unlikely to keep its promise to share data freely with downstream countries in any case, and would prefer to deal with each of these countries separately than as a regional group, said Witoon Permpongsacharoen, a researcher at the Bangkok-based Energy and Ecology Network."China has never recognized the Mekong River as an international waterway, but has always considered it a domestic one," he said. "Chinese authorities won't keep their promises to share info and data on the Mekong River."Protocol still unclearOfficials have not established the protocol for China to share its data going forward through what is being called the Lancang-Mekong Water Resources Cooperation Information Sharing Platform."Details will be discussed among relevant ministers from the six countries," Thai government spokesman Anucha Burapachaisri told Reuters news service.Li's announcement comes after the Mekong River Commission Thailand Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam issued a report on Aug. 7 urging China and other nations to provide more data about their dams.A series of 11 dams in China and two in Laos along with others in the Mekong's tributaries, alter the river's natural flow significantly, the report said.In April, a U.S. study found that China had compounded the 2019 drought that devastated fishing and farming communities in other nations by restricting water flow from its dams.Satellite measurements of "surface wetness" indicated that the Chinese dams in the Upper Mekong had "above-average" water levels when last year's drought took place in Thailand and other countries downstream, Alan Basist, president of the research company Eyes on Earth Inc., told BenarNews at the time of the report's release.Reported by BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service, with additional reporting by RFA's Khmer and Vietnamese Services.Load-Date: August 25, 2020End of Document

China accuses US of 'abuse' over new measures against HuaweiCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 18, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 345 wordsBodyChina on Tuesday fused new U.S. sanctions against telecom giant Huawei, accusing Washington of applying "domestic power abuse" to block the advance of Chinese companies.On Tuesday, in a statement, Commerce banned 38 Huawei partners from buying U.S.-made computer chips and other technology inputs.Tensions were already high between the two powers, while Washington claims Chinese companies spy for Beijing, which the Chinese government and companies deny.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said tuesday that there is no evidence that Huawei products have security gaps or 'back doors'. The sanctions are against "the principles of market and fair competition that the United States has always promoted," he added.Washington has relied on the "abuse of national power to apply all sorts of restrictions to Huawei and other Chinese companies," he said at a regular press conference.U.S. officials, for their part, argue that Huawei poses a security risk because of its ties to the Beijing government, a claim refuted by the company.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Huawei and its partners "have worked through third parties to capitalize on U.S. technology, undermining the country's national security and foreign policy interests."The Trump administration has banned Huawei from its 5G wireless networks in the United States and pressures its allies to do the same.In the last quarter, Huawei became the world's largest mobile phone manufacturer, largely as a result of its sales in the Chinese market, even when Washington acts to deny the group access to much of Google's Android system.Zhao urged the United States on Tuesday to "correct its mistakes" and noted that China "will continue to take the necessary steps to legitimately protect the rights and interests of its companies."President Donald Trump has also tried to ban the popular TikTok video mobile app, if its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, does not sell it, as well as ordered a ban on the use of the Chinese messaging app WeChat, owned by another tech giant, Tencent.tjx/rox/qan/age/zmLoad-Date: August 19, 2020End of Document

Stanford experts weigh in on Trump administration's potential TikTok banThe Stanford Daily: Stanford UniversityAugust 4, 2020 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 1034 wordsByline: Jessica ZhuBodySince its international release in 2017, TikTok has gained immense traction in the United States, with an estimated 65 to 80 million users nationwide. Its parent company, ByteDance, is based in China - a fact that has led some to question its potential ties to the Chinese Communist Party.As tensions between the United States and China rise, President Donald Trump has warned that Chinese-owned social media app TikTok may be mining users' personal data. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other lawmakers have raised similar concerns, alleging that the app could be legally forced to disclose users' personal data to the Chinese government, constituting a threat to American cybersecurity. After threatening a national ban on the widely popular platform, President Trump softened his stance, giving companies like Microsoft a month to purchase TikTok's U.S. operations. However, the app's future in America remains uncertain.Stanford experts, while unsure that the potential ban would offer significant protection from Chinese cyber threats, note that it serves as a reminder of the escalating battle between the two powerful countries.Andrew Grotto, director of the program on Geopolitics, Technology, and Governance at the Freeman Spogli Institute's Cyber Policy Center and former senior director for cybersecurity policy in both the Obama and Trump Administrations, echoed Secretary Pompeo's warning that TikTok could be weaponized by the Chinese Communist Party to mine American users' personal information."Chinese law grants the Chinese government virtually limitless power to compel companies to comply with government orders, " Grotto wrote in a statement to The Daily. "If the Chinese government decided that mining a company's data was in the state's interests, it would force the company to cooperate and the company would have few, if any, recourse to resist."In contrast, some experts do not consider TikTok's data mining to be a significant threat. These include Thomas Fingar, a fellow at FSI's Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center and former chairman of the National Intelligence Council, who maintains that TikTok does not pose a national security risk."The 'sensitive data' vulnerable to collection via apps like TikTok is limited to personal data posted voluntarily by users," Fingar wrote in a statement to The Daily. "Protecting the personal data of users is important but not usually considered a national security vulnerability."According to Fingar, since virtually all social media platforms gather the same information on their users, TikTok does not pose a risk unique from other Internet sites."The intersection of conventional national security and personal information security occurs when government employees or contractors with sensitive jobs and security clearances have personal data that can be exploited for blackmail or other purposes to persuade them to violate their obligations to protect national security information," he said. "To the extent that this is a threat, it is one that applies to any apps that collect and store personal information, not only to TikTok."Others agree with Fingar. Technology columnist for the Washington Post Geoffrey Fowler wrote that "TikTok doesn't appear to grab any more personal information than Facebook. That's still an appalling amount of data to mine about the lives of Americans.""But there's scant evidence that TikTok is sharing our data with China, and we should be wary of xenophobia dressed up as privacy concerns," he added.Even if TikTok does threaten American cybersecurity, Grotto expressed skepticism that a national ban would significantly safeguard personal data."It would result in some margin of additional security, though it's not at all clear how significant a margin it would be, and thus whether an outright ban is an appropriately proportionate response to the risk," he said.President Trump's authority to impose a ban in the first place has also been questioned. While he told reporters aboard Air Force One that he could use emergency economic powers or an executive order, the American Civil Liberties Union voiced concerns about government overreach."Banning an app like TikTok, even if it were legal, threatens our freedom of speech and doesn't fix the broader issue of surveillance," the legal advocacy organization wrote in a tweet.A potential Tik Tok ban, while not a defining moment in the conflict between the United States and China, is indicative of a worsening relationship between the two, noted Fingar."It would be one more straw on the camel's back," he said. "By itself, it would not do much to hurt the relationship, but the Chinese government and social media will highlight and exaggerate it as one more bit of evidence of malign U.S. government intent and unwarranted efforts to 'contain' China.""It would also fuel the narrative gaining traction in the U.S., thanks in large part to the Trump administration, that anything associated with China is 'bad' or threatening," he added.Grotto confirms that this adversarial political trend will continue to play a huge role in American foreign policy: "It is a reminder of how wide the gulf has grown. American policy makers from across the political spectrum are fundamentally rethinking the U.S. relationship with China.""The process began in the last year or so of the Obama administration, accelerated under Trump, and will be a defining challenge for the next President, whether Trump or Biden," he added.Contact Jessica Zhu at jesszhu 'at' stanford.edu..css-10w0hkr{margin:0 auto;width:100%;}@media (min-width:1100px){.css-10w0hkr{width:650px;}}While you're here...We're a student-run organization committed to providing hands-on experience in journalism, digital media and business for the next generation of reporters.

Q&A: TikTok saga continues with Microsoft talks. Now what?Associated Press InternationalAugust 3, 2020 Monday 9:01 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; DOMESTIC NEWS; POLITICAL NEWSLength: 1135 wordsByline: TALI ARBEL, AP Technology WriterDateline: NEW YORK BodyNEW YORK (AP) — The latest twist in the TikTok saga is an especially strange turn in a tale filled with strange turns. Suddenly, Microsoft — known primarily for work software like Windows and Office — is in talks to buy the popular Chinese-owned video app, which has raised national-security concerns for U.S. officials.The U.S. government is effectively forcing ByteDance, TikTok’s owner, to sell so it can salvage the app in the U.S., a huge and valuable market. President Donald Trump has threatened a “ban” on TikTok and other administration officials and U.S. lawmakers of both parties have said the app's Chinese ownership is a concern.It’s unclear what shape such a ban would take or whether the sale will go through. TikTok’s users are posting videos saying they are upset and angry. Here's what’s at stake.Q. What is TikTok again?A. The app is a home for fun, goofy videos that are easy to make and to watch. That's made it immensely popular, particularly with young people, and U.S. tech giants like Facebook and Snapchat see it as a competitive threat. TikTok says it has 100 million U.S. users and hundreds of millions globally. It has its own influencer culture, allowing people to make a living from posting videos on the service, and hosts ads from major U.S. companies.ByteDance Ltd., a Chinese company, launched TikTok in 2017, then bought Musical.ly, a video service popular with teens in the U.S. and Europe, and combined the two. A twin service, Douyin, is available for Chinese users.Q. What concerns U.S. officials about the app?A. TikTok, like most other social networks, collects data about its users and moderates what's posted. It grabs people’s locations and messages they send one another, for example, and tracks what people watch in order to know what kinds of videos they like and how best to target ads to them.Similar behavior has raised concerns about American social networks, but Chinese ownership adds an additional wrinkle, because the Chinese government can demand that companies help it gather intelligence. In the case of TikTok, this remains a hypothetical threat, said Samm Sacks, a researcher at Yale Law School’s Paul Tsai China Center — but it could be happening.TikTok has vowed that U.S. user data is not stored in China and that it would not hand over user data to the government. But experts have said that if the Chinese government wants information, it will get it. The U.S. government has also cracked down on Chinese telecom companies Huawei and ZTE because of this worry. The companies deny that they facilitate spying.There are also concerns about TikTok censoring videos critical of China, which TikTok denies, or pushing propaganda. Advocates in the U.S. also say the company is violating children’s privacy laws.Q. Is the threat from TikTok unique?A. No. China’s economic espionage is a well-known threat, and similar user data concerns were raised about Huawei, the telecom equipment maker. The Chinese military or groups with ties to it are accused of massive hacks of sensitive information from credit bureau Equifax and the federal Office of Personnel Management.But several experts say that the U.S. government is lashing out at Chinese tech companies without taking significant steps to protect Americans' privacy with federal legislation and while working to undermine encryption, which allows secure communications that can't be easily read by outsiders.“We’re trying to solve the issue of how you manage all the security risk that comes from massive data collection in an unregulated space, and we’re trying to solve it by playing whack-a-mole with different Chinese companies that we see as threats," Sacks said. "We get into dangerous territory where the U.S. government is controlling what Americans can and can’t do.... This is technonationalism.”Trump may also have reason to personally dislike TikTok, which has started to join the U.S. political conversation. In June, young people carried out a campaign on TikTok and other apps to troll the president by artificially boosting expected turnout for a Trump rally in Oklahoma. Sarah Cooper, a comedian who lip-syncs Trump’s statements in videos that make him look ridiculous, is a TikTok star.Q. Would a purchase by Microsoft address the administration’s concerns?A. “I think the security concern frankly has come down to the parent company is Chinese and that’s what U.S. lawmakers have a problem with,” Sacks said. If that’s the issue, a Microsoft deal would solve the problem.In remarks to reporters Monday, Trump said he supported such an arrangement. He said “we’ll close down (TikTok) on September 15 unless Microsoft or somebody else is able to buy it.” He said such a deal would require that the U.S. government “gets a lot of money” because it’s enabling the deal to happen. But not everyone in the White House may be in agreement; presidential trade adviser Peter Navarro said on Fox News Monday that the deal was a problem because of Microsoft's operations in China.Q. So, Microsoft might buy TikTok? Really?A. Really. Other potential Big Tech buyers, especially Facebook and Google, would likely face antitrust concerns if they tried to buy TikTok.Microsoft does already own the professional and job-hunting site LinkedIn, and it is the No. 4 digital ad company in the U.S., after Google, Facebook and Amazon. But TikTok would be a sharp change in direction away from workplace services for Microsoft.Q. What happens next?A. Microsoft is in talks with ByteDance and plans to complete those by Sept. 15. Any deal may involve other American investors as well.Microsoft’s plan would be to own and operate TikTok in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. That might complicate things if the service has different owners in different parts of the world.Q. How would a ban of TikTok work, anyway?A. That’s also not clear. TikTok could have been put on a Commerce Department list, like Huawei is, that cuts it off from business with U.S. companies. That could mean it wouldn’t work on the Apple and Google app stores. But it’s an unprecedented situation for a consumer app.“Never in our history since we’ve had app stores on smartphones have I been able to find an example where an app was actually banned by the U.S. government,” said Theresa Payton, the former White House Chief Information Officer and CEO of a cybersecurity consultancy.Q. What are the political consequences for a ban on TikTok?A. Tensions between China and the U.S. have been increasing over trade policy, diplomatic relations and cybersecurity concerns. The U.S. has pressed allies to crack down on Huawei and imposed sanctions. Trump has also misleadingly blamed China for the coronavirus pandemic, calling it the “China virus.”__AP Reporter Zeke Miller contributed to this report from Washington, D.C.Load-Date: August 3, 2020End of Document

CHINESE ENTREPRENEURS SUPPORT MEXICO WITH DONATIONS TO PANDEMIC COVID-19 TO BOOST ECONOMIC REVIVAL: ZHENGJIE ZHAOCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 3, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 664 wordsBodyAfter released that China's Jiangsu Chamber of Commerce in Mexico donated one hundred thousand dog covers worth one million pesos to the Government of Mexico City, which heads Claudia Sheinbaum, Vice-President of Chamber, Zhengjie Zhao, stated that the goal of the Chinese government and the more than 300 companies added to this Asian dome is to support the country in the face of this pandemic in order to boost economic recovery in the small and medium-sized companies as well as fixed and semi-fixed trading."What the Chamber of Commerce is interested in reviving the economy in Mexico City as well as in all the states of the Republic where medical supplies are needed to be used because more than profiting we seek to support the country," he said, detailing that this third donation comes from a Chinese Shein company dedicated to the manufacture and sale of Fhasion online clothing better known as E-commerce.The objective, he said, beyond the business that the Chinese have in this House is to contribute in times of crisis as is the PANDemia COVID-19 and therefore it is important for us as traders that there is access to medical and surgical supplies in Mexico so those from China will be channeled to the right places Stressed.Vice President of the Jiangsu Chamber of Commerce of China in Mexico, Zhengjie Zhao, stated that the delivery of this surgical material was made directly to the head of Mexico City's Ministry of Economic Development, Fadlala Akabani Hneide.The Ministry of Economic Development of Mexico City has considered the delivery of these covers for the health sector of the capital of the country as well as their dispersion in different dependencies of the CDMX, detailed.He stated that a Donation Agreement was signed with such dependency so it is hoped that there will be a good distribution and evenhad discussed the possibility of the coverers also reaching the Abasto Central as well as public markets, markets on wheels and tianguis as the aim is to boost the City's internal economy to ensure its revival in the face of this pandemic.This was because the first agreement for this donation envisaged the delivery of cover to the Abasto Central in Mexico City but then the distribution lines were rescheduled.In this way, now with the official delivery to Sedeco will be made the timely designation of such surgical material to hospitals and health sector, remarked.He detailed that it is important for the House to publicize the social sense that Chinese entrepreneurs have for episodes of health crises like this so that it announced three other installments in different states of the Mexican Republic.Zhengjie Zhao detailed, in that sense, that there will be two deliveries in the state of Coahuila and one in Zacatecas and recalled that "before this donation we have already made other donations to Monterrey and Zacatecas but to the municipality of Guadalupe as well as to a private hospital... That's how we've supported."So far 110,000 cover covers have been delivered, counting the previous deliveries plus those made to the Secretariat for Economic Development.The head covers are Tricapa and thermosealed, which although they have a short lifespan, can be used three times, it is also true that they serve to protect people who use it from this health risk.Shein's company dedicated to the manufacture and sale of Fhasión online clothing better known as E-commerce is not dedicated to marketing medical products, he clarified.And is that, he said, donation actions do not necessarily come from companies dedicated to medical supplies since any company interested in supporting can do it, so we havedonations in kind and mainly are covers from companies engaged in technological development, video surveillance and textile production.The Jiangsu Chamber of Commerce of China in Mexico has more than 250 companies in the Asian country affiliated while in our country its membership exceeds 50 companies among large, small and medium-sized.Load-Date: August 4, 2020End of Document

QANDA: TIKTOK BAN UNDERSCORES THE NEED FOR BETTER DATA LEGISLATION, HOME AND ABROADStates News ServiceAugust 12, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1146 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: Charlottesville, VA BodyThe following information was released by the University of Virginia:Whitelaw ReidLast week, President Donald Trump, citing national security concerns, signed executive orders seeking a ban on TikTok, the immensely popular smartphone app, based in China, in which users create and share and videos, often incorporating singing and dancing and showing off other talents.Everyone from your 12-year-old niece to highly successful recording artist Jason Derulo is holding their breath but the ramifications run much deeper than whether Americans have ways to entertain themselves during quarantines necessitated by the pandemic.The orders, set to take effect Sept. 20, prohibit any transactions with TikTok or WeChat (another China-based app) by any person or involving any property subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.According to media reports, the orders have essentially set a deadline for an acquisition of TikTok by a U.S.-based company, which is in talks to be acquired by Microsoft.To get a better handle on what is going on, UVA Today turned to Aynne Kokas, a University of Virginia media studies associate professor whose work focuses on the intersections between Chinese and U.S. media and technology industries.Q. For those who may not be following developments that closely, can you break down what is happening here?A. TikTok, a popular social media platform that was downloaded record-breaking 67 million times in the first quarter of 2020, is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance. Due to concerns about data gathering by the Chinese government, the Trump administration issued an executive order on Aug. 6 to block transactions with the firm. This means that U.S. users and U.S. companies won't legally be able to use TikTok after Sept. 15.WeChat, a popular Chinese social media platform with an estimated 19 million users in the United States, was also subject to a similar executive order blocking transactions with the firm.The TikTok executive order has gotten the most press because of the platform's huge popularity in the U.S. However, it may prove to be less of an issue for users. ByteDance is in talks to sell the platform to Microsoft, which could ensure continuity for TikTok teens and others.The blocking of WeChat, by contrast, could cause much more disruption. WeChat is central to doing business with and communicating with China. It is also the crown jewel of Chinese tech giant Tencent's empire. The possibility of the firm divesting WeChat is nil. Plus, no U.S. firm would be allowed to run a company that dominates China's social media landscape. Thus, U.S. companies and private WeChat users will be in a difficult situation after Sept. 15. Transactions with WeChat will no longer be allowed if the executive order stands. Enforcement, however, is another issue. After all, the U.S. does not have a Great Firewall like China.Q. How do the purported data privacy issues and concerns with TikTok compare to ones that everybody is always talking about at Facebook and Google?A. In some ways, the risks are similar. My media studies colleague, Siva Vaidhyanathan, clearly articulates the dangers of private companies gathering and integrating huge amounts of user data in his books "The Googlization of Everything" (University of California Press, 2012) and "Antisocial Media" (Oxford University Press, 2018).However, with Google and Facebook, which are domiciled in the United States, there is a tension between corporate aggregation of data and government utilization of that data. Because of how Chinese national security laws are written, Chinese firms don't have the same tools to push back against government data-gathering.In addition to the issues with corporate data-gathering that we have here in the U.S., there are additional concerns that the Chinese government could use the platforms to advance Chinese national interests. One issue suggested by the executive orders is the use of data for intelligence-gathering purposes. Another concern is the possibility of censoring political information or spreading misinformation on the platform as we have seen occurring on Chinese social media.From a trade standpoint, there is also the issue of asymmetrical market access. Bytedance, until recently, has been able to operate around the world. Google and Facebook have been systematically blocked from the Chinese market. When social media platforms are able to grow because of their scale, it is a huge national advantage to be able to operate in markets where your competitors are locked out.Q. In your opinion, do you think American citizens have cause for concern when it comes to using TikTok or other China-based smartphone apps?A. Yes. TikTok, for example, has a terrible record on preserving consumer data. It has already received a historically large fine from the Federal Trade Commission for violating the privacy of children. There are numerous active lawsuits alleging the firm is sending sensitive data back to China. Security researchers have found multiple instances of censorship. And we also know that TikTok gathers extensive personal data, which it argues that it stores in the U.S. and Singapore. However, the firm's engineering operations (which require access to user data) are based in Beijing.Researchers at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto have identified extensive surveillance efforts on users of WeChat even located outside of China.Q. In a recent piece for the Washington Post, you mentioned how data exfiltration extends beyond entertainment platforms, and you used Zoom as an example. Is this all a pretty slippery slope?A. The way that Chinese data security laws are written, any firm with operations in China is subject to the Chinese government conducting a review of the data that they are gathering and storing. I used the example of Zoom because we are all using it so regularly, but there are numerous other examples that I am writing about in my upcoming book.Q. Some experts are predicting retaliation from China. What could that look like? And how do you think all this winds up playing out?A. I think that retaliation is a given. This was a big hit. I think that the biggest potential victim of Chinese retaliation could be Apple. They are already in a precarious position in the market. However, one of the most concerning parts of erosion of U.S.-China relations is that both sides are acting unpredictably. Even though we have substantial differences, a stable relationship between the two countries is necessary for a peaceful and secure world.Q. Anything else you'd like to add?A. I would just urge readers to reach out to their Congresspeople to share their concerns about the importance of comprehensive U.S. data security legislation. While China highlights the importance of this issue, Americans have inadequate personal protection, even from countries based in the U.S.Load-Date: August 13, 2020End of Document

TRUMP SETS CLOCK TICKING FOR TIKTOKStates News ServiceAugust 1, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 794 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WHITE HOUSE BodyThe following information was released by the Voice of America (VOA):By Steve HermanUpdated August 01, 2020 08:07 PMWHITE HOUSE - U.S. President Donald Trump played 18 holes of golf Saturday after threatening to halt operations in the United States of a popular Chinese-owned video-sharing social media app.The White House said it had "very serious national security concerns over TikTok. We continue to evaluate future policy."Late Friday, the president said he would likely use an executive order to prohibit the app."As far as TikTok is concerned, we're banning them from the United States," he told reporters Friday night as they traveled with him from Florida on Air Force One. He indicated he would take action as soon as the following day.However, a casually dressed Trump was seen Saturday morning by VOA departing the West Wing for his private 325-hectare golf club located 40 kilometers northwest of the White House.Trump had also told reporters on the flight back home that he did not support a deal that would allow a U.S. company to buy TikTok's American operations.Microsoft and other U.S. companies, in recent days, reportedly have been looking to purchase the U.S. operations of TikTok.Microsoft put its discussions on hold following reporting of the president's stance, The Wall Street Journal said.Hugely popularThe app is extremely popular globally. It has been downloaded 2 billion times worldwide, including 165 million times in the United States.The app features not only entertainment videos but also debates, and it takes positions on political issues, such as racial justice and the coming U.S. presidential election.Officials in Washington are concerned that TikTok may pose a security threat, fearing the company might share users' data with China's government.When asked by Fox News last month whether Americans should download the app onto their phones, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, "Only if you want your private information in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party."TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, has said it does not share user data with the Chinese government and maintains that it stores U.S. user data only in the U.S. and Singapore. ByteDance has agreed to divest the U.S. operations of TikTok completely in a bid to save a deal with the White House, the Reuters news agency reported Saturday.TikTok also recently chose former Disney executive Kevin Mayer as its chief executive in a move seen as an effort to distance itself from Beijing.TikTok General Manager Venessa Pappas uploaded a video Saturday reassuring users that "we're not going anywhere" and noting that the platform has 1,500 employees in the United States and has been planning on bringing an additional 10,000 jobs into the country over the next three years.ACLU blasts banTrump's proposed ban is opposed by the American Civil Liberties Union."Banning an app that millions of Americans use to communicate with each other is a danger to free expression and is technologically impractical," said Jennifer Granick, the ACLU's surveillance and cybersecurity counsel."With any internet platform, we should be concerned about the risk that sensitive private data will be funneled to abusive governments, including our own. But shutting one platform down, even if it were legally possible to do so, harms freedom of speech online and does nothing to resolve the broader problem of unjustified government surveillance," Granick told VOA.The U.S. government's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), an interagency group led by the Treasury Department, opened a national security review of TikTok last year.CFIUS's job is to oversee foreign investments and assess them for potential national security risks. It can force companies to cancel deals or institute other measures it deems necessary for national security.China could retaliate."It could take the nuclear option, like banning Apple. Or, it may start to double down on initiatives like the STAR exchange [launched to make China technologically independent]," Abishur Prakash of the Center for Innovating the Future in Toronto, told VOA."The biggest mistake the West has made is playing its most powerful card too soon banning Chinese companies from the richest markets in the world. This is a long-term fight and the TikTok saga is just the beginning," predicted Prakash, a geopolitical futurist.Pranksters' actvititySome on social media are accusing Trump of singling out TikTok because pranksters used the app to order hundreds of thousands of tickets to his June 20 rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which attracted a smaller-than-expected crowd. TikTok is also where comedian Sarah Cooper posts her videos lip-synced to Trump sound bites, which have attracted millions of views.Load-Date: August 2, 2020End of Document

The TikTok Ban: Eliminating a National Security Threat or Limiting Free Speech?Cornell Daily Sun: Cornell UniversityAugust 20, 2020 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 1076 wordsByline: Angela DemaralBodyOver one-tenth of 'Generation Z' checks the TikTok app on a daily basis, but Cornell students and other young Americans could lose access to the app as soon as next month if a United States-based buyer fails to materialize.On Aug. 6, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that would prohibit Americans from doing business with ByteDance, the parent company of the rapidly growing social media platform that has increasingly come under fire for its close ties with the Chinese government.The move comes as lawmakers from both parties have claimed that the app's Chinese ownership may pose a significant threat to national security. In late July, the House of Representatives voted 336-71 to ban Federal employees from using TikTok on government-issued devices.Senate Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said that the app is "subject to Chinese Communist Party laws that may require handing over data to their government. A safe way must be found for TikTok to continue."However, John Dombrowski '23, a Cornell TikToker with over 2.6 million followers, said that he felt Trump's decision had little to do with cybersecurity and everything to do with the backlash that his administration has received through the platform.Some experts and content creators have also criticized Trump's ban of the app as an attack on free speech, comparing it to censorship similar to that utilized in China."I think that banning a social media app that has a large amount of criticism towards [Trump] ... is very indicative of a mass attempt at censorship of things he doesn't like, which is the epitome of anti-Americanism," Dombrowski said. "I think that it would definitely be a massive infringement on free speech, especially on younger generations."A ban of TikTok could also impact American individuals who have made money from gaining popularity on the app."When I first heard that the TikTok ban was happening, I thought that I was losing my only source of income," said Dombrowski. "It definitely affects my ability to attend Cornell because I'm just starting to make money for something that I've invested the past year into."After seeing recent increases in educational content on TikTok, some people have begun to view the app as an educational and informational resource for Generation Z rather than a platform based solely around entertainment."I think that people have this misconception about all of the content that's being put out ... I've educated people on the ocean, how to take care of your skin and dangerous marketing practices," said Dombrowski. "Banning TikTok wouldn't just have monetary impacts, but would be a huge disservice to education - particularly to youth education."Prof. Eli Friedman, industrial and labor relations, was also against banning TikTok due to cybersecurity concerns."I think that banning TikTok is probably not the right answer to that," Friedman said. "Maybe government or regulatory action is the right step to take to ensure that data is stored safely."To ensure that any data collected from the app is secure and utilized ethically, TikTok hired Kevin Mayer, a former Disney executive, as CEO in June. In July, the company also launched a "transparency center" where content policy and security experts can virtually tour TikTok's algorithm and content policies.But national security experts and prominent politicians express a number of concerns about the Chinese-owned app, one of which being that TikTok may be forced to hand over its user data to the Chinese government based on the country's national security laws. The app has also been found to have security gaps that allow hackers to gain control of private TikTok accounts. A third, larger concern with TikTok is its potential to limit free speech and influence global conversations on the Internet - the company has been criticized for restricting content on the app that is critical of the Chinese government.However, according to Prof. Connie Yuan, communication, Trump's order is rooted primarily in political motivation - not genuine concern over national security."From Trump's perspective, it's not enough," Yuan said. "It doesn't matter who you hire. This is political. Regardless of what you do, they have a political agenda. They will always find an issue as the reason to give an executive order."Despite TikTok's efforts to ensure that ethical data practices are being upheld, Trump stated that the only way to avoid a ban of TikTok would be for Microsoft to bid on the app. Several Microsoft employees have come forward in opposition of the forced sale of TikTok to the multinational technology company, calling it unethical.Friedman explained another possible reason behind Trump's decision to ban TikTok and force its sale to Microsoft."There's no question that TikTok is very profitable and has a lot of growth potential," stated Friedman. "If the U.S. government ... forces the sale [of TikTok] to an American company, then they just transferred a potentially very profitable enterprise from a Chinese company to an American company."Yuan stated that American companies, too, are likely participating in some of ByteDance's unethical data practices. She said, "Google is collecting similar information from everyone across the world who has downloaded the Google app, so American companies are doing the same thing."Friedman explained the difference between the U.S. and China's views on data mining and censorship, emphasizing the importance of looking at the development of increasingly scattered visions of technology in the last decade."On the one hand, we have the American tech company-led vision, which is more or less laissez-faire. It says that we should have free flow of information and governments should not get involved in regulating the information," explained Friedman. "The Chinese government has a very different idea ... the basic idea there is that governments have national interests and they can enforce those interests on the internet."Friedman said that this context is important for the future of free speech because Trump proposing to ban TikTok suggests that the Chinese view of Internet sovereignty is how the Internet should be viewed."I think [China] uses its censorship to nefarious ends, but the American version is also not all that appealing," said Friedman. "It's not to say that there should be no controls, but the political content of our speech should at least be protected on the Internet."Load-Date: August 20, 2020End of Document

Category I CPT codes 93XX0 - 93XX7 will replace Category III temporary CPT codes 0295T - 0298T as the primary codes that iRhythm uses to seek reimbursement for its Zio XT service. The eight new Category I CPT codes were split between two sets of four with rates tied to wear-time of greater than 48 hours and up to 7 days, and for greater than 7 days up to 15 days. These additional codes were established to define the associated time and work to monitor, detect, and identify cardiac disease over longer periods of time which has been shown to lead to higher detection rates. At this time, the company expects that the new CPT codes will be adopted by all U.S. payors for reporting purposes beginning January 1, 2021 when the new codes become effective.iRhythm has analyzed the impact of the Proposed Rule and new codes on its business and has initially determined that if the new codes had been implemented as currently proposed, the impact to its revenues would be slightly positive based on full year 2019 Zio XT volume and wear-time mix.16:45LC Lending Club misses by $0.06, misses on revs (5.30 +0.07)Reports Q2 (Jun) loss of $0.60 per share, $0.06 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.54); revenues fell 77.0% year/year to $43.9 mln vs the $59.53 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Loan origination volume fell 90% yr/yr.16:44OEC Orion Engineered Carbons beats by $0.12, beats on revs (10.63 +0.10)Reports Q2 (Jun) loss of $0.14 per share, $0.12 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.26); revenues fell 49.2% year/year to $202.6 mln vs the $180.02 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Volumes declined by 42.0%, or 113.5 kmt, to 156.9 kmt, year over year, with lower demand in both segments and in all regions, due to the effects of COVID-19 on the overall global economy.Adjusted EBITDA of $15.2 million compared to $71.5 million in the second quarter of 2019.Outlook: "We cannot predict the ultimate course of COVID-19 or the ensuing pace and shape of the recovery in our end markets.

The Nasdaq Composite (+0.4%) kept pace with the benchmark index to close at a record high, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.6%) and Russell 2000 (+0.7%) outperformed.According to media reports, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said negotiators are no closer to a deal than a week ago while Senator Perdue (R-GA) estimated that stimulus talks could last an additional two weeks. While discouraging, the broad market was not deterred by the news, as nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors closed higher.The energy sector rose 2.5% amid higher oil prices ($41.68/bbl, +0.66, +1.6%), followed by gains in the real estate (+1.4%), utilities (+1.4%), and materials (+1.3%) sectors. The health care (-0.5%) and financials (-0.4%) sectors were the lone holdouts.Financial stocks were pressured by some curve-flattening activity in the Treasury market, which reflected some growth-related angst given that lawmakers remained divided over stimulus talks. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 0.12%, while the 10-yr yield fell five basis points to 0.52%.Within the tech space, Microsoft (MSFT 213.29, -3.25, -1.5%) cooled off from yesterday's TikTok-driven rally, while Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 85.04, +7.37) surged 9.5% to fresh record highs.

Both parks will be open through November 1.Due to the diminishing number of calendar days left in the 2020 operating season, as well as limited visibility from state and local officials as to when park openings will be possible, four parks -- California's Great America, Carowinds, Kings Dominion and Valleyfair -- will remain closed for the rest of 2020.Canada's Wonderland near Toronto and Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park, California, the company's only year-round park, will remain in a state of readiness as park teams continue their dialogue with authorities about the possibility of opening.16:19WW WW misses by $0.51, misses on revs (26.52 -0.34)Reports Q2 (Jun) earnings of $0.20 per share, $0.51 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.71; revenues fell 9.6% year/year to $333.6 mln vs the $342.13 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.End of Period Digital Subscribers at all-time high and up 23% yr/yr.Total Paid Weeks in Q2 2020 were up 5.1% versus the prior year period, driven by Digital growth across all major geographic markets.16:19MCHP Microchip beats by $0.12, beats on revs; guides Q2 EPS in-line, revs in-line (107.32 )Reports Q1 (Jun) earnings of $1.56 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.12 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.44; revenues fell 1.7% year/year to $1.31 bln vs the $1.29 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

NVX-CoV2373, the company's recombinant COVID-19 vaccine candidate adjuvanted with Matrix-M, was generally well-tolerated and elicited robust antibody responses numerically superior to that seen in human convalescent sera. The Phase 1 portion of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluated two doses of Novavax' COVID-19 vaccine across two dose levels (5 and 25 g) in 131 healthy adults ages 18-59 years.NVX-CoV2373 was generally well-tolerated and had a reassuring safety profile.The vaccine induced neutralization titers in 100% of participants.Both 5 g and 25 g adjuvanted doses generated peak geometric mean titer greater than 1:3,300.All subjects developed anti-spike IgG antibodies after a single dose of vaccine, many of them also developing wild-type virus neutralizing antibody responses, and after Dose 2, 100% of participants developed wild-type virus neutralizing antibody responses. Both anti-spike IgG and viral neutralization responses compared favorably to responses from patients with clinically significant COVID-19 disease. Importantly, the IgG antibody response was highly correlated with neutralization titers, demonstrating that a significant proportion of antibodies were functional.

Georgia Senator David Perdue said in the early afternoon that stimulus negotiations could take another two weeks, but the Treasury market was not surprised by that revelation. The greenback rallied in overnight action, but the U.S. Dollar Index (93.41, -0.14, -0.2%) surrendered its gain as the day went on.

The Reserve Bank of Australia left its cash rate and its 3-yr yield target at 0.25%. The central bank plans to resume its bond purchases tomorrow. Japan's July Tokyo CPI increased 0.6% yr/yr (last 0.3%) while Tokyo Core CPI rose 0.4% yr/yr (expected 0.2%; last 0.2%). South Korea's July CPI was unchanged m/m (expected 0.1%; last 0.2%), rising 0.3% yr/yr (expected 0.4%; last 0.0%). Australia's June Retail Sales increased 2.7% m/m (expected 2.4%; last 16.9%). June trade surplus totaled AUD8.20 bln (expected surplus of AUD8.80 bln; prior surplus of AUD8.025 bln) as imports rose 1% m/m (last -6%) while exports increased 3% m/m (last -4%). Eurozone's June PPI rose 0.7% m/m (expected 0.5%; last -0.6%), falling 3.7% yr/yr (expected -3.9%; last -5.0%). Swiss Q3 SECO Consumer Climate improved to -30 from -56. Today's Data: Factory orders in June increased 6.2% m/m (Briefing.com consensus 5.2%) following a downwardly revised 7.7% increase (from 8.0%) in May. The back-to-back monthly increases follow a 13.5% decline in April. The key takeaway from the report is the affirmation that business spending picked up in June as economies reopened, evidenced by a 3.4% increase in new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft that was up slightly from the 3.3% increase noted in the Advance Durable Goods Orders report.

The current S&P CapitalIQ consensus is for TWLO to swing to a non-GAAP loss of $(0.08) per share vs a $0.03 profit last year. Revenue is expected to grow 34% yr/yr to $368.8 mln. TWLO develops APIs that are used by its customers to plug communication abilities (phone calls, text messaging via SMS, video etc.) into their apps. For example, if you're taking an Uber or a Lyft and you call/message the driver from inside the app, you're using Twilio.We do not think it's wise to automatically expect a loss from TWLO. Analysts were expecting an even larger loss in Q1 and TWLO posted a surprise profit. The $0.17 upside was TWLO's largest ever since its IPO debut in mid-2016. In terms of the pandemic impact, TWLO says it was built for these times.Protecting customers and employees from unnecessary in-person contact has become a top priority for many businesses. For example, Twilio's programmable video allows healthcare providers to launch a video visit with a patient. TWLO also provides Comcast (CMCSA) as an example, which is using its voice/video technology so techs can interact with customers remotely. The sharp increase in usage showed up in the numbers, which were pretty eye-popping in Q1.Demand for Twilio's APIs was already very strong, fueled by consumers being more on the go and wanting a more robust communication platform in the apps provided by the services they use. However, the pandemic has caused this demand to accelerate even further as in-person contact becomes taboo these days. The stock has been making a monster move since the Q1 report in early May, up 125% since then, as investors now realize how the pandemic and social distancing is actually good for a company like TWLO. (PVIEW)14:44TALKX Market Briefing: Stimulus doubts interrupt market gainsThe idea that the market is at increased risk of a setback because the mega-cap stocks seem to be at increased risk of a pullback is one that is percolating and keeping some prospective buyers on edge. However, the Dow, Nasdaq, and S&P 500 all took a quick step lower in recent action following news that Senator David Perdue (R-GA) noted stimulus talks could last an additional two weeks.This is not the news a lot of people want to hear, as another fiscal stimulus package is considered to be integral to shoring up the economy at this time of great uncertainty. Any undue delay means enhanced unemployment benefits, direct stimulus payments, and small business loans will not make into the hands of many people and businesses still reliant on such support.That support has been deemed a major driver of the recovery off the March lows, as it helped facilitate increased consumer spending. Hence, the lack of further stimulus now is seen as a major deterrent for consumer spending, which in turn can translate into major earnings disappointments and more layoffs in the near future.That consideration has undone most of today's gains for the major indices and has provided fuel for a Treasury market that has been trading with a demeanor that reflects such growth concerns.As the Dow, Nasdaq, and S&P 500 have fallen to their lows for the day, the 10-yr note yield has dropped back to its lows for the day (0.51%) and is flirting with its all-time low closing yield of 0.50% seen in March.The Russell 2000 is up 0.5%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average is flat; the S&P 500 is down 0.2%; and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.4%.14:33COMDX Energy Settlement PricesSep Crude Oil futures rose $0.92 (2.24%) to $41.93/barrel Sep Natural Gas $0.08 higher (3.81%) at $2.181/MMBtu Sep RBOB Gasoline settled $0.01 higher (0.45%) at $1.2186/gallon Sep Heating oil futures settled $0.02 higher (1.89%) at $1.2644/gallon14:03WEN Wendy's: Earnings Preview -- MCD weak quarter makes us nervous but WEN's breakfast launch has been strong (23.60 +0.55)Wendy's (WEN) is set to report Q2 results tomorrow before the open with a call to follow at 8:30am ET. Current consensus is for EPS of $0.11 and revenue of $411.3 mln. Do not expect any guidance as WEN has already withdrawn its 2020 outlook as well as its 2021-2024 Long-Term Outlook.Before digging into what to expect for Q2, an important difference is worth noting. While McDonald's (MCD) is a true global brand, WEN is much more US-centric with 86% of its restaurants in the US with 14% spread out in 30 foreign countries, with Canada being it largest international market. Investors may be surprised that Wendy's has no locations in Europe although that's an expansion target soon.The quarter should not be a total surprise as Wendy's provided an intra-quarter update in June. Probably what stood out most to us was a stabilization in same store comps.We were disappointed with McDonald's Q2 earnings report in late July. MCD reported a $0.10 EPS miss and slight upside revenue. Also, US comps came in at -8.7% which were a bit weak, in our view. MCD showed improvement each month with US comps, but we were disappointed that June did not get positive. Breakfast has been the main laggard for MCD.MCD's lackluster Q2 report makes us a bit nervous about WEN's report tomorrow. However, an advantage that WEN has is that it launched its breakfast menu on March 1 with good success. Plus it's lapping zero breakfast sales last year, so breakfast sales are all added gravy to the comps.Finally, a high profile problem for WEN was a disruption in beef supply in early May as beef suppliers faced production challenges. Some menu items were occasionally in short supply. WEN says it shifted its marketing efforts to focus on chicken, which was a smart move. The good news is that beef supply has now returned to near-normal levels.13:59SUMRX Earnings Out This Afternoon/ Tomorrow MorningThis Afternoon: ACHC ATVI ALSN ALL ANETBYND BMRN BOOT CDLX CDNA CDK CNO COHR CMP CORT DK DVN ENTA ENPH ETH EVER EVTC EXR FOE FNF FMC FOXA GTES GLUU LOPE GDOT PEAK ICFI IOSP INGN INSP NVTA JAZZ KTOS LC LPSN LMNX MTCH MODN MNST NPTN NEWR NUVA ONTO OMI ORCC PAYC PAA PLNT PPD PUMP PRU RGA TSLX TRHC TRUP TWLO UPWK VRSK DIS WU WW WYNNTomorrow Morning: AEIS GOLF ALE ABC ARES ASTE ATH AVA BCOR BWA BV CPRI CDW FUN CRL CLH CVS DISCA ERJ ENBL ENR EVRG EVOP EXTR FVRR GCP GEL ROCK HSC HEP HMC HZNP HUM INMD IONS KAR LL MTG MIDD MRNA NYT NXST NLSN NI DNOW ODP PSN PRGO REGN REYN SRE SBGI SR STWD STOR SSYS TCP TEVA TRI VCEL VST WD W WEN WWW13:58COMDX Metals Settlement PricesDec gold settled today's session up $36.20 (1.82%) at $2022.5/oz Sep silver settled today's session $1.54 higher (6.3%) at $25.955/oz Sep copper settled $0.02 lower (0.53%) at $2.8965/lb13:46SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: MNK (21.99 mln -26.11%)Materials: VALE (61.26 mln -0.83%)Industrials: GE (42.18 mln +0.76%), AAL (42.06 mln +5.19%), BA (22.77 mln +1.83%), UAL (22.59 mln +2.61%)Consumer Discretionary: NIO (99.73 mln -1.38%), F (47.8 mln +1.69%)Information Technology: AMD (104.53 mln +8.81%), MSFT (29.59 mln -1.74%), AAPL (28.57 mln +0.8%), NOK (26.42 mln +1.19%)Financials: SQQQ (42.78 mln -0.26%), BAC (24.69 mln +0.12%), ITUB (19.02 mln -3.49%)Energy: DNR (37.64 mln +10.8%), BP (21.63 mln +7.74%)Consumer Staples: ABEV (20.37 mln -2.52%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: DBVT (23.01x -41.46%), IRTC (6.55x +27.17%), MNK (3.77x -26.11%), TCMD (2.64x -17.23%)Materials: GSV (3.32x +8.4%), ICL (2.68x +4.91%)Industrials: SITE (3.37x -7.8%)Consumer Discretionary: RL (3.14x -5.54%), GME (2.64x +10.84%)Information Technology: HLIT (7.55x +25.58%), ITRI (2.7x -6.9%), SVMK (2.57x +0.04%)Financials: JRO (5.99x +0.12%), LEO (3.54x +1.65%), SUPV (3x +1.55%), BSMX (2.5x +3.94%)Energy: WLL (2.98x +27.21%)Consumer Staples: BTI (3.02x +1.4%)Utilities: EVRG (3.75x -10.26%), CEPU (2.55x +0.72%)13:46CVS CVS Health to report tomorrow morning (65.13 +1.27)CVS Health (CVS 65.13, +1.27, +2.0%) will report its Q2 results ahead of tomorrow's opening bell, followed by the management's conference call at 8:00 ET.The Capital IQ consensus expects the specialty retailer to report a 1.6% yr/yr increase in EPS to $1.92 on a 1.4% yr/yr increase in revenue to $64.29 bln. CVS reaffirmed its guidance for FY20 EPS between $7.04 and $7.17 on June 10. The pharmacy/convenience store operator is likely to report stronger sales of cleaning products and other coronavirus-related items, but the question is whether that was enough to offset higher operating costs and potential shortfalls in other areas. Peer Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA 40.87, -0.21, -0.5%) missed earnings expectations and issued disappointing guidance on July 9, but the weakness was concentrated in the company's international business. Credit Suisse upgraded CVS to Outperform from Neutral with a $75 target on May 14 while SVB Leerink initiated coverage of the stock with a Market Perform rating and a $72 target on July 1.CVS trades at 8.7x forward earnings expectations, which represents a premium to Walgreens and a sharp discount to Rite Aid (RAD 15.34, +0.08, +0.5%).13:45SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: IRTC (162.09 +27.17%), SIBN (19.75 +12.99%), MESO (16.05 +11.69%)Materials: MOS (15.54 +13.56%)Industrials: ENPH (69.16 +12.99%), BMCH (31.69 +11.68%)Consumer Discretionary: RUTH (7.44 +12.56%)Information Technology: HLIT (7.06 +25.58%), MTSC (22.1 +16.93%), SYKE (33.13 +15.88%), SEDG (199.36 +14.87%), SPWR (11.21 +13.18%), ARLO (5.22 +12.74%)Energy: WLL (0.98 +27.21%), CVIA (0.01 +14.29%), KOS (1.5 +11.75%), LPI (16.18 +11.28%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: DBVT (2.4 -41.46%), MNK (1.67 -26.11%), TCMD (35.83 -17.23%), HAE (77.46 -11.18%), ATRA (12.04 -10.85%), VYGR (10.13 -10.58%), EPZM (13 -9.53%), SLP (65.88 -8.62%)Materials: IPI (0.86 -9.22%)Industrials: SALT (13.02 -11.25%), SITE (121.65 -7.8%)Information Technology: CRUS (68.07 -8.62%), IPGP (165.13 -8.26%), CYBR (111.35 -7.11%), ITRI (66.48 -6.9%)Financials: AIG (29.76 -7.41%), TREE (334.08 -7.33%)Consumer Staples: INGR (78.38 -10.4%), EPC (28.66 -7.06%)Utilities: EVRG (56.25 -10.26%)13:19OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:EXTR Aug 5 calls are seeing interest ahead of earnings tomorrow before the open (volume: 1710, open int: 250, implied vol: ~146%, prev day implied vol: 90%).

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.4%) currently has the advantage with a 0.4% gain, while the S&P 500 (+0.1%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.1%), and Russell 2000 (+0.2%) trade closer to their flat lines.Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are trading in positive territory, though, led by the energy (+2.3%), materials (+1.2%), real estate (+1.2%), and utilities (+1.0%) sectors. The financials (-0.6%), health care (-0.4%), and information technology (-0.1%) sectors are the lone holdouts.Within the tech sector, Apple (AAPL 439.60, +3.81, +0.9%) and Adv. Micro Devices (AMD 85.30, +7.63, +9.8%) continue to advance. AMD is getting a boost after Jefferies raised its price target on the stock to $95 from $86 on a view that it will continue to gain at the expense of Intel's (INTC 48.60, +0.30, +0.6%) production issues.Conversely, mega-caps Microsoft (MSFT 212.05, -4.48, -2.1%), Facebook (FB 249.22, -2.73, -1.1%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1461.77, -12.68, -0.9%) are having an influential drag on the market. Recall, MSFT shares surged 5.6% yesterday on TikTok-acquisition optimism.Elsewhere, the moves in the Treasury market have been noteworthy. The 10-yr yield has dropped five basis points to 0.51%, nearing its all-time closing low yield of 0.50%, as investors presumably remain concerned about economic growth and coronavirus relief bill negotiations. The lower yields have hurt sentiment in the financials space.On the earnings front, Take-Two Interactive (TTWO 176.30, +8.16, +5.2%) stands out after providing upbeat results and guidance. Apple supplier Cirrus Logic (CRUS 67.66, -6.83, -9.2%) has dropped 9% following its report.Today's economic data was limited to the Factory Orders report for June, which increased 6.2% m/m (Briefing.com consensus 5.2%) following a downwardly revised 7.7% increase (from 8.0%) in May.The key takeaway from the report is the affirmation that business spending picked up in June as economies reopened, evidenced by a 3.4% increase in new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft that was up slightly from the 3.3% increase noted in the Advance Durable Goods Orders report.12:50SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (126) outpacing new lows (10) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: AAWW, ABMD, ACLS, ACMR, AMD, ANET, APPS, ARE, ARLO, ATVI, BAH, BERY, BLD, BMCH, BRKS, CAG, CAMT, CCC, CENX, CERS, CEVA, CHTR, CHWY, CLCT, COLD, CONE, COOP, COST, CREE, CTB, CVNA, CWH, CWST, DLB, EA, EBS, ECOM, ENTG, EQIX, ETSY, EVH, EXPD, EXPI, FIVN, FLGT, FLWS, FN, FOXF, FRPT, FSLY, FTCH, GIS, GLIBA, GLOB, GNRC, GOLF, GSS, HL, HOLX, HOME, HZNP, IAC.XX10, IIVI, INFO, IOTS, IPHI, IRTC, KKR, KMB, LBRDK, LCII, LGIH, LHCG, LOVE, LPSN, LVGO, MED, MKC, MKSI, MODN, MTCH.XX10, NFE, NOMD, NOVA, NUAN, NVDA, NVMI, NYT, OSTK, PDCO, PETQ, PG, PKI, PLMR, QDEL, QTWO, RCM, RMNI, SCPL, SEDG, SPLK, SPNS, SQ, SRNE, SSTK, SVMK, SWBI, TDOC, TRUP, TTD, TTGT, TTWO, TWOU, TWST, UPS, VAR, VICR, VRNS, VSTO, W, WHR, WING, WIX, WSO, XPEL, ZTS, EVA, MGICStocks that traded to 52 week lows: AHT, CLBK, CLI, CVIAQ, FCFS, INGN, NFBK, SALT, TLRDQ, XOGAQ, STFCETFs that traded to 52 week highs: GLD, IAU, IGV, LQD, PBD, PBW, QQQ, RTH, SIVR, SKYY, SLV, SMH, SOXX, TAN, TIP, XRTETFs that traded to 52 week lows: TBT12:45WTRG Essential Utilities increases quarterly dividend to $0.2507/share from $0.2343/share (44.81 -0.12)12:28JETS Industry Briefing: Airlines (15.79 +0.27)Since the COVID-19 pandemic hit full force, the stock market has had a love-hate relationship with the airline stocks.

The rate-sensitive sector is drawing support from a rally in the Treasury market, which is pressuring yields toward their record lows. The 10-yr yield is down four basis point at 0.52%, hovering at its lowest level since early March.The pressure on Treasury yields is increasing the relative attractiveness of high-yielding listings like REITs. Only three sector components trade in the red today while 12 names are up 2.0% or more. Vornado Realty Trust (VNO 36.87, +2.85, +8.4%) is the leading sector component after announcing that the company leased the entire Farley Post Office building in Manhattan to Facebook (FB 249.60, -2.36, -0.9%).

A conference call to review those results will be held tomorrow morning, August 5, at 8:30 a.m. ET.Currently, S&P Capital IQ Consensus expects that for the quarter, the company will report EPS of $0.48 and revenues of $533.75 mln, which would represent top-line growth of circa +7.2% yr/yr. The company missed consensus on the top line once in the last four quarters. Recall that Match Group in early July completed its separation from the other businesses of InterActiveCorp (IAC). Via the separation, the interest in Match Group formerly held by IAC transitioned to being held directly by IAC's shareholders. In Q1 which absorbed the early impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in March, the company's total Average Subscribers increased +15% yr/yr to 9.9 mln, including +28% Average Subscriber growth at flagship product Tinder. In Q4, Average Subscribers had increased +19% yr/yr to 9.8 mln, with +36% growth for Tinder Average Subscribers.Commenting during its Q1 earnings press in May on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Match Group noted that first-time subscribers for Tinder declined sequentially from February to March before stabilizing in April; most of the company's non-Tinder brands experienced similar sequential declines in first-time subscribers in March followed by improvement in April, and for most of those brands, first-time subscribers in April 2020 were higher than in April 2019. The degree of impact on enrollment and engagement was noted to vary depending on geography, age and gender demographics, and brand age. Tinder ARPU was facing headwinds from a shift to lower-priced subscriptions and fewer la carte purchases. The company did highlight a noticeable increase in activity among its user base since the emergence of the outbreak; average number of daily messages sent across all of its products was +27% higher in April than during the last week of February. Match Group was rolling out additional video and streaming-friendly features on its platforms to negotiate the transition to virtual socialization prompted by lockdown measures. Match Group estimated that in April, its total revenues grew +9% while total Average Subscribers grew +10%; it noted that absent a dramatic change in trends, it expected Q2 revenue to grow yr/yr but to decline sequentially on a percentage basis by low single digits. Adj. EBITDA was expected to be roughly flat yr/yr.Last week, while announcing the appointment of Jim Lanzone as the new CEO of Tinder, the company signaled that Mr. Lanzone would take over at Tinder "on the heels of another solid quarter, with double digit year-over-year revenue growth at Tinder despite the global COVID pandemic." The company in May refrained from guiding for the full year, citing uncertainties regarding the timeline of lockdown measures and of the reopening of key real-world dating venues like restaurants and bars.

Shares still moved higher following last quarter's "slower" growth as the company reported a profit when Street expectations were gearing up for a modest loss.High expectations may result in a "good, but not good enough" trade which could see the stock slip to previous support in the low $120s if there's not a hefty beat.It may be interesting to see how the company is coping with the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic. To be sure, the company has continued to enter the restaurant space in recent months with deals at KFC, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut just in the last three months. The company has also moved into more grocery stores as an attempt to facilitate the stay-at-home trend of 2020, entering Sam's Club, BJ's Wholesale, and select Canadian grocery stores in the last month.The company also recently launched the sale of its products in China, and reportedly Brazil.BYND garners an $8.7 bln market capitalization and trades at a hefty premium -- on an EBITDA basis -- to other consumer growth names like Freshpet (FRPT), Yum!

Bayer is therefore adjusting the forecast issued in February 2020 as follows, based on the business development in the first half of the year and assumptions for the rest of the year that involve uncertainties: The company anticipates that business at Pharmaceuticals and Consumer Health will normalize overall, although the growth originally envisaged for Pharmaceuticals is not expected to be achieved. For the Crop Science Division it foresees a restrained start in the fourth quarter to the 2021 North America season as a result of pandemic-related reduced demand for biofuel, feed and fiber driving an expected reduction in 2021 planted acres, as well as from ongoing soy market dynamics.This results in the following changes for the Bayer Group's financial indicators. The company is now targeting currency-adjusted growth in sales to between 43 and 44 billion euros (previously: to between 44 and 45 billion euros). This corresponds to an increase of 0 to 1 percent (previously: about 3 to 4 percent) on a currency- and portfolio-adjusted basis. It remains the aim to increase the EBITDA margin before special items to around 28 percent on a currency-adjusted basis. Based on the sales target, this would correspond to EBITDA before special items of around 12.1 billion euros (previously: 12.3 to 12.6 billion euros) on a currency-adjusted basis.

The extent and duration of these impacts cannot be specifically quantified given the dynamic nature and breadth of the pandemic's impact on our operations and that of our customers and suppliers."16:04TREX Trex beats by $0.16, beats on revs; guides Q3 revs above consensus; announces 2:1 split effective Sept. 14, 2020 (144.49 +5.16)Reports Q2 (Jun) earnings of $0.81 per share, $0.16 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.65; revenues rose 6.9% year/year to $220.65 mln vs the $201.21 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

He was conducting research in bio-mimics and fluid dynamics at the university.Numerous researchers and professors at American universities have been arrested in 2019 and 2020 as the Justice Department cracks down on Beijing's influence on college campuses, often on charges related to lying about ties with the Chinese government.The Justice Department also announced the arrest of another Chinese national, who was a researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles. Guan Lei, 29, was charged with destroying evidence to obstruct an FBI investigation. Lei was in the U.S. on a J-1 non-immigrant visa.Lei allegedly threw a hard drive into a trash dumpster near his resident on July 25, and the FBI recovered the hard drive after Leiwas not allowed to board a flight to China and didn't allow the FBI to examine his computer.The data on the hard drive was allegedly “removed deliberately and by force,” the statement said. He is being investigated for possibly transferring sensitive U.S. software to China's National University of Defense Technology (NUDT).Lei also allegedly lied about his ties to the People's Liberation Army, or China's military in his 2018 visa application. Lei later admitted to participating in the Chinese military, and it was discovered that one of his NUDT advisors was a Lieutenant General in the Chinese military who developed computers and nuclear technology for departments of the People's Liberation Army, according to the statement. Only a few days prior to the aforementioned arrests, Zhengdong Cheng, a professor at Texas A&M, was arrested on charges including lying about his ties with Chinese-owned universities while accepting NASA funding.

China rejected US pressure to sell TikTok, the app signaled for powering Beijing's intelligence systemCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 4, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 598 wordsBodyThe Chinese regime on Tuesday rejected US President Donald Trump's decision to order the sale by mid-September of the popular social network TikTok, noted for contributing user data to Beijing's intelligence system.TikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, will close in the United States on September 15 "unless Microsoft or someone else can buy it and reach an agreement," the US president announced Monday in referring to the app that has nearly 1 billion users worldwide, mainly teenagers.In a context of political and trade tensions with China, Washington has been accusing the platform of being used by Chinese intelligence services for surveillance purposes for months.Donald Trump, during an event at the White House (REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst) (JONATHAN ERNST/)Upon consulting on the announcement of Donald Trump, a spokesman for Chinese diplomacy, Wang Wenbin, accused the United States of attacking Chinese companies irregularly by abusing the notion of national security."This goes against the principles of the market economy and the principles of openness, transparency and non-discrimination of the WTO," the spokesman released the press. "It's about pure and simple intimidation. China strongly opposes it," he added.Without going until the announcement of retaliatory measures, Wang estimated that Washington was opening "Pandora's box.""If everyone imitates the United States, any country will be able to take similar action against U.S. companies in the name of national security," he warned.Chinese owner admits pressureWhile the company denies that its users' data is handed over to the Chinese government, ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming acknowledged Monday being under pressure and noted that they work 24 hours a day "to get the best possible exit.""We are always committed to ensuring the security of user data as well as the neutrality and transparency of the platform," Zhang told employees in an internal statement, according to Chinese media.Zhang Yiming, founder and CEO of ByteDance (REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton/file) (Shannon Stapleton/)However, he said, TikTok faces "increasing complexities across the geopolitical landscape and significant external pressure."And he noted that the company must face the challenge of the U.S. and Trump security forces, though "without giving up exploring any possibility."According to The Sun, ByteDance is considering moving TikTok's global operations to the UK, now based in Los Angeles.Very popular with young people, Tiktok allows users to create and share videos up to 60 seconds, often funny but also serious and even artistic.According to the head of American diplomacy, Mike Pompeo, companies like TikTok may be getting information from citizens such as their "facial recognition pattern," "residence," "phone numbers," "friends, " and "who they contact."In announcing a deadline for the sale of the app, Trump also released a new surprise condition, noting that the operationwould be a significant payment to the U.S. Treasury.Microsoft did not comment on Monday, but in a statement Sunday, it said that if it made the acquisition, it was committed to "providing the economic benefits that apply to the United States, including the Treasury."(With AFP information)MORE ON THIS TOPIC:Following Donald Trump's deadline imposed on TikTok, Microsoft confirmed that it is committed to acquiring the Chinese social networkThe United States warned that TikTok should be sold or blocked: "It can't go on as it is now"Companies and political parties in the United States restrict the use of Chinese social media TikTok and WeChatLoad-Date: August 5, 2020End of Document

The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.3%) and Russell 2000 (-0.2%) performed in-line with the benchmark index.Apple (AAPL 460.04, +8.00, +1.8%) set a fresh record high in a momentum trade, helping the information technology sector (+0.04%) eke out a gain despite a pullback in the semiconductor stocks and an 11% decline in Cisco (CSCO 42.72, -5.38, -11.2%) following its disappointing quarterly guidance. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fell 1.1%.The communication services sector (+0.4%) also closed higher due to its mega-cap components. Nine sectors closed lower, though, with the energy (-2.0%), real estate (-1.2%), industrials (-0.7%), and financials (-0.6%) sectors declining the most.In key data, weekly initial claims decreased by 228,000 to 963,000 (Briefing.com consensus 1.150 mln), which was the first time since March that claims checked in below one million. This was a relatively positive development for the market, but some speculated whether it would lessen the pressure for lawmakers to reach a timely coronavirus relief bill.A report from Politico suggested that there is little hope among negotiators of reaching a deal by September. House Speaker Pelosi (D-CA) said she will only resume talks with White House officials if they are willing to agree to at least a $2 trillion deal.Interestingly, the S&P 500 grazed above its all-time closing high (3386.15) and matched its high from yesterday at around the 3387 level before facing selling pressure throughout the afternoon. The initial selling, albeit modest, coincided with longer-dated Treasury yields pushing toward session highs.The 10-yr yield finished higher by five basis points to 0.72% after touching 0.65% at its low in overnight action. The 2-yr yield was flat at 0.16%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 93.29. WTI crude fell 0.8%, or $0.34, to $42.26/bbl.Reviewing Thursday's economic data, which included the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report:Initial claims for the week ending August 8 decreased by 228,000 to 963,000 (Briefing.com consensus 1.150 mln) from last week's revised reading of 1.191 mln (from 1.186 mln). Continuing claims for the week ending August 1 decreased by 604,000 to 15.486 mln from last week's revised reading of 16.107 mln (from 16.090 mln).The key takeaway from the report is that it represented the first sub-one million reading in nearly five months. However, at 963,000, weekly initial claims are still about four times as large as what the market had been accustomed to prior to the surge in late March.Import prices increased 0.7% in July, and prices, excluding oil, increased 0.2%. Export prices increased 0.8% in July, and prices, excluding agriculture, increased 0.7%.Looking ahead, investors will receive the following reports on Friday: Retail Sales for July, preliminary Q2 productivity and unit labor costs, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for July, the preliminary Univ. of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for August, and Business Inventories for June.Nasdaq Composite +23.1% YTDS&P 500 +4.4% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -2.3% YTDRussell 2000 -5.3% YTD16:19EBTC Enterprise Bancorp files for $75 mln mixed securities shelf offering (22.60 +0.15)16:19LPLA LPL Financial releases monthly activity report for July 2020 (83.77 -0.35)Total brokerage and advisory assets served at the end of July were approx. $792 bln, an increase of 4.0% compared to the end of June 2020.

Treasuries started the cash session on a slightly lower note, making for a continuation of the recent weakness, but the early selling was very limited. Treasuries ranged near their lows into the early afternoon, with longer tenors accelerating their slide after the completion of today's record-sized $26 bln 30-yr bond auction, which was met with poor demand. The high yield tailed the when-issued yield by nearly 2.5 bps while the bid-to-cover ratio and indirect takedown were below average. The afternoon selling lifted the 30-yr yield to its highest close in seven weeks, widening the 2s30s spread by six basis points to 127 bps. The U.S. Dollar Index (93.36, -0.09, -0.1%) approached a one-week low in morning trade but rebounded as the day went on. Yield Check: 2-yr: UNCH at 0.16% 3-yr: +1 bp to 0.20% 5-yr: +2 bps to 0.32% 10-yr: +5 bps to 0.72% 30-yr: +6 bps to 1.43%News: The United States, Israel, and the United Arab Emirates announced a peace agreement between Israel and UAE, calling for a normalization of diplomatic relations in exchange for Israel halting its annexation of Palestinian territory. This could pave the way to Israel reaching similar agreements with other countries in the region. The U.S. Treasury will sell $25 bln in 20-yr bonds and $7 bln in 30-yr TIPS next week. Banxico lowered its target rate to 4.50% from 5.00%, as expected. The Chinese government is reportedly considering more direct funding for companies. China's aviation regulators announced that passenger traffic in July was down 34.1% yr/yr after being down 42.4% in June. U.S. trade officials held off on recommending additional tariffs on imports from the EU over illegal subsidies to Airbus. China's July FDI increased 0.5% (last -1.3%). Australia's July employment increased by 114,700 (expected 40,000; last 210,800) while full employment increased by 43,500 (last -38,100).

Indirect bid: 59.8% (63.6%). Direct bid: 11.9% (15.0%). Today's Data: Initial claims for the week ending August 8 decreased by 228,000 to 963,000 (Briefing.com consensus 1.150 mln) from last week's revised reading of 1.191 mln (from 1.186 mln). Continuing claims for the week ending August 1 decreased by 604,000 to 15.486 mln from last week's revised reading of 16.107 mln (from 16.090 mln). The key takeaway from the report is that it represented the first sub-one million reading in nearly five months. However, at 963,000, weekly initial claims are still about four times as large as what the market had been accustomed to prior to the surge in late March. Import prices increased 0.7% in July after increasing 1.4% in June. Excluding oil, import prices increased 0.2% after increasing 0.3% in June. Export Prices increased 0.8% in July after increasing a revised 1.2% (from 1.4%) in June. Excluding agriculture, export prices increased 0.7% after increasing a revised 1.2% (from 1.4%) in June.

The CapitalIQ consensus estimate for Q3 (Jul) non-GAAP EPS is $0.95, up 28% yr/yr, and for revenue it's $4.17 bln, up 17% yr/yr.AMAT has a long track record of beating EPS estimates with no EPS misses in any quarter over the past four years although it did report just in-line EPS for Q2 (Apr). AMAT has also consistently reported revenue upside it reported a slight miss in Q2. It'd be understandable to ask why analysts expect solid yr/yr EPS and revenue growth for AMAT during a pandemic. However, the vast majority of AMAT's sales (87% in Q2) are in Asia, which is much further along in terms of the COVID-19 recovery. Also, many chip companies (AMAT's customers) reported great results in Q2, which is raising expectations for AMAT's earnings report. Plus last quarter AMAT was quite bullish saying that demand from semiconductor customers remained strong. In Q2, AMAT's results were hurt less by demand and more by AMAT's ability to ship systems as lockdown orders impacted some suppliers' operations, particularly in the Bay Area and Malaysia. However, AMAT is in a much better position today as it has made adjustments. In terms of its end markets, AMAT said last quarter: Foundry/logic demand at the leading edge remains very healthy, with a strong commitment from these customers to build out their factories and push forward with their development road maps. However, AMAT was seeing some pockets of weakness in specialty markets, mainly a pullback in the automotive and industrial sectors. In memory, AMAT said it continues to see a positive progression in the market with inventory levels approaching normal and improvements in pricing trends. Overall, the pandemic does not seem to be impacting AMAT very much. In fact, we think there's a decent change AMAT sees a snap back in results in JulQ. AprQ was hurt by supply constraints which caused an in-line quarter, but the supply issues seem to have been resolved. A good tell in terms of AMAT's confidence in its outlook will be whether AMAT goes back to providing guidance after not doing so last quarter.15:00SCANX Large cap notable movers of interest -- ZTO Express (ZTO) pulls back following second quarter results -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable large cap movers of interest ($10 bln - $200 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Large Cap GainersCHU (7.36 +18.52%): Gains after filing its results for the first half of 2020; co's service revs grew +4.0% yr/yr to RMB 138.3 bln, outperforming the industry average, while optimized cost efficiency led to strengthened profitability.

The FL indication has been accepted for standard review with a PDUFA goal date of June 15, 2021. The FDA also notified the Company that it is not currently planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss this application.The FL cohort was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of single agent umbralisib in patients with FL who were relapsed or refractory following at least two prior lines of therapy, including an anti-CD20 regimen and an alkylating agent. In October of 2019, the Company announced that the primary endpoint of ORR as determined by IRC was met for all treated FL patients. The results met the Company's prespecified response target of 40-50% ORR.On June 15, 2020, the Company announced the completion of the rolling submission of a NDA to the FDA requesting accelerated approval of umbralisib as a treatment for patients with previously treated MZL and FL.07:04CERC Cerecor announced the publication of a peer-reviewed paper demonstrating significantly elevated free LIGHT levels in the serum of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 infection (2.60 )"We believe these compelling results strongly support our hypothesis that LIGHT plays an important role in COVID-19 ARDS and indicated that a clinical trial of CERC-002 in COVID-19 ARDS was a logical next step," said Dr. Garry Neil, chief scientific officer at Cerecor. "This study is now well underway, and we expect topline results in the fourth quarter of 2020. We are further exploring the potential role of LIGHT as a driver of and biomarker for ARDS in additional studies of both COVID-19 infected patients as well as in a broader patient population of non-COVID-19 associated ARDS patients. From these studies we hope to learn more about the role of LIGHT in ARDS in general, while potentially opening a path for treatment of a broader population of ARDS patients who have high mortality and, in many cases, lack effective treatment options."07:02S&P futures vs fair value: -6.00.

The Nasdaq Composite set the performance pace with a 2.1% gain. The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 1.1%, and the Russell 2000 increased 0.5%.After leading yesterday's decline, the mega-caps returned to usual form with a strong rebound. Apple (AAPL 452.04, +14.54, +3.3%) rose 3%; Tesla (TSLA 1554.76, +180.37, +13.1%) surged 13% after announcing a 5:1 stock split; and NVIDIA (NVDA 457.61, +23.61, +5.4%) rose 5% after its price target was raised to a Street-high of $540 from $450 at Cascend Securities.The mega-cap stocks carried the S&P 500 information technology (+2.3%) and consumer discretionary (+1.7%) sectors into the leadership roles today. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index also had a strong day, rising 3.4%.Gains broadened out to the defensive-oriented health care (+1.7%), utilities (+1.5%), real estate (+1.3%), and consumer staples (+1.3%) sectors, too. Interestingly, the financials sector (-0.3%) sat this one out after outperforming in recent sessions as part of the rotation into value and cyclical stocks.In vaccine news, Moderna (MRNA 69.52, +0.55, +0.8%) reached a $1.525 billion deal with the U.S. government to manufacture and deliver 100 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine.

Excluding food and energy, CPI rose 0.6% m/m (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%) after a 0.2% increase in June.The key takeaway from the report is that while it followed in the footsteps of yesterday's hotter than expected PPI report, it is unlikely to have significant policy implications, since the Fed has made it clear that discussions about a rate hike are not being conducted at this time.The Treasury Budget showed a $63.0 bln deficit for July. The budget data is not seasonally adjusted, so the July deficit cannot be compared to the June deficit of $864.1 bln. The deficit in July 2019 was $119.7 bln.The key takeaway from the report is that the delayed tax filing deadline prevented the July statement from showing another big deficit as outlays nearly doubled year-over-year.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index rose 6.8% following a 5.1% decline in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report and Import and Export Prices for July on Thursday.Nasdaq Composite +22.7% YTDS&P 500 +4.6% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -2.0% YTDRussell 2000 -5.1% YTD16:20VREX Varex Imaging misses by $0.19, reports revs in-line; guides Q4 revs below consensus (16.00 -0.28)Reports Q3 (Jun) loss of $0.20 per share, $0.19 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.01); revenues fell 13.0% year/year to $171.2 mln vs the $171.1 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

In July 2020, net sales in the beauty category increased more than 100% for the fourth consecutive month, while sales of other "at home" categories also increased significantly year-over-year and benefited from newly sourced and expanded relationships with third-party vendors and owned brand suppliers. Rapid expansion of net sales into categories like beauty creates an exciting opportunity to acquire new customers and develop deeper relationships with existing REVOLVE customers over time by serving more of their needs, potentially capturing a greater share of their discretionary spending over the long term.16:07SGMS Scientific Games expands partnership with InComm to advance inlane, point-of-sale activated lottery technology (20.64 +0.42)Scientific Games announces that its partnership with InComm is expanding to advance a secure solution for shoppers to purchase drawing-based lottery games like POWERBALL and Mega Millions and lottery instant "scratch" games along with other store products directly in retail checkout lanes.

China says that the trade talks with US officials will happen "soon," this after President Trump postponed last week's scheduled talks due to the Communist country's handling of the coronavirus.Some of the top stories that we are watching this morning right now, Kamala Harris makes history at night three of the Democratic National Convention.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA) VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I accept your nomination for Vice President of the United States of America. It's not about Joe or me, it's about you, and it's about us. In this election, we have a chance to change the course of history.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Harris, the first woman of color to accept this Vice Presidential nomination. Her speech follows scathing comments from former President Barack Obama, who said that the fate of the nation depends on the outcome of this election.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, 44TH U.S. PRESIDENT: I did hope, for the sake of our country, that Donald Trump might show some interest in taking the job seriously. But he never did. No interest in treating the presidency as anything but one more reality show that he can use to get the attention he craves. Donald Trump hasn't grown into the job, because he can't.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joe Biden will formally accept the Democratic nomination for President tonight in the final night of the DNC. Steer clear, President Trump calls for Americans to boycott Goodyear Tires, reacting to the company telling employees not to wear a MAGA hat and Blue Lives Matter gear to work. Goodyear is saying that its policies have been mischaracterized. The stock of Goodyear initially took a hit. This morning, it is back up 0.32 percent at $9.53.Meanwhile, the only NASCAR Cup Series driver with a Trump 2020 decal on his car will still use Goodyear tires. The company is the official tire of NASCAR.Michigan reportedly agreeing to pay $600 million to victims of the Flint water crisis, thousands of Flint residents suing the state after their drinking water was contaminated with lead, after the city switched the water supply from Detroit to the Flint River in an effort to save money six years ago. An official announcement is expected later this week, coming out of Flint.New wildfires, meanwhile, forcing more evacuations in California this morning. Thousands are fleeing their homes in the San Francisco Bay Area, and historic lightning siege blamed for sparking hundreds of fires in that region of San Fran; the fires burning as the state deals with record breaking heat as well.Meanwhile, a pilot who was helping battle the wildfires was killed yesterday morning when his chopper crashed in Fresno County.Well, dipping back into bear markets, futures are pointing to a lower opening this morning. The Federal Reserve announced yesterday in its July minutes that the economic uncertainty is "very elevated" due to the coronavirus and the lack of fiscal action.Joining me right now is Mahoney Asset Management CEO Ken Mahoney. Also joining the conversation this morning is Forbes Media Chairman and former Republican Presidential Candidate Steve Forbes, along with Strategic Wealth Partners President and CEO Mark Tepper.Great to see everybody this morning. Thanks so much for being here. Ken, let me kick it off with you. Still no stimulus in sight, what kind of an impact is this going to have on markets? You heard what the Fed said yesterday.KEN MAHONEY, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, MAHONEY ASSET MANAGEMENT: Yes, so actually it cuts both ways. The Fed saying something that we all acknowledge, which is this virus is really creating havoc in our economy, this fits and starts and uneveness and so forth.But of course, when the Fed says it, there's a lot more bite to it, right, than when we say it. The stimulus package, I do think something's going to come out and I think it's going to be helpful and supportive.Remember, the two sides, when the Fed said, hey we have these uncertainties in the economy, it also means we still have the Fed put in place. You still have the power put in place. You still have that safety net that if things get really wobbly again, Federal Reserve will go in there and double up and triple up and quadruple up on their efforts. So, that's kind of the way I take yesterday's minutes from a month ago.BARTIROMO: And yet look at the yield at 0.653 percent on the 30 year, the 10 year also. So close to 0 percent interest rates, not a lot of alternatives here in terms of allocating capital. Even with that uncertain backdrop, Ken, do you still want to own stocks?MAHONEY: Absolutely. Look, as long as your stocks stay above the 50 and 200 day moving average, not to get so technical on you, but again, we look like a nice gentle chart going up, keep increasing your stop-loss orders.We may have to pay for this a little bit down the road, but we do have this FOMO that happens every day, F-O-M-O, fear of missing out. It's very real Maria, very real, because people are missing out. You have those hedge managers that are behind April (ph) and they need to get on it and they need to kind of jump on stocks to not be so far away from the averages.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's a great point. Mark Tepper, jump in.MARK TEPPER, PRESIDENT AND CEO, STRATEGIC WEALTH PARTNERS: Yes, Ken, when it comes to FOMO, how much higher can FOMO take us? We already recovered all of the losses that we experienced from the crisis in six months.And personally, I'm just having a little trouble with the math. The Street's expecting $164 in earnings for next year. You apply a very generous multiple of 20 to that. That gets us to about $3,300 at year end. So, how much can FOMO continue to help us?MAHONEY: I think it helps create a support, but to your point, we are going to have some type of correction. We've gone up almost parabolic here. You do have this FOMO as I mentioned, as you mentioned, kind of helping out. But at the end of the day, there are no alternatives. Maria just mentioned, you have the ten year at 0.65. That's kind of--Look, we know markets can stretch. You saw March, how quickly and how decisively markets could really stretch to the downside, and we also saw how quickly they can stretch the upside. We have to give the market credit and never has the happy medium. It's either overheating or falling apart like it did in March. There's no happy medium.BARTIROMO: Yes, speaking of parabolic, how about $2 trillion in market value from one company? Apple, the first company to reach this $2 trillion milestone during the intra-day trading session yesterday, before the overall market actually declined, this company's stock has more than doubled since its March 23rd lows, Ken. And now, we're looking at a stock split coming soon. Would you be putting new money to work here?MAHONEY: We always like (ph) to buy Apple and pull back. We still hold it long. I do think it's going to get a bit more exciting. We heard Tesla's going to do a split, maybe more companies, maybe Amazon will do a split.For those people again, I know back in the day, you always want to buy a round box, so to speak and commissions were high. So, it really doesn't make that much of a difference now, but psychology-wise, buying Amazon at $3,300 a share versus buying at $200 a share, you may get more retail interest when stocks like Apple and Tesla do a split.BARTIROMO: Yes. Steve Forbes, what do you make of all of this? What is it going to take for this market to take a breather here, even in the face of this stalemate in Washington, Steve? Markets keep going up. We are expecting a decline this morning of course. What's your take on what's most important here this morning, Steve?STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA: Well, just listen to the Democrat convention. If anyone had any doubts that this party's going socialist, you were disabused of that on Monday night.I'm wondering if Ken, when is the market kind of fully factor in the fact that Democrats might win? And if they do, despite all the happy talk of what the Fed might do, the bottom line is that's going to really damage the economy. You're not going to get 20 times earnings next year. You're not going to get $164. You're going to have a full blown recession when they pile those new taxes. 40 percent capital gains tax? Why isn't the market factoring that in more?MAHONEY: Steve, that's a great question.BARTIROMO: Ken, it's the right point, what do the markets think?MAHONEY: Look, we're actually putting news out again, thinking on November 4th when we wake up, assuming that we extra sleep on November 3rd, that we may not have a president the next morning. Literally, we may not have a president.We might be (ph) counting chads like the year 2000, and so Steve really, that's what keeps us up on that. That makes us kind of worry that, if you have this blue wave and there's no check and balances, we see what type of bills they put out, $3 trillion and most of that going to pay down debt from 20 years ago.At the end of the day, you'd have maybe something like a Treasury Secretary Warren. That'd be pretty scary. And you're right, they go into the left, they are not going to the middle, and that's obviously very scary.And I'm not sure why the market hasn't factored that in yet quite honestly, Steve. But my guess is, after Labour Day, that's when it's going to get real and that's when you have to tighten up your stock loss orders, because I do think on November 4th, we may not have a declared winner.BARTIROMO: So at this point, do you think markets still think that Trump takes it? I think because if they thought, if markets thought that the policies were going to do much different after the election, I agree with Steve, markets would be trading down.MAHONEY: Right. Look, there may be the check and balance, maybe the market's sniffed out that Republicans hold on to the Senate, and where Obama started with having that kind of check and balance and he can't get through heavy legislation with the Senate that's Republican. So maybe that's kind of the fail safe here that the market's thinking about.Maybe it does with the Biden, but then you have the Senate kind of squeaking out some victories there, being 51-49ish and still have some check and balances, so you don't get any huge legislative social agendas getting through.BARTIROMO: Well, we'll see about that. Ken, I know you'll be watching closely and we'll talk with you soon over the course of the next 75 days. Thank you so much, Ken.MAHONEY: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Ken Mahoney joining us. Time for the Morning Mover. Intel this morning rising ahead of the open, announcing a $10 billion accelerated stock buy-back. That has the stock up better than four percent. CEO Bob Swan says the stock right now is cheap. It is down better than 20 percent in the last month alone. This was part of a previous $20 billion stock buy- back plan, which was announced last October.We are just getting started this morning. Coming up, right after this, Georgia Congressman Doug Collins is here talking about the first criminal case in the Durham investigation.Next hour, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani will be here talking about the political field and the state of our cities. Then, New York Stock Exchange President Stacey Cunningham joining us, discussing new record breaking markets, delisting of Chinese companies on the horizon.And then in the 8:00 a.m. hour, Florida Senator Marco Rubio is here talking about the latest Senate report on Russia, plus Delaware Senator Chris Coons will be here.

Plus, big business of body armor, why protection sales have been going ballistic. Stay with us. You're watching Mornings with Maria live on Fox Business.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HARRIS: I accept your nomination for Vice President of the United States of America. It's not about Joe or me, it's about you, and it's about us. In this election, we have a chance to change the course of history. We're all in this fight.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Kamala Harris making history, becoming the first woman of color to accept the Democratic Vice Presidential nomination last night. Harris and other key speakers taking turns then, slamming President Trump.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HARRIS: Right now, we have a President who turns our tragedies into political weapons. Joe will be a President who turns our challenges into purpose.OBAMA: They believe that in a democracy, the right to vote is sacred and we should be making it easier for people to cast their ballots, not harder. They believe that no one, including the president, is above the law.HILLARY CLINTON (D) FORMER UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: I know something about the slings and arrows she'll face, and believe me, this former District Attorney and Attorney General can handle them all. And don't forget, Joe and Kamala can win by 3 million votes and still lose. Take it from me.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Senator Cory Booker and California Governor Gavin Newsom among tonight's speakers at night four of the DNC. The big highlight of course will be Joe Biden accepting the presidential nomination.Joining me right now is Northern Starr Strategies Founding Partner, Democratic Strategist, Michael Starr Hopkins. Michael, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.MICHAEL STARR HOPKINS, FOUNDING PARTNER, NORTHERN STARR STRATEGIES: Hey, thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: So, what will be a success for you tonight?HOPKINS: A success will be Joe Biden telling his story about the American Dream and once again putting the referendum forth on Donald Trump's Presidency and his failed reaction to coronavirus, his failure to support American workers, and his failure to respect the decency of the Office.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's interesting when you say the decency of the Office. That's exactly what the focus is right now in the Durham investigation and Senator Ron Johnson running governmental affairs, investigating the transition period when President Obama's intelligence agencies spied on Donald Trump. It's sort of like the elephant in the room while they attack the President from weaponizing these agencies. That's exactly what the Obama administration did.HOPKINS: Let's be very clear, President Obama didn't spy on Donald Trump.BARTIROMO: Oh yes, he did.HOPKINS: Michael Flynn was making calls with the Russians Ambassador.BARTIROMO: No, no, no, there was definitely spying.HOPKINS: No, he didn't.BARTIROMO: Yes, 100 percent.HOPKINS: No, there's a difference between calls being intercepted by the intelligence community, because he was talking to people that he shouldn't have been talking to, and spying. And it's disingenuous to say that President Obama was spying.BARTIROMO: No, no, no, that's not true Michael. That's absolutely 100 percent wrong, 100 percent. Carter Page was an asset of the CIA. He was working with the CIA. That's why he was with these Russian actors.And we know from the Michael Horowitz IG report, as well as from the Mueller Report that there in fact was spying going on. And that the administration--HOPKINS: And we thankfully know from the Republican intelligence--BARTIROMO: --I don't know how high up the ladder goes, but it is 100 percent that the Obama Administration spied on the Trump campaign.HOPKINS: There's information that the Republican--BARTIROMO: Look, I don't want to go back into it because this is fact at this point, Michael. And this is fact at this point.HOPKINS: I will take the word of the Republican Senatorial intelligence.BARTIROMO: President Trump campaigning today in - no, no, no, you can take it. We just heard from the Senate Intel. We heard from the Senate Intel Committee, we heard from Michael Horowitz and we also heard from Robert Mueller, so you can take all of their words.And we're also waiting on John Durham, which we are expecting to see indictments. So I'm wondering who from the Obama Administration is actually going to see an indictment, while President Trump campaigns today in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Joe Biden's hometown.The President spoke just hours before Biden will accept that Democratic nomination for President. What are your thoughts on this, the President going to Biden's hometown?HOPKINS: To be honest, since I guess the President is probably watching, the President's a joke. I mean, the idea that he's going to go to Scranton, Pennsylvania and try to make an argument about how he has some blue collar roots.This guy who barely won Pennsylvania in 2016 by 50,000 votes, He is behind by 4 percent in Pennsylvania now, He's called for a Goodyear Tires to no longer be supplied by the US government, he's let 170,000 Americans die, I would imagine that 170,000 Americans would give anything to have their family members back, including their 401(k)s. So I'm interested to hear what the President can say that could even exhibit empathy and a presidential--BARTIROMO: Michael, let me ask you this, given all of the conversation about Joe Biden's gas, do you believe that Joe Biden is entering a senile stage in any way?HOPKINS: No, not at all.BARTIROMO: Not at all?HOPKINS: I think Donald Trump is but anything showing the mentality of a psychopath. I think Donald Trump is an individual who showed no empathy and no ability to relate to anyone.BARTIROMO: Wow. OK, thank you Michael. Michael Starr Hopkins joining us. We'll be right back.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: President Obama did not do a good job. And the reason I'm here is because of President Obama and Joe Biden. But they did such a bad job that I stand before you as President. Thank you all very much.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: President Trump blasting former President Barack Obama ahead of the DNC last night. President Obama slamming the President during his speech at the convention. President Trump tweeted during that speech writing this, "He spied on my campaign and got caught." Then the President tweeted, "Why didn't he refuse to endorse slow Joe until it was all over? And even then was very late. Why did he try to get him not to run?"Let's talk about what we heard last night and your reaction, Steve Forbes, to some of these tweets. How do you see things?FORBES: I think the President is right on, and President Obama overlooked the fact that he and the office used the IRS to go after conservative individuals and conservative organizations. You mentioned the whole scandal of Spygate, the worst scandal in American history.So when misusing the Oval Office, he talked about Trump trying to help his friends. Oh, what about Joe Biden's son and Joe Biden's brother? They led with their chin last night and I think the President is going to have fun hitting him back next week, big time. And by the way, the US economy was slowing down when Barack Obama left office; Trump ramped it up.BARTIROMO: I just don't understand how they can get away with saying the things that they did to Trump, as if no big deal, as if it's just not in your face, like Trump uses the Justice Department to weaponize, that's exactly what the Obama administration did.And there are many people who feel that it goes right up the line to Obama and Biden, in terms of the spying and in terms of the setting up entrapment of some of the Trump campaign officials, Steve, and yet they say it with a straight face.FORBES: It's called the big lie. And they, even after the election, the way they destroyed Michael Flynn, trying to cripple the administration before it even took office. So, when they criticize Trump, oftentimes they're describing their own behavior, what they did in the Oval Office, what they did in corrupting the Justice Department, absolutely. Transference, whatever psycho term you want to use for, that's what it is.BARTIROMO: Yes, this is the biggest political scandal we've ever seen. Let's take a break and then we'll talk with Georgia Congressman Doug Collins. He was knee deep in all of this. He's going to talk about the first case of a guilty play out of the Durham criminal investigation.Then back from the brink, Airbnb poised for a public offering, what you need to know as it gets set to go public, stay with us.MARIA BARTIROMO, ANCHOR, MORNINGS WITH MARIA: Welcome back, good Thursday morning everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, August 20th. Let's take a look at markets here at 6:31 a.m. on the East Coast. Futures indicating a decline at the start of trading. We got the major averages under selling pressure with the Dow futures down 75, the Nasdaq down just about 1 point and the S&P down 8.5, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 pulling back from their record high closes yesterday. The Fed warned that there is still plenty of uncertainty for the economy due to the coronavirus pandemic.At the close yesterday, the Dow was down 85, the Nasdaq was down 64 and the S&P was lower by 15. Global markets this morning also in the red, take a look at European indices, spikes of the coronavirus cases and the Federal Reserve's down-beat outlook on the U.S. economy setting the tone for Europe as well. FTSE 100 down 69, CAC Quarante down 51, the Dax Index in Germany lower by 110. A selloff in Asia as well, China says that trade talks with U.S. officials will happen soon, but remember, President Trump postponed last week's schedule talks due to the Communist country's handling of the coronavirus. So we'll wait to see what happens next there. The Trump administration is doubling down on the pressure on Hong Kong, meanwhile, Cheryl Casone now with that angle. Cheryl, good morning to you.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS: That's right, Maria, and good morning. The U.S. State Department has suspended three trade agreements with Hong Kong, including its extradition treaty and tax exemptions on income. These latest steps are in response to the Chinese government's new national security law and be limiting dissent in the former British colony. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Twitter said, quote, "the Chinese Communist Party chose to crush the freedoms and autonomy of the people of Hong Kong. Well, Facebook is banning nearly 800 QAnon related groups from its platform for posts that celebrate violence.The tech giant is also restricting nearly 2,000 groups, 440 pages and 10,000 Instagram accounts that are associated with the social media movement. Twitter already removed thousands of QAnon accounts. Facebook shares actually slightly higher in the pre-market right now. Well, taking steps to go public. Airbnb announcing yesterday it submitted a draft registration IPO with the Securities and Exchange Commission. But the company did not reveal its financial information or specified how many shares would actually be offered. Airbnb was valued at $18 billion following its latest funding round. That was back in April, Maria. And those are your headlines from here, back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thanks so much. We are looking now at fallout from the investigation into wrongdoing at the top of the FBI during the 2016 election. Former FBI lawyer Kevin Clinesmith pleading guilty yesterday in federal court to making a false statement in the first criminal case stemming from John Durham's probe.Joining me right now to talk more about that and what is next is Georgia Congressman and House Judiciary Committee member Doug Collins. And Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thank you for being here --REP. DOUG COLLINS (R-GA): You're welcome --BARTIROMO: I know you and your colleagues worked so hard on this investigation. The origins of this Russia probe, your reaction to this first guilty plea from Kevin Clinesmith and what it tells us about where we are in this?COLLINS: Well, it's -- my first judgment is great, it's a great morning and then to look and see that somebody is being held accountable. How many times have you and I talked about somebody being held accountable for what they did, for what they did to the campaign. This fine -- the infiltration to try and to disrupt the Trump candidacy. But the initial part of the Trump presidency. So it's a vindication in such a way, but it's just the first of what I believe of more to come. And I think that's what's scaring the folks who are being investigated, the cabal of Comey and McCabe and Strzok, Lisa -- you know, Page and Peter Strzok and these folks that run any clapper, because they know that this is actually getting investigated because they never thought it was going to be.So, the first step is now done. I think we now need to continue to move on, and I'm looking forward hopefully to more indictments from the Durham investigation.BARTIROMO: Yes, isn't it interesting that Sally Yates was there in the spotlight at the DNC trashing President Trump, saying that he is using his intelligence agencies and the DOJ and weaponizing them, exactly what her colleagues did. Did that strike you at all, seeing Sally Yates up there? She obviously wants to get into politics and is not just a Justice Department official.COLLINS: Well, her getting into politics now means that she knows a lot about her past, I mean, it looks like what she wanting to do now, but she didn't want to acknowledge that she was a part of this. And for her to get on there and discuss this in a way that it's been portrayed and especially her role coming in, is really disturbing. I mean, when you have a group of folks that we've had already even on your show and others, they won't even admit that they were actually doing this to the Trump campaign and they were doing it actually in the first part of the presidency.When James Comey has the audacity to sit in an interview and talk about infiltrating the White House in the early stages because he knew he could. That is the very epitome of abuse of power. That is something -- when we go -- I don't want -- I'm so sick of the mainstream media who's ignored the Clinesmith issue as if it never happened, as if it meant nothing. What they are ignoring is the fact that this man changed e-mail, went before a secret court and spied on American citizen. That is wrong and for them to ignore it, it's simple malpractice.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's just amazing, and look at John Brennan, he is digging in even until the end. He's about to sit down with John Durham tomorrow on Friday and the FBI is under pressure, you've got this bipartisan Senate Intelligence report which finds fault in the FBI's handling of the 2016 Russia investigation. No kidding, specifically its use of the Steele dossier --COLLINS: Yes --BARTIROMO: Which could have included Russia disinformation. And you know, when this came out yesterday, the Senate Intel report, John Brennan tweets at Marco Rubio and says, no, it showed collusion. I mean, he keeps saying it, and it's really disturbing, giving that he's the former head of the CIA, congressman. What is he doing going into this John Durham interview tomorrow?COLLINS: I've never seen someone who should be more concerned about a Durham interview than him and actually getting on there, tweeting about that. You know, I'm not sure what's in their coffee. I'm not -- I think for most of us, if we don't drink coffee, you know, straight up, you know, just black, we put coffee, you know, creme or sugar. I don't know what they're putting in their coffee. But they're trying to block out a whole town frankly, because they won't let the American people believe they do not abuse the power that they've had. We've talked about this for many months and years now about what has actually happened.And the thing about it, is, what's really interesting, Maria, is for those of us who thought -- who would criticize you or criticize me or others who will call in and talk about releasing transcripts and showing the pattern they developed. What is amazing to me now is that every -- is every piece of information that comes out confirms what we were suspicious of, confirms what we were finding out. There's nothing that is not confirming that the FBI and the corrupt cabal actually did what they did every time we get more information, and now we're starting to see guilty pleas and indictments.It just confirms what we've done, and yet, they sit there as if it never happened and want the American people to believe along with their friends and the other media outlets, the liberal media outlets that it never happened. This is a serious issue that finally we're starting to get --BARTIROMO: Yes --COLLINS: Some resolution on.BARTIROMO: It's just extraordinary. All right, Congressman, let me switch gears, ask you about a stimulus or the fact that we don't have a stimulus deal, both sides reportedly dealing with internal divisions on how to proceed. The house is set to vote on that $25 billion package to address funding for the Postal Service on Saturday. What are you expecting, take us through the next couple of days?COLLINS: The next couple of days is nothing, but political theater, Maria. The Democrats are now trying to gen up an issue on the Postal Service which they actually turned down money earlier to -- that they were asked, well, they turned it down. And now all of a sudden, they're making up a story that deals with concern about the election, concern about vote. They should be concerned about the election. If you're watching the convention this week, they ought to be concerned that no one is going to vote for Joe Biden because they're not buying it. But now they're trying to blame it on the Postal Service and things that were just made up.So, this is just simply political theater, the speaker wanting to get the house back in session to vote on a bill, they will go nowhere and do nothing, but yet dominate the headlines and make people fearful. This is actually in my opinion, Democratic voter suppression. They want to make people fearful of actually going to vote, and they're doing so in a way that they try to have the cover of post administration. When at the end of the day, this is not what needs to happen. We need to actually be looking at a real solutions for our businesses, our small business, our schools and others to get our economy open up, our schools opened back up and our society back to normalcy procedures that we have.BARTIROMO: Well, and yet you've got Democratic mayors and governors out there who don't want to reopen the economy, don't want the kids back at school. Michelle Obama the other night said all we hear from Trump is chaos. Well, a lot of Democrat mayors and governors are allowing the chaos because they're not stopping it and they're not supporting the police force. Then you had Kamala Harris, sure, she's making history last night as the first woman of color to be a vice presidential candidate for a major party. But she was extremely critical of President Trump during her acceptance speech once again, congressman. Even as we see all of these Democrat mayors refusing to return law and order to their cities.COLLINS: Yes, where I believe the President Trump and the Republicans are offering hope and a time in which we are -- have been in a crisis. They're looking to -- we're looking to the future. The Democrats and even in these speeches, instead of encouraging hope to get out of it, they're encouraging fear. When they're encouraging others to be fearful of getting out, be fearful of opening up. That's not what America is about, America is about moving forward. America is about families, our country actually taking the reins and saying we can overcome this. And all I'm hearing from the former first lady and others is the fear that they're losing control. Fear that if we let this open back up, that we're going to lose the power that we have in an election year and which remember, all they are focused on is beating Donald Trump on November 3rd.They do not really have any other desire except to use every situation to say that this president is not doing what he should be doing. And frankly, they should be ashamed of what they're doing, because what they're setting up is people to be fearful of things that they can take care of, that we can control, that we can have safety measures put in place, but they would rather have the fear so to win an election than actually try to encourage people to get back to work.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, I made that remark earlier after day one, that it feels like, you know, there isn't any solution, any real, you know, policy ideas coming out of this DNC which would -- which would suggest what you're saying is that it's really more about holding onto power, keeping their grip on power. Congressman, it's good to see you this morning, thank you so much.COLLINS: Thanks, Maria, take care.BARTIROMO: We will keep watching -- and to you, Congressman Doug Collins. Coming up, Apple's big milestone, the company's market value hitting $2 trillion weeks before another stock split. Then hangover headaches may be history. A potential cure making a buzz this morning. You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business, back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Shiny Apple, the technology giant now the first U.S. company to reach a value of $2 trillion market cap. That doubled its valuations in just 2 years. Joining us right now is Wedbush Securities Managing Director and analyst, Daniel Ives. Dan, great to have you this morning. Your reaction to Apple and this incredible valuation?DANIEL IVES, MANAGING DIRECTOR, WEDBUSH SECURITIES: Look, I think it just speaks to the golden install base. I mean, right now, this is a coming -- going into a super cycle with iPhone 12 and 5G. And the services business, that's the key. This is really a re-rating by the street of the services business which we believe now was 700 billion-750 billion. And our bull key is $600 a share.BARTIROMO: OK, so you're saying $600 a share pre-split. Do you think once it splits that you get individual investors to come in at obviously at -- you know, in the $100 a share range and the stock resumes a huge up current from here?IVES: Yes, in my opinion, this is still in the middle innings of moving higher. Because you really have 3 things ahead of you. It's not just the stocks, but I mean, you have the super cycle. I think it's really a once- in-a-decade opportunity for Apple in terms of, you know, 350 million of 950 million iPhones worldwide during this window of upgrade opportunity. Two, China, I mean, 60 million or 70 million iPhones in China right now. We'd have those get upgraded despite the noise. And the third of services, it's the monetization of the services business, that's been the key, that's been the feather in the cap for Cook and Cupertino, so we believe this is still a stock that's moving higher, you know, in our opinion.BARTIROMO: Mark Tepper, jump in.MARK TEPPER, PRESIDENT & CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, STRATEGIC WEALTH PARTNERS: Yes, so full transparency, we own Apple, but I have to say I'm concerned about managing risk in this position. Over the last 18 months, the multiple on Apple has tripled. I mean, it's a 100 percent higher than the 5-year average, and over the course of the last 18 months, earnings haven't grown at all. So Dan, is the rapid rise justified, can this thing really go higher?IVES: Yes, and it's a great question. And I think even if it goes back, you know, a year ago with the U.S.-China tensions, it all comes down to really a re-rating in Apple. You know, this is a stock usually, it traded 12 to 16 times PE. Now, what's happening is that services business, historically streets giving about a $100 billion, $200 billion valuation, now 7 to 750 billion. I believe that's a 60 billion annual revenue-stream combined with the super cycle. I still believe this is one we're re-rating is farther on the horizon, and I think justified despite the haters, you know, continue to scratch their heads as it hits $2 trillion mark.BARTIROMO: So, Dan, what are the catalysts for this group? I mean, technology has been the leadership of the entire market. Look at Amazon, look at Facebook, all of these stocks. What are the catalysts? Let's call it the next 6 months that we need to be aware of for potential investment?IVES: Well, look, right now, the strong are getting stronger, and even though right now, that's been an issue from the anti-trust perspective in the beltway, we need to lose right now to contain risks in terms of more fines rather than the ultimate breakup. And I think the catalyst goes into the head is fundamentals continue especially in FANG names, you know, that right now is parabolic in terms of what we're seeing from Amazon, you know, to Apple, you know, of course, and Netflix and others. And I think you're going to continue seeing numbers go higher. And I think right now, I could tell you from investors I talk to every day, it's looking at numbers for 2021.You know, what do normalized numbers look like for these names, and I still think FANG names go another 20 percent, 25 percent over the next 6 to 9 months.BARTIROMO: All right, wow, that is big moves. Dan, we'll be watching, great to see you this morning, sir --IVES: Thank you --BARTIROMO: Thank you. Dan Ives joining us there on Apple and tech. Coming up, lights out, why one Los Angeles-base TikTok star's mansion is left in the dark. The Morning Buzz is coming up next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, time for the Morning Buzz. First up, lights out for one influencer. The city of Los Angeles cutting the power to a home in the Hollywood Hills after a massive 21st birthday party for TikTok star Bryce Hall. So, the mayor repeatedly threatened to take action against large gatherings during the pandemic, and they did so. Steve.STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA: Well, I think here -- it's again sold on civil liberty as you might call it a shocking overreach, and I think the clock is ticking on Mayor Garcetti in L.A., he has done nothing about the homelessness there, crime is rising, they're defunding the police, things are spinning out of control, so what does he do? He cuts power, he's starting to cut water to other houses, and that's not the way you deal with this crisis. You do it if people have disobeyed the law, you do it by going after individuals. You just don't cut off power, and if the host did something wrong, then give him a summons, give him an indictment. But don't do this kind of thing, we're going to shut everything down, that just shows all the mentally impotence, and the fact that these big city mayors don't know how to run big cities anymore.BARTIROMO: It's just incredible, actually, what's going on. It's a sad state of affairs. Next up, hope for killing hangovers, the amino acid cysteine, could be the key to stopping symptoms of a hangover according to a new study. Research shows that it relieves symptoms of nausea, headache and stress. Mark, what do you think?TEPPER: It's fantastic. I mean, it looks like those flights back from Vegas are going to be a heck of a lot easier on people if this works. But look, I mean, none of these --(LAUGHTER)So-called cures had ever really cure the night of excessive drinking. I may -- I may have had a hangover once or twice in my life, OK? Look, the only solution is to drink in moderation and hydrate, drink your water, people.BARTIROMO: There you go. Finally, this one. A tool for quarantine binge- watching. Netflix is testing out a new shuffle feature that automatically picks what show or movie customers can watch next based on a viewing history. It just does it on your own, you hit shuffle, Steve.FORBES: Well, just goes to show -- you call it invasion of privacy, but it's simply doing what networks have always done, juicing up the next show, showing --BARTIROMO: That's true --FORBES: If you buy a book, what the next book is, and it's a service and why not? You know, they're not forcing you to watch it.BARTIROMO: Yes --FORBES: They watch it, they just say you want to watch it, here it is, we think you might like it. What's wrong with that?BARTIROMO: Yes, it's true, you're right, you're right. You know what, Steve? We were just talking about cities -- we're going to take a break, when we come back, we're going to get into what's taking place in our cities with former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. He is here to talk about the state of our cities and what should be done. Plus, also ahead, New York Stock Exchange President Stacey Cunningham joining me on the record and record-market run and where Wall Street is going now.

Access Now: Trump Executive Orders Targeting China-Linked Apps Fail to Protect Privacy, Harm Human RightsTargeted News ServiceAugust 8, 2020 Saturday 9:00 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 731 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK BodyAccess Now issued the following news release:Unilateral decrees by the Trump Administration banning transactions between U.S. persons and businesses and the firms running WeChat and TikTok would deprive millions of people of information and communication tools during a global pandemic, restrict human rights groups from reaching at-risk communities, and suppress free expression just before the U.S. general election.On Thursday, August 6th, U.S. President Donald Trump issued executive orders stating that, in 45 days, U.S. persons and companies, and others within the United States, can be prohibited from doing business with ByteDance Ltd. (the China-incorporated firm that owns TikTok and other apps) and Tencent Holdings (including its WeChat service). In issuing the orders, the administration did not offer any new evidence of specific threats to privacy or data security that these applications may present for users in the United States. Blocking "transactions" with these platforms in the United States could result in millions of people losing access to services that empower them to exercise their human rights."WeChat has been a lifeline for people coping with the pandemic while far from their families, and TikTok enables creative expression as well as political commentary across borders. Activists and other users at risk globally use these services to report on human rights violations and improve their digital security in the face of surveillance and government harassment," said Peter Micek, General Counsel at Access Now. "Unilateral executive sanctions based on vague assertions and overbroad cybersecurity powers do not pass muster under international human rights law and will not protect our fundamental right to privacy.""In justifying its executive order, the Trump Administration has sought to draw support from claimed findings by other governments," said Raman Jit Singh Chima, Asia Policy Director at Access Now. "The administration references the emergency blocking orders against several China-linked services and apps by India's government in July, even though Indian human rights groups have raised concerns about the secrecy and opacity of the government's actions there. The Australian Government -- also mentioned in the executive orders -- has indicated it may take actions only after undertaking an investigation, if at all."Like most social media applications, these services collect too much user data under too vague terms. But that broader problem requires comprehensive data protection regulation, not arbitrary and politicized targeting of foreign-linked services.In justifying these actions, the administration has generally pointed to a mix of privacy and national security concerns centering on the relationship between TikTok and WeChat's U.S. operations and their parent companies, which under Chinese law can be forced to give the Chinese government access to any data and insights they retain. But the U.S. government's social media monitoring and requests for data from companies like Facebook mean that cutting ties with Chinese investors does not in itself remove the risk of surveillance for the users of these platforms."Just as the EU's GDPR forced U.S. companies to strengthen privacy safeguards for Europeans' data, a U.S. data protection framework is a necessary step toward ensuring the rights of people in the United States are properly protected, regardless of which companies are processing their data," said Carolyn Tackett, Global Campaign Strategist at Access Now.This move mirrors harmful censorship tactics that proponents of internet freedom -- including the U.S. State Department -- have decried for more than a decade. Arbitrary and disproportionate blocking, based on geopolitical escalation, spurs a race to the bottom, to a world of splintered internets with less cybersecurity and more exposure to overbearing nationalism. Further, these tactics place the heaviest burden on already vulnerable communities.Such overbroad executive censorship powers embolden governments to block access to internet services and information vital to billions all over the world, while not advancing the privacy protections and user-focused policy approaches to cybersecurity that are vital for protecting human rights in our digital age.[Category: Human Resources/Personnel]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7203051 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: August 8, 2020End of Document

TikTok Left 'Enormous' Amount of User Data Open to Chinese State, Pompeo ClaimsNewsweek.comAugust 13, 2020 Thursday 4:41 AM ESTCopyright © 2020 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 534 wordsByline: Jason MurdockHighlight: "This is about data sets that were clearly available to the Chinese Communist Party's national security apparatus. Enormous data sets," said U.S. secretary of state Mike Pompeo.BodyFacing intense U.S. pressure, TikTok has now been accused of leaving "enormous data sets" open to China's national security apparatus.The short-form video app, which is currently owned by a Beijing-based tech firm called ByteDance, has been threatened with a ban in the States, with officials claiming that it could be exploited by the foreign state to access user data of Americans.Despite one recent cybersecurity researcher suggesting TikTok's data sharing appeared to be no worse than Facebook, secretary of state Mike Pompeo has reiterated the claim that U.S. user information uploaded to the app is at risk of being hijacked."If I could raise up from TikTok for a moment, for us, this is a national security issue," he said during a speech in the city of Prague, Czech Republic, yesterday. "This is about data sets, and we know Europe cares about private information."This is about data sets that were clearly available to the Chinese Communist Party's national security apparatus. Enormous data sets. That's just not something that the United States is prepared to permit," he added, without elaborating.Pompeo had been responding to a question asking him to discuss the claim that TikTok poses a "risk to protection of personal data of the American citizens."Last week, the Trump administration released a pair of broad executive orders promising to crack down on U.S. "transactions" with the owners of TikTok and WeChat, a social media and messaging app owned by China's vast Tencent Holdings Ltd.President Donald Trump has pushed for TikTok's operations to be sold to an American company, with Microsoft recently confirming that it is exploring a deal. But with a deadline set for mid-September, it remains unclear if a viable purchase will be possible.Addressing the enforcement, Pompeo indicated in his speech that the crackdown may be broader than just TikTok or WeChat, as CNBC reported today."When President Trump made his announcement about not only TikTok, but about WeChat—and if you read it, it's broader even still than that—is that we're going to make sure that American data not end up in the hands of an adversary like the Chinese Communist Party for whom we have seen data uses in Western China that rival the greatest human rights violations in the history of mankind," Pompeo said.The U.S. has not released technical evidence that TikTok or ByteDance has been caught sharing user data with the Chinese state over the years. For its part, officials at TikTok have said U.S. user data is stored in America, with backups in Singapore.TikTok had enjoyed a huge surge in downloads this year, but its rivals are now growing. Facebook recently launched a similar service in Instagram, called Reels.TikTok has been contacted for comment by Newsweek.In an earlier statement, a TikTok spokesperson rejected the U.S. officials' claims of data misuse, saying: "TikTok is led by an American CEO, with hundreds of employees and key leaders across safety, security, product, and public policy here in the U.S."We have no higher priority than promoting a... secure app experience for our users. We have never provided user data to the Chinese government, nor would do so if asked."Link to ImageGraphic TikTokDrew Angerer/GettyIn this photo illustration, the download page for the TikTok app is displayed on an Apple iPhone on August 7, 2020 in Washington, DC.Load-Date: August 13, 2020End of Document

Why are Tencent and WeChat so important in China?CE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 7, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 638 wordsBodyTencent, one of Asia's largest companies, is little known beyond the tech world. But its super WeChat app has over one billion users worldwide.What began in 1998 when a small group of friends cloned an Israeli instant messaging service and adapted it for the Chinese market has become part of the fabric of the lives of people who use it to chat, shop, watch videos, play, flirt, order food and taxis, and more. Now it has caught the attention of US President Donald Trump, and not in a good way.1. What is Tencent?The Chinese company is like WhatsApp, Facebook, Paypal, Spotify, Netflix and Marvel in one. More than two-thirds of Chinese use their messaging apps, WeChat and QQ. In 2017, venture capitalist Mary Meeker estimated that they collectively spend 700 million hours a day on them, more than all other applications put together.Your WeChat badge has become a multi-purpose app that allows people to make payments, shop online and more. U.S. companies like Starbucks and KFC rely on the service to sell coffee and fried chicken to Chinese consumers. It is also important in online advertising, gaming, cloud computing and financial technology.2. Where did you get from?'Pony' Ma Huateng, its CEO, co-founded Tencent in 1998 in a crowded office in Shenzhen, northern Hong Kong, with three classmates and a friend. It has become a multinational conglomerate, still based in Shenzhen but with offices around the world, and has been listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange since 2004. Ma, now a billionaire, remains Tencent's top visionary. President Martin Lau, an avid goldman Sachs player and former dealer, is the leading strateman and operations manager.3. How does it operate in China?It's deeply integrated, for better or worse. By skillfully merging so many services into one platform, WeChat has not only simplified life, but has also created the perfect surveillance tool, giving the Chinese government an advantage when it comes to collecting data that enhances the algorithms that analyze, monitor, embarrass and sometimes push its citizens to jail.WeChat has blocked users who criticize the Communist Party and has collected private chat messages as evidence for police investigations.Citizen Lab, a research group at the University of Toronto, said in a report published in May that WeChat has also been monitoring sensitive keywords for its overseas version to build better artificial intelligence to block content in China.4. What is your presence in the United States?WeChat has not attracted consumers. But Tencent controls Riot Games, a manufacturer of one of the world's largest video games, League of Legends. He is also a major shareholder in Fortnite manufacturer Epic Games and has invested in Snap, Tesla, Reddit and Universal Music. He owns the broadcast rights to NBA basketball and also bought the rights to numerous Hollywood films, as well as investing in box office hits like Kong:Skull Island.5. What did Trump do?He signed executive orders on August 6 threatening fines to any US resident or company transacting with WeChat and TikTok, also a Chinese firm, saying that having Americans' personal data exposed to China poses a risk to national security. While the order blocks all transactions involving the WeChat app, it does not equate to a broader ban on relations with its owner, Tencent, according to a U.S. official.6. What is the impact?Tencent's shares fell in response to Trump's attack. Although the company earned less than 5 percent of its 2019 revenue outside China, the impact on cross-border business could be more painful. In China, companies basically use WeChat instead of email and text messages, even to settle invoices. Other messaging tools such as WhatsApp, owned by Facebook, are blocked in China, making it difficult to communicate with partners abroad without WeChat.Load-Date: August 8, 2020End of Document

TikTok sues Trump over his pending order to ban its appAssociated Press InternationalAugust 24, 2020 Monday 7:37 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; DOMESTIC NEWS; POLITICAL NEWSLength: 774 wordsByline: TALI ARBEL, AP Technology WriterDateline: NEW YORK BodyNEW YORK (AP) — Video app TikTok is suing the Trump Administration over its efforts to ban the popular Chinese-owned service over national-security concerns.TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, insisted Monday that it is not a national-security threat and that the government is acting to “further the president's anti-China political campaign.” The company said the government is acting without evidence for its allegations or due process. It filed suit Monday in federal court in California against the Commerce Department, President Donald Trump and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, saying that it sought to prevent the government from “impermissibly banning" TikTok by overturning President Donald Trump's executive order.Trump issued two orders in August. The first, on Aug. 6, imposed a sweeping but unspecified ban on any“transaction” with ByteDance, to take effect by Sept. 20. A week later, he ordered ByteDance to sell U.S. TikTok assets within 90 days. TikTok's lawsuit isn't fighting the sell order.In its complaint, TikTok said that while the full scope of the Aug. 6 ban order remains unclear until the Commerce Department fleshes it out, the order still poses "an existential threat to TikTok's U.S. business.” It said it would move to block action by the Commerce Department once it issues rules.The Commerce Department did not reply to a request for comment. The White House referred questions to the Justice Department, which declined to comment.Over past year, TikTok has tried to put distance between its app, which it says has 100 million U.S. users, and its Chinese owners. It installed a former top Disney executive as its American CEO and named two other Americans chief security officer and general counsel. TikTok has also said it is willing to sell its U.S. operations and has held talks with Microsoft. Other companies and investors have reportedly expressed interest as well.Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have shared concerns about TikTok that ranged from its vulnerability to censorship and misinformation campaigns to the safety of user data and children’s privacy. But the administration has provided no specific evidence that TikTok has made U.S. users’ data available to the Chinese government. The Trump administration has ratcheted up tensions with China over trade and tech security issues; the president has also blamed China for the global coronavirus pandemic. His administration has sought to hobble Chinese telecom equipment maker Huawei and the Chinese messaging app WeChat.U.S. officials point to the hypothetical threat that lies in the Chinese government’s ability to demand cooperation from Chinese companies. TikTok says it has not shared U.S. user data with the Chinese government and would not do so, and that it does not censor videos at the request of Chinese authorities.In its complaint, TikTok said that it has protected U.S. user data by storing it in the U.S. and Singapore, not China. It said it has also set up “software barriers” to ensure that TikTok segregates its U.S. user data from other ByteDance products.The company says Trump's Aug. 6 order violated TikTok's Fifth Amendment due-process rights by giving it no “notice or opportunity to be heard.” It claims that the order is not based on a genuine national emergency and the administration hasn't proven that TikTok's activities meet the legal standard of "an unusual and extraordinary threat” required by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which Trump cited as one of the bases for his order.Getting a court to overturn the government’s determination that TikTok is a national-security threat would be difficult, legal experts said. That's true even though the Trump administration is “pushing authority in places it's never been used before,” said Paul Marquardt, a foreign-investment review lawyer with Cleary Gottlieb in Washington.Still, the administration has “significant discretion” on national security, said Christian Davis, a Washington lawyer with Akin Gump whose practice focuses on foreign investment and international trade. Due-process claims might be easier to argue, Davis said, but those issues could be “cured” with a modification of the order.TikTok has grown rapidly in the past two years, racking up nearly 700 million global users as of July 2020, the company said in its complaint. That has drawn the attention of officials in the U.S. as well as in other countries — India has also cracked down on TikTok — as well as U.S. competitors. Facebook recently rolled out a TikTok copycat feature in its Instagram app and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg has publicly criticized TikTok.Load-Date: August 24, 2020End of Document

CSIS: Rep. Moulton - Our Response to COVID Will Affect Both National Security and Economic SecurityTargeted News ServiceAugust 5, 2020 Wednesday 7:00 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 4829 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Center for Strategic and International Studies issued the following transcript of a podcast on Aug. 4:Andrew Schwartz: You're listening to The Reopening. The podcast that asks, "How will America work through the COVID-19 pandemic? How will we innovate, and how will it change our global economy?" Each week we invite top business leaders to share their insights on the road to economic revival here at home, and around the world.Scott Miller: U.S. Representative Seth Moulton, a Democrat who represents Massachusetts' 6th Congressional District joins the podcast this week. Congressman Moulton is a member of the House Armed Services Committee, and the House Budget Committee. A former Marine Corps officer, Mr. Moulton has served has served his district since 2015 and offers his perspective on the health, economic, and security challenges we face.Andrew Schwartz: I'm Andrew Schwartz.Scott Miller: And I'm Scott Miller.Andrew Schwartz: And this is the Reopening.Andrew Schwartz: Congressman Seth Moulten Democrat of Massachusetts, Thank you so much for joining us today. You are, you are our first elected official first. Can I ask you to tell our listeners what part of Massachusetts you represent.Seth Moulton: So I represent the northeast corner of the state, Everything from a couple of towns north of Boston to the New Hampshire border and from the coast, west to towns like Billerica and Bedford. It's a wonderfully economically diverse part of the district. We have everything from small farms to the latest in Biotech, high tech defense tech, cities and small towns, it is not a place of a lot of highways and strip malls and chain restaurants. It's a place of small towns with real character and places with a lot of small businesses that we want to preserve.Andrew Schwartz: Yeah and that that's why I wanted you to describe it a little bit because your districts really a slice of America. I mean, can you tell us how your constituents have been affected so far by Covid and, you know, what's your expectation for the coming months and how you're going to come out on the other side of it.Seth Moulton: Well, we've been hit hard. There are a lot of people who have lost their lives even as the state has in general, had a fairly exemplary response and our trends are all in the right direction. Now, even as many other states are headed in the wrong direction but the fact the matter is that big numbers aside trends aside, people have lost their lives to this virus. It's particularly hit communities of color and we saw that very early on. I remember a hospital leader back in March, saying, I don't know what it is, but it just seems like people of color are getting hit harder with this.I think it's pretty apparent now that communities that just have poor access to health care don't have the ability to fight this off as well. And this is a virus that we have to fight with our immune systems. That's all we've got. Because we don't have vaccine or really effective treatments, yet it certainly hit the city's harder and it's hit those workers who who are on the job, you know, so many people in the so called "expendable class" are now the essential workers. We talked a lot about nurses and doctors. How about this hospital orderlies that literally have to clean up the mess. I mean, people who are really on the front lines of this fight bus plane train cleaners grocery store workers, you know, they're getting hit hard too.Scott Miller: Yeah the truck drivers and the people who are have really been essential to keeping the rest of us, you know, with food on our refrigerator and able to do our job is there supporting the services that we use every day. So, but they're, they're not often often heard fromSeth Moulton: No, I've never thought of grocery store workers as heroes and yet.Andrew Schwartz: Yeah.Seth Moulton: They show up to work every single day. It's heroic in the face of this virus. And how many people have to interact with every single day.Andrew Schwartz: And you know every time I'm in the grocery store, now I'm thanking all the workers, even more than I normally do, because you know they're the ones who are in their everyday exposing themselves.Seth Moulton: I know the first grocery store worker who died in my district was a wonderful woman named Betelina Williams truly amazing story to read about her life and her loving marriage and everything. In response to her death, I asked the Governor for emergency personnel designation to designate grocery store workers as emergency personnel so that they could get priority access to testing and PPE and and I'm proud to say that the Governor, who's from a different party than myself, did so within 24 hours.Scott Miller: But that's, that's great response. Well, great initiative on your part, great response by the Governor. But, you know, in the United States. We have a federal system. And there's lots of different levels of government with different responsibilities and different powers. How has that coordination been going? You obviously I think the entire message is delegation and the Congress and the Congress is Democratic and a Republican Governor, Republican President. So how's the working relationships how've they've been over time.Seth Moulton: So at the state and local level, it's been incredibly bipartisan my team including my specific coronavirus task force has been in regular communication with the governor's coronavirus Task Force sometimes on a daily basis or multiple times a day, especially as this was heating up. We've gotten quick responses on things like the story that I just shared. Look, I've got some criticisms of Governor Baker I haven't been shy about sharing them. Of course I'm someone who's not afraid to criticize my own party too, but because we have a strong working relationship, Massachusetts has responded well to this crisis. Sadly, that's not the case across the country.Scott Miller: You mentioned the unique kind of small town character and that the distinctiveness of the villages and towns and places in your district. Small business has been hard hit by both the the virus itself and the public health crisis, but also the many of the shutdowns that proceeded from it and the economic downturn particularly exposed small business, what have you seen in your district and how's that going to play out as they reopen and we get back on our feet?Seth Moulton: We obviously right, I means small businesses have been hit hard, and they're the lifeblood of our economy, they're also the lifeblood of so many of our communities. That's certainly the case and in my district, and it's sad to walk down the street and see so many storefronts shuttered, so many people out of work and so many families that have owned these businesses, sometimes for generations. And fought to always keep them alive and thriving and contributing to our communities, you know, really suffering and wondering whether their businesses will ever be able to reopen.So Congress came in and tried to help, but we came in big and heavy and quick. We got some of the numbers wrong. We, you know, perhaps gave a little bit too much and unemployment encouraging some people not to come back to work and few things like that. But the initial response was good and a lot of small businesses were eager to take advantage of that. There were some real problems in the administration of the aid, though. So Congress got the aid passed in a bipartisan manner I would add, and the President signed it but then his administration is responsible for distributing that aid and that's been much more of a hodgepodge. Some businesses have gotten checked right away. Some businesses, a couple months later, are still waiting on those loans to come through.Scott Miller: Yeah, given the scale and the immediacy of it that attempting to implement a brand new program. We shouldn't be surprised. Looking back, that it was rough, but you know, a lot of small businesses aren't accustomed to two lines of credit and those kinds of things. They're operating on cash flow. They're operating with you know with with sort of family employees. There's some special problems there that are actually kind of hard for our federal government to address. What do you think we should be doing going forward.?Seth Moulton: Well that's right because big chain stores have access to all sorts of financing. I mean, they can call a banker on Wall Street and figure out how to bridge this crisis. That's not the case for the average small independent restaurant owner or shop owner and so there are a couple things we have to do. First of all, I mean, look, you can't find a politician anywhere, who says that he or she favors big businesses over small .Scott Miller: Right, right.Seth Moulton: Right? And yet that's that's what our policy looks like, right, I mean, did you pay any taxes last year just personally?Scott Miller: I did, yes, actually.Seth Moulton: You did, I did too.Andrew Schwartz: Me too.Scott Miller: I remember quite well.Seth Moulton: I bet all three of us paid taxes and yet Amazon did not. So think about that all three of us, or even just one of us individually paid more taxes than all of Amazon. Which is profiting off of this of this crisis because some things that used to go to a small local store for now everyone's just going to Amazon. So our policy is set up to favor big business. But we're trying to help small businesses. And we have to make some fundamental changes and how we think about our economic policy in this in this country, unless we just decide. Nope. We want everything to be a big box, you know, nameless chain. If we want our small towns to thrive with small family owned businesses, then we've got to change our policy and make sure that they're getting help. We also just have to have more aid. I mean, the initial tranche of aid was great, but it's not enough. I saw some numbers recently, this was more focused on released to local governments rather than just small businesses, but some estimates said have said that the hit is about $1.3 trillion and we've delivered about $200 billion in aid.So in other words, we need about six times as much as we've already done. And the point that I made as vice chair of the Budget Committee and a recent hearing I said, look, nobody looks back at the Great Depression and says, you know, the problem was that the federal government did too much, or acted too quickly.Right, so it's a time to go hard, go big, be aggressive. I'd rather overestimate how much people need an unemployment, then underestimate, but at the same time, we've got to have a bipartisan commitment coming out of this that we're going to pay these bills back and that we're not going to continue on this path of enormous widening deficits every single year because otherwise we're just immorally and unethically handing that bill to our kids.Andrew Schwartz: So you believe that bipartisanship as possible going forward because you've seen it at the state and local level. And you've seen it in congress as well.Seth Moulton: Well, I've seen it to a limited extent in Congress, but we certainly you know in passing some of these initial aid packages we did see bipartisan compromise and even cooperation. I've seen it a lot, at the state and local level. I mean, I have a lot of Republicans that I represent, and I always remind everyone at my town halls, I hold a lot of town halls and I always remind them that I'm your representative, whether you're a Democrat, or Republican, an Independent whether you voted for me or you voted for someone else or you didn't vote at all. I'm your representative. I work for you. And that's the attitude that I think we all should take. My district voted for me as their congressional representative I'm a Democrat and the same election it voted by 13 points for our republican governor. So there are a lot of people in my district that I represent who were not afraid to vote for the person over the party. But I'm afraid that atmosphere that we're fortunate to have in the sixth District of Massachusetts is not the atmosphere that I see in Washington today.Scott Miller: Is there a way to set some of those habits of cooperation now, in terms of what's happening in the house?Seth Moulton: Well, one of the things we're certainly going to try to do just in the next few days is work in a bipartisan manner to pass the NDA,The National Defense bill. And that's incredibly important for our troops out there on the front lines you know a lot of people aren't talking about national security because we're all focused on fighting fires here at home, and yet it's a global pandemic. So this is a time when we should be talking about this a lot, right and I think that in working on the defense bill in the House, it's an opportunity for us to show some bipartisan leadership, leaving these political divisions at the water's edge as we always used to say, and doing the right thing for our troops and our country, over the politics of the moment.Andrew Schwartz: Does the use of the military and our foreign policy change in your view, given what we're dealing with the pandemic and moving forward out of it?Scott Miller: Which is a global problem in and of itself.Seth Moulton: That's right, it's a it's a global problem it's hitting our enemies as well as our allies. But there's no question that budgets are going to be tighter across the board. I think that's one of the most obvious effects here, we do have to pay back these bills and the idea that the defense budget can keep growing at the pace at which it's grown for the last several years is probably unrealistic. So what does that mean, it means that we have even less room for the parochial interests or as Senator McCain, put it the "Military Industrial Congressional Complex." When it comes to defense spending, you know, it's not just about, well, we should throw in a few more F-35's because that's a few more parts made in my district, no. We've got to be aggressively cutting costs, cutting fat, cutting old systems to make room for the new in order to keep up with China and Russia and emerging threats around the globe.Scott Miller: You know, it's a great point with you being on both armed services at the Budget Committee, you're one of the few people who can make it this cogently but you know we were running very fairly large deficits at full employment peak economic growth, sort of, before the pandemic now we have much lower economic growth much fewer many fewer revenues coming into it, governments at all levels and yet. And then we increase spending by about $3 trillion, this can't go on forever at least I don't think it can.Seth Moulton: You know it cant and so we're going to be looking for cuts across the board and and that's a risk for national security unless we aggressively modernize. That's what China and Russia are doing, you know, China is not trying to compete with us by building 20 aircraft carriers so they have a few more than us. They're just building missiles to defeat our aircraft carriers and guess what those missiles are a lot cheaper. In fact, you can buy about 1250 anti carrier missiles for the price of one aircraft carrier. So China is thinking about this in a very smart way, not just in terms of their security, but in terms of their budget and we've got to do the same.Andrew Schwartz: What else do we need to be thinking about in terms of defense going forward?Seth Moulton: Well, we've got to think about how we defend ourselves from pandemics. Now we know scientifically that this pandemic originated in China, but was not caused by the Chinese government. It could have been caused in part by negligence. We don't know that for sure. But the point is that something like this could be caused by a government in the future or it could emerge from any country in the world and infect us all and put all of our lives at risk. So we're going to think about this, not just as a medical problem or as a healthcare problem, but as a national security problem and that has implications well beyond the traditional realm of national security. I mean, it has implications for our economic security. Why are all our medical supplies made in China? I mean, that might make sense from a free trade perspective. I know free trade is not very popular in Congress, these days. I'm someone who believes in basic economics and believes there's a role for free trade, as long as it's fair trade, but we also have to put that national security piece into the equation. And it may be marginally cheaper to make all our medical devices in China. But if that leaves us high and dry in the face of a pandemic like this because we're counting on a foreign supplier for basic medical needs, then that's a real problem and we got to rethink those supply chains.Scott Miller: Yeah, this is you know it's funny because we we evaluate risk differently and we're evaluating exposure differently. Used to be that distributed supply chains were seen to be an advantage because we're trying to protect against the hurricane or the flood or, you know, the natural disasters that occurred in one place and now a sudden we need resilience when the natural disaster is everywhere.Seth Moulton: I think Scott. The point is that there's got to be a balance. Yeah, and I'm not saying that we should never manufacturer anything in China again. I mean, that would go against the basic principles of not only distributed man manufacturing but basic economics and the advantages, the free trade and all that but but we do need to make sure that we have some capability here at home. I'll give you another example. I remember this from when I went to business school several years ago back in 2011 or whatever my professor pointed out that if Southeast Asia cut off their supply of flat screen TVs, flat screen monitors, anything flat screen, you probably are all surrounded by several of them at this moment right. We don't have the capability to build them here in America right now. That doesn't mean we don't have the technical knowledge or we couldn't you know, build the manufacturing capacity, but if you just said tomorrow, America, you got to start producing flat screens, we wouldn't be able to do it and that that is a real concern for our national security.Andrew Schwartz: A lot of really bummed out people with no flat screen TVs to watch.Scott Miller: Well, or bigger issues than that, I think.Seth Moulton: I think there are bigger issues than that.Andrew Schwartz: Yeah.Scott Miller: But that would be important.Andrew Schwartz: Well speaking of big issues though. What do you think the biggest foreign policy challenge facing the United States is?Seth Moulton: The rise of China. I mean, look, you know, if you look at our national security doctrine, the most immediate threat is Russia, they have a massive nuclear arsenal. That is that is aimed at us. They've been remarkably successful at poking holes in the fundamentals of our democracy by interfering in our elections. That's the most immediate threat. But I'm a member of the bipartisan future defense Task Force. It's Co-chaired by myself and Jim Banks, an Navy veteran from Indiana and is a Republican and you know sometimes we joke that we might as well call this the China task force because when we look not to next year, but 20 or 30 years out, it's all about China, the rise of China and the clear threat that they pose to both our economic and our national security.Andrew Schwartz: Are we too hyper focused on China? Are we missing something?Seth Moulton: Well, of course, there always has to be a balance. I mean, I think we ignore Russia to our peril. They're putting bounties on American troops right now in Afghanistan. Their nuclear arsenal is the biggest in the world. They are undermining our democracy through social media and trying to tamper in our election as we speak. It's not a question as to whether they'll be involved in the 2020 election, they already are. So they're the immediate threat. We face the ongoing threat of terrorism and there are emerging threats around the globe. But I think we take our eye off China to our peril, in the long run. And so we have to have a balanced national defense, without question, but I don't think we're investing enough in the threat that China poses.Andrew Schwartz: What's the issue that we're all not talking about that needs to be talked about?Seth Moulton: Biotech and how important it is that we win the biotech race. I'm so proud to be from Massachusetts. We are the biotech leader of the planet right now, but the competition isn't from Silicon Valley, as it was when the tech boom you know played out. The competition is from Beijing. They want to win this race and I think what we don't appreciate are the consequences of losing this race to China. We won the tech revolution. And that means that American computers, operating systems, software, everything tech. We've dominated this, we've done, no one ever, we never worried about people going and buying transistors from the Soviet Union, we knew we were ahead we knew we won that race. We knew that it was much easier to get allies to buy our stuff than our Cold War competitors. The next big revolution is not the tech revolution but the biotech revolution.And it's not just about medicines. It's about things like our national security because we will use literally use biotechnology. To build weapons to build defense systems. And if we lose this race to China, and every time you want something biotech manufactured the world leader is in China and all the economies of scale go to China, then we're not only going to have a big health care problem but big economic problem. We're going to have a massive national security problem on our hands as well. China knows this and they're investing a lot of Chinese Communist Party government money in winning the biotech race. We're not doing, our private sector is leading the way and the American private sector is the best in the world. But China's putting every ounce of government money and private money into winning this race. We've got to have more government investment to do the same.Andrew Schwartz: So is it your view that we're losing now or that if we don't ramp up investment. We're going to be losing?Seth Moulton: We're still number one. But China is catching up very quickly. And at some point, those, those lines will cross and China will be ahead of us and I think that point is coming sooner than we'd like to think.Scott Miller: Well and comparing it to tech development of 50, 40 years ago there was a lot more government investment on the demand side that helped to create that victory in technology so,Seth Moulton: That's right. Most of the innovations still came from the private sector.Scott Miller: Yes, oh yes.Seth Moulton: Government investment was a huge part of driving and that's what China is doing. It's what we did to win, not just the tech revolution, but fundamentally, the entire Cold War and it's what we need to do here as well. And I think that's the answer your question, that's the piece that we're missing the most but it's important to remember that not only is this an economic issue, a health issue, a national security issue, It's also fundamentally a values issue. Because the ongoing conflict with China is going to be different than the Cold War with the Soviet Union. But at its core, it is about a system of government. It's about the values that we have for freedom and liberty. For self-governance and democracy and losing a race like the biotech race is not just going to have consequences for biotech, or even as I say for national security. It's going to have consequences for the freedom of humanity over the coming decade.Andrew Schwartz: In terms of economics. I gather you believe the battle with China is really an economic competition and not a military competition. Can you expand a little bit more on that beyond biotech, and some of the other categories?Seth Moulton: Andrew, I believe it's both.Andrew Schwartz: Oh you believe it's both.Seth Moulton: My argument is that biotech which we've never thought about as a realm of national security will increasingly be a realm of national security. I mean, when we first started making transistors, you know, we probably thought of them more as ways to miniaturize radios than as ways to win the Cold War, and yet that's how we won the Cold War with technology like that and and not to beat this dead horse to death with the Cold War analogies, but you think about it, our victory in the Cold War had as much to do with economic success as it did with military success. I believe the competition with China is the same. It's just going to inhabit new rounds that we haven't thought of as national security rounds before. Biotech being one of them. Obviously cyber security is something that's playing out right now. China steals jobs from America every single day through the Internet and we're not investing nearly enough to stop them from doing that. By the way, I don't think China signing some piece of paper and a trade deal is going to stop them from stealing our military designs and our economic innovations. I mean that's fundamental to how their economy works.Scott Miller: It certainly hasn't stopped them before they've signed lots of paper.Seth Moulton: That's right. We've got a we've got to we've got to defend ourselves. I've asked this great bipartisan bill to stop the Chinese importation of fentanyl to America because Chinese fentanyl is killing a lot of Americans.Andrew Schwartz: Right, I remember this.Seth Moulton: And one of the amazing facts about this is we pass this building to essentially criminalize Chinese producers of this. But the reason we had to do that is because we already had an agreement in place that said China would not export fentanyl to the United States, but the agreement didn't work.Scott Miller: Right.Seth Moulton: There was some amazing statistic around, I might get the numbers slightly off. But basically, for the period for the first year that this agreement was in place, essentially a customs agreement American customs officials stopped 1290 shipments of Chinese fentanyl to America and Chinese customs agents stopped four. In other words, they just weren't trying.Scott Miller: Yeah, big help. Yeah, and all these things.Seth Moulton: But we can sign an agreement with China that says they're not going to steal our jobs through the Internet, they're not going to enforce that we have to enforce that. And that's why we have to invest a lot more in cyber security as well.Andrew Schwartz: So what's it going to take for us to check China in a way that will let them know that we mean business that they really do need to stop stealing our intellectual property and they need to respect our ideals.Seth Moulton: The first thing we have to do is show them a united front. Come together as Democrats, Republicans, Independents and say, look, we're going to have our political debates that's hallmark of a democracy, but when it comes to protecting our values, standing up for our troops, defending our Constitution, you're not going to see any daylight between Republicans and Democrats or anybody else here in Washington. We're all going to stand up for America. That's the most important thing we can do right now and we'll still have great debates on the Armed Services Committee about exactly how to do that exactly how to fund this, that, or the other thing. There's a great debate playing out in the services now about how to evolve, especially under the Commandant's leadership in the Marine Corps. He's really challenging assumptions about how to best counter China, we're going to have a debate about that. But when it comes to standing up to China, when it comes to supporting our troops on the front lines there can be no debate that America will stand united.Scott Miller: That's I couldn't agree more. And I'm delighted to hear that from you as an important member of the Congress and the Armed Services Committee, but you've been very generous with your time today and we wish you great success in the NDAA because it's exactly that message that I think that bill tends to send so thank you for your time.Seth Moulton: Thank you, and thanks for this discussion.Andrew Schwartz: Congressman really appreciate it today. This is enlightening for us, really appreciate it.Seth Moulton: Andrew and Scott thanks for doing this. Thanks for carrying on the debate, we need to have more of this in Washington and policymakers like myself need to need to respond to debates like this by putting good policy into action. So thank you.Andrew Schwartz: Thanks a million. Hey Seth I want to introduce you to my interns. This is Riley Kennedy, who's here and Nina's here too, I think. Nina, are you here.[Category: Political]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7199075 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: August 5, 2020End of Document

Embattled TikTok: Behind the dance duels, a platform for youth activism; To many youths, the Chinese app TikTok has emerged as a key political platform. But to the White House, it's a potential national security threat.The Christian Science MonitorAugust 4, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Christian Science Publishing Society All Rights ReservedSection: TechnologyLength: 1299 wordsByline: Cassandre Coyer Staff writer, Noah Robertson Staff writerBodyAlyssa Bigbee, an acrobatics instructor in Philadelphia, downloaded TikTok last December to post videos of her students performing. For her - like its millions of other users - the app was something of an internet playground, filled with endless videos offering 15-second fun. But that would soon change. During the George Floyd protests at the start of the summer, Ms. Bigbee had noticed countless Americans asking how to be a white ally. She had an answer, so she posted it on TikTok. More than 150,000 people watched it."I never thought I would get 10,000 followers from talking about racism," she says. This year, millions of people around the world took to social media for entertainment during lockdowns, helping video platform TikTok become one of 2020's most downloaded apps. In months, it has gone from an apolitical teen utopia to an emerging activist platform and possible security threat - with the Trump administration recently threatening to ban the app if its Chinese parent company doesn't divest ownership to an American firm.As its users and owners race to adjust to the White House's threats, social media experts say TikTok's dramatic shift is another example of cyberspace colliding with the real world."When young people see the organizing that they do online can have an impact on what's happening offline, then they feel more encouraged to vote and get involved in electoral politics," says CedarBough Saeji, a visiting assistant professor of East Asian languages and cultures at Indiana University Bloomington. "This is a crucial moment for them to think about the impact of politics on their lives."Tuning in, tuning outThe app has begun to change as users like Ms. Bigbee started using it for activism. Ahead of President Donald Trump's June rally in Tulsa, teens used the app to artificially inflate the expected attendance. Others are confronting white supremacy by using the app to organize demonstrations and communicate about racism.Yet among social platforms, TikTok seems one of the least likely for political activity. It plays tailored feeds of memes, lip-syncing, dance challenges, and other bite-size diversions - most intended for its young user demographic. Often set to music, the app's 15-second videos tend to entertain rather than inform.Owned by Chinese parent company ByteDance, the app also has a reputation for removing controversial content. In late 2019 a teen's account was suspended after she criticized the Chinese government for its treatment of Uyghurs in Xinjiang province. Last December, TikTok admitted that it had policies suppressing videos of people with disabilities, people with neurodiverse conditions, obese people, and members of the LGBTQ community. (These policies have changed, according to a spokesman.) Many users now say videos with #blacklivesmatter are getting targeted.Other outspoken users have accused TikTok of "shadowbanning" them - or making their posts invisible to anyone outside their followers.While TikTok's activist culture is global, it's found a special resonance in the U.S. during the George Floyd protests. In the past few months, politically minded young people have taken to the app, using hashtags such as #blacklivesmatter billions of times. "Young people are really good at - I don't want to use the word hacking - but using social media in unique and unexpected ways," says Dhiraj Murthy, a sociologist at the University of Texas at Austin.Those strategies include intentionally misspelling sensitive words, avoiding certain hashtags, and using symbols to sneak past censors. TikTok users have adapted their activism to the app, developing a distinct etiquette and language. In the process, TikTok is finding a niche among other activist-oriented media, such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. Its particularly arresting videos help catch the attention of today's distracted culture, says Professor Saeji. And in a world of unlimited content, catching people's attention can matter. Rising voicesMs. Bigbee, the acrobatics instructor, has seen it matter firsthand. She and a network of "virtual allies" on the app have coordinated posts about Black Lives Matter protests and spread information about the challenges faced by certain ethnic groups, such as Native Americans. Some of those efforts have reached tens of thousands of users, she says."I credit TikTok and a mixture of the quarantine for why BLM blew up so wide," says Ms. Bigbee.When it comes to raising awareness about issues related to race, the numbers on TikTok often speak for themselves - just ask Anastasia Achiaa.Late this May, Anastasia, a high school student in Uxbridge, Massachusetts, posted a poem about her experience with stereotypes of Black women. In two months, it's gotten more than 2 million views, and helped bring Anastasia's account from relative obscurity to nearly a quarter of a million followers. Since then - even in the face of repeated shadowbans - Anastasia has continued posting on politically relevant issues. For her, TikTok's adolescent activist culture is a sign that her generation is continuing the tradition of civil rights activists who came before."We're a generation that's gonna fight," she says.Whether it's sharing problems while dancing to a catchy song; answering questions about race, gender, sexuality, or politics; or describing one's culture and history, such action can take many forms and reach millions of users worldwide.TikTok has "allowed a lot of the younger generations to really connect and spread awareness just like wildfire," says Luana, who has 14,000 followers. Asking to go only by her first name for privacy reasons, Luana uses the app to share Hawaiian culture and history. "It's nice to know that my voice is actually being heard and people are starting to understand more about our culture," she says. "That's all we want. Even if it's just one person, I'm happy that I was able to help them.An "unprecedented move"But with concerns over potential Chinese interference, TikTok activism may come with particular risks - such as improper data use or misinformation campaigns. India, once the app's largest user base, instituted a ban in June.The evidence for these threats is mixed, says Samm Sacks, a cybersecurity fellow at the think tank New America and a senior fellow at Yale Law School's Paul Tsai China Center. Still, on July 31, President Trump announced he planned to ban the app from the U.S., which he said he could do through emergency powers or an executive order. Mr. Trump later relaxed his threat, saying the deal can go through if TikTok finds a buyer by Sept. 15 - but only if the U.S. government gets a cut.Even if the app dodges a ban, for Microsoft to purchase the company under pressure from the U.S. government still represents "an unprecedented move in the way that you have state control over internet platforms," Ms. Sacks says.Meanwhile, TikTok U.S. General Manager Vanessa Pappas quickly responded to Mr. Trump's proposed ban. "We're not planning on going anywhere," said Ms. Pappas in a minute-long video posted on the app. But even if TikTok were banned, says Professor Murthy, its users would likely adapt. "If the political will is there in terms of an activist momentum, it's going to find steam in another platform if the platform is taken away from them," he says.Ms. Bigbee, who says she and other users are already planning to spread their activism to other sites - such as Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, or even creating their own websites - agrees: The movement is bigger than the medium."I just hope that everyone knows that this is not the end," she says. "TikTok was not the place for activism, but we got creative and turned it into that. That just shows that that can happen in any space they enter, even if this app was gone."Load-Date: August 4, 2020End of Document

TikTok, Beijing say Trump's ban ignores facts, harms U.S.-China relationsUPIAugust 7, 2020 Friday 9:35 AM ESTCopyright 2020 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 524 wordsByline: CLYDE HUGHESDateline: Aug. 7 BodyThe Chinese government and video-sharing platform TikTok slammed U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday after he signed an executive order barring the social app from doing business with firms in the United States.Trump signed the order Thursday night, which also barred the Chinese messaging app WeChat in restrictions that take effect in 45 days. The order cites concerns that both platforms could be used by Beijing to access U.S. data.The order came after Trump urged TikTok to move forward with a proposed sale to U.S. tech giant Microsoft, a push that angered Beijing, which called the move "open robbery" and "theft."TikTok, which has a U.S.-based operations chief and its largest office in Los Angeles, threatened to take legal action to block Trump's ban."This executive order risks undermining global businesses' trust in the United States' commitment to the rule of law, which has served as a magnet for investment and spurred decades of American economic growth," TikTok responded in a statement."And it sets a dangerous precedent for the concept of free expression and open markets. We will pursue all remedies available to us in order to ensure that the rule of law is not discarded and that our company and our users are treated fairly -- if not by the administration, then by the U.S. courts."TikTok says it has an estimated 100 million users in the United States and has become popular among teenagers and young adults, who share short-form videos on the platform.The app said Trump ordered the ban "without any due process.""For nearly a year, we have sought to engage with the U.S. government in good faith to provide a constructive solution to the concerns that have been expressed," TikTok said. "What we encountered instead was that the administration paid no attention to facts, dictated terms of an agreement without going through standard legal processes, and tried to insert itself into negotiations between private businesses."Yang Jiechi, a top member of the Communist Party of China's Central Committee and director of its Office of Foreign Affairs, criticized the state of U.S.-China relations in a statement Friday."We urge U.S. decision makers to respect facts of history, recognize the trend of the times, heed the visionary calls in the U.S., and listen to the voice of the international community," he wrote."We urge them to redress mistakes and change course, and work with China to manage differences on the basis of mutual respect, expand cooperation on the basis of mutual benefit, and bring China-U.S. relations back to the track of sound and steady development.""Some anti-China elements in the U.S. are abusing the concept of 'national security' to deliberately obstruct the normal interactions between the two countries and to mislead the American people in an attempt to cause irreversible damage to China-U.S. relations," he added."The friendly exchanges between the Chinese and American people cannot be cut off by some U.S. politicians through political maneuvering. The Chinese side welcomes more American people from all walks of life to China to see and experience the country for what it really is."Load-Date: August 7, 2020End of Document

To maintain the security of data owned by the State of Nebraska, and to safeguard against the intrusive cyber activities of China's communist government, we've made the decision to ban TikTok on State devices."In remarks to the press on August 5, 2020, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the federal government's stepped up efforts to protect Americans' electronic data from being accessed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which controls China's government."President Trump has mentioned impending action on TikTok, and for good reason.

O'Brien: China Targeting US Election Infrastructure With CyberattacksThe FrontrunnerAugust 10, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: NATIONAL CAMPAIGN NEWSLength: 1170 wordsBodyReuters (8/9, Bing) reports National Security Adviser O'Brien warned Sunday that "Chinese government-linked hackers have been targeting U.S. election infrastructure ahead of the 2020 presidential election," indicating "a more active level of alleged Chinese interference." O'Brien's comments "go beyond a statement released on Friday by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence which said China 'has been expanding its influence efforts,' and that Russia was already trying to undercut" Joe Biden, but "did not specifically accuse Beijing of hacking attempts against US election-related systems." O'Brien told CBS' Face The Nation (8/9, 2.43M), "They'd like to see the President lose. China - like Russia, like Iran - they've engaged in cyberattacks and phishing and that sort of thing with respect to our election infrastructure, with respect to websites and that sort of thing."Pelosi: Election Threats From Russia, China Aren't Equal.The AP (8/9) reports House Speaker Pelosi said Sunday the threats of interference in the US presidential election from Russia and China "are not equal, pointing to a more serious risk with Moscow's efforts to boost [Trump's] reelection bid." Said Pelosi on CNN's State Of The Union, "They're not equivalent. Russia is actively 24/7 interfering in our election. They did so in 2016, and they are doing so now." Pelosi "said trying to equate China and Russia on the threat of foreign election interference doesn't tell the story." Said the Speaker on Fox News Sunday, "The Chinese, they said, prefer Biden. We don't know that, but that's what they're saying, but they're not really getting involved in the presidential election."Evanina: China, Iran Want Trump To Lose Election, Russia Denigrating Biden.In a statement, National Counterintelligence and Security Center Director William Evanina on Friday said that ahead of the 2020 presidential elections, foreign nations are continuing "to use covert and overt influence measures in their attempts to sway US voters' preferences and perspectives, shift US policies, increase discord in the United States, and undermine the American people's confidence in our democratic process." Evanina also said that whereas China "prefers that President Trump - whom Beijing sees as unpredictable - does not win reelection," and Iran "seeks to undermine US democratic institutions, President Trump, and to divide the country," Russia "is using a range of measures to primarily denigrate former Vice President Biden and what it sees as an anti-Russia 'establishment.'"Typical of the tone of the coverage, the New York Times (8/7, A1, Barnes, 18.61M) reported on its front page that US intelligence officials "said Friday in their first public assessment that Moscow continues to try to interfere in the 2020 campaign to help...Trump," even as China "preferred that Mr. Trump be defeated in November and was weighing whether to take more aggressive action in the election." The Times added that US officials "said that Russia was the far graver, and more immediate, threat," given that while China "seeks to gain influence in American politics, its leaders have not yet decided to wade directly into the presidential contest [in spite of how] much they may dislike Mr. Trump, the officials said."Similarly, Washington Post (8/7, A1, Harris, Nakashima, Dawsey, 14.2M) said on its front page that Evanina "described Russia as actively engaged in efforts that are reminiscent of the Kremlin's attempts to influence the outcome of the 2016 election" and he identified Andriy Derkach, "a Ukrainian lawmaker who has been in contact with Rudolph W. Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer, [as] part of a Russian disinformation effort." Evanina said Derkach "is spreading claims about corruption - including through publicizing leaked phone calls - to undermine" Biden and Democrats.The Washington Times (8/7, Blake, 492K) reported Evanina "said the US intelligence community assess Iran seeks to undermine US democratic institutions and Mr. Trump and to divide the country ahead of Election Day." NBC Nightly News (8/7, story 9, 1:19, Holt, 5.62M) on Friday reported the White House "says the US will not tolerate foreign interference in our electoral processes."Meanwhile, The Hill (8/7, Axelrod, 2.98M) reported that Trump Campaign Communications Director Tim Murtaugh said the assessment "that both China and Iran are trying to stop President Trump's re-election is concerning, but clearly because he has held them accountable after years of coddling by politicians like Joe Biden." ABC World News Tonight (8/7, story 8, 1:54, Llamas, 6.66M) reported that the Trump campaign "says they don't need [the help], saying, 'President Trump will beat Joe Biden fair and square.'" ABC added that a senior adviser to the Biden campaign "says the former VP has refused to accept information from a foreign government intended to help his campaign, and they underscore that the President himself has not made that commitment less than 100 days out from Election Day."According to the AP (8/7, Tucker, Riechmann), Friday's assessment follows "criticism" from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) "and other congressional Democrats that the intelligence community has been withholding from the public specific intelligence information about the threat of foreign interference in American politics." In a statement, Pelosi and House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) said that they were "pleased that Mr. Evanina heeded our call to make additional details public about Russia's malign interference campaign," although they criticized him for identifying Iran and China "as equal threats to our democratic elections."Facebook Removed Pro-Trump Pages Linked To Romanian Network.The Washington Times (8/7, Blake, 492K) reported that Facebook announced Thursday that "Facebook and Instagram accounts touting...Trump were taken down after being traced to a Romanian-based network recently purged from the platforms." The pages, "We Love Our President" on Facebook, and "Black People Vote for Trump" on Instagram, "were among dozens of online profiles removed from the platforms last month for violating their rules against foreign interference."Pompeo Rejects Congressional Subpoenas Seeking Information On Biden Investigation, Linick Dismissal.The AP (8/7, Lee) reported that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday "rejected congressional subpoenas issued for him and for the State Department to provide information and testimony to lawmakers" regarding the State Department's investigation into Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, as well as the dismissal of State Department Inspector General Stephen Linick in May. In letters sent to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Pompeo and the State Department's acting head of legislative affairs, Ryan Kaldahl, "said they had no intention of complying with the subpoenas. They said the subpoenas were politically motivated, without merit, and unnecessary as the information and testimony could be otherwise obtained."Load-Date: August 10, 2020End of Document

Pompeo says Trump will take action 'in the coming days' on TikTok and other Chinese appsCNN WireAugust 2, 2020 Sunday 4:31 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 556 wordsDateline: (CNN) Body (CNN) --  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday that President Donald Trump "will take action in the coming days" on Chinese apps, including TikTok, citing national security risks.Trump told reporters on Friday that he would ban TikTok from operating in the United States through emergency economic powers or an executive order -- though it was not immediately clear what such an order would look like and what legal challenges it might face. The threat met concern from users of the app, who have come to love the short-form video platform. But Pompeo said during an interview on Fox News' "Sunday Morning Futures" that Chinese apps like TikTok are an issue for US national security and the privacy of Americans."Here's what I hope that the American people will come to recognize -- these Chinese software companies doing business the United States, whether it's TikTok or WeChat, there are countless more ... are feeding data directly to the Chinese Communist Party, their national security apparatus -- could be their facial recognition pattern, it could be information about their residence, their phone numbers, their friends, who they're connected to," he told Maria Bartiromo.He continued, "President Trump has said enough and we're going to fix it and so he will take action in the coming days with respect to a broad array of national security risks that are presented by software connected to the Chinese Communist Party."Microsoft is in talks to acquire TikTok, according to the New York Times, citing a person with knowledge of the discussions. Microsoft declined to comment to CNN Business on the matter. Trump firmly rejected the idea of a potential spin-off deal satisfying national security concerns. Asked if acquisition of TikTok by Microsoft would eliminate "China surveillance," Pompeo did not offer a clear answer. "I promise you the President, when he makes his decision, will make sure that everything we have done drives us as close to zero risk for the American people. That's the mission set that he laid out for all of us when we began to evaluate this now several months back. We're closing in on a solution and I think you'll see the President's announcement shortly," he said. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Sunday that there was bipartisan agreement that TikTok could not stay in its current format "because it risks sending back information on 100 million Americans," referencing the concern that American user data will end up in the hands of the Chinese government. He noted Republicans and Democrats, including Sens. Marco Rubio and Tom Cotton, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, were all in agreement."We all agree there needs to be a change," he told Martha Raddatz on ABC's "This Week."Later when talking to reporters, Mnuchin said that the Committee on Foreign Investments in the US, which he chairs, had reviewed the app and unanimously made a recommendation on action to the President but would not give details on what that recommendation was. Mnuchin added that Trump was looking at other options including forcing a sale by TikTok's parent company or banning the app using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.CNN's Brian Fung contributed to this report.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

TikTok CEO resigns after Trump threat to ban Chinese social network use in USCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 27, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 371 wordsBodyChinese company ceo TikTok Kevin Mayer has tendered his resignation just days after US President Donald Trump threatened to ban the use of the network in the United States, the Financial Times has reported.Being a top Disney executive resigns a few months after his appointment by the Chinese short video platform that has denounced the U.S. government for its threats. The Chinese-owned company has been accused of being a risk to U.S. national security by the Trump administration.Mayer joined TikTok in June after leaving his post as Disney's head of streaming services.TikTok recently received a 90-day deadline to be sold to a U.S. company or should face its ban in the United States."In recent weeks, as the political environment has changed dramatically, I have made a meaningful reflection on what corporate structural changes will require and what they mean for the global role I signed up for," Mayer said in a letter to employees who reproduce various international media. However, despite the fact that the talks between the company and Trump continue, Mayer says in the letter: "In this context, and as we hope to reach a resolution very soon, I want to let you know with great regret that I have decided to leave the company."The Trump Administration argues that TikTok poses a "threat" to U.S. national security, so it prevented its transactions from September 15, and is seeking to force its sale to a U.S. company like Microsoft, which has shown interest in the popular social network.TikTok, which in the US has more than 80 million users, is one of the most growing social networks in recent years, where it has become the main entertainment for many teenagers and a marketing channel for major celebrities.A chapter of the trade war China's Foreign Ministry opposes the forced sale of TikTok, an operation it believes violates the principles of the World Trade Organization (WTO).Indeed, the Chinese government sees the intention to sell TikTok as another chapter of the beijing-Washington trade war, which seeks to contain the growing technological power of the Asian giant, which has already seen the telecommunications firm Huawei face restrictions.commentsforum0WhatsApp  Facebook  Twitter  Linkedin       Load-Date: August 28, 2020End of Document

"It would come from the sale whatever the number is."It is unclear under what authority the government could demand such a payment.In a statement, Microsoft confirmed that its chief executive officer, Satya Nadella, had spoken to Trump and was committed to acquiring the company by the stated deadline."Microsoft will move quickly to pursue discussions with TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, in a matter of weeks, and in any event completing these discussions no later than September 15, 2020. During this process, Microsoft looks forward to continuing dialogue with the United States government, including with the president," the statement read."Price is important, as well as whatever restrictions come with it from a government perspective, but I think it's an exciting avenue for Microsoft to really increase its consumer base," the company's largest individual shareholder, former CEO Steve Ballmer, told CNBC earlier Monday.Trump suggested it would be "easier to buy the whole thing than to buy a portion" of TikTok."How do you do 30%? Who is going to get the name? The name is hot. The brand, hot. And who is going to get the name? How do you do that if it's owned by two different companies?" Trump said at the White House.The Chinese video app is extremely popular globally. It has been downloaded 2 billion times, including 165 million times in the United States.TikTok features not only entertainment videos but also debates, and it takes positions on political issues, such as racial justice and the upcoming U.S. presidential election.US president has threatened to ban popular Chinese-owned social media app amid security concernsOfficials in Washington have repeatedly expressed concern that TikTok may pose a security threat, fearing the company might share users' data with the Chinese government.ByteDance has said it does not share user data with the government of China and maintains it stores Americans' user data only in the United States and Singapore.TikTok recently chose former Disney executive Kevin Mayer as its chief executive in a move seen as an effort to distance itself from Beijing."TikTok will be here for many years to come," company spokesperson Hilary McQuaide said in a statement issued Monday.The U.S. government's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), an interagency group led by the Treasury Department, opened a national security review of TikTok last year.CFIUS's job is to oversee foreign investments and assess them for potential national security risks. It can force companies to cancel deals or institute other measures it deems necessary for national security.Load-Date: August 4, 2020End of Document

It represents a severe blow to TikTok's owner, Beijing-based ByteDance, who became one of the few truly global Chinese conglomerates thanks to the commercial success of the app."As far as TikTok is concerned, we're going to ban it in the United States," U.S. President Donald Trump said Friday, drawing the attention of teenagers, the Chinese company, and even the American Microsoft, who was trying to buy it.TikTok said saturday that it will remain in the country, where it has 1,500 workers. "We don't plan to go anywhere," said his general manager in the United States, Vanessa Pappas, who added that they expect to hire another 10,000 people over the next three years.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also wanted to be part of the controversy. He said the U.S. government can force the sale or block the social network if it considers it a threat. "TikTok cannot remain in the current format due to the risk that it will send information [to the Chinese government] about 100 million Americans," he said. They have not yet managed to reach an agreement for the Chinese parent company to detach itself from the operations of its application in the US, according to sources familiar with the matter. Talks are expected to continue in the coming days.45 daysTrump agreed to give the Chinese company ByteDance a 45-day deadline to negotiate the sale of the popular TikTok short video app to Microsoft Corp, two people familiar with the issue yesterday said in dialogue with Reuters. After discussing the issue with tech CEO Satya Nadella, The Washington-based Redwood company, he said in a statement that negotiations to acquire the social network would continue, and that he aimed to reach an agreement by September 15.Negotiations between ByteDance and Microsoft will be overseen by the Foreign Investment Committee in the United States (CFIUS), a U.S. government panel that has the right to block any agreement, according to sources, that requested anonymity prior to a White House announcement, according to Diario de Cuyo. "Microsoft fully appreciates the importance of addressing the president's concerns. It is committed to acquiring TikTok subject to a comprehensive security review and providing the right economic benefits to the United States," Microsoft said in a statement.Under the proposed agreement, Microsoft would take over TikTok's operations in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. With the acquisition, Microsoft would "ensure that all private data of TikTok US users is transferred and remains" in the country. In addition, the technology noted that it will ensure that this data is "removed from servers outside the country after it was transferred".The Trump entry insists he will ban TikTok in the US to put pressure on China was first published in Daily The Republic.Load-Date: August 4, 2020End of Document

Trump orders TikTok's Chinese-owned parent company to divest interest in US operationsCNN WireAugust 15, 2020 Saturday 2:15 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 580 wordsDateline: WASHINGTON (CNN) BodyWASHINGTON (CNN) --  President Donald Trump issued an executive order Friday evening directing ByteDance, the Chinese-owned parent company of TikTok, to divest interest in the app's US operations within the next 90 days. Trump explained in the order that he believes there is "credible evidence" that ByteDance "might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States" following the company's acquisition of the social media app Musical.ly.The step marks just the latest twist in the dramatic back and forth between the popular video app and the President after he declared last month that he would ban TikTok from operating in the US. Trump issued an executive order last week that would ban the app from operating in the US in 45 days if it is not sold.But Friday night's order specifically directs ByteDance to destroy all data obtained from US TikTok owners and inform the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US once it has done so. ByteDance will have to certify on weekly basis that it is in compliance with the order to the committee, which is allowed to take measures to ensure the order's implementation -- including allowing US government employees to have access "to all premises and facilities" of ByteDance, TikTok and their subsidiaries within the US.Attorney General William Barr has the authority to "take any steps necessary" to enforce the order. The order also requires ByteDance to notify the committee of any intended sale or transfer and explicitly states that the committee may consider whether the buyer or transferee is a US citizen or is owned by US citizens. As TikTok has scrambled to keep its American presence alive, Microsoft has emerged as a potential, albeit unlikely, savior for the platform.The company said earlier this month that it was pushing forward with talks to acquire TikTok, following a conversation between CEO Satya Nadella and Trump. The transaction could be complicated and difficult to accomplish, and Microsoft has shifted its strategy from consumers toward businesses in recent years. Still, analysts say the deal is almost certain to be worthwhile for both companies.The app has exploded in popularity in the US and other Western countries, becoming the first Chinese social media platform to gain significant traction with users outside of its home country. It was downloaded 315 million times in the first three months of this year, more quarterly downloads than any other app in history, according to analytics company Sensor Tower.Critics of TikTok worry that the data it collects on its US users could end up in the hands of the Chinese government, though TikTok has said it stores its data outside China and that it would resist any attempts by Beijing to seize the information."TikTok US user data is stored in the US, with strict controls on employee access. TikTok's biggest investors come from the US. We are committed to protecting our users' privacy and safety as we continue working to bring joy to families and meaningful careers to those who create on our platform," TikTok spokesperson Hilary McQuaide told CNN earlier this month.Cybersecurity experts have said TikTok's potential risk to national security is largely theoretical and that there is no evidence to suggest that the app's user data has been compromised by Chinese intelligence.CNN's Brian Fung and Clare Duffy contributed to this report. TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

NICE VIDEO STREAMING BUSINESS YOU GOT THERE...States News ServiceAugust 5, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1875 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Cato Institute:By Julian SanchezOn Monday, Americans witnessed a stunningly brazen act of what can only be called political gangsterism. Speaking from the White House, Donald Trump declared that for "security reasons" the popular video sharing platform TikTokwhich is owned by a Chinese company called ByteDancewould be "shut down" in the United States on September 15, unless it were purchased by Microsoft or another American firm. Moreover, since the government was effectively forcing the sale by threatening to shutter TikTok, Trump expected the U.S. Treasury to get a piece of the actionthough the exact legal mechanism by which the government would take payment for this "service" was left vague. It's worth quoting Trump's explanation at length:I did say that if you buy it, whatever the price is, that goes to whoever owns it, because I guess it's China, essentially, but more than anything else, I said a very substantial portion of that price is going to have to come into the Treasury of the United States. Because we're making it possible for this deal to happen. Right now they don't have any rights, unless we give it to 'em. So if we're going to give them the rights, then it has to come into, it has to come into this country.It's a little bit like the landlord" tenant [relationship]. Uh, without a lease, the tenant has nothing. So they pay what is called "key money" or they pay something. But the United States should be reimbursed, or should be paid a substantial amount of money because without the United States they don't have anything, at least having to do with the 30%.So, uh, I told him that. I think we are going to have, uh, maybe a deal is going to be made, it's a great asset, it's a great asset. But it's not a great asset in the United States unless they have the approval of the United States. So it'll close down on September 15th, unless Microsoft or somebody else is able to buy it, and work out a deal, an appropriate deal, so the Treasury of the really the Treasury, I suppose you would say, of the United States, gets a lot of money. A lot of money.Let's not mince words: This is the Mafia's business model. "We'll threaten your competitor, forcing them to sell the business cheap, but we expect our cut in return." The national security powers of the executive branch are now officially muscle for hire.But howone might reasonably wondercould an app best known for videos of teenagers dancing and lip" syncing pose a national security threat in the first place? A threat so dire it justifies the use of emergency powers to close down an expressive platform used by millions of Americans every day? Can a president even do that?Let's start with the supposed threat. Like many other apps, TikTok collects quite a bit of data about its users, some obvious (such as personal profile information), some less so (device configuration; location on videos that have been geotagged). That data is stored on U.S. servers (with backups in Singapore), and the American CEO of the company's U.S. subsidiary says they would not share it with the Chinese government. But in theory, under China's security laws, the parent company ByteDance could be ordered to produce that data to the Chinese government for some presumptively nefarious purpose.As other analysts have noted, there is something very odd about singling out TikTok as a focus of panic on this front, as the type of personal data collected would be of relatively low intelligence value to China. (Contrast the recent compelled divestiture of the gay dating app Grindr by Chinese firm Kunlun, where there was at least an intelligible argument that the specific nature of the data collected made it uniquely useful for blackmail.) One can imagine how such information might be abused by a government interested in monitoring its own citizens, but it's harder to articulate any coherent reason midwestern teens posting cat videos should be fearful that Maoists are scrutinizing their system settings or geotags. As long as we're spinning hypotheticals, however, TikTok is hardly the only potential corporate source of data about Americans. The Chinese firm Lenovo is one of the largest hardware manufacturers in the world, and owns the U.S. smartphone maker Motorola Mobility. The Qingdao" based Haier Group owns GE Appliances, which sells Internet" enabled devices to the American market. Chinese gaming giant Tencent owns the company that makes League of Legendsone of the most popular games in the world for over a decadeand holds a large stake in Epic Games, developers of the more recent megahit Fortnite. It's not clear why the data collected by TikTok, in particular, poses a greater security threat than the data collected by innumerable other Chinese" owned companiesor, for that matter, by American companies that make use of overseas call or data centers.One might reasonably respond that we should be concerned about any foreign exfiltration of data on U.S. persons. But if so, the rational response is a generally applicable data framework guided by neutral rules and principles, not the arbitrary deployment of the most extreme possible policy response against individual companies that commit the sin of becoming too popular or prominent. The disproportionate panic over TikTok seems to be substantially driven by the fact that it's the hot new thingheavily used by teens, which helps trigger our protective instinctsand therefore attracts media attention more readily than denunciations of foreign" owned appliance makers. And the message to foreign companies considering investing or doing business in the United States is: You may be expropriated virtually overnight, subject to the whims of the president, without having done anything wrong or violated any preexisting rule.It's also worth noting that the argument being deployed against TikTok could just as easily be turned on the United States. Under section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the U.S. government may demand warrantless access to foreign users' informationincluding private communicationsfrom American tech companies. In 2019, a stunning 204,968 foreign persons were targeted for "collection" under that single authority. Indeed, a data sharing agreement between the United States and the European Union was recently invalidatedand its future remains uncertainin part because the E.U. high court deemed such authority inconsistent with the privacy rights of Europeans. The logic behind a ban on TikTok works equally well as a rationale for the rest of the world to ban Google and Facebook.None of this is to deny that TikTok might present a legitimate security risk for some users. Notwithstanding the company's assurances, democracy activists with plans to travel to China would probably be wise to avoid installing it, and government agencies that handle sensitive information would be amply justified in barring it (and many other apps) from employees' phones. But government agencies already have and enforce their own elaborate device security policies. (Recent legislative proposals to specifically bar TikTok from government devices suggest some lawmakers mistakenly believe these agencies require granular security guidance from Congress, at the level of individual appsan unsettling prospect, but fortunately untrue.) The government need not impose on every citizen the security measures appropriate for NSA analysts, or threaten to kick millions of Americans off an expressive platform in order to protect Naval Intelligence officers.Others worry that TikTok could serve as a vehicle for Chinese propaganda and misinformation. But as the 2016 election should have made clear, foreign governments hardly need to operate their own media platforms to engage in such information operations, and there is no good reason to think that TikTok videos pose a bigger threat on this scorewhether the platform is owned by Microsoft or ByteDancethan Facebook posts.So can the president "ban" TikTok? There are a number of legal mechanisms available to the executive that might have that practical effect, though given the thin and almost entirely hypothetical nature of the "national security threat" posed, it would be a gross abuse of power to do so. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States can retroactively demand that ByteDance divest itself of TikTok. Trump could invoke the International Emergency Powers Act, declaring that the popularity of the video sharing app constitutes a "national emergency" and imposing sanctions on its parent company, which would force the Apple and Android app stores to delist the app. That would not remove it from the millions of phones on which it is already installed, however, and at least in theory the platform could continue to operate on overseas servers, both for existing users and those who access it via the Web rather than an appa perverse result if the aim is to prevent Americans' data from being exfiltrated to China. To truly prevent Americans from accessing a foreign platform would, ironically, require something akin to China's "Great Firewall," long considered an emblem of the country's authoritarian repression of speech.However effective such a ban might ultimately be in practice, the prospect ought to be appalling from a First Amendment perspective. Again, this is a platform for expression used daily by millions of Americans. Whileas with most social mediamuch of the content is frivolous, it has also become a vehicle for political speech and organizing. Perhaps not coincidentally, online teens, organizing primarily via TikTok, successfully pranked a recent Trump rally in Tulsa, submitting bogus registrations and inflating attendance expectations, which likely contributed to the spectacle of conspicuously empty seats that is said to have infuriated the president. It is hard not to wonder whether Now the president has announced that, absent a deal with Microsoft, he intends to attempt to shutter the entire platform for "security reasons" less than two months before a presidential electiona drastic response that would radically disrupt the legitimate speech of citizens. There may be valid data privacy concerns about foreign" owned online services that could be addressed by an appropriately general legislative framework. But killing a massively popular venue for speech by executive fiat would be, as Trump is fond of saying, a "cure worse than the problem."In short, Trump's threat is an egregious affront to American values on multiple levels. If Microsoft is unable to reach a deal with TikTok, the president has pledged to unilaterally use the powers of his office to destroy a vast platform for speech and expression whose users recently embarrassed him, invoking a vague and speculative "national security threat" ostensibly posed by a company that has not, as yet, been accused of any actual wrongdoing. If a deal is reached, Trump has announced that the coercion of foreign companiescoercion supposedly required by national security interestsis in fact a service to American corporations, for which the beneficiaries should pay a fee. It's the sort of thing one might expect to see in Chinanot the United States.Load-Date: August 6, 2020End of Document

Ricketts bans Chinese app on state phones, citing securityAssociated Press State & LocalAugust 12, 2020 Wednesday 2:08 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: STATE AND REGIONALLength: 113 wordsDateline: LINCOLN, Neb. BodyLINCOLN, Neb. (AP) — Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts has banned the Chinese app TikTok on state government phones, citing security concerns.Ricketts announced the ban Wednesday, days after President Donald Trump ordered a sweeping ban on dealings with the app's Chinese owners.Ricketts said Nebraska's ban is intended to protect the state against cyberattacks.“The Chinese government has long engaged in systematic, covert efforts to access sensitive data from U.S. governments, companies, and individuals,” he said in a statement. “As an app owned by a company based in China, TikTok is legally obligated to provide data from its users to the country’s communist regime upon request."Load-Date: August 12, 2020End of Document

China wants to sit down and negotiate with the US. The 'detail'? Wants to include TikTok and WeChat in conversationsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 12, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 488 wordsBodyNegotiators from the U.S. and China plan to discuss the progress of their trade agreement in the coming days, and Beijing will push to broaden the agenda to include Washington's recent crackdown on companies like TikTok and WeChat.A virtual meeting would be held this week, although no date has been finalized, according to people familiar with the preparations who asked not to be identified. On Tuesday, President Donald Trump's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, downplayed concerns about the phase one agreement and the possibility of it collapsing.In addition to agricultural purchases and the dollar-yuan exchange rate, Chinese officials intend to put on the table future bans on transactions of the two applications for security reasons—announced by Trump—according to sources, who did not give further details on what China hopes to achieve on the issue.Nearly seven months after the signing of the agreement that ended the tariff war that had shaken the world economy, promised purchases of American products are far behind. With the crisis of the new coronavirus and the deterioration of US-China relations in a number of respects, from technological security to Hong Kong, the trade agreement remains one of the few issues on which the Washington and Beijing governments are still cooperating.The "only front on which we are committed is trade," larry Kudlow, Trump's top economic adviser, said at a press conference at the White House on Tuesday. "Everything's fine now."China seeks to neutralize an unpredictable confrontation with the United States, which has attacked several of its technology leaders. Recent measures could lead to a possible sale of US trades from ByteDance's TikTok short video application to Microsoft.Trump also banned transactions in the US with Tencent Holdings' WeChat app, which has more than one billion users.Trump's executive orders, expected to take effect in September, could have a potentially greater impact than the prolonged attack on telecom hardware provider Huawei, as they threaten to cut off communication links between people in the world's largest economies.The US argues that Chinese applications that collect information about U.S. citizens pose a serious risk to national security, as the data could be acquired by the Chinese government.Given the collapse of the world economy this year linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, of which Trump has repeatedly blamed China, bythe end of June Beijing has met just 25 percent of the goal of buying more than $170 billion in U.S. products this year.On Tuesday, Kudlow downplayed the deficit and said China had "substantially" increased purchases of U.S. products.China would need to buy about $130 billion in thesecond semester to comply with the original terms of the agreement signed in January, which provided for the purchase of an additional $200 billion in U.S. goods and services through the end of 2021 at the 2017 level.Load-Date: August 13, 2020End of Document

China announces Beijing and Washington will hold talks on trade dealCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 20, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 439 wordsBodyAlthough the President of the United States has canceled the latest round of talks with China, Beijing announced that a new meeting between the parties is "coming soon" to assess the implementation of the phase one trade agreement between the world's two largest economies.The Ministry of Commerce announced in Beijing that the two countries will "soon" resume talks. The news was given by Gao Feng, a Chinese government spokesman, when asked whether the previously scheduled meeting on phase one would take place.    No further details have been revealed on the Chinese side, such as the date of the meeting or its purpose, but the information contradicts the latest statements by the United States on the subject that has been going on for months.            Read Also Trump cancels negotiations with Beijing: "I don't want to talk to China right now" Donald Trump said Tuesday that he was responsible for cancelling talks with China. "I canceled talks with China," Trump said Tuesday in Arizona. "I don't want to talk to China right now."The agreement reached in January, which entered into force in February, implied an evaluation of its implementation every six months, but the first, scheduled for the end of last week, ultimately did not happen. Although the agenda for the talks was never formally announced, the South China Morning Post revealed that the meeting, by videoconference, was scheduled for last Sunday and would include Chinese Deputy Prime Minister Liu He, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.According to Trump this meeting will no longer happen, but on the Chinese side the information points to this happening soon. Asked whether the United States is planning to withdraw from this phase one agreement, the White House leader said only that "we'll see what happens." According to Bloomberg, the cancellation of the agreement would imply written notification and would take effect after 60 days unless the two parties agreed to another timetable.As part of this understanding, China has made structural changes in several areas such as the protection of intellectual property rights, but has fallen far short in its promise to increase purchases of goods from the United States.Trump, for his part, just months before the November presidential election, has increased pressure on China, not only on the situation in Taiwan and Hong Kong, but also on the country's technology.Recently, Trump signed two executive orders imposing restrictions on tiktok and wechat owners, and threatened a broader war against the entire industry, citing national security-related risks.Load-Date: August 21, 2020End of Document

The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.6% to close at a record high, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6%, and the Russell 2000 gained 0.9%.All 11 S&P 500 sectors closed in positive territory, with energy (+1.9%) and materials (+1.1%) rising more than 1.0%. The information technology sector (+1.0%) was next in line, but it was perhaps the most influential gainer today given its top-weighted position in the S&P 500. The health care sector (+0.2%) lagged.In the tech space, Workday (WDAY 243.88, +27.25, +12.6%), HP Inc. (HPQ 19.85, +1.15, +6.2%), Dell (DELL 66.21, +3.78, +6.1%), and VMware (VMW 146.09, +3.19, +2.2%) stood out as earnings winners. Semiconductor stocks also chipped in a solid outing, evident by the 2.0% increase in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index.There was no one specific catalyst today, but investors did receive another batch of better-than-expected economic data that helped broaden out the gains.For July, personal income increased 0.4% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -0.2%) and personal spending rose 1.9% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +1.5%). The final University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for August ticked up to 74.1 (Briefing.com consensus 72.8) from the preliminary reading of 72.8.The data provided some fuel for the reopening stocks like casinos, airlines, cruise lines, and hotels. Shares of MGM Resorts (MGM 23.86, +1.05, +4.6%) rose nearly 5%, even as the company announced plans to lay off 18,000 furloughed employees as a result of the pandemic.U.S. Treasuries finished mixed. The 2-yr yield was flat at 0.15%, and the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 0.73%. The U.S. Dollar Index fell 0.7% to 92.32. WTI crude futures declined 0.1% to $42.97/bbl. The CBOE Volatility Index declined 6.2% to 22.96 after touching 26.30 at its intraday high.Reviewing Friday's economic data:Personal income increased 0.4% m/m in July (Briefing.com consensus -0.2%), which was much better than expected, and personal spending rose 1.9% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +1.5%), which was also much better than expected. The PCE Price Index and core-PCE Price Index both increased 0.3% m/m and were weaker than expected increases of 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively. That left the PCE Price Index up 1.0% yr/yr, versus 0.9% in June, and the core PCE Price Index up 1.3% yr/yr, versus 1.1% in June.The key takeaway from the report is that the income gain was driven by an increase in compensation (+1.3% m/m), which more than offset a 1.7% m/m decrease in personal current transfer receipts. In other words, the income gain was driven by people returning to work as the economy reopened.The final University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for August ticked up to 74.1 (Briefing.com consensus 72.8) from the preliminary reading of 72.8. The final reading for July was 72.5.The key takeaway from the report is that consumer sentiment has been slow to rebound and that the incremental improvement seen has been based simply on the view that things couldn't get worse than they were at the depths of the shutdown period.The Chicago PMI for August decreased to 51.2 from 51.9 in July.Wholesale inventories decreased 0.1% in July following a revised 1.3% decline in June (from -1.4%).Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +30.4% YTDS&P 500 +8.6% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +0.4% YTDRussell 2000 -5.4% YTD16:21FREQ Frequency Therapeutics files for 2,350,108 share common stock offering by selling shareholders (19.65 -0.34)16:16WRAPX This week's biggest % gainers/losers The following are this week's top percentage gainers and losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).This week's top % gainers Healthcare: RYTM (26.88 +45.53%), CYRX (55.51 +42.99%)Industrials: BMCH (41.3 +25.42%), DY (57.36 +24.05%)Consumer Discretionary: PRTY (2.84 +41.75%), RUTH (11.15 +31.31%), NIO (18.28 +29.44%), LIND (10.12 +28.26%), RRGB (11.1 +27.59%), PLAY (17.2 +27.31%), URBN (23.72 +25.81%)Information Technology: SPWR (11.66 +52.21%), NTNX (28.23 +34.57%), CRM (270.27 +30.23%), PLAN (61.56 +25.86%), CSIQ (32.52 +25.27%)This week's top % losers Healthcare: ODT (18.05 -46.18%), QDEL (163.72 -32.21%), OPK (3.31 -32%), TCDA (10.03 -24.24%), NVAX (107.32 -22.02%), OSUR (11.67 -21.07%), QTNT (5.02 -18.46%), LMNX (26.56 -15.6%)Consumer Discretionary: GTX (3.38 -49.4%), MOGU (2.47 -21.34%), OSTK (95.88 -20.82%)Information Technology: PLT (12.8 -21.33%), CASA (4.27 -14.85%)Energy: CHK (4.4 -21.43%), FTSI (4.15 -16.33%), DHT (5.25 -15.44%)16:09ASMB Assembly Biosciences files for $300 mln mixed securities shelf offering (21.73 +0.49)16:08ABUS Arbutus Biopharma files for $200 mln mixed securities shelf offering (3.03 +0.11)16:07CYAD Celyad SA files for $250 mln mixed securities shelf offering (10.26 +1.03)16:02LPCN Lipocine provides regulatory update for TLANDO; FDA needs additional time to complete review of NDA (1.65 )Lipocine today announced that the FDA has informed the company that it needs additional time to complete its review of TLANDO's New Drug Application (NDA) and is committed to taking action as expeditiously as possible.

Treasuries of most tenors began the day near their flat lines while the 30-yr bond lagged from the start. The market faced some selling in response to the July Personal Income/Outlays report, which showed better than expected income and spending growth, but the core PCE price index increased at a slower than expected rate. Treasuries followed the brief dip with a rally that continued into mid-morning trade. Midday action saw some backtracking that pressured the long bond into negative territory while the 10-yr note narrowed its gain. The 5-yr note and the 3-yr note outperformed notably, reclaiming their entire losses from yesterday. The 2s10s spread ended the week nine basis points wider at 58 bps while the 2s30s spread widened by 16 bps to 136 bps. In Washington, White House Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows, said that House Speaker Pelosi turned down a $1.30 trln fiscal stimulus proposal.

The PCE Price Index and core-PCE Price Index both increased 0.3% m/m and were weaker than expected increases of 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively. That left the PCE Price Index up 1.0% yr/yr, versus 0.9% in June, and the core PCE Price Index up 1.3% yr/yr, versus 1.1% in June. The key takeaway from the report is that the income gain was driven by an increase in compensation (+1.3% m/m), which more than offset a 1.7% m/m decrease in personal current transfer receipts. In other words, the income gain was driven by people returning to work as the economy reopened. The advance goods trade deficit totaled $79.30 bln in July after a $71.00 bln deficit in June. Advance Wholesale Inventories ticked down 0.1% in July after falling a revised 1.3% (from -1.4%) in June. The final University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for August ticked up to 74.1 (Briefing.com consensus 72.8) from the preliminary reading of 72.8. The final reading for July was 72.5. The key takeaway from the report is that consumer sentiment has been slow to rebound and that the incremental improvement seen has been based simply on the view that things couldn't get worse than they were at the depths of the shutdown period.

The Nasdaq Composite is up 0.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.5%, and Russell 2000 is up 0.4%.Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are trading in positive territory. The information technology sector's 0.7% gain is carrying the most weight, but the energy (+1.2%) and materials (+0.9%) sectors are up the most. Conversely, the defensive-oriented real estate (-0.2%), utilities (-0.2%), and health care (-0.3%) sectors are the lone holdouts.The gains are broad in the tech space. Heavyweight Visa (V 214.86, +3.82, +1.8%) is up 2%, semiconductor stocks are outperforming based on the 1.3% gain in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, and there are numerous earnings winners.For example, Workday (WDAY 243.04, +26.41, +12.2%), HP Inc. (HPQ 19.85, +1.15, +6.1%), Dell (DELL 66.16, +3.73, +6.1%), and VMware (VMW 147.51, +4.61, +3.2%) are up noticeably following better-than-expected earnings reports.Reopening stocks like casinos, airlines, and cruise lines are also exhibiting strength. Retailer Ulta Beauty (ULTA 237.65, 13.70, +6.1%) is up 6% after exceeding earnings estimates.Walmart (WMT 140.16, +3.54, +2.6%) is another standout today. Walmart is approaching the $400 billion market capitalization, which would put it an exclusive club with Tesla (TSLA 2249.20, +10.45, +0.4%), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 152.78, -0.21, -0.1%), and Taiwan Semi (TSM 80.35, -0.24, -0.3%).Elsewhere, there are subtle signs of caution. The 10-yr yield is down three basis points to 0.72% amid an uptick in buying interest, gold futures are up 2.4% to $1970.00 amid a weaker dollar (92.32, -0.68, -0.7%), and the CBOE Volatility Index is up 1.6% to 24.86 but it was up as much as 7.5% earlier.Reviewing today's economic data:Personal income increased 0.4% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -0.2%), which was much better than expected, and personal spending rose 1.9% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +1.5%), which was also much better than expected. The PCE Price Index and core-PCE Price Index both increased 0.3% m/m and were weaker than expected increases of 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively. That left the PCE Price Index up 1.0% yr/yr, versus 0.9% in June, and the core PCE Price Index up 1.3% yr/yr, versus 1.1% in June.The key takeaway from the report is that the income gain was driven by an increase in compensation (+1.3% m/m), which more than offset a 1.7% m/m decrease in personal current transfer receipts. In other words, the income gain was driven by people returning to work as the economy reopened.The preliminary University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for August ticked up to 72.8 (Briefing.com consensus 70.5) from the final reading of 72.5 for July.The key takeaway from the report is that there was little overall change from the preceding period. The University of Michigan provided a table showing consumer expectations by political affiliation, which showed a stark difference in expectations among those who identify as Republican (97.4) and Democrat (45.0). Expectations of respondents identifying as Independent were essentially in the middle (66.7).The Chicago PMI for August decreased to 51.2 from 51.9 in July.Wholesale inventories decreased 0.1% in July following a revised 1.3% decline in June (from -1.4%).12:22SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (66) outpacing new lows (10) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ABT, AKAM, ANSS, ARCB, ARNA, BKI, BLDR, BMCH, CHDN, CHWY, CMG, COST, CRBP, CRWD, CSIQ, CSTL, CTAS, DELL, DY, EGAN, ENPH, EPAM, EW, EXPD, FCX, FDX, FIZZ, FLWS, FSLR, HIBB, HUBS, IAA, IIPR, JOE, KNSL, KURA, LSTR, MA, MMSI, MRTX, NOW, NVDA, ODFL, RH, ROKU, RUN, RYTM, SCCO, SILK, SPLK, SWAV, TENB, TGTX, TNDM, TSLA, V, VEEV, VICR, VRNS, VSLR, WDAY, WMT, YUMC, Z, ZM, ZSStocks that traded to 52 week lows: ADES, AERI, ASC, CVIAQ, DNRCQ, DSSI, SR, STNG, TLRDQ, VALPQThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: CWCOETFs that traded to 52 week highs: BKF, ENZL, FDN, FXA, GXC, IGV, IHI, IYK, IYM, PBD, PBW, SKYY, TAN, URA, XLB, XLK, XLP12:04XLY Sector Briefing: Consumer Discretionary (150.35 +0.80)The heavily weighted consumer discretionary sector (+0.5%) is among today's outperformers, extending this week's gain to 3.1%. The influential sector has rallied 9.2% in August, trailing only technology (+0.8%; +11.2% month-to-date) and communication services (+0.3%; +15.5% month-to-date) on the August leaderboard.The discretionary sector owes its outperformance to gains in about 2/3 of its components. Ulta (ULTA 237.39, +13.44, +6.0%) is the best performer after beating Q2 EPS estimates on light revenue while casino and cruise stocks also appear among the leaders.Notable movers:Ulta (ULTA 237.39, +13.44, +6.0%): leading performer, approached its June high after beating Q2 earnings estimates on light revenue.

Also, as previously disclosed, the company conducted its own review and implemented remedial and improvement measures based upon this review, including replacement of certain employees and enhancements of policies and procedures in China. The company cooperated with the SEC and DOJ and has now reached separate resolutions with each of them. On August 28, the SEC accepted the Offer of Settlement and issued an administrative order finding that the company violated the books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA. In addition, on August 28, the company and DOJ separately entered into a court-approved deferred prosecution agreement (DPA), under which DOJ deferred criminal prosecution of the company for a period of three years related to a conspiracy to violate the books and records provisions of the FCPA. Among other things, the company is required to undertake compliance self-reporting obligations for the three-year term of the respective agreements with the SEC and DOJ. If the company remains in compliance with the DPA during its three-year term, the deferred charge against the company will be dismissed with prejudice. In addition, the company agreed to pay the SEC and DOJ aggregate penalties, disgorgement, and prejudgment interest of approx. $123 mln. The company previously recognized an estimated aggregate accrued liability for these matters of approx. $123 mln, which has been recognized in other current liabilities within its condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2020. Accordingly, there will not be any additional impact on the company's results of operations.10:41TALKX Market Briefing: Growth stocks out front again (along with the VIX)Any performance edge cyclical/value stocks might have had early has faded, as they are now looking up at growth stocks once again. This disparity is evident in the major indices, as the Russell 2000 (+0.5%) and Nasdaq Composite (+0.4%) are outlegging the S&P 500 (+0.1%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%).The larger takeaway, though, is that sellers have been unable to pack any real punch so far, as each of the major indices is in positive territory.The leadership of the mega-cap growth stocks, the fear of missing out on further gains, and the understanding that the Fed isn't going to get in the way of things soon with a rate hike, have been underpinning factors for the broader market.The latter point notwithstanding, one can detect the emergence of some pullback angst in the outperformance of the CBOE Volatility Index (25.80, +1.33, +5.4%) and the renewed buying interest in the Treasury market where gains are being logged across the curve. Currently, the 10-yr note yield is down four basis points to 0.71% after scraping 0.78% in the overnight trade.Once again, the S&P 500 information technology sector (+0.6%) sits atop the performance board in a generally mixed market. The weakest area thus far is the real estate sector (-0.6%).10:33ADAP Adaptimmune Therapeutics announces presentation of "promising" data from Phase 1 trial with ADP-A2AFP in liver cancer (8.36 +0.22)Adaptimmune Therapeutics presented data from its Phase 1 trial with SPEAR T-cells targeting AFP at the virtual International Liver Congress. One patient out of four dosed with 5 bln or more cells had a complete response, which was reported previously. The data also demonstrate an acceptable safety profile in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Top-line data presented include:One patient had a complete response and also demonstrated a sustained reduction in serum AFP. This patient experienced disease progression, having developed new lesions at Week 32.Overall, nine patients have been treated as of the data cutoff. Of those:Four patients have been treated with ~5 bln or more transduced cells (three in Cohort 3 and one in the expansion phase): 1 patient with the complete response, 1 with stable disease (SD), and 2 had progressive disease (PD).Five patients were previously treated in the first two dose cohorts with doses of 100 mln and 1 bln transduced cells, respectively, and all patients had best responses of SD.ADP-A2AFP SPEAR T-cells were associated with an acceptable safety profile with no evidence of significant T-cell related hepatotoxicity and no protocol-defined dose limiting toxicities. Evidence of dose-dependent persistence of ADP-A2AFP SPEAR T-cells post-infusion. Further translational evaluation is ongoing to understand indicators of response.10:33XLK Sector Briefing: Technology (122.91 +0.81)The top-weighted technology sector (+0.8%) started today's session in the lead, making for a continuation of this week's outperformance.

The study demonstrated statistically significant improvement in overall survival for Menkes disease subjects who received early treatment (ET) with CUTX-101, compared to an untreated historical control (HC) cohort, with a nearly 80% reduction in the risk of death (Hazard Ratio = 0.21, p<0.0001). Median survival for the ET cohort was 14.8 years (177.1 months) compared to 1.3 years (15.9 months) for the untreated HC cohort.Based on the criteria outlined in the SAP to ensure the two cohorts were comparable, 31 Menkes disease patients who received ET with CUTX-101 and 18 HC Menkes disease patients were included in the primary efficacy analysis. The primary endpoint of overall survival was met. "With no currently approved [FDA] treatments, Menkes disease is a serious condition with a significant unmet medical need," said Lung S. Yam, M.D., Ph.D., President and CEO of Cyprium.Rolling submission of a NDA for CUTX-101 is on track to begin in Q4 of 2020.The top-line primary efficacy data and other relevant briefing materials will be presented to the FDA at a pre-NDA meeting scheduled for later in the current quarter. Other pre-specified secondary and sensitivity analyses will be included in the NDA submission.08:35WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: +15.10.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.6%) and Russell 2000 (+0.3%) performed slightly better, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.3% after setting an all-time high earlier in the session.Financial stocks were among today's biggest winners, benefiting from some curve-steepening activity after Fed Chair Powell outlined a shift towards an average inflation target. Under the new framework, the Fed would allow PCE inflation to run moderately beyond 2.0% over time to make up for years when it ran below 2.0%.From a sector perspective, the S&P 500 financials sector finished atop the standings with a 1.7% gain, followed by real estate (+1.4%), health care (+0.8%), and consumer staples (+0.6%). The communication services (-1.3%), consumer discretionary (-0.7%), and materials (-0.2%) sectors were the lone holdouts.Other positive factors today included reports that Microsoft (MSFT 226.58, +5.43, +2.5%) and Walmart (WMT 136.63, +5.93, +4.5%) are teaming up to possibly acquire TikTok US, and Abbott Labs (ABT 111.29, +8.10, +7.9%) receiving emergency use authorization from the FDA for its $5.00, 15-minute COVID-19 antigen test.Mega-cap growth stocks had a relatively weak outing today after an incredibly strong performance yesterday. Microsoft was an exception, of course, and so was Tesla (TSLA 2238.75, +85.58, +4.0%).As an aside, Senate Majority Leader McConnell (R-KY) reportedly said stimulus talks remained at a stalemate, which may have been a contributing factor in the market's brief dip into negative territory around 1:00 p.m. ET. The market, however, swiftly rebounded into positive territory.Recapping the moves in the Treasury market, the 2-yr yield finished flat at 0.16%, while the 10-yr yield increased six basis points to 0.75% as investors sold longer-dated bonds following Fed Chair Powell's speech. The U.S. Dollar Index was little changed at 93.03. WTI crude futures declined 0.8%, or $0.36, to $43.03/bbl.Reviewing Thursday's economic data:Initial jobless claims for the week ending August 22 were roughly in-line with expectations, decreasing by 98,000 to 1.006 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.000 million). Continuing claims for the week ending August 15 decreased by 223,000 to 14.535 million. The key takeaway from the report is that the labor market, while recovering, is still fractured in a big way that is not conducive for strong and sustained economic growth.The second estimate for Q2 GDP showed output decreased at an annualized rate of 31.7% (Briefing.com consensus -32.9%) versus the advance estimate of -32.9%. The GDP price index was down 2.0% (Briefing.com consensus -1.8%) versus the advance estimate of -1.8%.The key takeaway from the report is that the upward revision doesn't change the fact that the COVID crisis triggered the biggest downturn for the U.S. economy on record.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Personal Income and Spending report for July, the final Univ. of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for August, and Wholesale Inventories for July on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +29.6% YTDS&P 500 +7.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -0.2% YTDRussell 2000 -6.2% YTD16:20KMI Kinder Morgan announces commercial in-service of final Movable Modular Liquefaction unit at Elba Island Liquefaction facility (13.86 +0.13)The Elba Liquefaction Company, a joint venture between Kinder Morgan and EIG Global Energy Partners, announced today the commercial in-service of Unit 7, the last of 10 Movable Modular Liquefaction units of the approx. $2 bln Elba Liquefaction project.

Trump to ban TikTok app in THE US even if there is no evidence that China uses it to spy on its usersCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 1, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 412 wordsBodyU.S. President Donald Trump announced Friday that he will ban the use of the TikTok app in the US, while en ampassured that he "has authority" to do so. The US government has expressed concern about the use of us-language user data that the application might make, in the face of suspicions that they were potentially accessible to the Chinese Executive. Trump justifies a national security risk even though cybersecurity experts confirm that there is no evidence of this."As far as TikTok is concerned, we're going to ban it in the United States," Trump told the press aboard Air Force One. Thus, he has specified that to prohibit it he would use emergency economic powers or an executive order, although he has not provided further details in this regard, according to the CNN television network.Hours earlier, it referred to the matter and confirmed that its Administration was considering banning the use of the mobile phone application, following the opening of an investigation to the 'app' for national security reasons. "We're analyzing TikTok. We could ban TikTok, we could do other things. There are a couple of options, but a lot of things are happening," said the representative.Is there a risk of espionage in TikTok?The investigation against TikTok, owned by China's ByteDance, has been conducted by the U.S. Foreign Investment Committee. U.S. authorities were concerned about whether the 'app' poses a risk to national security.Specifically, critics of the application were wary of whether the data TikTok could collect from US users could end up in the hands of the Chinese government, even though the company has assured it stores its data outside China and would resist any attempt by Beijing to appropriate the information.For their part, cybersecurity experts have pointed out that the potential national security risk posed by the application is, above all, theoretical and that there is no evidence to suggest that TikTok user data may be compromised by China Intelligence.Beijing on Thursday accused Washington of "threatening Chinese companies without evidence" and thereby violating "the principles of the World Trade Organization (WTO)". "Without evidence, the United States threatens a Chinese company in the wake of a presumption of guilt, revealing its hypocrisy in the so-called 'respect for justice and freedoms'," criticized Wang Wenbin, foreign Ministry spokesman for the Asian giant.commentsforum0WhatsApp  Facebook  Twitter  Linkedin       Load-Date: August 2, 2020End of Document

Microsoft in advanced talks to buy TikTok's US businessAssociated Press InternationalAugust 1, 2020 Saturday 6:50 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; POLITICAL NEWSLength: 1027 wordsByline: TALI ARBEL and ANNE D'INNOCENZIO, AP Technology WriterDateline: NEW YORK BodyNEW YORK (AP) — Microsoft is in advanced talks to buy the U.S. operations of TikTok, the popular Chinese-owned video app that has been a source of national security and censorship concerns, according to a person familiar with the discussions who spoke only on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity to the negotiations.The potential deal would be a victory for both companies, making Microsoft Corp. a major player in the social media arena and providing relief to TikTok and its parent company, Bytedance Ltd., a target of President Donald Trump's.Trump said Friday that he would take action as soon as Saturday to ban TikTok in the United States. Trump’s comments on Friday aboard Air Force One came after published reports that the administration is planning to order China’s ByteDance to sell TikTok.“As far as TikTok is concerned, we’re banning them from the United States,” Trump told reporters Friday on Air Force One as he returned from Florida.Trump said he could use emergency economic powers or an executive order to enforce the action, insisting, “I have that authority.” He added, "It’s going to be signed tomorrow.”Microsoft declined to comment.Reports by Bloomberg News and the Wall Street Journal citing anonymous sources said the administration could soon announce a decision ordering ByteDance to divest its ownership in TikTok.There have been reports of U.S. tech giants and financial firms being interested in buying or investing in TikTok as the Trump administration sets its sights on the app. The New York Times and Fox Business, citing an unidentified source, first reported Friday that Microsoft is in talks to buy TikTok.TikTok issued a statement Friday saying that, “While we do not comment on rumors or speculation, we are confident in the long-term success of TikTok.”On Saturday it posted a short video from its U.S. General Manager Vanessa Pappas saying that “We're not planning on going anywhere.”ByteDance launched TikTok in 2017, then bought Musical.ly, a video service popular with teens in the U.S. and Europe, and combined the two. A twin service, Douyin, is available for Chinese users.TikTok's fun, goofy videos and ease of use has made it immensely popular, and U.S. tech giants like Facebook and Snapchat see it as a competitive threat. It has said it has tens of millions of U.S. users and hundreds of millions globally.But its Chinese ownership has raised concerns about the censorship of videos, including those critical of the Chinese government, and the potential for sharing user data with Chinese officials.TikTok maintains it doesn’t censor videos based on topics sensitive to China and it would not give the Chinese government access to U.S. user data even if asked. The company has hired a U.S. CEO, a former top Disney executive, in an attempt to distance itself from its Chinese ownership.U.S. national-security officials have been reviewing the Musical.ly acquisition in recent months, while U.S. armed forces have banned their employees from installing TikTok on government-issued phones. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said this month that the U.S. was considering banning TikTok.These national-security worries parallel a broader U.S. security crackdown on Chinese companies, including telecom providers Huawei and ZTE. The Trump administration has ordered that the U.S. stop funding equipment from those providers in U.S. networks. It has also tried to steer allies away from Huawei because of worries about the Chinese government's access to data, which the company has denied it has.The Trump administration has stepped in before to block or dissolve deals on national-security concerns, including stopping Singapore's Broadcom from its $117 billion bid for U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm in 2018 in an effort to help retain U.S. leadership in the telecom space. It also told China's Beijing Kunlun Tech Co. to sell off its 2016 purchase of gay dating app Grindr.Other countries are also taking action against TikTok. India this month banned dozens of Chinese apps, including TikTok, citing privacy concerns, amid tensions between the countries.The U.S. government’s poor track record in bolstering Americans' data privacy more broadly lessens its credibility in taking on Chinese-owned companies, according to Susan Ariel Aaronson, a professor at George Washington University and a data governance and national-security expert. The federal government has not passed broad privacy or data-security legislation despite efforts to do so last year, and the Justice Department has tried to undermine encryption - which makes sure only a sender and receiver can see content they exchange - for law-enforcement reasons. Tech companies have pushed back against that.“I continue to be wary of forcing a sale of TikTok without data protection laws they could try to follow,” Alex Stamos, the former chief security officer at Facebook who now studies internet security at Stanford University, tweeted on Friday. He added that Microsoft “has one of the best child safety teams, which is a larger risk on TikTok right now.”Microsoft, which owns LinkedIn, is the No. 4 digital ad company in the U.S., after Google, Facebook and Amazon. Still, buying TikTok would be a significant change of direction from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s focus on workplace software that makes people more productive, said technology industry analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy. Unlike Google or Facebook, which dominate the digital advertising industry, Microsoft hasn’t been under the intense scrutiny of U.S. politicians and antitrust regulators lately over its market power. Moorhead said that might make it easier to swoop in and acquire TikTok, which poses a competitive threat to social networks like Facebook, Instagram, Google’s YouTube and Snapchat. It’s an interesting irony that it was Microsoft at the center of the landmark antitrust case 20 years ago.If the deal goes through, “it would definitely make Microsoft a much more competitive advertising system in years to come,” said eMarketer analyst Ross Benes.___Kevin Freking aboard Air Force One and Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this reportLoad-Date: August 2, 2020End of Document

It’s an interesting irony that it was Microsoft at the center of the landmark antitrust case 20 years ago.If the deal goes through, “it would definitely make Microsoft a much more competitive advertising system in years to come,” said eMarketer analyst Ross Benes.___Kevin Freking aboard Air Force One and Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this reportLoad-Date: August 2, 2020End of Document

TikTok and WeChat, a US security threat, experts sayCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 8, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 605 wordsBodyDespite Donald Trump's reasons for turning a rudder against Chinese internet jewelry, Tik Tok and WeChat do not pose a "major" threat to U.S. security, consider industry experts who suspect the president has other motivations."There is no justification for banning an application just because it's Chinese," Daniel Castro of the Foundation for Innovation and Information Technology told AFP.For the expert, "security risk allegations must be backed up by solid evidence, not unfounded innuendo."Castro fears that the measure will be counterproductive to American tech giants."They're going to lose share in the global market if other countries start applying the same rules and block American companies because they fear being watched by the United States," he added.Trump signed a decree Thursday banning, from 45 days from his signature, all transactions of people under US jurisdiction with ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of the Tik Tok video application.The representative took a similar move against the WeChat platform, which belongs to chinese giant Tencent and is ubiquitous in the lives of chinese with various services, including messaging, remote payments and bookings.The Republican tycoon invoked a "national emergency," accusing the two applications of collecting information for Beijing.Both platforms "pose more of a political problem than a security threat," said Nicholas Weaver, a professor of computer security at the University of California.To be sure, they collect data from hundreds of millions of users and WeChat stores it on servers in China, which under a 2017 law, must be accessible to china's intelligence services."WeChat uses encrypted links with its servers in China, but those servers can see all the messages, and the Chinese government as well," Weaver said.For the expert, however, there are not many alternatives if one wants to communicate widely with the Chinese, both inside and outside the country. "By banning WeChat, you will primarily prevent Americans from communicating with friends or relatives in China, which is a horrible idea."- Politics or security? -As for the TikTok app, very popular with young people, it represents "a massive data extraction operation" but no more or less than American social networks. "Of course the Chinese government can access it, just like the U.S. government," he said.For Weaver these platforms do not pose a particular risk as long as users are aware of the danger.The best approach "is not a complete ban, but to better communicate with U.S. companies to call them to be vigilant and configure government systems to avoid risks" of espionage, he warns."Real security threats, and there are, are best handled with discretion," Weaver warned."This is clearly a political concern rather than security concern," he added.Neither WeChat nor Tik Tok should be installed on the phones of U.S. officials, said Adeam Segal, director of the Foreign Council's digital security program.But the ban "is not an essential action to increase cybersecurity," he agrees, speculating on Trump's possible political motivations, which seeks to be re-elected in the November 3 election, to make the decision.The Republican president "seems motivated by his sense of technological competition with the Chinese and his desire to stand firm against China as the election approaches," Segal said, emphasizing the ad's ambiguityPresidential.The Trump administration "was very clear when it said that we were going to compete with China and that we had to contain it," he said. On the other hand, "it has not made clear what you expect from China."rl-pmh/chp/la/gfe/yowLoad-Date: August 9, 2020End of Document

Here are excerpts of the report issued on Aug. 26 and written by Kelley M. Sayler, analyst in advanced technology and global security:Summary:Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing field of technology with potentially significant implications for national security. As such, the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) and other nations are developing AI applications for a range of military functions. AI research is underway in the fields of intelligence collection and analysis, logistics, cyber operations, information operations, command and control, and in a variety of semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles.Already, AI has been incorporated into military operations in Iraq and Syria. Congressional action has the potential to shape the technology's development further, with budgetary and legislative decisions influencing the growth of military applications as well as the pace of their adoption.AI technologies present unique challenges for military integration, particularly because the bulk of AI development is happening in the commercial sector. Although AI is not unique in this regard, the defense acquisition process may need to be adapted for acquiring emerging technologies like AI. In addition, many commercial AI applications must undergo significant modification prior to being functional for the military. A number of cultural issues also challenge AI acquisition, as some commercial AI companies are averse to partnering with DOD due to ethical concerns, and even within the department, there can be resistance to incorporating AI technology into existing weapons systems and processes.Potential international rivals in the AI market are creating pressure for the United States to compete for innovative military AI applications. China is a leading competitor in this regard, releasing a plan in 2017 to capture the global lead in AI development by 2030. Currently, China is primarily focused on using AI to make faster and more well-informed decisions, as well as on developing a variety of autonomous military vehicles. Russia is also active in military AI development, with a primary focus on robotics.Although AI has the potential to impart a number of advantages in the military context, it may also introduce distinct challenges. AI technology could, for example, facilitate autonomous operations, lead to more informed military decisionmaking, and increase the speed and scale of military action. However, it may also be unpredictable or vulnerable to unique forms of manipulation. As a result of these factors, analysts hold a broad range of opinions on how influential AI will be in future combat operations. While a small number of analysts believe that the technology will have minimal impact, most believe that AI will have at least an evolutionary--if not revolutionary--effect.Military AI development presents a number of potential issues for Congress:* What is the right balance of commercial and government funding for AI development?* How might Congress influence defense acquisition reform initiatives that facilitate military AI development?* What changes, if any, are necessary in Congress and DOD to implement effective oversight of AI development?* How should the United States balance research and development related to artificial intelligence and autonomous systems with ethical considerations?* What legislative or regulatory changes are necessary for the integration of military AI applications?* What measures can Congress take to help manage the AI competition globally?* * *Contents:IntroductionAI Terminology and BackgroundIssues for CongressAI Applications for DefenseIntelligence, Surveillance, and ReconnaissanceLogisticsCyberspace OperationsInformation Operations and "Deep Fakes"Command and ControlSemiautonomous and Autonomous VehiclesLethal Autonomous Weapon Systems (LAWS)Military AI Integration ChallengesTechnologyProcessPersonnelCultureInternational CompetitorsChinaRussiaInternational InstitutionsAI Opportunities and ChallengesAutonomySpeed and EnduranceScalingInformation SuperiorityPredictabilityExplainabilityExploitationAI's Potential Impact on CombatMinimal Impact on CombatEvolutionary Impact on CombatRevolutionary Impact on Combat* * *Introduction/1Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing field of technology that is capturing the attention of commercial investors, defense intellectuals, policymakers, and international competitors alike, as evidenced by a number of recent initiatives. On July 20, 2017, the Chinese government released a strategy detailing its plan to take the lead in AI by 2030. Less than two months later Vladimir Putin publicly announced Russia's intent to pursue AI technologies, stating, "[W]hoever becomes the leader in this field will rule the world."/2Similarly, the U.S. National Defense Strategy, released in January 2018, identified artificial intelligence as one of the key technologies that will "ensure [the United States] will be able to fight and win the wars of the future."/3The U.S. military is already integrating AI systems into combat via a spearhead initiative called Project Maven, which uses AI algorithms to identify insurgent targets in Iraq and Syria./4These dynamics raise several questions that Congress addressed in hearings during 2017, 2018, and 2019: What types of military AI applications are possible, and what limits, if any, should be imposed? What unique advantages and vulnerabilities come with employing AI for defense? How will AI change warfare, and what influence will it have on the military balance with U.S. competitors? Congress has a number of oversight, budgetary, and legislative tools available that it may use to influence the answers to these questions and shape the future development of AI technology.AI Terminology and Background/5Almost all academic studies in artificial intelligence acknowledge that no commonly accepted definition of AI exists, in part because of the diverse approaches to research in the field.Likewise, although Section 238 of the FY2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) directs the Secretary of Defense to produce a definition of artificial intelligence by August 13, 2019, no official U.S. government definition of AI yet exists./6The FY2019 NDAA does, however, provide a definition of AI for the purposes of Section 238:1. Any artificial system that performs tasks under varying and unpredictable circumstances without significant human oversight, or that can learn from experience and improve performance when exposed to data sets.2. An artificial system developed in computer software, physical hardware, or other context that solves tasks requiring human-like perception, cognition, planning, learning, communication, or physical action.3. An artificial system designed to think or act like a human, including cognitive architectures and neural networks.4. A set of techniques, including machine learning that is designed to approximate a cognitive task.5. An artificial system designed to act rationally, including an intelligent software agent or embodied robot that achieves goals using perception, planning, reasoning, learning, communicating, decision-making, and acting./7This definition encompasses many of the descriptions in Table 1 below, which summarizes various AI definitions in academic literature.The field of AI research began in the 1940s, but an explosion of interest in AI began around 2010 due to the convergence of three enabling developments: (1) the availability of "big data" sources, (2) improvements to machine learning approaches, and (3) increases in computer processing power./8This growth has advanced the state of Narrow AI, which refers to algorithms that address specific problem sets like game playing, image recognition, and navigation. All current AI systems fall into the Narrow AI category. The most prevalent approach to Narrow AI is machine learning, which involves statistical algorithms that replicate human cognitive tasks by deriving their own procedures through analysis of large training data sets. During the training process, the computer system creates its own statistical model to accomplish the specified task in situations it has not previously encountered.Experts generally agree that it will be many decades before the field advances to develop General AI, which refers to systems capable of human-level intelligence across a broad range of tasks./9Nevertheless, the rapid advancements in Narrow AI have sparked a wave of investment, with U.S. venture capitalists investing an estimated $8 billion in AI research in 2018 alone./10Similarly, DOD's unclassified investments in AI have grown from just over $600 million in FY2016 to $2.5 billion in FY2021 (including investments in autonomy), with the Department reportedly maintaining over 600 active AI projects./11AI has a number of unique characteristics that may be important to consider as these technologies enter the national security arena. First, AI has the potential to be integrated across a variety of applications, improving the so-called "Internet of Things" in which disparate devices are networked together to optimize performance./12As Kevin Kelley, the founder of Wired magazine, states, "[AI] will enliven inert objects, much as electricity did more than a century ago.Everything that we formerly electrified we will now cognitize."/13Second, many AI applications are dual-use, meaning they have both military and civil applications. For example, image recognition algorithms can be trained to recognize cats in YouTube videos as well as terrorist activity in full motion video captured by uninhabited aerial vehicles over Syria or Afghanistan./14Third, AI is a relatively transparent enabling capability, meaning that its integration into a product may not be immediately recognizable. By and large, AI procurement will not result in countable objects. Rather, the algorithm will be purchased separately and incorporated into a larger system.As an expert in the field points out, "We will not buy AI. It will be used to solve problems, and there will be an expectation that AI will be infused in most things we do."/15* * *AI ConceptsTable 1. Taxonomy of Historical AI DefinitionsFigure 1. Relationships of Selected AI DefinitionsTable can be viewed at https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R45178* * *Issues for CongressA number of Members of Congress have called for action on military AI. During the opening comments to a January 2018 hearing before the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats, the subcommittee chair called for a "national level effort" to preserve a technological edge in the field of AI./23Former Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Work argued in a November 2017 interview that the federal government needs to address AI issues at the highest levels, further stating that "this is not something the Pentagon can fix by itself."/24Other analysts have called for a national AI strategy to articulate AI objectives and drive whole-ofgovernment initiatives and cross-cutting investments./25In the meantime, DOD has published a classified AI strategy and is carrying out multiple tasks directed by DOD guidance and the FY2019 NDAA, including* establishing a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC), which now "coordinate[s] the efforts of the Department to develop, mature, and transition artificial intelligence technologies into operational use";/26* publishing a strategic roadmap for AI development and fielding, as well as guidance on "appropriate ethical, legal, and other policies for the Department governing the development and use of artificial intelligence enabled systems and technologies in operational situations";/27 and* establishing a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence to conduct a comprehensive assessment of militarily relevant AI technologies and provide recommendations for strengthening U.S. competitiveness./28These initiatives will present a number of oversight opportunities for Congress.In addition, Congress may consider the adequacy of current DOD funding levels for AI.Lieutenant General John Shanahan, the former director of the JAIC, identified funding as a barrier to future progress./29Although DOD funding for AI has increased, beginning in 2018--to include the JAIC's $1.75 billion six-year budget and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA's) $2 billion multiyear investment in over 20 AI programs--some experts have argued that additional DOD funding will be required to keep pace with U.S. competitors and avoid an "innovation deficit" in military technology./30Critics of increased federal funding contend that significant increases to appropriations may not be required, as the military should be leveraging research and development (R&D) conducted in the commercial sector. The 2017 National Security Strategy identifies a need to "establish strategic partnerships to align private sector R&D resources to priority national security applications" and to reward government agencies that "take risks and rapidly field emerging commercial technologies."/31In addition, the Office of Management and Budget directed DOD in preparing its FY2020 budget to "seek to rapidly field innovative technologies from the private sector, where possible, that are easily adaptable to Federal needs, rather than reinventing solutions in parallel."/32Some experts in the national security community also argue that it would not be a responsible use of taxpayer money to duplicate efforts devoted to AI R&D in the commercial sector when companies take products 90% of the way to a useable military application./33Others contend that a number of barriers stand in the way of transitioning AI commercial technology to DOD, and that reforming aspects of the defense acquisition process may be necessary./34These issues are discussed in more detail later in this report./35One impediment to accurately evaluating funding levels for AI is the lack of a stand-alone AI Program Element (PE) in DOD funding tables. As a result, AI R&D appropriations are spread throughout generally titled PEs and incorporated into funding for larger systems with AI components. For example, in the FY2019 National Defense Authorization Act, AI funding is spread throughout the PEs for the High Performance Computing Modernization Program and Dominant Information Sciences and Methods, among others./36On the other hand, a dedicated PE for AI may lead to a false precision, as it may be challenging to identify exact investments in enabling technologies like AI. The lack of an official U.S. government definition of AI could further complicate such an assessment.Congress may also consider specific policies for the development and use of military AI applications. Many experts fear that the pace of AI technology development is moving faster than the speed of policy implementation. Former Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee Representative Mac Thornberry has echoed this sentiment, stating, "It seems to me that we're always a lot better at developing technologies than we are the policies on how to use them./37Congress may assess the need for new policies or modifications to existing laws to account for AI developments and ensure that AI applications are free from bias./38Perhaps the most immediate policy concern among AI analysts is the absence of an independent entity to develop and enforce AI safety standards and to oversee government-wide AI research./39Former Secretary of Defense Ashton B. Carter, for example, has suggested the need for an "AI czar" to coordinate such efforts./40Relatedly, Congress may consider debating policy options on the development and fielding of Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS), which may use AI to select and engage targets.Since 2014, the United States has participated in international discussions of LAWS at the United Nations (U.N.) Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW). Approximately 30 state parties have called for a treaty banning "fully autonomous weapon systems" due to ethical considerations, while others have called for formal regulations or political declarations./41Some analysts are concerned that efforts to ban or regulate LAWS could impose strict controls on AI applications that could be adapted for lethal use, thereby stifling development of other useful military--or even commercial--technology. During recent testimony to the U.N., one expert stated, "If we agree to foreswear some technology, we could end up giving up some uses of automation that could make war more humane. On the other hand a headlong rush into a future of increasing autonomy with no discussion of where it is taking us, is not in humanity's interest either." He suggested the leading question for considering military AI applications ought to be, "What role do we want humans to play in wartime decision making?"/42Congress may consider the growth of international competition in the AI market and the danger of foreign exploitation of U.S. AI technology for military purposes. In particular, the Chinese government is reported to be aggressively pursuing AI investments in the United States. Amid growing scrutiny of transactions involving Chinese firms in the semiconductor industry, in September 2017 President Trump, following the recommendation of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), blocked a Chinese firm from acquiring Lattice Semiconductor, a U.S. company that manufactures chips that are a critical design element for AI technology./43In this way, some experts believe that CFIUS may provide a means of protecting strategically significant technologies like AI./44Indeed, the Foreign Investment Risk ReviewModernization Act of 2018 (FIRRMA) expands CFIUS's ability to review certain foreign investments, including those involving "emerging and foundational technologies." It also authorized CFIUS to consider "whether a covered transaction involves a country of special concern that has a demonstrated or declared strategic goal of acquiring a type of critical technology or critical infrastructure that would affect United States leadership in areas related to national security."/45Congress may monitor the implementation of FIRRMA and assess whether additional reforms might be necessary to maintain effective congressional oversight of sensitive transactions.In addition, many analysts believe that it may be necessary to reform federal data policies associated with AI. Large data pools serve as the training sets needed for building many AI systems, and government data may be particularly important in developing military AI applications. However, some analysts have observed that much of this data is classified, accesscontrolled, or otherwise protected on privacy grounds. These analysts contend that Congress should implement a new data policy that balances data protection and privacy with the need to fuel AI development./46Closely related, AI development may increase the imperative for strict security standards. As discussed later in this report, AI algorithms are vulnerable to bias, theft, and manipulation, particularly if the training data set is not adequately curated or protected. During a February 2018 conference with defense industry CEOs, then-Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan advocated for higher cybersecurity standards in the commercial sector, stating, "[W]e want the bar to be so high that it becomes a condition of doing business."/47Some leading commercial technology companies have issued similar calls for increased scrutiny, with Microsoft president Brad Smith arguing that a lack of regulation in this area could lead to "a commercial race to the bottom, with tech companies forced to choose between social responsibility and market success."/48Finally, commercial companies have long cited the potential loss of intellectual property rights as a key impediment to partnering with DOD. In recognition of this issue, Section 813 of the FY2016 NDAA established a "government-industry advisory panel" to provide recommendations on technical data rights and intellectual property reform./49The panel's report, released in November 2018, offers a number of recommendations, including increased training in intellectual property rights for acquisitions professionals and a pilot program for intellectual property valuation in the procurement process./50AI's Potential Impact on CombatAlthough AI has not yet entered the combat arena in a serious way, experts are predicting the potential impact that AI will have on the future of warfare. This influence will be a function of many factors, including the rate of commercial investment, the drive to compete with international rivals, the research community's ability to advance the state of AI capability, the military's general attitude toward AI applications, and the development of AI-specific warfighting concepts./226Many experts assert that there is a "sense of inevitability" with AI, arguing that it is bound to be substantially influential./227Nevertheless, in January 2016, then-Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Paul Selva, intimated that it may be too early to tell, pointing out that DOD is still evaluating AI's potential. He stated, "The question we're trying to pose now is, 'Do the technologies that are being developed in the commercial sector principally provide the kind of force multipliers that we got when we combined tactical nuclear weapons or precision and stealth?' If the answer is yes, then we can change the way that we fight.... If not, the military will seek to improve its current capabilities slightly to gain an edge over its adversaries."/228There are a range of opinions on AI's trajectory, and Congress may consider these future scenarios as it seeks to influence and conduct oversight of military AI applications.Minimal Impact on CombatWhile many analysts admit that military AI technology is in a stage of infancy, it is difficult to find an expert who believes that AI will be inconsequential in the long run./229However, AI critics point to a number of trends that may minimize the technology's impact. From a technical standpoint, there is a potential that the current safety problems with AI will be insurmountable and will make AI unsuitable for military applications./230In addition, there is a chance the perceived current inflection point in AI development will instead lead to a plateau. Some experts believe that the present family of algorithms will reach its full potential in another 10 years, and AI development will not be able to proceed without significant leaps in enabling technologies, such as chips with higher power efficiency or advances in quantum computing./231The technology has encountered similar roadblocks in the past, resulting in periods called "AI Winters," during which the progress of AI research slowed significantly.As discussed earlier, the military's willingness to fully embrace AI technology may pose another constraint. Many academic studies on technological innovation argue that military organizations are capable of innovation during wartime, but they characterize the services in peacetime as large, inflexible bureaucracies that are prone to stagnation unless there is a crisis that spurs action./232Members of the Defense Innovation Board, composed of CEOs from leading U.S. commercial companies, remarked in their most recent report, "DOD does not have an innovation problem, it has an innovation adoption problem" with a "preference for small cosmetic steps over actual change."/233Another analysis asserts that AI adoption may be halted by poor expectation management. The report asserts that overhyped AI capabilities may cause frustration that will "diminish people's trust and reduce their willingness to use the system in the future."/234This effect could have a significant chilling effect on AI adoption.Evolutionary Impact on CombatMost analysts believe that AI will at a minimum have significant impact on the conduct of warfare. One study describes AI as a "potentially disruptive technology that may create sharp discontinuities in the conduct of warfare," further asserting that the technology may "produce dramatic improvements in military effectiveness and combat potential."/235These analysts point to research projects to make existing weapon systems and processes faster and more efficient, as well as providing a means to cope with the proliferation of data that complicate intelligence assessments and decisionmaking. However, these analysts caution that in the near future AI is unlikely to advance beyond narrow, task-specific applications that require human oversight./236Some AI proponents contend that although humans will be present, their role will be less significant, and the technology will make combat "less uncertain and more controllable," as machines are not subject to the emotions that cloud human judgment./237However, critics point to the enduring necessity for human presence on the battlefield in some capacity as the principle restraining factor that will keep the technology from upending warfare. An academic study of this trend arguesAt present, even an AI of tremendous power will not be able to determine outcomes in a complex social system, the outcomes are too complex - even without allowing for free will by sentient agents.... Strategy that involves humans, no matter that they are assisted by modular AI and fight using legions of autonomous robots, will retain its inevitable human flavor./238Pointing to another constraining factor, analysts warn of the psychological impact that autonomous systems will have on an adversary, especially in conflict with cultures that place a premium on courage and physical presence. One study on this topic quotes a security expert from Qatar who stated, "How you conduct war is important. It gives you dignity or not."/239In addition, experts highlight that the balance of international AI development will affect the magnitude of AI's influence. As one analyst states, "[T]he most cherished attribute of military technology is asymmetry."/240In other words, military organizations seek to develop technological applications or warfighting concepts that confer an advantage for which their opponent possesses no immediate countermeasure. Indeed, that is the U.S. military's intent with the current wave of technological development as it seeks "an enduring competitive edge that lasts a generation or more."/241For this reason, DOD is concerned that if the United States does not increase the pace of AI development and adoption, it will end up with either a symmetrical capability or a capability that bestows only a fleeting advantage, as U.S. competitors like China and Russia accelerate their own respective military AI programs./242The democratization of AI technology will further complicate the U.S. military's pursuit of an AI advantage. As the 2018 National Defense Strategy warns, "The fact that many technological developments will come from the commercial sector means that state competitors and nonstate actors will also have access to them, a fact that risks eroding the conventional overmatch to which our Nation has grown accustomed."/243In these circumstances, AI could still influence warfighting methods, but the technology's overall impact may be limited if adversaries possess comparable capabilities.* * *Footnotes:1 This report was originally written by Daniel S.

University of Miami Business School: The Clock is Ticking on a Probable TikTok SaleTargeted News ServiceAugust 14, 2020 Friday 2:17 PM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1304 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: CORAL GABLES, Florida BodyThe University of Miami's Miami Herbert Business School issued the following news release:University of Miami business experts examine the implications--transactional, ethical, and legal--of the pending sale of the social networking site that shares short videos.Microsoft is negotiating a possible purchase of TikTok, the wildly popular, short-form video app, in an unusual scenario in which the United States government intervened--first threatening a ban of the newest darling of the social media world and then inviting the U.S.-based tech giant to buy it.The government set a deadline of Sept. 15 for the transaction to take place. Media reports indicated that TikTok plans to sue the Trump administration--as soon as this week--challenging his executive order banning the service from the U.S."This could be a good deal for Microsoft, depending on the price that they pay and what they intend to do with it," said Tarek Sayed, a University of Miami alumnus and a business technology lecturer in the Miami Herbert Business School.The names of other buyers have been circulated, but Microsoft is the leading contender for a host of reasons, not the least of which is that it appears to be the government's hand-picked favorite. Yet the sale--and its potentially colossal price tag--carries an abundance of risk."I am not convinced that just because TikTok went viral, that any company should spend $50 billion on it. Why hand them the money?" asked Sayed, who is also associate director of software architecture at the School of Law. "It will be like many other apps that are forgotten after a time. But again, Microsoft has been looking for something sexy in the consumer space. This might be a way to attract youngsters and compete with Apple, Google, and Facebook, but at $50 billion?"The announcement of a possible ban of the app in the United States prompted an uproar amid the TikTok faithful--the company claims 30 million monthly active U.S. users who spend an average 46 minutes a day on the app. Forty-two percent are ages 18 to 24, and 27 percent are ages 13 to 17.The U.S. government alleges that ByteDance shares information with the Chinese government--a allegation it has denied--and charged in early July that the company had violated its agreement to protect children's privacy. Media reports suggested that a ban of the immensely popular app could have repercussions politically.The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), an inter-agency body chaired by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, confirmed that it launched an investigation of ByteDance in November 2019 for possible violations. The agency, which includes representatives of 16 agencies--including Defense, State, and Homeland Security--reviews transactions for national security risk.Established in 1975 amid fears that wealthy Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries companies would buy U.S. firms, CFIUS has seen its powers expanded over time. Legislation spurred by the current administration, the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018, further broadened the agency's powers and those of the president to address security concerns, especially relating to Chinese firms investing in U.S. high-tech companies, as reported by the Congressional Research Service.According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a U.S.-based think tank, CFIUS reviewed 552 transactions between 2015 and 2017 and more than 25 percent were China-based--the most by far of any country.Joan Martinez-Evora, a lecturer in the Business Law Department, emphasized the ethical considerations of the unfolding scenario and drew attention to the two executive orders issued in early August that threaten to ban TikTok based on national security concerns relating to the International Emergency Powers Act and the National Emergencies Act."On one hand, arguments have been made that TikTok data collection practices are standard in the industry and that it is really a security and privacy concern for the few in the greater pool of TikTok clients, such as U.S. government officials, political dissidents, and U.S. military personnel, but not so much for ordinary U.S. citizens and youth," Martinez-Evora pointed out.Both in business and in law, Martinez-Evora has studied ethical considerations. He addressed the fact that business transactions--especially global ones of massive scale--often transcend the economic into the political arena."We have to be careful with those 'greater good analysis in international business ethics' because then we are forgetting the justice element," he cautioned."It's true that we are talking about millions of users of TikTok, and the monetary gains may be rewarding. But at what cost?" Martinez-Evora asked. He referred specifically to the Chinese government's suppression of political dissidents in China and Hong Kong, the ethnic oppression of Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities, and the spreading of disinformation.The ends do not justify the means, he noted."Some principles are just universal--humans and businesses have virtues, values, and freedoms," said Martinez-Evora. "When state-owned businesses like TikTok and Huawei [also accused by the U.S. of aiding Chinese government spying efforts] are used as means to achieve the wrong goals--to become the next global economic superpower--other businesses, the country, and the world is certainly not better off."Sayed suggested that the threatened ban appears more a tactic than a potential reality."The ban or executive order doesn't add much. It steps up the pressure on the company to finish the transaction, but there are consequential legal and constitutional issues that may arise," he said. "The more likely scenario if negotiations fail is to add the company to the Commerce Department's Entity List and prevent U.S. companies from doing business with them, including Apple and Google."The other major issue in the scenario pertains to data protection, Sayed stated."If we're going to start down the road of data privacy, we will have to look at all the social media apps then," he said "You can say that any device or app that is connected to the Internet is a national security threat. And, you can even extend that argument to some U.S. companies if they happen to share data access with employees who are foreign nationals working in an International subsidiary."By and large, data privacy has been left to the consumer--at least up until now."The U.S. doesn't have an overarching privacy framework," Sayed pointed out. "We put responsibility on the consumer instead of restricting or regulating businesses, with the exception of a few sectors--health, banking, and education. The idea is, let's not over-regulate, so we don't choke industries and innovations."He also referred to the recent hearings where the big tech companies--Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google--were grilled by members of both parties of the House antitrust subcommittee regarding their market powers."Competition practices is one of the issues that Microsoft is going to have to worry about in this acquisition," he said. "But they have stayed clear of any of those issues in recent times. They are probably the only company who could get in and make an offer on TikTok nicely and cleanly.''ByteDance spent $1 billion in November 2017 to acquire the Chinese-headquartered and U.S.-based social video app "Musical.ly." The company merged the platform with TikTok in August 2018 to create the world's largest short-video app.TikTok stands to be a big winner if the sale progresses, Sayed suggested."This is a great opportunity for TikTok," Sayed remarked. "Who gets a price like this and says no? Unless the Chinese government has other views, and we don't know that yet."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7207970 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: August 14, 2020End of Document

Google deletes 2,600 YouTube accounts linked to ChinaUPIAugust 6, 2020 Thursday 9:30 AM ESTCopyright 2020 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 224 wordsByline: CLYDE HUGHESDateline: Aug. 6 BodyGoogle has taken down about 2,600 YouTube channels it says were connected with a "coordinated influence operation" from China.Google's Threat Analysis Group said it also deleted channels connected with Russia and Iran during its sweeps but found most that violated platform rules originated in China.The company said it terminated a little fewer than 2,600 Chinese channels altogether between April and June."These channels mostly uploaded spammy, non-political content, but a subset posted political content primarily in Chinese similar to the findings in a recent [analysis], including content related to racial justice protests in the U.S.," Google said in its report Wednesday. "This campaign was consistent with similar findings reported by Twitter."Google cited a report by Graphika in April that found a pro-Chinese political spam campaign called "Spamouflage Dragon" that used new and dormant accounts to post about Hong Kong politics, critics of the Chinese government and Beijing's response to COVID-19.Google said almost 100 Russian channels were similarly terminated.Earlier this week, the Trump administration threatened to ban Chinese video-sharing app TikTok unless it's sold to U.S. tech giant Microsoft, a proposal that's drawn ire in China. President Donald Trump gave TikTok's parent company until Sept. 15 to work out a sale.Load-Date: August 6, 2020End of Document

TikTok: China accuses US of 'intimidation' over forced sale of social networkCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 4, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 597 wordsBodyChina accused the United States of"pure and simple intimidation"after Donald Trump ordered the sale before mid-September of the very popular social network TikTok,owned by the Chinese company ByteDance.TikTok will close in the United States on September 15 "unless Microsoft or someone else can buy it and come to an agreement,"the U.S. president announced referring to the app that has nearly 1 billion users worldwide, mainly teenagers.In a context of political and trade tensions with China, Washington has been accusing the platform of being used by Chinese intelligence services for surveillance purposes for months.Upon consulting on the announcement of Donald Trump,a spokesman for Chinese diplomacy, Wang Wenbin, accused the United States of regularly attacking foreign companies by abusing the notion of national security."This goes against the principles of the market economy and the principles of openness, transparency and non-discrimination of the WTO," the spokesman released the press. "It's about pure and simple intimidation. China strongly opposesit," he added.Without going until the announcement of retaliatory measures, Wang estimated that Washington was opening "Pandora's box." "Ifeveryone imitates the United States, any country can take similar action against U.S. companies in the name of national security,"he warned.While the company denies that its users' data is handed over to the Chinese government, ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming acknowledged being under pressure and noted that they work 24 hours a day "to get the best possible way out.""We are always committed to ensuring the security of user data as well as the neutrality and transparency of the platform," Zhang told employees in an internal statement, according to Chinese media.However, he said, TikTok faces "increasing complexities across the geopolitical landscape and significant external pressure."And he noted that the company must face the challenge of the U.S. and Trump security forces, though "without giving up exploring any possibility."According to The Sun, ByteDance is considering moving TikTok's global operations to the UK, now based in Los Angeles.Very popular with young people, Tiktok allows users to create and share videos up to 60 seconds, often funny but also serious and even artistic.According to the head of American diplomacy, Mike Pompeo, companies like TikTok may be getting information from citizens such as their "facial recognition pattern," "residence," "phone numbers," "friends, " and "who they contact."In announcing a deadline for the sale of the app, Trump also released a new surprise condition, noting that the operation would result in a significant payment to the U.S. Treasury.Microsoft has emerged as the savior of young TikTok users, who have praised the technology company for trying to buy a stake in the internet app in the United States, hopingto prevent Washington from shutting down the short video platform.With the "hashtags" #SaveTikTok and #Microsoft, which have generated more than 1 billion views combined, TikTok users - an effervescent group of young people who create dance, comedy and skill demonstration videos - folded into a company founded by their grandparents' generation and whose former executive president stars in the executivenow Youtube memes with old recordings of their outbursts in public.Analysts say that a look at records of recent Acquisitions from Microsoft, including the purchase of the Minecraft game in 2014 and the LinkedIn network of work contacts in 2016, could validate the optimism of TikTok users.Load-Date: August 5, 2020End of Document

What is Norinco, the Chinese regime company behind the low-quality armoured vehicles that the Argentine government wants to buyCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 17, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1136 wordsBodyNorthern Industries Corporation (Norinco) is the preferred state-controlled company of many governments around the world. Especially governments of dubious institutional quality. The firm offers facilities that no other would allow. It is flexible in its hiring and always - however it may - comes to an agreement. It was born in 1980 under the protective cloak of the State Council of China and has since remained controlled by the Ministry of Science and Technology for National Defense. Indeed, the one behind it is the omnifient Chinese Communist Party (PCC), in charge of the lobby to convince reluctant foreign wills.His business is extensive. From the oil and gas industry to the construction of transport machinery, to the most profitable: armament for military defense. Infobae revealed in recent hours that the Argentine government was about to make a monumental purchase - the amount that will be disbursed did not go a long way - of armoured personnel to the Chinese regime. These are the VN-1s that Norinco produces. He wants to acquire 200 of those tanks of dubious effectiveness."China first showed them in 2008. At first glance they are similar to the 8x8 of GDLS... a poor quality copy," says one subject matter expert who ruled out the purchase of these vehicles in his country. When he talks about GDLS, he refers to LAV-III designed and built by General Dynamics, a Canadian company born in 1952 and providing war material to the United States and European countries. "They are certainly the best, but the Chinese have other arts to convince," adds ironicly the source that prefers anonymity.Norinco site where they detail the war material they sell to developing countries. Nothing says of the allegations against him of deficiency in his armored vehicles and the alleged copies of armaments to the competition (Norinco)In addition to the reduced after-sales services and services that Chinese armoured vehicles offer their customers, the safety of their occupants is a sensitive point that is often not taken into account by those who rubric the millionaire business. In recent years, dozens of chronicles showed how the Armor of the Norinco were breached by militias, no longer by regular armies. Other similar models have shown severe deficiencies in the field.Two examples mark the lack of confidence even the Chinese have in their armored vehicles. When Kenya was about to purchase the VN-4 (other "tanks" for military use), Norinco's executive salesman refused to enter the appliance for quality testing. It was 2015. I knew why I was doing it. Delighted by the facilities offered by the regime - and by diplomatic pressure - the Nairobi government moved forward with the mega-purchase. A year later, in 2016, dozens of military personnel were reported dead in those vehicles.A Norinco 6x6 WZ551 armored vehicle destroyed in Kenya by Islamic terrorists on the border with Somalia (The Standard)The Standard, Kenya's top newspaper, blamed the authorities for the lack of sensitivity in a very harshfor continuing to buy that war material from a company that wasn't even encouraged to try its own products. It was last October, after a patrol on the border with Somalia ended in a massacre at the hands of Islamic terrorists. They were from the Al-Shabaab group, a nightmare for the country's military. "It is unfortunate that even after such deaths, our officers continue to patrol the border in chinese-made vans and armoured personnel carriers, despite the pervasive danger."An article published by Pulse Live, a Kenyan magazine, highlights a similar concern: "The 30 armored personnel carriers Kenya purchased from China in 2016 to specifically protect personnel from landmine attacks and improvised explosive devices (IEDs) are apparently useless against rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs)." Kenya is not only losing the fight against extremists, but also a lot of credibility among its people.Another image of one of Norinco's 6x6 WZ551 armored vehicles purchased by the Kenyan government and destroyed in Kenya by Islamic terrorists on the border with Somalia (The Standard)A 6x6 WZ551 armored vehicle manufactured by that Xi Jinping-dependent company was completely destroyed and unusable after suffering a mine explosion. It is similar to the 8x8 that dazzle the Argentine kirchnerist government. Behind the attack, again Al-Shabaab. All its occupants were killed.A Norinco armored vehicle destroyed in Kenya by Islamic militias (The Standard)For added mistrust, Norinco never sells its best products abroad. Only the "disposable or the second category", explains the same European analyst. That is, the Chinese People's Liberation Army ensures that the other armed forces not only depend on a state-owned company under the regime, but also know that they will never have their best technological version. He was recognized in dialogue with Infobae by Argentine Defense Minister Agustín Rossi, who nevertheless claims that the models they will buy - "at least 200" - are "very good"."I think the big problem with all Chinese weapons, including copies of Western teams, is that they remain unproven in combat," said Eric Wertheim, naval analyst and author of the book World Combat Fleets at the U.S. Naval Institute. "While they may be much less expensive than their Western counterparts, it is understandable that many countries are reluctant to risk purchasing products that have not passed the ultimate combat test," he added in an article published in USNI.A study published by the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies and signed by Ian Storey, its editor-in-chief explains that "Chinese defense teams have long suffered a bad reputation for their quality and after-sales service." The institution is based in Singapore and is engaged in academic research on strategic issues in the region."In a word: reliability." This is summarized by journalist Kevin Knodell for War Is Boring, a publication specializing in war affairs, when he raises why fewcountries that are inclined to buy war material from China. "The global perception of the Chinese defense industry is below what is acceptable. Some of the perceptions are due to faulty systems or defective weapon designs. In addition, China lacks additional services, such as training and maintenance of equipment and weapons. Some countries also lack political confidence in China," he says based on research papers.But they also have another significant obstacle: their firing ports are not safe for their occupants, they do not allow to identify all targets and are even susceptible to technical deficiencies and bring danger to the occupants due to lack of oxygen and generation of toxic gases.MORE ON THIS TOPIC:Nerist government deepens relationship with Chinese regime: it would buy armoured vehicles discarded by its own armyLoad-Date: August 18, 2020End of Document

TRUMP ORDERS BANS ON 2 CHINESE APPS, CITING SECURITY CONCERNSStates News ServiceAugust 7, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 217 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the Voice of America (VOA):By VOA NewsUpdated August 07, 2020 02:26 AMU.S. President Donald Trump Thursday ordered sweeping bans on two Chinese consumer apps.He ordered the bans prohibiting U.S. companies from doing business with ByteDance, the owner of the video-sharing app TikTok, and Tencent, the owner of the messenger app WeChat. The executive orders targeting the Chinese companies go into effect in 45 days.Whether Trump has the legal authority for such actions is not immediately clear, analysts said.The move comes amid data collection and privacy concerns the Trump administration and U.S. lawmakers have expressed about the apps. However, no evidence has been cited to support the claims.Both companies have said they do not share their data with the Chinese government."I am the first to yell from the rooftops when there is a glaring privacy issue somewhere," mobile security expert Will Strafach told The Associated Press last month. "But we just have not found anything we could call a smoking gun in TikTok."Analysts said they expect China to retaliate.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday that the U.S. would not allow U.S. stores to sell Chinese apps because of security concerns.Millions of people around the world use the two apps.Load-Date: August 7, 2020End of Document

Trump bans doing business with TikTok and WeChat ownersCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 7, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 770 wordsBodyDonald Trump on Thursday ordered a broad but unspecified ban on efforts with Chinese owners of the TikTok and WeChat mobile apps, although it was unclear whether the U.S. president has legal authority to veto apps in the country.The two decrees _uno for each aplicación_ will come into force in 45 days. The documents allege that they are necessary because Chinese-owned platforms ''threaten U.S. national security, foreign policy, and economy', and ask the Secretary of Commerce to define prohibited transactions by that date.Although the drafting of the decrees is vague and seems hasty, some experts point out that they seem to be seeking to ban popular platforms from being in Apple and Google stores, which could de facto stop their distribution in the United States."This is an unprecedented use of presidential authority," Paul Triolo, an analyst at Eurasia Group, said in an email. At the very least, he added, the orders appear to "constitute a ban on the ability of Apple and Google's U.S. app stores to include either mobile app after 45 days.'According to Triolo, the orders could face legal remedies and warned that Beijing is likely to "react harshly, at least rhetorically.'Presidential decrees cite legal authority conferred by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the National Emergency Law.The move is the Trump administration's latest attempt to curb China, a rising economic superpower.In recent years, Washington has waged a trade war with Beijing, blocked mergers involving Chinese companies, and limited the businesses of firms such as Huawei, a manufacturer of cell phones and telecommunications equipment. On the other hand, Chinese-linked hackers were blamed for thefts in U.S. federal databases and credit agency Equifax. The Chinese government imposes strict limits on what U.S. firms can do in the country.U.S. policy this election year seems to be stoking those flames, while Trump appears to be using friction with Beijing to get voter backing.Lawmakers both Republicans and Democrats share concerns about TikTok ranging from their vulnerability to censorship and disinformation campaigns, to the security of user data, and to the privacy of minors. But the government did not provide specific evidence that TikTok made DATA available to Beijing. Instead, officials pointed to the hypothetical threat posed by the Chinese government's ability to demand the cooperation of the country's companies.Earlier this week, Trump threatened to "close' TikTok unless Microsoft or another company bought it before September 15, a warning that the new executive order seems to formalize. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday that he would expand the anti-technology whip to ban Chinese apps from being in U.S. virtual stores, citing alleged security threats and referring to TikTok and WeChat by name.TikTok did not respond to the inquiries. Tencent, owner of WeChat, and Microsoft declined to comment on the situation."The United States thinks that anything that is Chinese is suspicious,'" said Andy Mok, researcher at the Center for China and beijing's Globalization. They are being attacked not by what they have done, but by who they are."What the experts sayProminent mobile security experts say that TikTok is no more intrusive in collecting data from its users and monitoring their usersactivity that U.S. apps owned by Facebook and Google.TikTok, known for its short and catchy videos, is an extremely popular app among young people in the United States and other countries. It is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, which operates a separate version for the Chinese market. TikTok insists that it does not store information from US users in China, but does so in the United States and Singapore, and notes that it would not share it with Beijing.WeChat and its sister Weixin app are very popular apps in China that include messaging, cash transfers and a number of services, and claims to have more than 1 billion users. Around the world, many expats use it to stay in touch with friends and family in their country and to do business in mainland China. They are owned by Tencent, a Chinese digital conglomerate.Within China, WeChat is censored and is expected to adhere to content restrictions set by the authorities. Toronto-based Internet monitoring group Citizen Lab said WeChat monitors files and images shared abroad to help its censorship in China.TECHNOLOGY Newsletter with the most important analysis and news, every Wednesday.

UYGHUR MODEL 'DISAPPEARS' AFTER RISKING PUNISHMENT WITH VIDEO OF HIS DETENTIONStates News ServiceAugust 6, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1405 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:A young Uyghur man who risked severe punishment to take a video of himself in detention in China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) and his aunt, who sent the video out of the country, have both "disappeared," according to the man's uncle.On Tuesday, the BBC published a nearly five-minute video showing Merdan Ghappar, a 31-year-old Uyghur model for Chinese online retailer Taobao, shackled to a bed in filthy living conditions while political slogans are played over a loudspeaker outside his barred window.The video, and several text messages Merdan sent, appears to show some of the best evidence yet of China's continuing policy of mass incarceration of Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in a vast network of internment camps in the XUAR. This contradicts a government narrative that all detainees have "graduated" from the facilities that officials refer to as "vocational schools." Up to 1.8 million people are believed to have been held in the camps since April 2017.Merdan was initially held in a police jail with dozens of other detainees after being made to return from where he lived in Guangdong province's Foshan city to his ancestral home in Kuchar (in Chinese, Kuche) city, in the XUAR's Aksu (Akesu) prefecture, to "register" with authorities in January.But 18 days after his detention, amid reports of an outbreak of the coronavirus in the region and with Merdan exhibiting signs of illness, he was moved to an individual cell, where restrictions were slightly looser and he was able to gain access to his phone amongst other personal items, which he used to take the video.He sent the video to his aunt, Ayshemgul Ghappar, who then forwarded it to his Netherlands-based uncle, Abdulhakim Ghappar, in early March. Abdulhakim said he and Merdan exchanged text messages relayed by Ayshemgul over the course of several days, discussing his situation in detention before all communication suddenly ceased with his nephew and sister."We exchanged messages for a week ... [and for the last time] around March 9 or 10, I can't remember exactly," he said."He sent me a message and then he and my sister were just gone. I've heard nothing from my sister since."Abdulhakim said that while it was unclear what happened to the pair, guards at the facility where Merdan was being held "undoubtedly took his phone away.""It seems clear that he got in even worse trouble after sending the videoI think this is why he disappeared," he said.Attempts to contact Chinese government officials to confirm the whereabouts of Merdan and Ayshemgul, as well as the reason Merdan was placed in detention, have gone unanswered.Taobao, the online retailer that had hired Merdan as a model, no longer has any record of him on its website, while any mention of him has been scrubbed from Baidu, China's most popular search engine.Abdulhakim told RFA he initially posted Merdan's video on Facebook in March but removed it as the BBC proceeded with an investigation of his nephew's case.The British broadcaster published it Tuesday along with texts Merdan sent detailing his experience in the police jail, which he said included being hooded and shackled on both his hands and feet, held in a 50-square-meter cell with 50-60 others, and regularly hearing screams coming from a nearby interrogation room.In the video, taken after he was moved to solitary confinement, Merdan records himself shackled by his left wrist to a bedthe only furniture in the roomwhile a prerecorded message in Mandarin Chinese and Uyghur denouncing "separatism" blares from a loudspeaker outside of his window. He appears to be wearing dirty clothes and seems noticeably anxious.Merdan also sent a photo of a communique he said he found on the floor of one of the facility's bathrooms, calling on Uyghur children as young as 13 to "repent and surrender" to authorities for acts of "religious extremism."Since their last communication in March, Abdulhakim said a Han Chinese friend of his nephew's traveled to Kuchar to find him, but authorities "went to great lengths to stop her ... after they knew she'd come for Merdan."He said the young woman was able to enter a police station where Merdan is believed to be held but was treated rudely and told by officers that they had no responsibility to inform her about his case."They didn't dispute that he was being held there, they only said that they wouldn't tell her anything," Abdulhakim said.Beijing describes its three-year-old network of camps as voluntary "vocational centers," but reporting by RFA and other media outlets shows that detainees are mostly held against their will in poor conditions, where they are forced to endure inhumane treatment and political indoctrination.Evidence of Merdan's detention and other reporting by RFA challenges claims made in early December by Shohrat Zakir, Xinjiang's Uyghur governor, that people at the centers had all "graduated" and are living happy lives. Zakir made the statement a week after U.S. Congress approved the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act, which allows for sanctions against Chinese officials deemed responsible for abuses in the XUAR and has since been signed into law.Last week, the Trump administration sanctioned the quasi-military Xinjiang Production and Construction Corp (XPCC) and two of its current and former officials over rights violations in the XUAR.The move followed similar sanctions in July against several top Chinese officials, including regional party secretary Chen Quanguo, marking the first time Washington targeted a member of China's powerful Politburo.Merdan's case also shows that even Uyghurs who live their lives according to the Chinese government's expectations of their ethnic group are not immune to persecution by authorities.Merdan graduated from the dance program at the Xinjiang Arts Institute in Urumqi in 2007 and was invited to work for a company in Beijing before being "discovered" by an online clothing retailer, which hired him to be a model and relocated him to Guangdong's Guangzhou city. He later began modeling for other companies as well, including Taobao, and was earning up to 10,000 yuan (U.S. $1,440) per day, according to his uncle.However, Merdan soon found that even with his high-profile career and newfound wealth, he was still often treated as a second-class citizen by majority Han Chinese, who regularly discriminate against Uyghurs.Merdan's employers told him not to identify himself by his ethnic group and instead claim he had European ancestry so that nobody would question him, which he agreed to do."He had to make a living, after all, and it's certainly hard to carve out a space for yourself among the nearly 1.5 billion people in China, so he went along with it," Abdulhakim.Merdan kept his head down and worked hard, his uncle said, noting that "he's not really interested in religionhe's not very interested in politics, either."At some point, he bought a large apartment for around 800,000 yuan (U.S. $115,000), although he was forced to register it in the name of a Han Chinese friend because he was told that, as a Uyghur, he couldn't do so in his own name, Abdulhakim said.But despite his success, Merdan was arrested in August 2018 and sentenced to 16 months in prison for selling marijuana, a charge which his friends have denied.It's unclear whether Merdan was guilty of the charges against him, but reports suggest that Uyghurs are more likely to face conviction in China's judicial system than Han Chinese, and those who have served prison sentences are also seemingly at higher risk of later detention in the camp system.Upon his release from prison in November, Merdan tried to resume work, but two months later "some Uyghur police officers [from Xinjiang] showed up along with local police" who "said they were taking him back" to the region, where he was detained on his return."Ultimately, I see the fact that he's Uyghur as the primary reason for his detention," Abdulhakim told RFA."When he went to Guangzhou, his agent told him not to openly advertise that he was Uyghur in his business dealings," he added."People in China think like this: if you're Uyghur or from Xinjiang, it doesn't matter how talented you are, you can't be successful. So those were the grounds for his modeling career."Reported by Nur Iman for RFA's Uyghur Service. Translated by Elise Anderson.

IF TIKTOK AND WECHAT BANS GO INTO EFFECT, WILL IT BE A CRIME TO USE THE APPS IN THE UNITED STATES?States News ServiceAugust 24, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1347 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: BOSTON, MA BodyThe following information was released by Boston University:BU cybersecurity experts discuss uncertainties about how the bans will affect communication and be enforced by the Trump administrationAugust 24, 2020Jessica ColarossiIt might seem like they are just online spaces to share buzzworthy content and viral dance moves, but TikTok and WeChattwo apps owned by Chinese companieshave been the subject of recent sanctions threatened by the Trump administration. The reason? Trump says the apps pose national security concernshis ensuing executive orders to bar the apps from being used in the United States raise some of the most pressing questions in modern-day tech policy."Can the president ban TikTok or WeChat? The answer to that is yes," says Ahmed Ghappour, a Boston University School of Law associate professor and a law and computer security expert.Through the authority granted under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA)a federal act that allows the president to impose sanctions against foreign entities for a wide range of circumstances that could encroach on national securityGhappour says the power to explore whether or not a business entity is a threat to the nation sits within the purview of the US president.Trump has signed two executive orders announcing that his administration will bar people and property within the United States from carrying out transactions with the WeChat and TikTok apps by September 20, an act that escalates an ongoing trade war that Trump has waged against China. Trump's executive orders say that the apps capture "vast swaths of information from [their] users" and that this data "threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans' personal and proprietary information."In the week following the announcement, Trump extended the deadline for ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, to sell or spin off TikTok to a company based in the United States. Some American companies seem interestedMicrosoft and Oracle are both in talks with ByteDance over a possible purchase of TikTok. Meanwhile, WeChat, owned by Chinese company Tencent, is expected to go offline in the United States by the original deadline.TikTok denies sharing information with the Chinese government and plans to sue the Trump administration to challenge the executive order in court. The US government has "failed to follow due process and act in good faith, neither providing evidence that TikTok was an actual threat, nor justification for its punitive actions," the company said in a blog post.But the Trump administration believes that the app's terms of servicestating it can share data with its parent company ByteDancecould allow for personal data, such as location data or search histories, to be handed over from ByteDance to the Chinese government, a possibility that has put White House officials on edge."Privacy policies impose the upper limits, saying that a company will use data in no more than X ways, and they're bound by law to adhere to their upper limits," says Mayank Varia, a BU College of Arts and Sciences research associate professor of computer science and an expert on cybersecurity and encryption tools. But because policies are written so vaguely, he says, "it is hard to understand what they are actually doing" with users' data.The ban poses unique challenges for Chinese Americans and Chinese expatriates who rely on WeChat to connect to relatives, friends, or business partners in China, since many common social media and messaging apps in the United States, like Google services, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and Twitter, are blocked by the Chinese government. Many people use WeChat for far more than a communication hub, making payments, hailing taxi rides, and even reading the news on the appincluding BU news. BU is one of the many US institutions active on WeChat, making University news accessible to current BU students who use the app and to student families and prospective students in China.So what would a violation of a ban on TikTok or WeChat look like? And what would enforcement of that violation look like for individuals and companies?"We don't know how it's going to be enforced," says Ghappour. "But if the prohibition is as wide in scope as the president is authorized...it would effectively end Apple's and Google's dealings with these apps through their app stores, and result in the United States blocking these apps through IP filtering," or other means of wiping them off the app stores."That doesn't necessarily prohibit people from installing WeChat or TikTok on their devices or computers, and wouldn't necessarily prohibit users from accessing them through a VPN or anonymous network," he says, but those actions could put people in a potentially incriminating position.The president's orders remain befuddling, having not yet cleared the air on what specific transactions will be prohibited or if people could face criminal charges for disobeying the executive orders.The American Civil Liberties Union has argued that speech concerns render Trump's order unconstitutional, stating that subjecting users to civil or possibly criminal penalties for communicating with family members, friends, or business contacts would violate First Amendment rights."The idea of going after high-profile TikTok creators and preventing them from posting 15-second videos seems in direct contradiction to our traditions of free speech and historic approach to an open internet," says Ghappour, adding that it would also put thousands of US employees in a legally precarious position, including building owners who lease out office space to the company in the United States, and individuals who use the app itself.What can tech companies do to better protect personal data? In general, when you download any app on your phone, you are providing a certain level of information in order for the company to provide the service and do its job. Anything beyond what is needed for the service being donefor example, opening and sending emails or texting a friendis not data a company wants nor has any need for, Varia explains. He was recently chosen by the office of Senator Ed Markey (Hon.'04) (D-Mass.) to serve on the inaugural federal Advisory Committee on Data for Evidence Building, to guide the use of data in federal policymaking and how to satisfy the government's desire for transparency and data privacy, at the same time."There's this prevailing view that in order for a company to provide you with services, they have to be able to see the data," says Varia. "The nice things about more advanced crypto technologies like multiparty computation is that they create a possibility for [there to be] a world in which a technology company can provide [you with] a service and the ability to search through your own emails and data, but without being able to read [your personal information and communications] themselves."Some tech companies have already employed data privacy measures. Messages sent between users on Facebook's WhatsApp platform are encrypted, protecting them from third-party access. And new data privacy methods continue to emerge, like multiparty computation (MPC), which allows companies to collect personal data without the need to view the data itself, presenting a broad solution for protecting data from being misused or shared."If data is not limited at the front end...it's hard to limit what happens after the fact, like what people might be worried about right now with these executive orders; how might data or metadata be used? Might it be used in a damaging way? I think those are questions that apply to all tech companies no matter where they are," Varia says. "It becomes the question, for any company, to what extent are they good data stewards, and to what extent are they doing things that are in [the user's] interest?"Although questions about security remain on the table about both TikTok and WeChat, an all-out ban on the apps could potentially sever ties of communication between people in China, the United States, and around the world.Load-Date: August 26, 2020End of Document

TikTok and WeChat may raise security concerns, but Trump's knee-jerk reaction isn't the way to deal with themCNN WireAugust 16, 2020 Sunday 00:18Invalid date found for VDI: 1597213706 XCEDOCID: 0 LNI: 60KV-GX01-JBSS-S03V-00000-00. Date output 'as-is'.GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1211 wordsDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  For years, the Great Firewall of China has blocked some of the largest online services coming out of the United States, including Google, Facebook and Twitter. This month, Washington indicated that it might be willing to build a wall of its own by threatening a ban on two of the most popular Chinese-owned apps in the world: TikTok and WeChat.US President Donald Trump has given the apps 45 days to find American buyers, according to a pair of executive orders he issued last week. Trump claimed the apps pose risks to national security, citing concerns about data privacy and censorship.ByteDance's TikTok has already been courted by Microsoft, which would make it possible for the app to avert a total ban --- albeit at the cost of its Chinese ownership. Tencent's WeChat, though, is far less popular in the US than it is at home, and its use stateside could be significantly curtailed. Because Trump's order is vague, some analysts also suspect a ban could have potentially severe knock-on effects for American people and businesses who use the app in China.Trump's moves risk further fracturing the global internet, upending families and online communities, and disrupting the flow of tech investment and innovation in both countries, without necessarily putting in place a set of policies to ensure popular apps --- be they from China or the US --- guarantee the privacy and security of their users."The solution can't be to undermine the free flow of information that underpins the internet," said Susan Ariel Aaronson, an expert on internet governance at George Washington University. "What worries me is that the US is becoming China by trying to block off apps."The two apps targeted by Trump also pose unique challenges, further muddying the issue. Tencent has long faced accusations of censorship and surveillance, making WeChat a poster child for the privacy and free speech concerns often expressed about some Chinese apps. But cutting it off entirely from the US would come with its own costs for American and Chinese users. With TikTok, the privacy issues are murkier, given the app does not appear to behave that differently from its US competitors. Its treatment also raises questions about whether Washington could ever trust a Chinese app of its scale. But the Trump administration appears to be taking a one-size-fits-all approach to Chinese-owned apps, in a way that risks not only conflating the issues with each, but potentially undermining the administration's own case for the crackdowns in the first place.What we do (and don't) know about WeChat and TikTokWeChat and TikTok are both social media applications with millions of users around the world and owned by Chinese parent companies. But they have different histories and concerns.TikTok is an app used by teenagers for sharing silly videos, so its inclusion in any conversation about national security may seem bizarre to some observers.There is "no information captured from TikTok that would be useful to Chinese intelligence," said James Lewis, an expert on technology policy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.But Trump has accused the app of capturing "vast swaths of information from its users," such as location data and browsing and search histories, which "threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans' personal and proprietary information --- potentially allowing China to track the locations of Federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage."TikTok has denied that it would share data with Beijing, and says US user data isn't stored in China. The app has also broadly pushed back at other allegations, including recent claims published by the Wall Street Journal that it bypassed protections on Android to scrape user data.On paper, at least, TikTok does not collect significantly more data than rivals such as Facebook and Google, which gather such information for targeting advertising. In fact, it may collect less, given that users are uploading less personal information to the app than they do on other social media platforms.The extent to which WeChat collects information, meanwhile, has long raised security concerns --- as has Tencent's close relationship to the Chinese Communist Party. For example, cybersecurity experts in the Tibetan exile community in Dharamsala have pointed to the prevalence of WeChat as a potential reason for a drop in hacking attacks on members in recent years. "Because WeChat is so embedded in the community in some ways, I don't think they need to hack systems as much as they used to because that information is already being given to them," Lobsang Gyatso Sither, a Tibetan cybersecurity expert, has previously said.WeChat's owner Tencent has consistently denied spying on users. But in the past, Chinese prosecutors have also cited evidence retrieved from the app, including supposedly deleted messages, in cases against Muslims, dissidents and even Communist Party members. Chinese cybersecurity laws give the government broad powers to request data from companies like Tencent, which may also face political pressure to hand over information in sensitive cases."Any type of message or content shared on WeChat is very likely under heavy surveillance [by] the Chinese government," said Samm Sacks, a China and cybersecurity expert at New America, a Washington DC-based think tank.Overdue regulation China has been firing back at Washington for targeting the apps.In a series of tweets Wednesday, Hua Chunying, a top diplomat with China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, accused the US of creating a "splinternet" and of using "gangster logic" in trying to force TikTok to sell. She highlighted Washington's own less-than-stellar record on government surveillance. And while Beijing's stance comes across as somewhat ironic, given its own relationship with many Western firms, Hua isn't alone in such criticisms. Last month, for example, the European Court of Justice ruled against a data-sharing plan between the US and the European Union over concerns that data shared by Europeans might not be adequately protected from US surveillance.Accusations of hypocrisy do not mean Washington should be blind to the potential threats posed by Chinese apps -- or any apps -- when it comes to data security and free speech, but both could be protected without necessarily banning or blocking foreign services."The question is, how do we make the app system more secure overall?" said Sacks. "We need to spend more time on legislation and standards where you have a trusted set of criteria for all platforms. So whether you're TikTok or some random weather app, in order to operate you have to be audited, approved under these more strict cybersecurity practices."A similar approach could be taken on the issue of censorship, with standards set for how apps should be expected to protect their users' free speech and avoid exposing them to misinformation."It's time for the US to get its own vision for internet governance," Sacks said. "How do you govern massive amounts of data that's collected on these platforms?" TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Vietnam accuses China of 'infringing its sovereignty' in disputed watersCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 20, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 334 wordsBodyHo Chi Minh City ( Vietnam), 20 Aug (EFE).- Vietnam on Thursday accused China of "infringing its sovereignty" and endangering peace in the South China Sea by deploying an aircraft carrier and fighter jets in a Vietnamese archipelago that is contesting the Asian giant."Sending troops to the Hoang Sa (or Paracel) archipelago not only violates Vietnam's sovereignty, but also complicates the situation in the East Sea. We urge all parties to contribute responsibly to the maintenance of peace, stability and security in the South China Sea," Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang said at a press conference.The spokesoquarer, who emphasized that the Paracel and Spratly archipelago, also contested by China, "are an inseparable part of Vietnam," referred to the military maneuvers that neighboring China carried out on 1 August for several days on those islands with fighter jets, according to the Vietnamese portal Thanh Nien.China's territorial ambitions in the waters south of its territory - through which 30% of global trade flows and is home to 12% of the world's fishing grounds, as well as oil and gas fields - affect not only Vietnam, but also the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan.In recent months, Chinese Navy ships have made raids on territorial waters in Vietnam and the Philippines, which has helped to strain China's relations with these countries and the United States.The Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague conferred on the Philippines in 2016 the ownership of Scarborough Atoll and part of the Spratly Archipelago, disputed by China, which refuses to acknowledge the ruling.Vietnam and China share a land border of about 1,300 kilometers and their relations are historically fraught with tensions.Both countries waged a brief war in early 1979, when the Asian giant launched an invasion in the north of its southern neighbor in retaliation to the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia the previous year that ended the Khmer Rouge regime, allies of the Chinese government.Load-Date: August 21, 2020End of Document

Rep. Walorski Calls for Hearing on China's Efforts to Hack Coronavirus Vaccine ResearchersTargeted News ServiceAugust 1, 2020 Saturday 7:31 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 422 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyRep. Jackie Walorski, R-Indiana, issued the following news release:U.S. Rep. Jackie Walorski (R-Ind.) called for the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis to hold a hearing on China's efforts to hack companies researching and developing a coronavirus vaccine. The U.S. Department of Justice last week announced the indictment of two hackers working with the Chinese government to target intellectual property and confidential business information, including COVID-19 research."Just last week, the Justice Department indicted two Chinese nationals for hacking companies that are working on a vaccine," Congresswoman Walorski said. "We sent a strong message to China: this will not be tolerated. I'm glad the administration took action by naming and shaming those involved, as well as closing down a Chinese consulate that was a hub for intellectual property and trade secret theft. We must hold China accountable, Mr. Chairman. Before I close, can you commit to holding a hearing on the threat of Chinese espionage on vaccine producers?"In today's subcommittee hearing, Walorski also applauded the Trump administration's Operation Warp Speed, an initiative to accelerate the development of a safe, effective, affordable, and widely available vaccine. In response to questions from Congresswoman Walorski, Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, assured the American people the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will not compromise or eliminate any safety standards in the vaccine approval process."I believe ultimately over a period of time in 2021, if we have - and I think we will have - a safe and effective vaccine, that Americans will be able to get it," Dr. Fauci said. "The commissioner of the FDA, Dr. Stephen Hahn, has assured me and has spoken publicly that he would make sure any decision on the part of the FDA will be based on sound scientific data proving the safety and the efficacy. Given that, I think the American public should be assured that in the process of determining the safety and efficacy the proper steps have been taken to determine that, and when a vaccine becomes available it's important for their own health and for the health of the country to take that vaccine."Video of Congresswoman Walorski's remarks at the hearing can be found here https://youtu.be/ncF3veDFZp8.Walorski represents the 2nd Congressional District of Indiana, serving as a member of the House Ways and Means Committee.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7196295 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: August 1, 2020End of Document

China tells US not to "open pandora's box, or it will suffer the consequences"CE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 4, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 501 wordsBodyPEKON.- China today called the US campaign against the TikTok short video application of the Chinese company ByteDance "pure manipulation" and warned Washington not to open the "Pandora's box" or else "it will suffer the consequences."Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Wenbin said at his daily press conference that it is "common for the US to use its state power to violently attack companies in other countries."In his view, "if this Washington error is reproduced, any country may take similar measures against any U.S. company based on national security.""The United States must not open Pandora's box; otherwise they will suffer the consequences," he warned.U.S. President Donald Trump gave ByteDance deadline Monday through September 15 for TikTok to move into the hands of U.S. capital or face its ban on operating in the country for national security reasons.In addition, it stated that the Treasury Department should "receive a lot of money" from the sale operation, without specifying on what concept or how it would be carried out."I don't care if it's Microsoft or another large company, a secure company, a very American company has to buy it," the representative said.TikTok, which in the US has more than 80 million users, is one of the most growing social networks in recent years in the country, where it has become the main entertainment for many teenagers and a marketing channel for major celebrities.The Trump Administration, as well as leading Democratic congressmen, claim that the widespread use of TikTok jeopardizes the privacy of American data and national security, as they argue that the application is exposed, through ByteDance, to instructions and intervention by the Chinese government.ByteDance founder and CEO Zhang Yiming lettered his employees' disagreement with Washington's imposition to sell its U.S. subsidiary and assured that "they are always committed to protecting user data and maintaining TikTok's neutrality and transparency."The Foreign Spokesman said today that companies conduct business in the US in accordance with market principles and international rules, complying with U.S. laws, and called the Trump administration's actions "political manipulation.""Removing non-U.S. companies under the pretext of national security without any evidence violates the principles of the market economy and those of openness, transparency and non-discrimination of the World Trade Organization (WTO)," he said.Wang urged Washington to "listen carefully to the voices of its own country and the international community, to renounce politicizing economic affairs, and to provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory investment framework for all market players in the US."TikTok's case is the latest episode of the China-US conflict, which has gone from commercial to technological, and could be further found after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's announcement that Trump will act "soon" against Chinese software companies that he considers a risk to national security.Load-Date: August 5, 2020End of Document

Thank you.Microsoft looking to buy Tiktok's U.S. business after President Trump threatened to ban the popular Chinese app over security concerns.Susan Li has very latest. Good morning, Susan.SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Dagen.That is right. So 45 days -- 45 days for Tiktok and Microsoft to negotiate a deal according to reports. And this is after a weekend of negotiations involving the White House and the two companies. But President Trump said that he is considering an executive order to ban the popular music app.So Microsoft taking the unusual stop here to comment on takeover talks, saying that following a conversation between Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and President Trump, Microsoft is prepared to continue discussions to explore a purchase of Tiktok in the U.S. adding that they were aiming for September 15 in order to finalize the deal.Now that's a better outcome for Tiktok and its millions of users in the U.S. than say other executive action that the President could have taken and that included a break up of the original deal that created Tiktok in the first place, or putting Tiktok on the trade blacklist meaning that no U.S. company including Microsoft could actually buy it. One man with oversight of this process is Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STEVE MNUCHIN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY: I said publicly that it is under review. I will say publicly, that the entire committee agrees that Tiktok cannot stay in the current format because it sending back information on a hundred million Americans. The President can either force a sale or the President can block the app.(END VIDEO CLIP)LI: So Tiktok is one of the most popular apps on the planet. A 100 million users in the U.S., more than 800 million active users worldwide and downloaded over 2.2 billion times. And there's bipartisan concerns of both Democrats and Republicans asking for national security reviewers.ByteDance issuing a statement in China overnight, suggesting that its sale to Microsoft might be just one of the options among others that they could take.Now, if you are wondering why Microsoft in this case since Tiktok would probably be a better fit for say Facebook or Google instead. Well, Microsoft isn't really a focus for antitrust in D.C.Also Microsoft has a long history with Tiktok's owner ByteDance. The billionaire who started ByteDance used to work at Microsoft in China before starting his own company. Now, the price tag here will be interesting because Tiktok was last valued, Dagen, at $50 billion. But if you take a look at Microsoft and how it's trading today up over 2 percent and rallying in the premarket, people think that they might get a fire-sale price here and that would be beneficial to get around $2.2 billion users for say $5 billion.MCDOWELL: They're not getting any profits, about a billion in revenue per year, not profitable according to reports.LI: It's users' eyeball --MCDOWELL: Yes, exactly. Been there, done that, seen that.Thank you so much Susan. Great to see you always.On "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES" Maria spoke with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about banning Tiktok as well as potentially other Chinese apps. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:: What happened with Tiktok, Secretary?MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Well here is what I hope that the American people will come to recognize. These Chinese stocks companies doing business in the United States, whether it's Tiktok or WeChat, other countless more. As Peter Navarro said, are feeding data directly to the Chinese Communist Party., their national security apparatus could be there. The facial recognition pattern, there could be information about the residents, their phone numbers, their friends, who they are connected to. Those are the issues that President Trump's made clear, we are going to take care of.So he will take action in the coming days with respect to a broad array of national security risks that are presented by software connected to the Chinese Communist Party.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Joining us now, Tennessee senator Senate Armed Services, Judiciary and Veterans Affairs Committee member, Marsha Blackburn.Senator, always a pleasure to see you.SEN. MARSHA BLACKBURN (R-TN): Good to see you.MCDOWELL: Do you have -- Senator, do you have a sense of how many more apps might be targeted by the Trump administration or their security risks here in the United States?BLACKBURN: Yes. There is a security risk with these apps. I don't know the number that will end up being reviewed, but bear in mind, many of these apps -- whether it is FaceApp or TikTok or WeChat -- when you are doing business in China, there is ownership by the Chinese government, which is the Chinese Communist Party. And what are they doing? They are building a repository of images.And Dagen, through the years, you and I have talked about who owns the virtual you, which is you and your presence online. And we know that China, through the Digital Silk Road, through the Belt and Road Initiative, through all of these social media software applications, they are collecting images, they're collecting faces, they're collecting data, they're collecting relationships, because China is determined to be the winner of the 21st century.They are focused on domination of the global economy, of the global political systems. And they have a president that is just -- he has hit the accelerator, and he is determined that he is going to diminish his competitors.And so, I think that they are going to very actively try to partner with American business because that puts American business right in participation with the Chinese Communist Party, and it puts money in their pocket, and basically gas in their tank for pushing forward their agenda of global domination.MCDOWELL: Why didn't the Trump administration get tough on these issues of national security sooner, rather than facing on that phase one trade deal? Why wasn't this number one, rather than maybe or two or three or -- down the list?BLACKBURN: Right. I give President Trump a lot of credit for, in his campaign in 2016 saying, China is a problem, and we are going to deal with them. And that he did.But Dagen, look at how we have walked into this, what President Trump very successfully did was to say, we are not doing to do the TPP. We're not going to do massive trade deals. We are going to negotiate these one at a time. And he pulled China out separately. Now one of the things that has happened after COVID-19, is our global allies have been standing with us. We had a very successful trade agreement with Japan that was negotiated before Ambassador Hagerty left Japan.Now we have had Great Britain. And Boris Johnson has looked at China and said, hey, forget about it, we are not going to take Huawei.Huawei we know has spyware embedded in their hardware. That is a win for us.MCDOWELL: Right.BLACKBURN: So part of it is getting people to change this relationship with how they do trade deals and how they participate with China.MCDOWELL: Right.BLACKBURN: And another component of this is, we have to shut down these Confucius institutes and Confucius classrooms that are part of Chinese propaganda.And we also have to deal with organizations like the World Health Organization, the U.N. that soft pedal when it comes to China and do not hold them to account for human rights abuses.MCDOWELL: Just quickly before we move on. On the issue of the TPP, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, many people argue that the U.S. should have stayed in it, because it actually -- we locked arms with the rest of Asia against China. That it strengthened our negotiating position, instead of pulling out and weakening it. That is the other side of that.I want to get to stimulus. There's gridlock in D.C. Lawmakers are no closer to passing a round -- another round of coronavirus stimulus. They're caught on the $600 extra per week that people get in unemployment benefits from the federal government.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer set to meet with Trump administration officials today.And breaking this morning, Trump administration sources are telling Fox News that the White House is looking into stimulus options that do not require congressional legislative action.Senator, what would that be? Because again, the power of the purse is with Congress.BLACKBURN: Yes the power of the purse is with Congress. But probably what is being referred to as the payroll tax holiday, which employers are very much for this, because it puts more money in the pocket of workers that come back.And Dagen I will tell you I have not talked to one single employer in the state of Tennessee who has said, hey, this $600 a week plus-up is a really great idea. What they are telling me is they have help wanted signs that are out, and there is a difficulty having people come back to work because they are making more money on unemployment.So we have to find a way for our relief to be targeted. It needs to go to people that need it. We need to get people back to work, children back to school. And there is still a lot of money in the pipeline from the Cares Act.There needs to be clarity given to the states as to how they can use that money and specificity on that money absolutely cannot be used for.MCDOWELL: Senator, thank you for being here this morning.Senator Marsha Blackburn.BLACKBURN: Good to be with you. Thank you.MCDOWELL: We'll be right back.MCDOWELL: Fighting cancel culture. Former opinion writer and editor of "The New York Times" Bari Wise speaking out this weekend on HBO's "Real Time with Bill Maher".(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARI WISE, FORMER "NEW YORK TIMES" EDITOR: Cancel culture is about -- it's not criticism. It is about punishment. The writer Jonathan Rauch has called it something like social murder. Writers and editors need to have a level of bravery. When you are living in fear of an online mob, you know, all it takes is a dozen people to repeat a lie about you that you're --(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Wise resigned in July after more than three years at the newspaper due to alleged harassment from her colleagues regarding her viewpoints.Lee, what do you make of this? I watched what is going on with Ellen DeGeneres and to see how low the bar is now set for canceling someone. And I was saying that that would give people in Hollywood, in the entertainment business, people consider themselves to be liberal, a real pause about targeting people because guess what, people have always said this and Greg Gutfeld has talked about it. Eventually they come for you, too.LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS: Yes. And there's no question about it. I think one of the things that concerns me the most is what we are teaching young people right now. This is all black and white thinking. You're either all good or you're all bad. There's no room for people to make mistakes. There's no room for people to learn. There's no room for redemption stories. And frankly, that's some of the most important lessons that we learned.And you know, if you are not able to do that I think that every -- we'd have a bill (ph) problem in society in general, and God forbid anybody look in mirror and think they have not made mistakes, that they haven't had it rough.I just think that it is -- it's lunacy. I don't think it's fair. I think that we are, you know, we're basically assuming people are guilty until proven innocent. It's not American and it's not right.MCDOWELL: I think the power lies in the private sector. And I am not talking about governor's social media companies. I am talking about the companies that employ individuals and the companies that give marketing and ad dollars to individuals or their companies. That they are not going to stand -- because that is really what cancel somebody is, they loss their livelihood. And every corporation, private has the right to say no, enough, we're not doing it.MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR: Yes. But the corporations are falling in line --MCDOWELL: They are.HUCKABEE: -- and they are bowing and surrendering. So the truth is cultural cannibalism, which is what we are seeing destroys creativity and we need creativity even if sometimes it's awkward and uncomfortable, creativity stimulates everything including the economy.MCDOWELL: I know it's self-censorship. Actually it's censorship by, you know, the people with money in their pocket and I am talking about large corporations. It's very dangerous but, again, watch Ellen DeGeneres. If you think that you are above reproach, I mean she's contributed so much to the entertainment community in terms of her legacy and they are coming for her.Coming up rapid COVID-19 testing. One company hoping to speed up the process. That's next.Plus back to school protests, Chicago teachers making demands ahead of the school year.We're back after the break. You are watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.MCDOWELL: Well, there's been more widespread coronavirus testing. The time it takes to get results is causing some concern. One lab is looking to change that with its rapid at home saliva test and it just received FDA emergency use authorization status.Joining me now, Clinical Reference Lab CEO Robert Thompson. Robert, how does this all work?ROBERT THOMPSON, CEO, CLINICAL REFERENCE LAB: So, CLR Rapid Response is a saliva-based product. We simply spit in a tube and mail it into our laboratory and we have 24 to 48 hour turnaround time.MCDOWELL: How accurate is it? Is it as accurate as the, I would say, deep sinus, nasal swab?THOMPSON: Yes, we have 100 percent agreement with the deep sinus, nasal swab or NT swab (ph) in our clinical studies.MCDOWELL: So are corporations getting on board for this because "The Wall Street Journal" has an article today that what has become a huge problem with the backlog of tests and the wait times for individuals, people can't get back to work and back on the job because they're COVID tests are taking so long.So are you having -- who have you signed on to use this so far?THOMPSON: So the response has been off the charts. We've had banks, airlines, sports teams, auto manufacturers, retailers and universities all come on board. Financial companies as well.We're starting with the University of Kansas or KU. In the next two weeks we'll be testing over 25,000 of their students as they return to school and there are a dozen other universities that we will be dealing with in the next two to three weeks.MCDOWELL: Mitch Roschelle, jump in.MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER: Yes. One of my questions -- you're using U.S. mail; the mail hasn't been the most reliable throughout the pandemic. So is there any risk there. Are you using some of the overnight companies to speed up the process?THOMPSON: Everything is done by FedEx.MCDOWELL: What -- in terms of rolling out these tests, Robert, how quickly can you get them out to a variety of say you professional sports teams, for example? Universities, how quickly can you get these tests out across the nation?THOMPSON: So for the last three months we've been investing very heavily and we've ramped up our capacity to -- we will be at over 50,000 tests a day in a couple weeks. So things have really been moving fast. So we will be testing effective immediately large populations.MCDOWELL: Anything to add before we go Robert in terms of the emergency use authorization you got from the government. Where we are in fighting this virus? Are we -- how close are we to not just more widespread testing but also a vaccine you believe?THOMPSON: So, right now we have to learn to live with this, and you know, the ability to do easy frequent fast testing is really essential, the saliva brings the ability to do large population quickly and cost effectively. We have to live with the virus until we have the opportunity down the road for a virus for the vaccine -- and what I have been hearing and studying here is that there are three or four vaccine candidates with a very high likelihood of coming through by the end of the year.MCDOWELL: Thank you. Thank you so much Robert. Robert Thompson joining us.Coming up Washington stimulus battle where the two sides stand with the August recess just days away. Plus Dr. Fauci's new COVID-19 warning, he's stressing extra protection to stay safe you.You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA, live on Fox Business.MCDOWELL: Welcome back. I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Monday, August 3. A look at your markets at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. A 136 point gain on the Dow Futures. Futures are looking to start a new month after a four-month winning streak. Start a new month to the plus side.Checking on global market action, European markets are in the green. A gain of more than 2 percent in Germany. Gains in England and France as well. The Eurozone economy showing signs of growth with the Purchase Managers' Index there for July coming in above 50, showing growth.In Asia overnight, markets were mostly higher. The only loser there, the Heng Seng down half a 1 percent. And gold shining. It's a record-breaking run. Still on a roll closing in on $2,000 an ounce. President Trump meantime demanding that the Boston Marathon bomber face a new death sentence after an appeals court overturned it. Cheryl Casone has the details and more. Cheryl -CASONE: That's right, Dagen. The president tweeting yesterday no one deserve the death penalty more than Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. He and his brother, remember, killed three people and injured 260 in the 2013 Boston Marathon attack. Last week, a federal court vacated the death sentence after ruling that jurors were not properly screened for potential bias. Tsarnaev is still going to serve life in prison. The Justice Department is expected to appeal.Well 7-Eleven, the popular destination for many last-minute snacks and purchases, now wants to gas up your car. The company is buying the Speedway gas station chain from Marathon Petroleum for $21 billion. This is the biggest deal ever for 7-Eleven's Japanese parent company, and it gives 7- Eleven a presence nearly every heavily populated area throughout the United States. Shares of Marathon Petroleum, as you can see, rallying in the premarket up more than 9 percent.Well Best Buy's starting wage increase has finally kicked in. Employees are now going to make $15 an hour. That's a 4 percent pay hike for hourly workers. This replaces the hourly appreciation pay that began in March due to the coronavirus pandemic. Taking a look at shares of Best Buy year-to- date, stock is up about 13 percent year-to-date, and you can see that reflected on that chart. And those are your headlines, Dagen. Back over to you.MCDOWELL: Thank you so much, Cheryl. Cheryl Casone. Stimulus gridlock, lawmakers no closer to passing round four of a coronavirus stimulus package as they remain caught up on the $600 per week extra that the unemployed get in federal benefits. White House Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows, chide at Democrats for playing politics in coronavirus stimulus negotiations. All of this as Congress is set to break for recess on Friday. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)MARK MEADOWS, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: We're still a long ways apart and I don't want to suggest that a deal is imminent because it is not, but like with any deal as you make progress I think it's important to recognize that your making progress and not set an unrealistic expectation that, you know, we're just a few items away because there's still substantial differences, but we did make good progress.MCDOWELL: Meantime, the CEOs of some of the world's biggest company had banded together to send a message to Washington to get money to small businesses now. Joining us now former CKE Restaurant CEO, former Labor Secretary nominee, and The Capitalist Comeback author, Andy Puzder. Andy, if you were in Congress or if you were in the administration, what would you do on this issue of the extra $600, which is already disappeared as of last week?ANDY PUZDER, FORMER CKE RESTAURANTS CEO: Well you really can't continue the $600 a week federal bonus. We - there are complaints from - I speak to people in the restaurant sector regularly. They can't find employees, but just to your local grocery store or drug store and ask, you know, what impact is this having on your ability to hire employees, and you'll find out it's very negative. So the $600 a week bonus is keeping the unemployment rate artificially high. I think Democrats would like to see that because they'd like to see the rate high by the time of the election. Republicans are actually offering to give people substantially all that they would earn if they were working or, you know, close to it or actually that amount, but they can't make any progress. So I think - I think this is all about politics, and I think the Republicans need to hang in there for the American people and for our - the benefit of our economy.MCDOWELL: There was one idea, a proposal that was put out that benefits would decline once the unemployment rate had improved. It's called the automatic stabilizer because it automatically reduces the spending on the program as the economy recovers, but would it - if this $600 is keeping the unemployment rate high, that wouldn't work.PUZDER: Well you're absolutely - this - you know, the Democrats are really smart. I mean, you implement a policy that keeps the unemployment rate high and you tell Republicans, well look, we'll get rid of that policy as the unemployment rate comes down. Well if you keep the policy in place it's not going to come down for a long time, certainly not before November. So that's a ploy. That's a political ploy, and I - Mark Meadows - look, Mark Meadows and Steve Mnuchin are really smart guys. I can't believe they would fall for that.MCDOWELL: We'll see. I want to bring this up, though. The Wall Street Journal, its editorial board out with a new piece today entitled "Economists versus Common Sense". The board writes this, the op-ed page. "Senate Republicans have offered to extend the enhanced benefit by $200 weekly for two months which would still allow many low-wage workers to make as much as they did working. Democrats are demanding that the extra $600, which expired July 31, be extending into 2021. If you subsidize not working, you get less work." The gist of this op-ed is about this Yale study that said that it found that this extra $600 didn't have any impact on the incentive to work which just seems completely illogical, but leave it to Yale to come up with that.PUZDER: Well they did everything they possibly could to come up to that conclusion. Let me give you an example. They didn't include part-time employees, and they didn't include employees who had been with the business less than a year. Well, if you look at the quick-service restaurant sector or the casual dining restaurant sector, they have 100 percent turnover a year, so you're really not including hardly any of the employees that are - that are involved in that restaurant sector.So look, there's a University of Chicago study which was much more comprehensive, done much more thoroughly, much more intelligently, and it said 68 percent of people who receive this - who receive unemployment are making more than they would make at their job, and there's a Congressional Budget Office report because if we continue this $600 a week bonus that 80 percent of people are going to receive more than they received at their job. The Yale study is bologna. It's fictional. It was rigged, and people should just ignore it.MCDOWELL: I want to raise this issue because we reported this toward the top of the hour that the White House is looking at essentially doing something, options of unilateral action it can take to address some of the economic fallout caused by the pandemic if no deal is reached in Congress. And so, I just want to raise the issue that there is a piece in The Wall Street Journal from Stephen Moore, who you know well, and Phil Kerpen that says - that argues that President Trump can unilaterally deliver tax relief by ordering the IRS to stop collecting the payroll tax. What do you make of that?PUZDER: Well look, if he has to do that, that's what he has to do. The president had to act independently with respect to drug prices because he couldn't get Congress to act. Now, if they're not going to pass something that helps the American people, if he's not going to pass something - they're not going to pass something that gets us through this pandemic, this economy crisis, then the president has to act. And I think not collecting the payroll tax would be a great idea. I think that would encourage people to work because they'd make more at work, and we want to reward work, and it would also encourage employers to hire more employees because it would be less expensive to do so. So it's a great plan and I like Steve's idea. I think the president doing this is something that we should look into very carefully.MCDOWELL: Governor Huckabee, get in here.FMR. GOV. MIKE HUCKABEE (R-AR): Well I agree with Andy 100 percent that the payroll tax elimination is really significant because it does cause people to want to go back to work. It's simple. It's easy, requires virtually no administration, and it's not embroiled in a lot of political gamesmanship. Everything that's going on right now, the negotiations between the Republicans and the Democrats, it's all about fine tuning what each side wants. I think the president should take this action, and I think Andy is 100 percent right. It certainly will help the people out there in the service industry, and they need that help right now.MCDOWELL: But Andy, you got to admit a lot of people would be hurt if this $600 goes away or if it isn't replaced with at least a partial payment from the federal government. And the you're literally less than 100 days before a presidential election. That just doesn't seem politically logical in addition to financially logical.PUZDER: Look, we should help people that need help. There's no question about that. People that can't work, are unable to work because of the coronavirus, because of the pandemic, we should help them. They should make - I don't even care if we pay them as much as they would make if they were working. The problem is when you incentivize people not to work. There's a difference between helping people who need help and incentivizing people who don't need help who could, you know, just stay home by paying them. In effect making it unaffordable to work because you pay them. 20 percent of people make double or more what they would have made on the job. Well, how can those people go back to work even if they want to? And with the rates of suicide going up - you heard the head of the CDC saying we're seeing more deaths from suicide, drug addition, alcohol addiction than we're seeing from the pandemic. With those rates going up, I think we need to start getting people back out there. We need to - we need to get people back on the job.MCDOWELL: I've heard that from EMTs not just here in New York City but in other part - in another part of the country that they don't do any coronavirus runs but they'll do multiple overdose runs in a morning in half a days of work. Andy, really quickly in terms of the unemployment benefit, if you're an employer and you call someone back to work and they refuse, could you report them because there's an issue with I think people can actually claim fear or fear of catching the virus to avoid going back to work. If you're an employer, should you do that? Can you do that?PUZDER: Well, the question is would you even want to do it because -(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: Right.PUZDER: -- eventually when these - when these benefits expire you're going to want those people coming back to the job. You don't want to alienate your employees. So I think - and plus you - you know, it just doesn't feel right to do it. So I think probably a lot of employers won't do it. I think there's probably a lot of fraud out there, but I don't think fraud's the big problem. I think the big problem is we're encouraging people not to work. It will keep the unemployment rate up. I think that's the Democrats' plan is to keep the unemployment rate up, and we shouldn't be doing that. We shouldn't be playing politics with this. We shouldn't be using the pandemic to transform America. We should be getting people back to work and getting our economy back in shape.MCDOWELL: Right. You know what hinders an economic recovery? You pay people to stay at home. You don't give liability protection to corporations, and you keep the schools closed. That is the -(CROSSTALK)PUZDER: Yes.MCDOWELL: -- three-part recipe for keeping the economy held down. Andy, great to see you.PUZDER: Yes.MCDOWELL: As always.PUZDER: Great to see you, Dagen. Thanks.MCDOWELL: Andy Puzder. Coming up, back to school protests. Chicago teachers making demands ahead of the school year. Plus the new health risk hitting men. Why success and physical well-bring may not mix. What about women, too? And be sure to tune into Fox Business tomorrow at 9:30 a.m. Eastern. Maria will be ringing the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange, celebrating 25 years since she made her debut on the floor at the NYSE. You're watching Mornings with Maria live on Fox Business.Protect your eyes. Dr. Anthony Fauci recommending wearing goggles or a face shield along with a face mask to better safe guard against COVID-19. The added layer of protection keeping eyes safe from the coronavirus. Joining us now, family physician, Dr. Jennifer Caudle. Dr. Caudle, great to see you. Really?DR. JENNIFER CAUDLE, FAMILY PHYSICIAN: Good to see you, too?MCDOWELL: Really?(LAUGHER)CAUDLE: Yes.MCDOWELL: I mean, we have to do this. I know it's not -(CROSSTALK)CAUDLE: No. Well no, no, no.(LAUGHTER)MCDOWELL: Go ahead.CAUDLE: So that's - Dagen, that's a really great question because a lot of people are saying they interpreted this as oh gosh, now I have to do this. And no, you don't have to do it. I think what Fauci was saying and what I believe and even what the CDC says is that goggles and/or a face shield could add an extra added layer of protection. So we still want everyone wearing face masks. That's what we want you to wear, but if you choose to wear goggles or a face shield in addition, that could also protect your eyes which we know can be a conduit potentially for viruses, bacteria, and even COVID-19. So it's optional, OK? It's not a CDC recommendation, but if you choose to do it along with a mask it can give you greater protection.MCDOWELL: Like if you're taking the subway maybe and you know that you're going to be in close contact with other people. I want to move on to -(CROSSTALK)CAUDLE: Right actually.MCDOWELL: - I want to move onto this. A new study shows that listening to slow music can make you eat less. Scientists in Denmark monitored eating chocolate and found that slower music slowed them down. It seems to make sense, Dr. Caudle. What are your thoughts on this?CAUDLE: Yes. I think it makes sense, too, and we know that eating slower or at least some research has shown that eating slower and for like longer periods of time, like not wolfing (ph) down our food can actually be helpful for eating less over a period of time and feeling more satisfied and things like that. This research really wanted to sort of look at that, and what researchers found I think were two main takeaways I think are important. One is that when people listen to music versus sitting in silence, they tend to eat slower and for longer periods of time. So music makes us slow down our eating. In addition, the type of music matters as well. So they looked at slow and legato music. Legato is just a word for articulation, how the music is articulated, versus fast and staccato.MCDOWELL: Right.CAUDLE: Staccato as well and articulation. They found that those people who listen to the slower, more legato music also sort of calmed down, slowed down. And this I think is really interesting because we think that that may actually help in things like, you know, management of obesity and if you really -(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: Right, I'm -(CROSSTALK)CAUDLE: -- want to sort of, you know -(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: I'm going to try - I'm going to try it because I am embarrassingly fast eater so much my family won't even eat in public with me. Men who make -(LAUGHTER)MCDOWELL: -- we got to get to this. Men who make more money are more likely to have high blood pressure and be overweight according to a new study. Researchers found that men making more than $94,000 a year have double the risk of developing high blood pressure. Dr. Caudle, what is behind this?CAUDLE: Yes. So first of all I want to say that this study was based on a press release. I only had access to the press release. It was a study that was presented a conference in Japan and looking at men there and their income levels and their risk for hypertension, how many of them have hypertension.This is what I would say. Let's sort of distill this down and boil this down. Regardless of whatever income you make for Americans in this country, what you do, et cetera, we know that hypertension is a risk factor for so many things - strokes, heart attacks, so many other things. And some of the mainstays and the ways to minimize hypertension, which is what the study sort of alluded to in the end, is this idea of, you know, not smoking, minimizing stress, eating a healthy diet, exercising, you know, sort of keeping a healthy weight. This is really what I think the take home is. Regardless of what your salary is we want to minimize hypertension and those are some ways to do it.MCDOWELL: Great to see you as always, Dr. Jennifer Caudle. Take care of yourself.CAUDLE: You as well.MCDOWELL: Thank you so much again.CAUDLE: Thank you.MCDOWELL: We'll see you very soon. We'll be right back.Back to school almost here, but there is a battle playing out across the country over whether students should return to the actual classroom or learn remotely. President Trump tweeting about it earlier this hour writing, "Cases up because of big testing. Much of our country is doing very well. Open the schools!" Grady Trimble is live from Chicago where teachers do not want to head back to the classroom. Grady.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)GRADY TRIMBLE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Dagen. Chicago schools are planning a hybrid model to start the year, but it's that return to in-person classes that the Chicago Teachers Union and teachers across the country are protesting today. The Chicago Teachers Union has put out frankly ambitious demands to the school district. They want 100 percent remote classes to start the year as well as free computers and internet access for students.Last week, the American Federation of Teachers authorized local unions to strike as a last resort if teachers don't feel safe going back to the classroom. The CTU hasn't said whether a strike is on the table, but it would be the second in less than a year if one does happen. There was a strike last October over contract negotiations. On the other hand from the teachers, many parents know challenges come with working and schooling from home, and they want a return to in-person teaching.NANCY BENSON, PARENT: Being at home, working full time, having a kid come in to ask questions when you're trying to figure out some work things, it was very stressful. It burned us out.TRIMBLE: A lot of parents can relate to that. In Florida, several teachers unions are taking legal action against the state to try to block the return to in-person classes which is just weeks away in Miami Dade County, which is an epicenter for the coronavirus and also the largest school district in the state. They're planning all virtual classes against the governor's wishes to start the school year. Dagen.(END VIDEO TAPE)MCDOWELL: Grady, thank you so much for that. Grady Trimble. Lee, I keep using this quote, and it was from a professor that was in the - quoted in The Wall Street Journal. It was literally with women being forced to stay at home, largely women taking care of their kids, you have a generational - generation of gains wiped out in the workplace for women.CARTER: Yes. It's - this is a really, really tough decision for everyone involved, right? Two-thirds of parents are concerned about sending their kids back to school, but the bottom line is this. School is an essential function. We're making our grocery workers go to work. We've got to find a way to get children back to school so they can continue to thrive and develop, in many cases schools providing an essential service.MCDOWELL: Lee, thank you so much. More Mornings with Maria are right after this.MCDOWELL: Thank you so much, Lee Carter, Mike Huckabee, and Mitch Roschelle. Thank you one and all. Great to spend the morning with you. That does it for us. Varney & Company is up right now. Stuart?Load-Date: August 3, 2020End of Document

TikTok social media app caught in political squeezeThe Blade (Toledo, Ohio)August 7, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 The BladeDistributed by Tribune Content AgencySection: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWSLength: 1305 wordsByline: Kirk Baird, The Blade, Toledo, OhioBodyAug. 07--     Aug. 7--From President Trump's executive order to ban it and Microsoft's overtures to buy it, TikTok, the social media app launched by a Chinese company that's wildly popular with tweens and teens around the world, has been in the news frequently.For some adults, the recent headlines may be their first and only exposure to TikTok.For 13-year-old Cameron Tracy who lives in Lambertville, her initial experience came in a more roundabout way in 2016, when her older sister told her about an app called Musical.ly, a short-form video-sharing platform based in Shanghai but popular in the United States and Europe."It was really cool and I downloaded it" to her iPod, Cameron said, to watch mostly comedy and funny videos. "I was an early adopter."In late 2017, Musical.ly was sold to the Beijing-based ByteDance and rebranded as TikTok. Less than a year later Cameron, by then a sixth-grader at Christ the King School in West Toledo, had TikTok on her cell phone to watch and share short dance videos, and even post some of her own videos through her private account, which now has more than 175 followers."Everyone on the app is so creative and a lot of people have different content, so I never get bored," she said. And with most videos being less than a minute long, "I don't have to wait around to get to the entertaining part."The lure of TikTok has been especially tempting this summer during the pandemic. "I spend a little too much time on TikTok," Cameron said, approximately 90 minutes in total during the course of a day such as between chores, or before a dance class, or while in the car.Her mother, Michelle Tracy, 39, has noticed Cameron's extra time on TikTok."I do have some concerns regarding the time that she's on there, but I think that's the same with every one of her friends," she said. "It's the generation they're in. Plus, with everything going on with COVID-19 now, there's not a lot of other outlets. With TikTok, they can see their friends and keep in touch with each other."Otherwise, Mrs. Tracy hasn't seen any cause for alarm. In fact, she used to follow her daughters on TikTok when they first joined, but now simply performs a periodic spot check of the app on their phones."My concerns for them, as with any type of social media, was who are they talking to, what content are they posting, and what content are they viewing," she said. "I found that mostly everything they were posting were just for fun and entertainment purposes."A native mobile app designed for mobile phone users, TikTok is an entertainment-oriented video app that delivers specific content based on algorithms or a user's own customized preferences, said Louisa Shu Ying Ha, a professor in Media Production and Studies at Bowling Green State University."[It's] the short, more fun, and interactive version of YouTube," she said.TikTok began in late September, 2016, as the Chinese app 'Douyin,' which means "shaking sound," Ms. Ha said, and its "short-form music video/lipsynching and dancing-along format, in 15 to 60 seconds, made it very fast-paced and very tempting to use."Douyin was an immediate hit in China, it now has 400 million users, she said. TikTok, the U.S.-based brand of the app, has an estimated 100 million users in the United States and two billion users worldwide.Based on her research, Ms. Ha said TikTok is most popular among teenagers younger than 18, appealing to their short attention span and cravings for "spontaneous entertainment.""It becomes their habit to check what's out there in TikTok every day," she said. "They may watch many videos without realizing how much time they have spent on it."TikTok does have an age restriction: Users must by 13 years old to have full access to the app and its features, she said. A version of TikTok for children 12 and younger, though, allows younger users to create their own videos, but not to post their videos. It also restricts access to videos deemed inappropriate for children.Ms. Ha cautions that it's not just TikTok that should concern parents."I would say all social media are not safe for kids under the age of 13," she said. "People write and post all sorts of things and it is impossible to clean all of them up before someone see them. If parents allow children to use social media, they should educate them how to use them and protect themselves from predators and cyberbullies, revealing personal information as well as advise them what is inappropriate content."The privacy of TikTok's users, particularly because so many of them are minors, has drawn concern from Republicans and Democrats. And in an interview with Fox News on Sunday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said President Trump will "fix it.""These Chinese software companies doing business the United States, whether it's TikTok or WeChat ... are feeding data directly to the Chinese Communist Party, their national security apparatus. [It] could be their facial recognition pattern, it could be information about their residence, their phone numbers, their friends, who they're connected to. President Trump has said enough and we're going to fix it and so he will take action in the coming days with respect to a broad array of national security risks that are presented by software connected to the Chinese Communist Party."On Thursday, he did just that, ordering an unspecified ban on "transactions" with the Chinese owners of the consumer apps TikTok and WeChat.The twin executive orders -- one for each app -- were set to take effect in 45 days. They call on the Secretary of Commerce to define the banned transactions by that time.Mr. Trump had threatened a deadline of Sept. 15 to "close down" TikTok unless Microsoft or "somebody else" bought it. TikTok, Microsoft and WeChat owner Tencent had no immediate replies to queries.The President's order cited legal authority from the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the National Emergencies Act.The Senate on Thursday also passed a measure that would prohibit the TikTok app on government-issued devices.TikTok insists it does not store U.S. user information in China and would not share it with the Chinese government. WeChat also says it doesn't share data with the Chinese government and never has, and does not store international user data in China.As reported by the New York Times, Microsoft is in talks to buy TikTok, with a deadline of Sept. 15, the date the president set for a nationwide ban if the company wasn't sold.And while TikTok and social media platforms themselves aren't political, they can be politicized, said Radhika Gajjala, a professor of Media and Communication and of American Culture Studies at Bowling Green State University.For example, India banned TikTok along with dozens of Chinese apps including WeChat following the death of 20 Indian soldiers in a clash with Chinese troops over a disputed border in the Himalayas, "thus politicizing TikTok in the context of India-China relations," Ms. Gajjala said.In fact, the future of the video-sharing platform, best known for goofy dances, light comedy, and lively fun, may depend on how we think of TikTok: as a space for freedom of expression or as a technology product."If its primarily first and foremost a tech product -- even if it supposedly facilitates freedom of expression in public space -- in different ways I would say it's absolutely possible to ban it," she said. "But it depends on the international trade agreements, laws, global business exchange histories, information technology policies nationally and internationally, and so much more."Suffice it to say for now," Ms. Gajjala added, "that the use of it does not have to be political but it often gets there."___ (c)2020 The Blade (Toledo, Ohio) Visit The Blade (Toledo, Ohio) at www.toledoblade.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.Load-Date: August 8, 2020End of Document

All rights reserved.This content is provided to LexisNexis by Comtex News Network, Inc.Length: 12103 wordsBodyHourly In Play (R)Updated: 28-Aug-20 12:00 ET11:45HLF Herbalife Nutrition confirms payment of approx. $123 mln to settle FCPA case (49.23 -0.45)As previously disclosed, the SEC and the DOJ conducted investigations into Herbalife Nutrition's compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, in China. Also, as previously disclosed, the company conducted its own review and implemented remedial and improvement measures based upon this review, including replacement of certain employees and enhancements of policies and procedures in China. The company cooperated with the SEC and DOJ and has now reached separate resolutions with each of them. On August 28, the SEC accepted the Offer of Settlement and issued an administrative order finding that the company violated the books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA. In addition, on August 28, the company and DOJ separately entered into a court-approved deferred prosecution agreement (DPA), under which DOJ deferred criminal prosecution of the company for a period of three years related to a conspiracy to violate the books and records provisions of the FCPA. Among other things, the company is required to undertake compliance self-reporting obligations for the three-year term of the respective agreements with the SEC and DOJ. If the company remains in compliance with the DPA during its three-year term, the deferred charge against the company will be dismissed with prejudice. In addition, the company agreed to pay the SEC and DOJ aggregate penalties, disgorgement, and prejudgment interest of approx. $123 mln. The company previously recognized an estimated aggregate accrued liability for these matters of approx. $123 mln, which has been recognized in other current liabilities within its condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2020. Accordingly, there will not be any additional impact on the company's results of operations.10:41TALKX Market Briefing: Growth stocks out front again (along with the VIX)Any performance edge cyclical/value stocks might have had early has faded, as they are now looking up at growth stocks once again. This disparity is evident in the major indices, as the Russell 2000 (+0.5%) and Nasdaq Composite (+0.4%) are outlegging the S&P 500 (+0.1%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%).The larger takeaway, though, is that sellers have been unable to pack any real punch so far, as each of the major indices is in positive territory.The leadership of the mega-cap growth stocks, the fear of missing out on further gains, and the understanding that the Fed isn't going to get in the way of things soon with a rate hike, have been underpinning factors for the broader market.The latter point notwithstanding, one can detect the emergence of some pullback angst in the outperformance of the CBOE Volatility Index (25.80, +1.33, +5.4%) and the renewed buying interest in the Treasury market where gains are being logged across the curve. Currently, the 10-yr note yield is down four basis points to 0.71% after scraping 0.78% in the overnight trade.Once again, the S&P 500 information technology sector (+0.6%) sits atop the performance board in a generally mixed market. The weakest area thus far is the real estate sector (-0.6%).10:33ADAP Adaptimmune Therapeutics announces presentation of "promising" data from Phase 1 trial with ADP-A2AFP in liver cancer (8.36 +0.22)Adaptimmune Therapeutics presented data from its Phase 1 trial with SPEAR T-cells targeting AFP at the virtual International Liver Congress. One patient out of four dosed with 5 bln or more cells had a complete response, which was reported previously. The data also demonstrate an acceptable safety profile in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Top-line data presented include:One patient had a complete response and also demonstrated a sustained reduction in serum AFP. This patient experienced disease progression, having developed new lesions at Week 32.Overall, nine patients have been treated as of the data cutoff. Of those:Four patients have been treated with ~5 bln or more transduced cells (three in Cohort 3 and one in the expansion phase): 1 patient with the complete response, 1 with stable disease (SD), and 2 had progressive disease (PD).Five patients were previously treated in the first two dose cohorts with doses of 100 mln and 1 bln transduced cells, respectively, and all patients had best responses of SD.ADP-A2AFP SPEAR T-cells were associated with an acceptable safety profile with no evidence of significant T-cell related hepatotoxicity and no protocol-defined dose limiting toxicities. Evidence of dose-dependent persistence of ADP-A2AFP SPEAR T-cells post-infusion. Further translational evaluation is ongoing to understand indicators of response.10:33XLK Sector Briefing: Technology (122.91 +0.81)The top-weighted technology sector (+0.8%) started today's session in the lead, making for a continuation of this week's outperformance. The sector has rallied 4.3% since last Friday and it is on track to gain 11.2% for the month, which puts the group ahead of the remaining ten sectors on the August leaderboard.Today's outperformance is owed to another strong showing from the largest sector components by weight. Apple (AAPL 502.59, +2.55, +0.5%), Microsoft (MSFT 229.73, +3.15, +1.4%), Visa (V 213.46, +2.43, +1.2%), MasterCard (MA 359.33, +3.33, +0.9%), and NVIDIA (NVDA 514.44, +9.31, +1.8%) are up between 0.5% and 1.6%.Notable movers:HP (HPQ 20.10, +1.40, +7.5%): best performer in the sector, rallying to its highest level since early March after beating Q3 expectations and issuing better than expected guidance. Cowen raised its price target for the stock to $20 from $18. Western Digital (WDC 36.60, +1.36, +3.9%): extending its rebound from a five-month low. Akamai Technologies (AKAM 117.51, +3.45, +3.0%): rising to its best level in over 20 years. Citrix Systems (CTXS 145.72, +3.48, +2.5%): rising above its 50-day moving average (145.42).

The study demonstrated statistically significant improvement in overall survival for Menkes disease subjects who received early treatment (ET) with CUTX-101, compared to an untreated historical control (HC) cohort, with a nearly 80% reduction in the risk of death (Hazard Ratio = 0.21, p<0.0001). Median survival for the ET cohort was 14.8 years (177.1 months) compared to 1.3 years (15.9 months) for the untreated HC cohort.Based on the criteria outlined in the SAP to ensure the two cohorts were comparable, 31 Menkes disease patients who received ET with CUTX-101 and 18 HC Menkes disease patients were included in the primary efficacy analysis. The primary endpoint of overall survival was met. "With no currently approved [FDA] treatments, Menkes disease is a serious condition with a significant unmet medical need," said Lung S. Yam, M.D., Ph.D., President and CEO of Cyprium.Rolling submission of a NDA for CUTX-101 is on track to begin in Q4 of 2020.The top-line primary efficacy data and other relevant briefing materials will be presented to the FDA at a pre-NDA meeting scheduled for later in the current quarter. Other pre-specified secondary and sensitivity analyses will be included in the NDA submission.08:35WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: +15.10.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.6%) and Russell 2000 (+0.3%) performed slightly better, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.3% after setting an all-time high earlier in the session.Financial stocks were among today's biggest winners, benefiting from some curve-steepening activity after Fed Chair Powell outlined a shift towards an average inflation target. Under the new framework, the Fed would allow PCE inflation to run moderately beyond 2.0% over time to make up for years when it ran below 2.0%.From a sector perspective, the S&P 500 financials sector finished atop the standings with a 1.7% gain, followed by real estate (+1.4%), health care (+0.8%), and consumer staples (+0.6%). The communication services (-1.3%), consumer discretionary (-0.7%), and materials (-0.2%) sectors were the lone holdouts.Other positive factors today included reports that Microsoft (MSFT 226.58, +5.43, +2.5%) and Walmart (WMT 136.63, +5.93, +4.5%) are teaming up to possibly acquire TikTok US, and Abbott Labs (ABT 111.29, +8.10, +7.9%) receiving emergency use authorization from the FDA for its $5.00, 15-minute COVID-19 antigen test.Mega-cap growth stocks had a relatively weak outing today after an incredibly strong performance yesterday. Microsoft was an exception, of course, and so was Tesla (TSLA 2238.75, +85.58, +4.0%).As an aside, Senate Majority Leader McConnell (R-KY) reportedly said stimulus talks remained at a stalemate, which may have been a contributing factor in the market's brief dip into negative territory around 1:00 p.m. ET. The market, however, swiftly rebounded into positive territory.Recapping the moves in the Treasury market, the 2-yr yield finished flat at 0.16%, while the 10-yr yield increased six basis points to 0.75% as investors sold longer-dated bonds following Fed Chair Powell's speech. The U.S. Dollar Index was little changed at 93.03. WTI crude futures declined 0.8%, or $0.36, to $43.03/bbl.Reviewing Thursday's economic data:Initial jobless claims for the week ending August 22 were roughly in-line with expectations, decreasing by 98,000 to 1.006 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.000 million). Continuing claims for the week ending August 15 decreased by 223,000 to 14.535 million. The key takeaway from the report is that the labor market, while recovering, is still fractured in a big way that is not conducive for strong and sustained economic growth.The second estimate for Q2 GDP showed output decreased at an annualized rate of 31.7% (Briefing.com consensus -32.9%) versus the advance estimate of -32.9%. The GDP price index was down 2.0% (Briefing.com consensus -1.8%) versus the advance estimate of -1.8%.The key takeaway from the report is that the upward revision doesn't change the fact that the COVID crisis triggered the biggest downturn for the U.S. economy on record.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Personal Income and Spending report for July, the final Univ. of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for August, and Wholesale Inventories for July on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +29.6% YTDS&P 500 +7.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -0.2% YTDRussell 2000 -6.2% YTD16:20KMI Kinder Morgan announces commercial in-service of final Movable Modular Liquefaction unit at Elba Island Liquefaction facility (13.86 +0.13)The Elba Liquefaction Company, a joint venture between Kinder Morgan and EIG Global Energy Partners, announced today the commercial in-service of Unit 7, the last of 10 Movable Modular Liquefaction units of the approx. $2 bln Elba Liquefaction project.

The Nasdaq Composite is up 0.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.5%, and Russell 2000 is up 0.4%.Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are trading in positive territory. The information technology sector's 0.7% gain is carrying the most weight, but the energy (+1.2%) and materials (+0.9%) sectors are up the most. Conversely, the defensive-oriented real estate (-0.2%), utilities (-0.2%), and health care (-0.3%) sectors are the lone holdouts.The gains are broad in the tech space. Heavyweight Visa (V 214.86, +3.82, +1.8%) is up 2%, semiconductor stocks are outperforming based on the 1.3% gain in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, and there are numerous earnings winners.For example, Workday (WDAY 243.04, +26.41, +12.2%), HP Inc. (HPQ 19.85, +1.15, +6.1%), Dell (DELL 66.16, +3.73, +6.1%), and VMware (VMW 147.51, +4.61, +3.2%) are up noticeably following better-than-expected earnings reports.Reopening stocks like casinos, airlines, and cruise lines are also exhibiting strength. Retailer Ulta Beauty (ULTA 237.65, 13.70, +6.1%) is up 6% after exceeding earnings estimates.Walmart (WMT 140.16, +3.54, +2.6%) is another standout today. Walmart is approaching the $400 billion market capitalization, which would put it an exclusive club with Tesla (TSLA 2249.20, +10.45, +0.4%), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 152.78, -0.21, -0.1%), and Taiwan Semi (TSM 80.35, -0.24, -0.3%).Elsewhere, there are subtle signs of caution. The 10-yr yield is down three basis points to 0.72% amid an uptick in buying interest, gold futures are up 2.4% to $1970.00 amid a weaker dollar (92.32, -0.68, -0.7%), and the CBOE Volatility Index is up 1.6% to 24.86 but it was up as much as 7.5% earlier.Reviewing today's economic data:Personal income increased 0.4% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -0.2%), which was much better than expected, and personal spending rose 1.9% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +1.5%), which was also much better than expected. The PCE Price Index and core-PCE Price Index both increased 0.3% m/m and were weaker than expected increases of 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively. That left the PCE Price Index up 1.0% yr/yr, versus 0.9% in June, and the core PCE Price Index up 1.3% yr/yr, versus 1.1% in June.The key takeaway from the report is that the income gain was driven by an increase in compensation (+1.3% m/m), which more than offset a 1.7% m/m decrease in personal current transfer receipts. In other words, the income gain was driven by people returning to work as the economy reopened.The preliminary University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for August ticked up to 72.8 (Briefing.com consensus 70.5) from the final reading of 72.5 for July.The key takeaway from the report is that there was little overall change from the preceding period. The University of Michigan provided a table showing consumer expectations by political affiliation, which showed a stark difference in expectations among those who identify as Republican (97.4) and Democrat (45.0). Expectations of respondents identifying as Independent were essentially in the middle (66.7).The Chicago PMI for August decreased to 51.2 from 51.9 in July.Wholesale inventories decreased 0.1% in July following a revised 1.3% decline in June (from -1.4%).12:22SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (66) outpacing new lows (10) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ABT, AKAM, ANSS, ARCB, ARNA, BKI, BLDR, BMCH, CHDN, CHWY, CMG, COST, CRBP, CRWD, CSIQ, CSTL, CTAS, DELL, DY, EGAN, ENPH, EPAM, EW, EXPD, FCX, FDX, FIZZ, FLWS, FSLR, HIBB, HUBS, IAA, IIPR, JOE, KNSL, KURA, LSTR, MA, MMSI, MRTX, NOW, NVDA, ODFL, RH, ROKU, RUN, RYTM, SCCO, SILK, SPLK, SWAV, TENB, TGTX, TNDM, TSLA, V, VEEV, VICR, VRNS, VSLR, WDAY, WMT, YUMC, Z, ZM, ZSStocks that traded to 52 week lows: ADES, AERI, ASC, CVIAQ, DNRCQ, DSSI, SR, STNG, TLRDQ, VALPQThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: CWCOETFs that traded to 52 week highs: BKF, ENZL, FDN, FXA, GXC, IGV, IHI, IYK, IYM, PBD, PBW, SKYY, TAN, URA, XLB, XLK, XLP12:04XLY Sector Briefing: Consumer Discretionary (150.35 +0.80)The heavily weighted consumer discretionary sector (+0.5%) is among today's outperformers, extending this week's gain to 3.1%. The influential sector has rallied 9.2% in August, trailing only technology (+0.8%; +11.2% month-to-date) and communication services (+0.3%; +15.5% month-to-date) on the August leaderboard.The discretionary sector owes its outperformance to gains in about 2/3 of its components. Ulta (ULTA 237.39, +13.44, +6.0%) is the best performer after beating Q2 EPS estimates on light revenue while casino and cruise stocks also appear among the leaders.Notable movers:Ulta (ULTA 237.39, +13.44, +6.0%): leading performer, approached its June high after beating Q2 earnings estimates on light revenue. Telsey Advisory Group raised its price target for the stock to $295 from $280. Wynn Resorts (WYNN 91.79, +5.27, +6.1%): rallying to its best level since mid-June. Royal Caribbean (RCL 70.14, +3.54, +5.3%): nearing its June high (75.55). MGM Resorts (MGM 24.01, +1.20, +5.2%): rallying to levels from early March after The Wall Street Journal reported that the company will fire 18,000 workers. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH 17.55, +0.90, +5.4%): rising to its best level since mid-July. Carnival (CCL 17.06, +0.94, +5.9%): rising to levels from mid-July. The company's German unit will resume operations in the fall. Las Vegas Sands (LVS 52.64, +2.11, +4.2%): rallying to its best level since early June with its 200-day moving average (46.74) looming above. Darden Restaurants (DRI 89.39, +3.63, +4.2%): rising above its 200-day moving average (87.86) toward its June high (92.07). Nordstrom (JWN 15.44, +0.65, +4.3%): rising to its 50-day moving average (15.50). eBay (EBAY 54.93, -1.38, -2.4%): weakest performer in the sector, falling below its 50-day moving average (55.62).12:01SUMRX Economic SummaryEconomic Data Summary:Jul Personal Income 0.4% vs Briefing.com consensus of -0.2%; prior was revised to -1.0% from -1.1%The key takeaway from the report is that the income gain was driven by an increase in compensation (+1.3% m/m), which more than offset a 1.7% m/m decrease in personal current transfer receipts. In other words, the income gain was driven by people returning to work as the economy reopened.Jul Personal Spending 1.9% vs Briefing.com consensus of 1.5%; prior was revised to 6.2% from 5.6% Jul PCE Prices 0.3% vs Briefing.com consensus of 0.4%; prior was revised to 0.5% from 0.4% Jul PCE Prices - Core 0.3% vs Briefing.com consensus of 0.5%; prior was revised to 0.3% from 0.2% Jul Adv. Intl. Trade in Goods -$79.3B; prior was -$70.99B Jul Wholesale Inventories -$79.3B; prior was revised to -1.3% from -1.4% Aug Chicago PMI 51.2; prior was 51.9 Aug Univ. of Michigan Consumer Sentiment - Final 74.1 vs Briefing.com consensus of 72.8; prior was 72.8The key takeaway from the report is that consumer sentiment has been slow to rebound and that the incremental improvement seen has been based simply on the view that things couldn't get worse than they were at the depths of the shutdown period.Upcoming Economic Data:Aug ISM Manufacturing Index due out Tues at 10 ET (prior was 54.2%) Jul Construction Spending due out Tues at 10 ET (prior was -0.7%)11:45HLF Herbalife Nutrition confirms payment of approx. $123 mln to settle FCPA case (49.23 -0.45)As previously disclosed, the SEC and the DOJ conducted investigations into Herbalife Nutrition's compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, in China. Also, as previously disclosed, the company conducted its own review and implemented remedial and improvement measures based upon this review, including replacement of certain employees and enhancements of policies and procedures in China. The company cooperated with the SEC and DOJ and has now reached separate resolutions with each of them. On August 28, the SEC accepted the Offer of Settlement and issued an administrative order finding that the company violated the books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA. In addition, on August 28, the company and DOJ separately entered into a court-approved deferred prosecution agreement (DPA), under which DOJ deferred criminal prosecution of the company for a period of three years related to a conspiracy to violate the books and records provisions of the FCPA. Among other things, the company is required to undertake compliance self-reporting obligations for the three-year term of the respective agreements with the SEC and DOJ. If the company remains in compliance with the DPA during its three-year term, the deferred charge against the company will be dismissed with prejudice. In addition, the company agreed to pay the SEC and DOJ aggregate penalties, disgorgement, and prejudgment interest of approx. $123 mln. The company previously recognized an estimated aggregate accrued liability for these matters of approx. $123 mln, which has been recognized in other current liabilities within its condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2020. Accordingly, there will not be any additional impact on the company's results of operations.10:41TALKX Market Briefing: Growth stocks out front again (along with the VIX)Any performance edge cyclical/value stocks might have had early has faded, as they are now looking up at growth stocks once again. This disparity is evident in the major indices, as the Russell 2000 (+0.5%) and Nasdaq Composite (+0.4%) are outlegging the S&P 500 (+0.1%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%).The larger takeaway, though, is that sellers have been unable to pack any real punch so far, as each of the major indices is in positive territory.The leadership of the mega-cap growth stocks, the fear of missing out on further gains, and the understanding that the Fed isn't going to get in the way of things soon with a rate hike, have been underpinning factors for the broader market.The latter point notwithstanding, one can detect the emergence of some pullback angst in the outperformance of the CBOE Volatility Index (25.80, +1.33, +5.4%) and the renewed buying interest in the Treasury market where gains are being logged across the curve. Currently, the 10-yr note yield is down four basis points to 0.71% after scraping 0.78% in the overnight trade.Once again, the S&P 500 information technology sector (+0.6%) sits atop the performance board in a generally mixed market. The weakest area thus far is the real estate sector (-0.6%).10:33ADAP Adaptimmune Therapeutics announces presentation of "promising" data from Phase 1 trial with ADP-A2AFP in liver cancer (8.36 +0.22)Adaptimmune Therapeutics presented data from its Phase 1 trial with SPEAR T-cells targeting AFP at the virtual International Liver Congress. One patient out of four dosed with 5 bln or more cells had a complete response, which was reported previously. The data also demonstrate an acceptable safety profile in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Top-line data presented include:One patient had a complete response and also demonstrated a sustained reduction in serum AFP. This patient experienced disease progression, having developed new lesions at Week 32.Overall, nine patients have been treated as of the data cutoff. Of those:Four patients have been treated with ~5 bln or more transduced cells (three in Cohort 3 and one in the expansion phase): 1 patient with the complete response, 1 with stable disease (SD), and 2 had progressive disease (PD).Five patients were previously treated in the first two dose cohorts with doses of 100 mln and 1 bln transduced cells, respectively, and all patients had best responses of SD.ADP-A2AFP SPEAR T-cells were associated with an acceptable safety profile with no evidence of significant T-cell related hepatotoxicity and no protocol-defined dose limiting toxicities. Evidence of dose-dependent persistence of ADP-A2AFP SPEAR T-cells post-infusion. Further translational evaluation is ongoing to understand indicators of response.10:33XLK Sector Briefing: Technology (122.91 +0.81)The top-weighted technology sector (+0.8%) started today's session in the lead, making for a continuation of this week's outperformance. The sector has rallied 4.3% since last Friday and it is on track to gain 11.2% for the month, which puts the group ahead of the remaining ten sectors on the August leaderboard.Today's outperformance is owed to another strong showing from the largest sector components by weight. Apple (AAPL 502.59, +2.55, +0.5%), Microsoft (MSFT 229.73, +3.15, +1.4%), Visa (V 213.46, +2.43, +1.2%), MasterCard (MA 359.33, +3.33, +0.9%), and NVIDIA (NVDA 514.44, +9.31, +1.8%) are up between 0.5% and 1.6%.Notable movers:HP (HPQ 20.10, +1.40, +7.5%): best performer in the sector, rallying to its highest level since early March after beating Q3 expectations and issuing better than expected guidance. Cowen raised its price target for the stock to $20 from $18. Western Digital (WDC 36.60, +1.36, +3.9%): extending its rebound from a five-month low.

The study demonstrated statistically significant improvement in overall survival for Menkes disease subjects who received early treatment (ET) with CUTX-101, compared to an untreated historical control (HC) cohort, with a nearly 80% reduction in the risk of death (Hazard Ratio = 0.21, p<0.0001). Median survival for the ET cohort was 14.8 years (177.1 months) compared to 1.3 years (15.9 months) for the untreated HC cohort.Based on the criteria outlined in the SAP to ensure the two cohorts were comparable, 31 Menkes disease patients who received ET with CUTX-101 and 18 HC Menkes disease patients were included in the primary efficacy analysis. The primary endpoint of overall survival was met. "With no currently approved [FDA] treatments, Menkes disease is a serious condition with a significant unmet medical need," said Lung S. Yam, M.D., Ph.D., President and CEO of Cyprium.Rolling submission of a NDA for CUTX-101 is on track to begin in Q4 of 2020.The top-line primary efficacy data and other relevant briefing materials will be presented to the FDA at a pre-NDA meeting scheduled for later in the current quarter. Other pre-specified secondary and sensitivity analyses will be included in the NDA submission.08:35WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: +15.10.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.6%) and Russell 2000 (+0.3%) performed slightly better, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.3% after setting an all-time high earlier in the session.Financial stocks were among today's biggest winners, benefiting from some curve-steepening activity after Fed Chair Powell outlined a shift towards an average inflation target. Under the new framework, the Fed would allow PCE inflation to run moderately beyond 2.0% over time to make up for years when it ran below 2.0%.From a sector perspective, the S&P 500 financials sector finished atop the standings with a 1.7% gain, followed by real estate (+1.4%), health care (+0.8%), and consumer staples (+0.6%). The communication services (-1.3%), consumer discretionary (-0.7%), and materials (-0.2%) sectors were the lone holdouts.Other positive factors today included reports that Microsoft (MSFT 226.58, +5.43, +2.5%) and Walmart (WMT 136.63, +5.93, +4.5%) are teaming up to possibly acquire TikTok US, and Abbott Labs (ABT 111.29, +8.10, +7.9%) receiving emergency use authorization from the FDA for its $5.00, 15-minute COVID-19 antigen test.Mega-cap growth stocks had a relatively weak outing today after an incredibly strong performance yesterday. Microsoft was an exception, of course, and so was Tesla (TSLA 2238.75, +85.58, +4.0%).As an aside, Senate Majority Leader McConnell (R-KY) reportedly said stimulus talks remained at a stalemate, which may have been a contributing factor in the market's brief dip into negative territory around 1:00 p.m. ET. The market, however, swiftly rebounded into positive territory.Recapping the moves in the Treasury market, the 2-yr yield finished flat at 0.16%, while the 10-yr yield increased six basis points to 0.75% as investors sold longer-dated bonds following Fed Chair Powell's speech. The U.S. Dollar Index was little changed at 93.03. WTI crude futures declined 0.8%, or $0.36, to $43.03/bbl.Reviewing Thursday's economic data:Initial jobless claims for the week ending August 22 were roughly in-line with expectations, decreasing by 98,000 to 1.006 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.000 million). Continuing claims for the week ending August 15 decreased by 223,000 to 14.535 million. The key takeaway from the report is that the labor market, while recovering, is still fractured in a big way that is not conducive for strong and sustained economic growth.The second estimate for Q2 GDP showed output decreased at an annualized rate of 31.7% (Briefing.com consensus -32.9%) versus the advance estimate of -32.9%. The GDP price index was down 2.0% (Briefing.com consensus -1.8%) versus the advance estimate of -1.8%.The key takeaway from the report is that the upward revision doesn't change the fact that the COVID crisis triggered the biggest downturn for the U.S. economy on record.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Personal Income and Spending report for July, the final Univ. of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for August, and Wholesale Inventories for July on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +29.6% YTDS&P 500 +7.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -0.2% YTDRussell 2000 -6.2% YTD16:20KMI Kinder Morgan announces commercial in-service of final Movable Modular Liquefaction unit at Elba Island Liquefaction facility (13.86 +0.13)The Elba Liquefaction Company, a joint venture between Kinder Morgan and EIG Global Energy Partners, announced today the commercial in-service of Unit 7, the last of 10 Movable Modular Liquefaction units of the approx. $2 bln Elba Liquefaction project.

The Nasdaq Composite is up 0.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.5%, and Russell 2000 is up 0.4%.Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are trading in positive territory. The information technology sector's 0.7% gain is carrying the most weight, but the energy (+1.2%) and materials (+0.9%) sectors are up the most. Conversely, the defensive-oriented real estate (-0.2%), utilities (-0.2%), and health care (-0.3%) sectors are the lone holdouts.The gains are broad in the tech space. Heavyweight Visa (V 214.86, +3.82, +1.8%) is up 2%, semiconductor stocks are outperforming based on the 1.3% gain in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, and there are numerous earnings winners.For example, Workday (WDAY 243.04, +26.41, +12.2%), HP Inc. (HPQ 19.85, +1.15, +6.1%), Dell (DELL 66.16, +3.73, +6.1%), and VMware (VMW 147.51, +4.61, +3.2%) are up noticeably following better-than-expected earnings reports.Reopening stocks like casinos, airlines, and cruise lines are also exhibiting strength. Retailer Ulta Beauty (ULTA 237.65, 13.70, +6.1%) is up 6% after exceeding earnings estimates.Walmart (WMT 140.16, +3.54, +2.6%) is another standout today. Walmart is approaching the $400 billion market capitalization, which would put it an exclusive club with Tesla (TSLA 2249.20, +10.45, +0.4%), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 152.78, -0.21, -0.1%), and Taiwan Semi (TSM 80.35, -0.24, -0.3%).Elsewhere, there are subtle signs of caution. The 10-yr yield is down three basis points to 0.72% amid an uptick in buying interest, gold futures are up 2.4% to $1970.00 amid a weaker dollar (92.32, -0.68, -0.7%), and the CBOE Volatility Index is up 1.6% to 24.86 but it was up as much as 7.5% earlier.Reviewing today's economic data:Personal income increased 0.4% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -0.2%), which was much better than expected, and personal spending rose 1.9% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +1.5%), which was also much better than expected. The PCE Price Index and core-PCE Price Index both increased 0.3% m/m and were weaker than expected increases of 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively. That left the PCE Price Index up 1.0% yr/yr, versus 0.9% in June, and the core PCE Price Index up 1.3% yr/yr, versus 1.1% in June.The key takeaway from the report is that the income gain was driven by an increase in compensation (+1.3% m/m), which more than offset a 1.7% m/m decrease in personal current transfer receipts. In other words, the income gain was driven by people returning to work as the economy reopened.The preliminary University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for August ticked up to 72.8 (Briefing.com consensus 70.5) from the final reading of 72.5 for July.The key takeaway from the report is that there was little overall change from the preceding period. The University of Michigan provided a table showing consumer expectations by political affiliation, which showed a stark difference in expectations among those who identify as Republican (97.4) and Democrat (45.0). Expectations of respondents identifying as Independent were essentially in the middle (66.7).The Chicago PMI for August decreased to 51.2 from 51.9 in July.Wholesale inventories decreased 0.1% in July following a revised 1.3% decline in June (from -1.4%).12:22SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (66) outpacing new lows (10) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ABT, AKAM, ANSS, ARCB, ARNA, BKI, BLDR, BMCH, CHDN, CHWY, CMG, COST, CRBP, CRWD, CSIQ, CSTL, CTAS, DELL, DY, EGAN, ENPH, EPAM, EW, EXPD, FCX, FDX, FIZZ, FLWS, FSLR, HIBB, HUBS, IAA, IIPR, JOE, KNSL, KURA, LSTR, MA, MMSI, MRTX, NOW, NVDA, ODFL, RH, ROKU, RUN, RYTM, SCCO, SILK, SPLK, SWAV, TENB, TGTX, TNDM, TSLA, V, VEEV, VICR, VRNS, VSLR, WDAY, WMT, YUMC, Z, ZM, ZSStocks that traded to 52 week lows: ADES, AERI, ASC, CVIAQ, DNRCQ, DSSI, SR, STNG, TLRDQ, VALPQThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: CWCOETFs that traded to 52 week highs: BKF, ENZL, FDN, FXA, GXC, IGV, IHI, IYK, IYM, PBD, PBW, SKYY, TAN, URA, XLB, XLK, XLP12:04XLY Sector Briefing: Consumer Discretionary (150.35 +0.80)The heavily weighted consumer discretionary sector (+0.5%) is among today's outperformers, extending this week's gain to 3.1%. The influential sector has rallied 9.2% in August, trailing only technology (+0.8%; +11.2% month-to-date) and communication services (+0.3%; +15.5% month-to-date) on the August leaderboard.The discretionary sector owes its outperformance to gains in about 2/3 of its components. Ulta (ULTA 237.39, +13.44, +6.0%) is the best performer after beating Q2 EPS estimates on light revenue while casino and cruise stocks also appear among the leaders.Notable movers:Ulta (ULTA 237.39, +13.44, +6.0%): leading performer, approached its June high after beating Q2 earnings estimates on light revenue. Telsey Advisory Group raised its price target for the stock to $295 from $280. Wynn Resorts (WYNN 91.79, +5.27, +6.1%): rallying to its best level since mid-June. Royal Caribbean (RCL 70.14, +3.54, +5.3%): nearing its June high (75.55).

Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH 17.55, +0.90, +5.4%): rising to its best level since mid-July. Carnival (CCL 17.06, +0.94, +5.9%): rising to levels from mid-July. The company's German unit will resume operations in the fall. Las Vegas Sands (LVS 52.64, +2.11, +4.2%): rallying to its best level since early June with its 200-day moving average (46.74) looming above. Darden Restaurants (DRI 89.39, +3.63, +4.2%): rising above its 200-day moving average (87.86) toward its June high (92.07). Nordstrom (JWN 15.44, +0.65, +4.3%): rising to its 50-day moving average (15.50). eBay (EBAY 54.93, -1.38, -2.4%): weakest performer in the sector, falling below its 50-day moving average (55.62).12:01SUMRX Economic SummaryEconomic Data Summary:Jul Personal Income 0.4% vs Briefing.com consensus of -0.2%; prior was revised to -1.0% from -1.1%The key takeaway from the report is that the income gain was driven by an increase in compensation (+1.3% m/m), which more than offset a 1.7% m/m decrease in personal current transfer receipts. In other words, the income gain was driven by people returning to work as the economy reopened.Jul Personal Spending 1.9% vs Briefing.com consensus of 1.5%; prior was revised to 6.2% from 5.6% Jul PCE Prices 0.3% vs Briefing.com consensus of 0.4%; prior was revised to 0.5% from 0.4% Jul PCE Prices - Core 0.3% vs Briefing.com consensus of 0.5%; prior was revised to 0.3% from 0.2% Jul Adv.

Trade in Goods -$79.3B; prior was -$70.99B Jul Wholesale Inventories -$79.3B; prior was revised to -1.3% from -1.4% Aug Chicago PMI 51.2; prior was 51.9 Aug Univ. of Michigan Consumer Sentiment - Final 74.1 vs Briefing.com consensus of 72.8; prior was 72.8The key takeaway from the report is that consumer sentiment has been slow to rebound and that the incremental improvement seen has been based simply on the view that things couldn't get worse than they were at the depths of the shutdown period.Upcoming Economic Data:Aug ISM Manufacturing Index due out Tues at 10 ET (prior was 54.2%) Jul Construction Spending due out Tues at 10 ET (prior was -0.7%)11:45HLF Herbalife Nutrition confirms payment of approx. $123 mln to settle FCPA case (49.23 -0.45)As previously disclosed, the SEC and the DOJ conducted investigations into Herbalife Nutrition's compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, in China. Also, as previously disclosed, the company conducted its own review and implemented remedial and improvement measures based upon this review, including replacement of certain employees and enhancements of policies and procedures in China. The company cooperated with the SEC and DOJ and has now reached separate resolutions with each of them. On August 28, the SEC accepted the Offer of Settlement and issued an administrative order finding that the company violated the books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA. In addition, on August 28, the company and DOJ separately entered into a court-approved deferred prosecution agreement (DPA), under which DOJ deferred criminal prosecution of the company for a period of three years related to a conspiracy to violate the books and records provisions of the FCPA. Among other things, the company is required to undertake compliance self-reporting obligations for the three-year term of the respective agreements with the SEC and DOJ. If the company remains in compliance with the DPA during its three-year term, the deferred charge against the company will be dismissed with prejudice. In addition, the company agreed to pay the SEC and DOJ aggregate penalties, disgorgement, and prejudgment interest of approx. $123 mln. The company previously recognized an estimated aggregate accrued liability for these matters of approx. $123 mln, which has been recognized in other current liabilities within its condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2020. Accordingly, there will not be any additional impact on the company's results of operations.10:41TALKX Market Briefing: Growth stocks out front again (along with the VIX)Any performance edge cyclical/value stocks might have had early has faded, as they are now looking up at growth stocks once again. This disparity is evident in the major indices, as the Russell 2000 (+0.5%) and Nasdaq Composite (+0.4%) are outlegging the S&P 500 (+0.1%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%).The larger takeaway, though, is that sellers have been unable to pack any real punch so far, as each of the major indices is in positive territory.The leadership of the mega-cap growth stocks, the fear of missing out on further gains, and the understanding that the Fed isn't going to get in the way of things soon with a rate hike, have been underpinning factors for the broader market.The latter point notwithstanding, one can detect the emergence of some pullback angst in the outperformance of the CBOE Volatility Index (25.80, +1.33, +5.4%) and the renewed buying interest in the Treasury market where gains are being logged across the curve. Currently, the 10-yr note yield is down four basis points to 0.71% after scraping 0.78% in the overnight trade.Once again, the S&P 500 information technology sector (+0.6%) sits atop the performance board in a generally mixed market. The weakest area thus far is the real estate sector (-0.6%).10:33ADAP Adaptimmune Therapeutics announces presentation of "promising" data from Phase 1 trial with ADP-A2AFP in liver cancer (8.36 +0.22)Adaptimmune Therapeutics presented data from its Phase 1 trial with SPEAR T-cells targeting AFP at the virtual International Liver Congress. One patient out of four dosed with 5 bln or more cells had a complete response, which was reported previously. The data also demonstrate an acceptable safety profile in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Top-line data presented include:One patient had a complete response and also demonstrated a sustained reduction in serum AFP. This patient experienced disease progression, having developed new lesions at Week 32.Overall, nine patients have been treated as of the data cutoff. Of those:Four patients have been treated with ~5 bln or more transduced cells (three in Cohort 3 and one in the expansion phase): 1 patient with the complete response, 1 with stable disease (SD), and 2 had progressive disease (PD).Five patients were previously treated in the first two dose cohorts with doses of 100 mln and 1 bln transduced cells, respectively, and all patients had best responses of SD.ADP-A2AFP SPEAR T-cells were associated with an acceptable safety profile with no evidence of significant T-cell related hepatotoxicity and no protocol-defined dose limiting toxicities. Evidence of dose-dependent persistence of ADP-A2AFP SPEAR T-cells post-infusion.

The study demonstrated statistically significant improvement in overall survival for Menkes disease subjects who received early treatment (ET) with CUTX-101, compared to an untreated historical control (HC) cohort, with a nearly 80% reduction in the risk of death (Hazard Ratio = 0.21, p<0.0001). Median survival for the ET cohort was 14.8 years (177.1 months) compared to 1.3 years (15.9 months) for the untreated HC cohort.Based on the criteria outlined in the SAP to ensure the two cohorts were comparable, 31 Menkes disease patients who received ET with CUTX-101 and 18 HC Menkes disease patients were included in the primary efficacy analysis. The primary endpoint of overall survival was met. "With no currently approved [FDA] treatments, Menkes disease is a serious condition with a significant unmet medical need," said Lung S. Yam, M.D., Ph.D., President and CEO of Cyprium.Rolling submission of a NDA for CUTX-101 is on track to begin in Q4 of 2020.The top-line primary efficacy data and other relevant briefing materials will be presented to the FDA at a pre-NDA meeting scheduled for later in the current quarter. Other pre-specified secondary and sensitivity analyses will be included in the NDA submission.08:35WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: +15.10.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.6%) and Russell 2000 (+0.3%) performed slightly better, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.3% after setting an all-time high earlier in the session.Financial stocks were among today's biggest winners, benefiting from some curve-steepening activity after Fed Chair Powell outlined a shift towards an average inflation target. Under the new framework, the Fed would allow PCE inflation to run moderately beyond 2.0% over time to make up for years when it ran below 2.0%.From a sector perspective, the S&P 500 financials sector finished atop the standings with a 1.7% gain, followed by real estate (+1.4%), health care (+0.8%), and consumer staples (+0.6%). The communication services (-1.3%), consumer discretionary (-0.7%), and materials (-0.2%) sectors were the lone holdouts.Other positive factors today included reports that Microsoft (MSFT 226.58, +5.43, +2.5%) and Walmart (WMT 136.63, +5.93, +4.5%) are teaming up to possibly acquire TikTok US, and Abbott Labs (ABT 111.29, +8.10, +7.9%) receiving emergency use authorization from the FDA for its $5.00, 15-minute COVID-19 antigen test.Mega-cap growth stocks had a relatively weak outing today after an incredibly strong performance yesterday. Microsoft was an exception, of course, and so was Tesla (TSLA 2238.75, +85.58, +4.0%).As an aside, Senate Majority Leader McConnell (R-KY) reportedly said stimulus talks remained at a stalemate, which may have been a contributing factor in the market's brief dip into negative territory around 1:00 p.m. ET. The market, however, swiftly rebounded into positive territory.Recapping the moves in the Treasury market, the 2-yr yield finished flat at 0.16%, while the 10-yr yield increased six basis points to 0.75% as investors sold longer-dated bonds following Fed Chair Powell's speech. The U.S. Dollar Index was little changed at 93.03. WTI crude futures declined 0.8%, or $0.36, to $43.03/bbl.Reviewing Thursday's economic data:Initial jobless claims for the week ending August 22 were roughly in-line with expectations, decreasing by 98,000 to 1.006 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.000 million). Continuing claims for the week ending August 15 decreased by 223,000 to 14.535 million. The key takeaway from the report is that the labor market, while recovering, is still fractured in a big way that is not conducive for strong and sustained economic growth.The second estimate for Q2 GDP showed output decreased at an annualized rate of 31.7% (Briefing.com consensus -32.9%) versus the advance estimate of -32.9%. The GDP price index was down 2.0% (Briefing.com consensus -1.8%) versus the advance estimate of -1.8%.The key takeaway from the report is that the upward revision doesn't change the fact that the COVID crisis triggered the biggest downturn for the U.S. economy on record.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Personal Income and Spending report for July, the final Univ. of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for August, and Wholesale Inventories for July on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +29.6% YTDS&P 500 +7.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -0.2% YTDRussell 2000 -6.2% YTD16:20KMI Kinder Morgan announces commercial in-service of final Movable Modular Liquefaction unit at Elba Island Liquefaction facility (13.86 +0.13)The Elba Liquefaction Company, a joint venture between Kinder Morgan and EIG Global Energy Partners, announced today the commercial in-service of Unit 7, the last of 10 Movable Modular Liquefaction units of the approx. $2 bln Elba Liquefaction project.

Walmart is approaching the $400 billion market capitalization, which would put it an exclusive club with Tesla (TSLA 2249.20, +10.45, +0.4%), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 152.78, -0.21, -0.1%), and Taiwan Semi (TSM 80.35, -0.24, -0.3%).Elsewhere, there are subtle signs of caution. The 10-yr yield is down three basis points to 0.72% amid an uptick in buying interest, gold futures are up 2.4% to $1970.00 amid a weaker dollar (92.32, -0.68, -0.7%), and the CBOE Volatility Index is up 1.6% to 24.86 but it was up as much as 7.5% earlier.Reviewing today's economic data:Personal income increased 0.4% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -0.2%), which was much better than expected, and personal spending rose 1.9% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +1.5%), which was also much better than expected. The PCE Price Index and core-PCE Price Index both increased 0.3% m/m and were weaker than expected increases of 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively. That left the PCE Price Index up 1.0% yr/yr, versus 0.9% in June, and the core PCE Price Index up 1.3% yr/yr, versus 1.1% in June.The key takeaway from the report is that the income gain was driven by an increase in compensation (+1.3% m/m), which more than offset a 1.7% m/m decrease in personal current transfer receipts. In other words, the income gain was driven by people returning to work as the economy reopened.The preliminary University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for August ticked up to 72.8 (Briefing.com consensus 70.5) from the final reading of 72.5 for July.The key takeaway from the report is that there was little overall change from the preceding period. The University of Michigan provided a table showing consumer expectations by political affiliation, which showed a stark difference in expectations among those who identify as Republican (97.4) and Democrat (45.0). Expectations of respondents identifying as Independent were essentially in the middle (66.7).The Chicago PMI for August decreased to 51.2 from 51.9 in July.Wholesale inventories decreased 0.1% in July following a revised 1.3% decline in June (from -1.4%).12:22SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (66) outpacing new lows (10) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ABT, AKAM, ANSS, ARCB, ARNA, BKI, BLDR, BMCH, CHDN, CHWY, CMG, COST, CRBP, CRWD, CSIQ, CSTL, CTAS, DELL, DY, EGAN, ENPH, EPAM, EW, EXPD, FCX, FDX, FIZZ, FLWS, FSLR, HIBB, HUBS, IAA, IIPR, JOE, KNSL, KURA, LSTR, MA, MMSI, MRTX, NOW, NVDA, ODFL, RH, ROKU, RUN, RYTM, SCCO, SILK, SPLK, SWAV, TENB, TGTX, TNDM, TSLA, V, VEEV, VICR, VRNS, VSLR, WDAY, WMT, YUMC, Z, ZM, ZSStocks that traded to 52 week lows: ADES, AERI, ASC, CVIAQ, DNRCQ, DSSI, SR, STNG, TLRDQ, VALPQThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: CWCOETFs that traded to 52 week highs: BKF, ENZL, FDN, FXA, GXC, IGV, IHI, IYK, IYM, PBD, PBW, SKYY, TAN, URA, XLB, XLK, XLP12:04XLY Sector Briefing: Consumer Discretionary (150.35 +0.80)The heavily weighted consumer discretionary sector (+0.5%) is among today's outperformers, extending this week's gain to 3.1%. The influential sector has rallied 9.2% in August, trailing only technology (+0.8%; +11.2% month-to-date) and communication services (+0.3%; +15.5% month-to-date) on the August leaderboard.The discretionary sector owes its outperformance to gains in about 2/3 of its components. Ulta (ULTA 237.39, +13.44, +6.0%) is the best performer after beating Q2 EPS estimates on light revenue while casino and cruise stocks also appear among the leaders.Notable movers:Ulta (ULTA 237.39, +13.44, +6.0%): leading performer, approached its June high after beating Q2 earnings estimates on light revenue.

Also, as previously disclosed, the company conducted its own review and implemented remedial and improvement measures based upon this review, including replacement of certain employees and enhancements of policies and procedures in China. The company cooperated with the SEC and DOJ and has now reached separate resolutions with each of them. On August 28, the SEC accepted the Offer of Settlement and issued an administrative order finding that the company violated the books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA. In addition, on August 28, the company and DOJ separately entered into a court-approved deferred prosecution agreement (DPA), under which DOJ deferred criminal prosecution of the company for a period of three years related to a conspiracy to violate the books and records provisions of the FCPA. Among other things, the company is required to undertake compliance self-reporting obligations for the three-year term of the respective agreements with the SEC and DOJ. If the company remains in compliance with the DPA during its three-year term, the deferred charge against the company will be dismissed with prejudice. In addition, the company agreed to pay the SEC and DOJ aggregate penalties, disgorgement, and prejudgment interest of approx. $123 mln. The company previously recognized an estimated aggregate accrued liability for these matters of approx. $123 mln, which has been recognized in other current liabilities within its condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2020. Accordingly, there will not be any additional impact on the company's results of operations.10:41TALKX Market Briefing: Growth stocks out front again (along with the VIX)Any performance edge cyclical/value stocks might have had early has faded, as they are now looking up at growth stocks once again. This disparity is evident in the major indices, as the Russell 2000 (+0.5%) and Nasdaq Composite (+0.4%) are outlegging the S&P 500 (+0.1%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%).The larger takeaway, though, is that sellers have been unable to pack any real punch so far, as each of the major indices is in positive territory.The leadership of the mega-cap growth stocks, the fear of missing out on further gains, and the understanding that the Fed isn't going to get in the way of things soon with a rate hike, have been underpinning factors for the broader market.The latter point notwithstanding, one can detect the emergence of some pullback angst in the outperformance of the CBOE Volatility Index (25.80, +1.33, +5.4%) and the renewed buying interest in the Treasury market where gains are being logged across the curve. Currently, the 10-yr note yield is down four basis points to 0.71% after scraping 0.78% in the overnight trade.Once again, the S&P 500 information technology sector (+0.6%) sits atop the performance board in a generally mixed market. The weakest area thus far is the real estate sector (-0.6%).10:33ADAP Adaptimmune Therapeutics announces presentation of "promising" data from Phase 1 trial with ADP-A2AFP in liver cancer (8.36 +0.22)Adaptimmune Therapeutics presented data from its Phase 1 trial with SPEAR T-cells targeting AFP at the virtual International Liver Congress. One patient out of four dosed with 5 bln or more cells had a complete response, which was reported previously. The data also demonstrate an acceptable safety profile in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Top-line data presented include:One patient had a complete response and also demonstrated a sustained reduction in serum AFP. This patient experienced disease progression, having developed new lesions at Week 32.Overall, nine patients have been treated as of the data cutoff. Of those:Four patients have been treated with ~5 bln or more transduced cells (three in Cohort 3 and one in the expansion phase): 1 patient with the complete response, 1 with stable disease (SD), and 2 had progressive disease (PD).Five patients were previously treated in the first two dose cohorts with doses of 100 mln and 1 bln transduced cells, respectively, and all patients had best responses of SD.ADP-A2AFP SPEAR T-cells were associated with an acceptable safety profile with no evidence of significant T-cell related hepatotoxicity and no protocol-defined dose limiting toxicities. Evidence of dose-dependent persistence of ADP-A2AFP SPEAR T-cells post-infusion. Further translational evaluation is ongoing to understand indicators of response.10:33XLK Sector Briefing: Technology (122.91 +0.81)The top-weighted technology sector (+0.8%) started today's session in the lead, making for a continuation of this week's outperformance. The sector has rallied 4.3% since last Friday and it is on track to gain 11.2% for the month, which puts the group ahead of the remaining ten sectors on the August leaderboard.Today's outperformance is owed to another strong showing from the largest sector components by weight. Apple (AAPL 502.59, +2.55, +0.5%), Microsoft (MSFT 229.73, +3.15, +1.4%), Visa (V 213.46, +2.43, +1.2%), MasterCard (MA 359.33, +3.33, +0.9%), and NVIDIA (NVDA 514.44, +9.31, +1.8%) are up between 0.5% and 1.6%.Notable movers:HP (HPQ 20.10, +1.40, +7.5%): best performer in the sector, rallying to its highest level since early March after beating Q3 expectations and issuing better than expected guidance. Cowen raised its price target for the stock to $20 from $18. Western Digital (WDC 36.60, +1.36, +3.9%): extending its rebound from a five-month low.

The study demonstrated statistically significant improvement in overall survival for Menkes disease subjects who received early treatment (ET) with CUTX-101, compared to an untreated historical control (HC) cohort, with a nearly 80% reduction in the risk of death (Hazard Ratio = 0.21, p<0.0001). Median survival for the ET cohort was 14.8 years (177.1 months) compared to 1.3 years (15.9 months) for the untreated HC cohort.Based on the criteria outlined in the SAP to ensure the two cohorts were comparable, 31 Menkes disease patients who received ET with CUTX-101 and 18 HC Menkes disease patients were included in the primary efficacy analysis. The primary endpoint of overall survival was met. "With no currently approved [FDA] treatments, Menkes disease is a serious condition with a significant unmet medical need," said Lung S. Yam, M.D., Ph.D., President and CEO of Cyprium.Rolling submission of a NDA for CUTX-101 is on track to begin in Q4 of 2020.The top-line primary efficacy data and other relevant briefing materials will be presented to the FDA at a pre-NDA meeting scheduled for later in the current quarter.

In Asia, the divergence between Japan and China continued with the Shanghai rising 1.6%, while the Nikkei sank 1.4%. The biggest news within the region was the announcement by Japan's Prime Minister Abe that he would resign due to health reasons. This caused the yen to spike higher and equities to fall. The Shanghai started out lower, but buyers stepped in after the first hour. The bid did not relinquish as the Chinese benchmark closed at the high of the day.In Europe, the major bourses are trading modestly lower. Weaker than expected German Consumer Confidence soured sentiment early on and the DAX has failed to recover. Financials are among the bright spots with Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank trading 2-3% higher.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.6%) and Russell 2000 (+0.3%) performed slightly better, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.3% after setting an all-time high earlier in the session.Financial stocks were among today's biggest winners, benefiting from some curve-steepening activity after Fed Chair Powell outlined a shift towards an average inflation target. Under the new framework, the Fed would allow PCE inflation to run moderately beyond 2.0% over time to make up for years when it ran below 2.0%.From a sector perspective, the S&P 500 financials sector finished atop the standings with a 1.7% gain, followed by real estate (+1.4%), health care (+0.8%), and consumer staples (+0.6%). The communication services (-1.3%), consumer discretionary (-0.7%), and materials (-0.2%) sectors were the lone holdouts.Other positive factors today included reports that Microsoft (MSFT 226.58, +5.43, +2.5%) and Walmart (WMT 136.63, +5.93, +4.5%) are teaming up to possibly acquire TikTok US, and Abbott Labs (ABT 111.29, +8.10, +7.9%) receiving emergency use authorization from the FDA for its $5.00, 15-minute COVID-19 antigen test.Mega-cap growth stocks had a relatively weak outing today after an incredibly strong performance yesterday. Microsoft was an exception, of course, and so was Tesla (TSLA 2238.75, +85.58, +4.0%).As an aside, Senate Majority Leader McConnell (R-KY) reportedly said stimulus talks remained at a stalemate, which may have been a contributing factor in the market's brief dip into negative territory around 1:00 p.m. ET. The market, however, swiftly rebounded into positive territory.Recapping the moves in the Treasury market, the 2-yr yield finished flat at 0.16%, while the 10-yr yield increased six basis points to 0.75% as investors sold longer-dated bonds following Fed Chair Powell's speech. The U.S. Dollar Index was little changed at 93.03. WTI crude futures declined 0.8%, or $0.36, to $43.03/bbl.Reviewing Thursday's economic data:Initial jobless claims for the week ending August 22 were roughly in-line with expectations, decreasing by 98,000 to 1.006 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.000 million). Continuing claims for the week ending August 15 decreased by 223,000 to 14.535 million. The key takeaway from the report is that the labor market, while recovering, is still fractured in a big way that is not conducive for strong and sustained economic growth.The second estimate for Q2 GDP showed output decreased at an annualized rate of 31.7% (Briefing.com consensus -32.9%) versus the advance estimate of -32.9%. The GDP price index was down 2.0% (Briefing.com consensus -1.8%) versus the advance estimate of -1.8%.The key takeaway from the report is that the upward revision doesn't change the fact that the COVID crisis triggered the biggest downturn for the U.S. economy on record.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Personal Income and Spending report for July, the final Univ. of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for August, and Wholesale Inventories for July on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +29.6% YTDS&P 500 +7.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -0.2% YTDRussell 2000 -6.2% YTD16:20KMI Kinder Morgan announces commercial in-service of final Movable Modular Liquefaction unit at Elba Island Liquefaction facility (13.86 +0.13)The Elba Liquefaction Company, a joint venture between Kinder Morgan and EIG Global Energy Partners, announced today the commercial in-service of Unit 7, the last of 10 Movable Modular Liquefaction units of the approx. $2 bln Elba Liquefaction project.

SENATOR HAWLEY DEMANDS MICROSOFT SEVER ALL TIES TO BYTEDANCE, CCP IN POTENTIAL TIKTOK ACQUISITIONStates News ServiceAugust 5, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1045 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Missouri Senator Josh Hawley:Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent a letter to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella demanding that TikTok sever any and all ties to ByteDance and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in any potential acquisition by Microsoft. Senator Hawley writes that there have been a number of recent conflicting reports about Microsoft's plans and it is not clear whether the app will include vulnerabilities that allow the CCP to access American users' data."It is not clear whether Microsoft is moving toward a partnership with ByteDance to continue offering the app in the United States, or whether Microsoft will be taking full and independent control of the app and its data," writes Senator Hawley."Let me be clear: Any resolution of the TikTok investigation that fails to sever all links between TikTok and potential proxies for the Chinese Communist Party, including but not limited to ByteDance, is unacceptable."Senator Hawley requests Microsoft explain what steps they plan to take to ensure the app is not covertly sending user data to Chinese stakeholders, how they anticipate using user data, and make the identities of any co-investors known to Congress to conduct oversight of the deal.Read the full letter here or below.August 5, 2020Satya NadellaCEOMicrosoft CorporationOne Microsoft WayRedmond, WA 98052Dear Mr. Nadella:Over the last few days, there have been a number of conflicting reports in the press about how exactly Microsoft hopes to take control of the popular TikTok app.To name just a few examples: The New York Times reported on July 31 that "non-Chinese investors like Sequoia Capital, SoftBank and General Atlantic could purchase a majority stake in the app from ByteDance."[1] An August 2 post on the Official Microsoft Blog stated that current proposals "would involve a purchase of the TikTok service in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand and would result in Microsoft owning and operating TikTok in these markets" and noted that "Microsoft may invite other American investors to participate on a minority basis in this purchase."[2] Protocol reported on August 3 that your company is seeking a deal that would "cut[] off all ties between Bytedance, TikTok's Chinese parent company, and the app itself."[3] And a ByteDance internal employee letter circulated on the same day stated that "CFIUS determined that ByteDance must fully divest TikTok's US operations" and that ByteDance has "initiated preliminary discussions with a tech company to help clear the way for [ByteDance] to continue offering the TikTok app in the U.S."[4]Based on these reports, it is not clear whether Microsoft is moving toward a partnership with ByteDance to continue offering the app in the United States, or whether Microsoft will be taking full and independent control of the app and its data. It is not clear whether the code Microsoft plans to offer in the United States might include potential vulnerabilities that would allow the Chinese government continued access to U.S. users' data subsequent to any divestment. It is not clear whether the new entity's operations will be run by former Bytedance engineers who answer to the Chinese government. It is not even clear whether the Chinese Communist Party and proxies like Bytedance will be allowed to profit from the final settlement of this inquiry.Let me be clear: Any resolution of the TikTok investigation that fails to sever all links between TikTok and potential proxies for the Chinese Communist Party, including but not limited to ByteDance, is unacceptable.I have a number of questions about the proposed details of such an ownership transfer that will inform my view as to whether any acceptable divestment of TikTok's assets to Microsoft is even possible:If there are co-investors, what steps will Microsoft take to ensure that such partners' interests will not conflict with Microsoft's efforts to wall off TikTok from Chinese influence? When will Microsoft disclose the identities of these co-investors, and will said investors make themselves available to Congress so that we can conduct appropriate oversight of this deal?In the short term, what steps will Microsoft take to review the TikTok app code to ensure that the app is not sending user data, overtly or covertly, to Chinese stakeholders?What connection aside from branding will the American version of TikTok have with the Chinese version? Will the users of one of the two applications have access to videos from the other? If so, will popular Chinese TikTok videos, potentially promoted by the Chinese Communist Party itself, be promoted to U.S. users?Assuming all U.S. user data will be stored on U.S. soil, who will have access to this data? Will ByteDance's technical team, or other engineers potentially affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party, be involved with transferring user data over to your company or in the company's ongoing operations after such transfer? If so, how can Microsoft possibly ensure that backdoors are not being implemented behind the scenes on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party?How does Microsoft anticipate using TikTok user data? Does Microsoft plan a greater emphasis in the future on consumer advertising? What steps will Microsoft take to ensure that the underage userbase of this application is not exploited?What steps will Microsoft take to ensure that no TikTok user data or inferences and analytics derived from such data are transferred, whether intentionally or intentionally, to or through Microsoft's large-scale data operations in China?[5] If Microsoft plans on training its artificial intelligence systems on TikTok data, how can any such separation even be possible?Given the Chinese Communist Party's past efforts to censor content shared on TikTok, will Microsoft develop new terms of service regarding content moderation? If so, how does Microsoft plan to avoid the concerns about political censorship that have plagued other American social media applications?Will Bytedance be allowed to profit from the proposed acquisition?Will the United States government receive an appropriate share of the acquisition cost?Thank you for your attention to these matters.Sincerely,Josh HawleyU.S. SenatorLoad-Date: August 5, 2020End of Document

National Security Adviser Warns of Russia, China Interference in 2020 U.S. Election: 'We're Not Going to Put Up With It'Newsweek.comAugust 9, 2020 Sunday 3:29 PM ESTCopyright © 2020 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 654 wordsByline: Benjamin FearnowHighlight: National Security Adviser Robert O' Brien said China's efforts to interfere with the 2020 election are focused on ensuring that President Donald Trump does not win re-election on November 3.BodyWhite House National Security Adviser Robert O' Brien said China's efforts to interfere with the 2020 election are focused on ensuring that President Donald Trump does not win re-election on November 3.O'Brien confirmed Sunday that U.S. intelligence believes both the Chinese and Russian governments are actively attempting to meddle in the upcoming elections. A July 24 report from American intelligence agencies warned that several foreign actors including Iran are trying to access candidates' private communications and voting infrastructure on both the state and federal levels.Trump's national security adviser cautioned that China is waging perhaps the largest cyber war against the U.S. elections and their primary goal is see Trump lose. O'Brien cited Trump's ongoing sanctions and tit-for-tat trade war with the world's second-largest economy as Beijing's motive."We've got our cyber teams in place, DHS is working very hard to track down those malign actors," O'Brien said Sunday on CBS' Face the Nation. "We know it's China, we know it's Russia, we know it's Iran and they're trying to access secretary of state websites and collect data on Americans and engage in influence operations, whether it's on TikTok or Twitter or in other spaces.""It's not just Russia, the Chinese don't want the president re-elected, he's been tougher on China than any president in history," O'Brien added.Last Friday, the Director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, William Evanina, issued a statement saying the Kremlin is actively working to derail the presidential campaign of former Vice President Joe Biden. A U.S. State Department report described how Russia is using "disinformation and propaganda" techniques in order to "create and amplify false narratives" about American political candidates online.Evanina told the Associated Press Friday it's not far-fetched Chinese and Russian governments favor different candidates, in this case the former being in favor of Biden and the latter assisting Trump."Many foreign actors have a preference for who wins the election, which they express through a range of overt and private statements; covert influence efforts are rarer," Evanina said. "We are primarily concerned about the ongoing and potential activity by China, Russia and Iran."O'Brien confirmed the reports Sunday and said U.S. counterintelligence and Department of Homeland Security agents are pro-actively working to prevent any cyber attacks or interference from foreign actors."We're standing up for the first time against the Chinese Communist Party and protecting Americans, protecting our IP [intellectual property], protecting our economy, protecting our [coronavirus] vaccine data. There are a lot of people around the world who aren't happy with America because they don't share our values and that shouldn't be a surprise to anybody."O'Brien also said during his Face the Nation interview: "China, like Russia, like Iran, have engaged in cyber-attacks and phishing and that sort of thing with respect to our election infrastructure, with respect to websites and that sort of thing. We're aware of it and we're taking steps to counter it. Whether it's China or Russia or Iran, we're not going to put up with it. And there will be severe consequences with any country that attempts to interfere with our free and fair elections."Newsweek reached out to the State Department, the White House and the Chinese embassy in Washington for additional remarks Sunday afternoon.China and Russia may have disagreement over their favored U.S. presidential candidate, but last month their respective foreign ministers spoke on a telephone call in which they claimed America has "lost its mind." Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov discussed how they believe the Trump administration is trying to revert relationships back to a "Cold War mentality."Link to ImageGraphic robert obrien donald trump chinaALEX WONG / Staff/Getty ImagesWhite House National Security Adviser Robert O' Brien said China's efforts to interfere with the 2020 election are focused on ensuring President Donald Trump is does not win re-election on November 3.Load-Date: August 9, 2020End of Document

China, Iran seek to undermine Trump; Russia is anti-Biden, intelligence expert saysUPIAugust 7, 2020 Friday 5:54 PM ESTCopyright 2020 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 547 wordsByline: DANIELLE HAYNESDateline: Aug. 7 BodyChina and Iran are working to undermine President Donald Trump's chances of re-election, while Russia prefers former Vice President Joe Biden loses in November, the top U.S. elections intelligence official said Friday.William Evanina, director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, said the foreign states are attempting to influence the 2020 presidential election to work in their respective favors. He warned that not only are the countries trying to sway Americans' opinions, but they also seek to steal sensitive data, call into question the integrity of the election system and increase discord in society."We assess that China prefers that President Trump -- whom Beijing sees as unpredictable -- does not win re-election," he said.Evanina said the country has increased its efforts to influence the election and policy. Among other policy topics, the Chinese government has grown increasingly critical of the United States' handling of the COVID-19 pandemic."It has harshly criticized the administration's statements and actions on Hong Kong, TikTok, the legal status of the South China Sea and China's efforts to dominate the 5G market," he said. "Beijing recognizes that all of these efforts might affect the presidential race.Tensions increased further this week between Beijing and Washington, D.C., after Trump signed an executive order barring Chinese social media app TikTok from doing business with firms in the United States.Yang Jiechi, a top member of the Communist Party of China's Central Committee and director of its Office of Foreign Affairs, criticized the state of U.S.-China relations in a statement Friday."We urge U.S. decision makers to respect facts of history, recognize the trend of the times, heed the visionary calls in the U.S., and listen to the voice of the international community," he wrote.Meanwhile, Iran is similarly hoping to see Trump fail in the 2020 election, in part because of the pressure his administration has put on the country in hopes of a regime change, Evanina said. He said the country seeks to undermine democratic institutions and divide the country."Iran's efforts along these lines probably will focus on online influence, such as spreading disinformation on social media and recirculating anti-U.S. content," he said.Working in favor of Trump is Russia, which Evanina said views Biden negatively due to the Obama administration's stance on Ukraine and support of the Russian opposition."For example, pro-Russia Ukrainian parliamentarian Andriy Derkach is spreading claims about corruption -- including through publicizing leaked phone calls -- to undermine former Vice President Biden's candidacy and the Democratic Party. Some Kremlin-linked actors are also seeking to boost President Trump's candidacy on social media and Russian television," Evanina said.Special counsel Robert Mueller determined last year that Russia worked to influence the 2016 election in favor of Trump, mostly through an online and social media campaign.Evanina said the intelligence community is working to combat both cyber and other outside influence efforts in the 2020 election."Our election should be our own. Foreign efforts to influence or interfere with our elections are a direct threat to the fabric of our democracy."Load-Date: August 7, 2020End of Document

China warns it won't allow 'looting' of TikTokCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 4, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 424 wordsBody(Bloomberg) -- The Chinese government will not accept a purchase of TikTok's U.S. operations by Microsoft Corp. and it could take action against Washington if a sale is forced, the Beijing-backed China Daily newspaper said in its Tuesday editorial.It is the most vigorous defense of ByteDance Ltd. and its viral video phenomenon by Beijing to date. President Donald Trump threatened to ban the app unless an agreement is reached to sell TikTok's U.S. business to Microsoft or another U.S. entity by September 15. That process amounts to officially sanctioned theft, the Communist Party spokesman wrote, echoing prominent Beijing-backed media, such as the Global Times."China will not accept in any way the 'theft' of a Chinese technology company, and has many ways to respond if the Administration carries out its looting plan," he said, without specifying options. "Now that competitiveness depends on the ability to collect and use data, it is a choice of submission or deadly combat in technology."ByteDance has become the world's largest startup thanks to the phenomenal success of TikTok, which U.S. congressmen say pose a threat to national security in collecting data. Trump now has the power to deal a big blow to ByteDance's most cherished asset by including TikTok on the U.S. list of entities, forcing U.S. companies like Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google to eliminate service from their app stores.America's repression has divided many into the industry: some denounce betrayal of values such as freedom of expression and capitalism, while others advocate doing whatever it takes to subdue a geopolitical rivalry and its vital technology industry.Trump repeatedly insisted Monday that any sale of TikTok's U.S. operations would have to include a significant payment to the United States. That was "open robbery," tweeted Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the Global Times, a tabloid led by People's Daily, the party's main publication.It is unclear what regulatory measures China might take. The Global Times wrote that China has a "limited ability" to protect its businesses, as the United States still enjoys technological superiority. China's Foreign Ministry has previously criticized Washington for employing double standards in trying to ban TikTok. But when asked about the latest developments at a regular press conference on Monday, a spokesman said, "We also didn't comment on the specific business activity of relevant companies."Original Note:China Won't Allow a TikTok 'Smash and Grab,' State Media Warns©2020 Bloomberg L.P.Load-Date: August 5, 2020End of Document

The study demonstrated statistically significant improvement in overall survival for Menkes disease subjects who received early treatment (ET) with CUTX-101, compared to an untreated historical control (HC) cohort, with a nearly 80% reduction in the risk of death (Hazard Ratio = 0.21, p<0.0001). Median survival for the ET cohort was 14.8 years (177.1 months) compared to 1.3 years (15.9 months) for the untreated HC cohort.Based on the criteria outlined in the SAP to ensure the two cohorts were comparable, 31 Menkes disease patients who received ET with CUTX-101 and 18 HC Menkes disease patients were included in the primary efficacy analysis. The primary endpoint of overall survival was met. "With no currently approved [FDA] treatments, Menkes disease is a serious condition with a significant unmet medical need," said Lung S. Yam, M.D., Ph.D., President and CEO of Cyprium.Rolling submission of a NDA for CUTX-101 is on track to begin in Q4 of 2020.The top-line primary efficacy data and other relevant briefing materials will be presented to the FDA at a pre-NDA meeting scheduled for later in the current quarter. Other pre-specified secondary and sensitivity analyses will be included in the NDA submission.08:35WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: +15.10.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.6%) and Russell 2000 (+0.3%) performed slightly better, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.3% after setting an all-time high earlier in the session.Financial stocks were among today's biggest winners, benefiting from some curve-steepening activity after Fed Chair Powell outlined a shift towards an average inflation target. Under the new framework, the Fed would allow PCE inflation to run moderately beyond 2.0% over time to make up for years when it ran below 2.0%.From a sector perspective, the S&P 500 financials sector finished atop the standings with a 1.7% gain, followed by real estate (+1.4%), health care (+0.8%), and consumer staples (+0.6%). The communication services (-1.3%), consumer discretionary (-0.7%), and materials (-0.2%) sectors were the lone holdouts.Other positive factors today included reports that Microsoft (MSFT 226.58, +5.43, +2.5%) and Walmart (WMT 136.63, +5.93, +4.5%) are teaming up to possibly acquire TikTok US, and Abbott Labs (ABT 111.29, +8.10, +7.9%) receiving emergency use authorization from the FDA for its $5.00, 15-minute COVID-19 antigen test.Mega-cap growth stocks had a relatively weak outing today after an incredibly strong performance yesterday. Microsoft was an exception, of course, and so was Tesla (TSLA 2238.75, +85.58, +4.0%).As an aside, Senate Majority Leader McConnell (R-KY) reportedly said stimulus talks remained at a stalemate, which may have been a contributing factor in the market's brief dip into negative territory around 1:00 p.m. ET. The market, however, swiftly rebounded into positive territory.Recapping the moves in the Treasury market, the 2-yr yield finished flat at 0.16%, while the 10-yr yield increased six basis points to 0.75% as investors sold longer-dated bonds following Fed Chair Powell's speech.

The key takeaway from the report is that the labor market, while recovering, is still fractured in a big way that is not conducive for strong and sustained economic growth.The second estimate for Q2 GDP showed output decreased at an annualized rate of 31.7% (Briefing.com consensus -32.9%) versus the advance estimate of -32.9%. The GDP price index was down 2.0% (Briefing.com consensus -1.8%) versus the advance estimate of -1.8%.The key takeaway from the report is that the upward revision doesn't change the fact that the COVID crisis triggered the biggest downturn for the U.S. economy on record.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Personal Income and Spending report for July, the final Univ. of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for August, and Wholesale Inventories for July on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +29.6% YTDS&P 500 +7.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -0.2% YTDRussell 2000 -6.2% YTD16:20KMI Kinder Morgan announces commercial in-service of final Movable Modular Liquefaction unit at Elba Island Liquefaction facility (13.86 +0.13)The Elba Liquefaction Company, a joint venture between Kinder Morgan and EIG Global Energy Partners, announced today the commercial in-service of Unit 7, the last of 10 Movable Modular Liquefaction units of the approx. $2 bln Elba Liquefaction project.

The primary endpoint of overall survival was met. "With no currently approved [FDA] treatments, Menkes disease is a serious condition with a significant unmet medical need," said Lung S. Yam, M.D., Ph.D., President and CEO of Cyprium.Rolling submission of a NDA for CUTX-101 is on track to begin in Q4 of 2020.The top-line primary efficacy data and other relevant briefing materials will be presented to the FDA at a pre-NDA meeting scheduled for later in the current quarter. Other pre-specified secondary and sensitivity analyses will be included in the NDA submission.08:35WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: +15.10.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.6%) and Russell 2000 (+0.3%) performed slightly better, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.3% after setting an all-time high earlier in the session.Financial stocks were among today's biggest winners, benefiting from some curve-steepening activity after Fed Chair Powell outlined a shift towards an average inflation target. Under the new framework, the Fed would allow PCE inflation to run moderately beyond 2.0% over time to make up for years when it ran below 2.0%.From a sector perspective, the S&P 500 financials sector finished atop the standings with a 1.7% gain, followed by real estate (+1.4%), health care (+0.8%), and consumer staples (+0.6%). The communication services (-1.3%), consumer discretionary (-0.7%), and materials (-0.2%) sectors were the lone holdouts.Other positive factors today included reports that Microsoft (MSFT 226.58, +5.43, +2.5%) and Walmart (WMT 136.63, +5.93, +4.5%) are teaming up to possibly acquire TikTok US, and Abbott Labs (ABT 111.29, +8.10, +7.9%) receiving emergency use authorization from the FDA for its $5.00, 15-minute COVID-19 antigen test.Mega-cap growth stocks had a relatively weak outing today after an incredibly strong performance yesterday. Microsoft was an exception, of course, and so was Tesla (TSLA 2238.75, +85.58, +4.0%).As an aside, Senate Majority Leader McConnell (R-KY) reportedly said stimulus talks remained at a stalemate, which may have been a contributing factor in the market's brief dip into negative territory around 1:00 p.m. ET. The market, however, swiftly rebounded into positive territory.Recapping the moves in the Treasury market, the 2-yr yield finished flat at 0.16%, while the 10-yr yield increased six basis points to 0.75% as investors sold longer-dated bonds following Fed Chair Powell's speech.

Continuing claims for the week ending August 15 decreased by 223,000 to 14.535 million. The key takeaway from the report is that the labor market, while recovering, is still fractured in a big way that is not conducive for strong and sustained economic growth.The second estimate for Q2 GDP showed output decreased at an annualized rate of 31.7% (Briefing.com consensus -32.9%) versus the advance estimate of -32.9%. The GDP price index was down 2.0% (Briefing.com consensus -1.8%) versus the advance estimate of -1.8%.The key takeaway from the report is that the upward revision doesn't change the fact that the COVID crisis triggered the biggest downturn for the U.S. economy on record.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Personal Income and Spending report for July, the final Univ. of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for August, and Wholesale Inventories for July on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +29.6% YTDS&P 500 +7.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -0.2% YTDRussell 2000 -6.2% YTD16:20KMI Kinder Morgan announces commercial in-service of final Movable Modular Liquefaction unit at Elba Island Liquefaction facility (13.86 +0.13)The Elba Liquefaction Company, a joint venture between Kinder Morgan and EIG Global Energy Partners, announced today the commercial in-service of Unit 7, the last of 10 Movable Modular Liquefaction units of the approx. $2 bln Elba Liquefaction project.

This disparity is evident in the major indices, as the Russell 2000 (+0.5%) and Nasdaq Composite (+0.4%) are outlegging the S&P 500 (+0.1%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%).The larger takeaway, though, is that sellers have been unable to pack any real punch so far, as each of the major indices is in positive territory.The leadership of the mega-cap growth stocks, the fear of missing out on further gains, and the understanding that the Fed isn't going to get in the way of things soon with a rate hike, have been underpinning factors for the broader market.The latter point notwithstanding, one can detect the emergence of some pullback angst in the outperformance of the CBOE Volatility Index (25.80, +1.33, +5.4%) and the renewed buying interest in the Treasury market where gains are being logged across the curve. Currently, the 10-yr note yield is down four basis points to 0.71% after scraping 0.78% in the overnight trade.Once again, the S&P 500 information technology sector (+0.6%) sits atop the performance board in a generally mixed market. The weakest area thus far is the real estate sector (-0.6%).10:33ADAP Adaptimmune Therapeutics announces presentation of "promising" data from Phase 1 trial with ADP-A2AFP in liver cancer (8.36 +0.22)Adaptimmune Therapeutics presented data from its Phase 1 trial with SPEAR T-cells targeting AFP at the virtual International Liver Congress. One patient out of four dosed with 5 bln or more cells had a complete response, which was reported previously. The data also demonstrate an acceptable safety profile in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Top-line data presented include:One patient had a complete response and also demonstrated a sustained reduction in serum AFP. This patient experienced disease progression, having developed new lesions at Week 32.Overall, nine patients have been treated as of the data cutoff. Of those:Four patients have been treated with ~5 bln or more transduced cells (three in Cohort 3 and one in the expansion phase): 1 patient with the complete response, 1 with stable disease (SD), and 2 had progressive disease (PD).Five patients were previously treated in the first two dose cohorts with doses of 100 mln and 1 bln transduced cells, respectively, and all patients had best responses of SD.ADP-A2AFP SPEAR T-cells were associated with an acceptable safety profile with no evidence of significant T-cell related hepatotoxicity and no protocol-defined dose limiting toxicities. Evidence of dose-dependent persistence of ADP-A2AFP SPEAR T-cells post-infusion. Further translational evaluation is ongoing to understand indicators of response.10:33XLK Sector Briefing: Technology (122.91 +0.81)The top-weighted technology sector (+0.8%) started today's session in the lead, making for a continuation of this week's outperformance.

The study demonstrated statistically significant improvement in overall survival for Menkes disease subjects who received early treatment (ET) with CUTX-101, compared to an untreated historical control (HC) cohort, with a nearly 80% reduction in the risk of death (Hazard Ratio = 0.21, p<0.0001). Median survival for the ET cohort was 14.8 years (177.1 months) compared to 1.3 years (15.9 months) for the untreated HC cohort.Based on the criteria outlined in the SAP to ensure the two cohorts were comparable, 31 Menkes disease patients who received ET with CUTX-101 and 18 HC Menkes disease patients were included in the primary efficacy analysis. The primary endpoint of overall survival was met. "With no currently approved [FDA] treatments, Menkes disease is a serious condition with a significant unmet medical need," said Lung S. Yam, M.D., Ph.D., President and CEO of Cyprium.Rolling submission of a NDA for CUTX-101 is on track to begin in Q4 of 2020.The top-line primary efficacy data and other relevant briefing materials will be presented to the FDA at a pre-NDA meeting scheduled for later in the current quarter.

The bid did not relinquish as the Chinese benchmark closed at the high of the day.In Europe, the major bourses are trading modestly lower.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.6%) and Russell 2000 (+0.3%) performed slightly better, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.3% after setting an all-time high earlier in the session.Financial stocks were among today's biggest winners, benefiting from some curve-steepening activity after Fed Chair Powell outlined a shift towards an average inflation target. Under the new framework, the Fed would allow PCE inflation to run moderately beyond 2.0% over time to make up for years when it ran below 2.0%.From a sector perspective, the S&P 500 financials sector finished atop the standings with a 1.7% gain, followed by real estate (+1.4%), health care (+0.8%), and consumer staples (+0.6%). The communication services (-1.3%), consumer discretionary (-0.7%), and materials (-0.2%) sectors were the lone holdouts.Other positive factors today included reports that Microsoft (MSFT 226.58, +5.43, +2.5%) and Walmart (WMT 136.63, +5.93, +4.5%) are teaming up to possibly acquire TikTok US, and Abbott Labs (ABT 111.29, +8.10, +7.9%) receiving emergency use authorization from the FDA for its $5.00, 15-minute COVID-19 antigen test.Mega-cap growth stocks had a relatively weak outing today after an incredibly strong performance yesterday. Microsoft was an exception, of course, and so was Tesla (TSLA 2238.75, +85.58, +4.0%).As an aside, Senate Majority Leader McConnell (R-KY) reportedly said stimulus talks remained at a stalemate, which may have been a contributing factor in the market's brief dip into negative territory around 1:00 p.m. ET. The market, however, swiftly rebounded into positive territory.Recapping the moves in the Treasury market, the 2-yr yield finished flat at 0.16%, while the 10-yr yield increased six basis points to 0.75% as investors sold longer-dated bonds following Fed Chair Powell's speech. The U.S. Dollar Index was little changed at 93.03. WTI crude futures declined 0.8%, or $0.36, to $43.03/bbl.Reviewing Thursday's economic data:Initial jobless claims for the week ending August 22 were roughly in-line with expectations, decreasing by 98,000 to 1.006 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.000 million). Continuing claims for the week ending August 15 decreased by 223,000 to 14.535 million. The key takeaway from the report is that the labor market, while recovering, is still fractured in a big way that is not conducive for strong and sustained economic growth.The second estimate for Q2 GDP showed output decreased at an annualized rate of 31.7% (Briefing.com consensus -32.9%) versus the advance estimate of -32.9%. The GDP price index was down 2.0% (Briefing.com consensus -1.8%) versus the advance estimate of -1.8%.The key takeaway from the report is that the upward revision doesn't change the fact that the COVID crisis triggered the biggest downturn for the U.S. economy on record.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Personal Income and Spending report for July, the final Univ. of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for August, and Wholesale Inventories for July on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +29.6% YTDS&P 500 +7.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -0.2% YTDRussell 2000 -6.2% YTD16:20KMI Kinder Morgan announces commercial in-service of final Movable Modular Liquefaction unit at Elba Island Liquefaction facility (13.86 +0.13)The Elba Liquefaction Company, a joint venture between Kinder Morgan and EIG Global Energy Partners, announced today the commercial in-service of Unit 7, the last of 10 Movable Modular Liquefaction units of the approx. $2 bln Elba Liquefaction project.

China warns US and raises tension: we will not allow 'looting' of TikTokCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 4, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 400 wordsBodyThe Chinese government will not accept a acquisition of TikTok's U.S. operations by Microsoft and could take action against Washington if a sale is forced, Beijing-backed China Daily reported at its editorial Tuesday.It is ByteDance's most energetic defense and its viral video phenomenon by Beijing to date. U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to ban the app unless an agreement is reached to sell TikTok's U.S. business to Microsoft or another U.S. entity by September 15. That process amounts to officially sanctioned theft, the Communist Party spokesman wrote, echoing prominent Beijing-backed media, such as the Global Times."China will not accept in any way the 'theft' of a Chinese technology company, and has many ways to respond if the administration carries out its looting plan,"he said, without specifying options. "Now that competitiveness depends on the ability to collect and use data, it is a choice of submission or deadly combat in technology."ByteDance has become the world's largest startup thanks to the phenomenal success of TikTok, which U.S. congressmen say pose a threat to national security in collecting data. Trump now has the power to deal a big blow to ByteDance's most cherished asset by including TikTok on the US list of entities,forcing Us companies like Apple and Alphabet's Google to eliminate service from their app stores.America's repression has divided many into the industry: some denounce betrayal of values such as freedom of expression and capitalism, while others advocate doing whatever it takes to subdue a geopolitical rival and its vital technology industry.Trump repeatedly insisted Monday that any sale of TikTok's U.S. operations would have to include a significant payment to the United States. That was "open robbery," tweeted Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the Global Times, a tabloid led by People's Daily, the party's main publication.It is unclear what regulatory measures China might take. The Global Times wrote that China has a "limited ability" to protect its businesses, as the United States still enjoys technological superiority. China's Foreign Ministry has previously criticized Washington for employing double standards in trying to ban TikTok. But when asked about the latest developments at a regular press conference on Monday, a spokesman noted, "We also didn't comment on the specific business activity of relevant companies."Load-Date: August 5, 2020End of Document

There are all shades of comments, from effusive praise to disdain and, of course, some garden variety trolling. The replies can be a good place for users to try to get the attention of the President, who has been known to retweet many who mention him, as well as the attention of his tens of millions of followers. Now, researchers at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), a London-based think tank, say they have found pro-Chinese Communist Party (CCP) accounts spamming the replies of the President and other US officials about Covid-19 on Twitter. Accounts with usernames like @Dotard36639316, @alex75471129, and @susanblunt2020, all only set up in March of this year, tweeted at President Trump hundreds of times, often falsely claiming that America, not China, was the source of Covid-19. These accounts were among thousands identified by the researchers. Their report said the accounts were using Twitter to push talking points in favor of CCP, China's ruling party. In response, Twitter questioned the report and said it has seen an uptick in use from real Chinese-speaking users since the outbreak of Covid-19. Although the government in Beijing has been shown to be running fake accounts on the social network, it's also very possible many of the accounts spamming the president with pro-CCP messaging are real CCP supporters and sympathizers. The accounts' activity shows how the propaganda battle over who is responsible for the outbreak of Covid-19 is now playing out in the replies to tweets from lawmakers. The research also underscores how challenging it can be to determine who is behind what are often faceless accounts online --- a government, a misinformation group for hire, a concerned citizen, or someone with a different motive. These accounts, which sometimes tweeted in broken English, had almost no followers and were apparently more intent on getting the attention of Trump and his followers than building a mass audience. ISD said it identified the accounts by examining the followers of Chinese government officials. An account's short life on Twitter - and more than 180 replies to President Trump On April 3rd, the account @susanblunt2020 tweeted in response to President Trump: "It's very suspicious that there are so many cases in American (sic), only explanation is that America is the source." Another tweet from the same account on March 27th read, "Why did not tell us the virus started in [September] in the US? Why your politicians still blaming China? Why your media still saying China needs to pay for your not taking actions." In an apparent attempt to appear legitimate, the account @susanblunt2020 used a picture of an American blogger as its profile picture. The blogger, who CNN Business is not naming, said she did not know who was behind the account. Of the 238 tweets @sunsanblunt2020 sent in its short life on Twitter, more than 180 of them directly mentioned President Trump's Twitter username, according to data gathered in ISD's analysis and seen by CNN Business. Twitter suspended @Dotard36639316, @alex75471129, and @susanblunt2020 for breaking its rules on platform manipulation after CNN Business asked about them. The company would not say who was behind the accounts, if they were linked to each other, or where they were run from. Attribution of who is really behind accounts is normally only possible to determine through access to non-public information, such as IP and email addresses --- information normally only accessible to companies like Twitter and intelligence agencies. Twitter now publicly discloses a few times a year when it shuts down networks of accounts it determines are linked to nation-states. ISD told CNN Business it handed over details of almost 10,000 accounts to Twitter in July and that Twitter suspended 3,000 of them. A Twitter spokesperson told CNN Business that after ISD reported the accounts to the company, the social network asked account holders to provide additional information, like a phone number, in an effort to prove the account is not suspicious or spam. The Twitter spokesperson said some of the accounts ISD flagged were suspended for not responding to Twitter's request. While calling them "pro-Chinese Communist Party," ISD was careful not to claim the accounts they found were tied to the government in Beijing, but Twitter still said it had "strong concerns" about the methodology the group used to identify the approximately 10,000 accounts in the report. A Twitter spokesperson said ISD had flagged some real and legitimate users as suspicious in its research. ISD said data it had on about 1,100 of the suspended accounts showed 767 of them had mentioned @realDonaldTrump. The ISD released its findings Thursday in a joint report with the German Marshall Fund's Alliance for Securing Democracy. CNN has asked the government in Beijing for comment on the report. Tensions over identifying influence operations Twitter's comments on ISD's findings highlight an ongoing tension between Silicon Valley companies and independent researchers. Academics, think tanks, journalists and others now regularly publish findings based on opensource information that point to coordinated influence campaigns, often involving hundreds or thousands of fake social media accounts. Sometimes these outside findings feed into the work the social media platforms do in positively identifying such campaigns; other times these groups can be wrong. Chloe Colliver, who leads the digital research unit at ISD, said her team was careful not to make a determination on who was behind the accounts, or indeed if the accounts were linked, but instead focused on the accounts' behavior. "We hope this is part of a process where civic society and tech companies can constructively engage in order to confront the manipulation of tech platforms," she told CNN Business. According to Twitter and Facebook, however, there is no question that China has been involved in covert online campaign especially over the past year --- the type of operations involving trolls, bots, and fake accounts that Americans may associate more with Russia after its use of social media to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. In June, Twitter shut down 170,000 accounts it linked to Beijing which pushed deceptive narratives around Covid-19 and other topics. Renee DiResta, research manager at the Stanford Internet Observatory (SIO) who also analyzed the accounts taken down in June, said many of those that posted about Covid-19 throughout the spring had only been set up in late January. "Narratives around Covid," the SIO wrote in its analysis, "praise China's response to the virus while tweets also use the pandemic to antagonize the U.S. and Hong Kong activists." An ISD review of those accounts did not find a high amount of direct mentions of Trump's account. Responding to Twitter's takedown in June, Hua Chunying, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, said, "this is the perfect example of ideological prejudice, bias against China, blatant double standards, and the behavior to confuse right and wrong. What should be shut down is precisely the accounts that attack and smear China in an organized and coordinated manner." But it is not just covert operations. Researchers at the German Marshall Fund's Alliance for Securing Democracy who track information operations online have noted an uptick in China's diplomatic corps use of Western social media platforms over the past year as Beijing faced intense scrutiny because of its handling of Covid-19 and also protests in Hong Kong. A Chinese diplomat and Chinese Communist Party media promoted a false conspiracy theory that the US military brought the coronavirus to China. One US Army reservist who found herself at the center of the conspiracy theory and was falsely accused of starting the pandemic described to CNN Business in April how her life had been turned upside down. "Some foreign media and social platforms are fraught with lies and rumors against China," Chunying said in June. "In the dark and ugly world of disinformation, it is necessary for some people, including Chinese diplomats, to speak in a truthful, objective and impartial manner, like striking a match in the dark night to bring some light. Anyone who is not playing deaf and dumb will be able to see the truth." A blend of official spokespeople who apparently have no problem bending the truth, state-controlled media, and networks of covert social media accounts all help create a fog of misinformation that has become a reality of being online in 2020. TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Microsoft Moving Forward with TikTok Purchase After Trump ReprieveUSNEWS.comAugust 3, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 U.S. News & World Report All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; National News; Vol.; No.Length: 885 wordsByline: Claire HansenHighlight: Microsoft has confirmed that it was moving forward with negotiations to buy TikTok's U.S. services following an about-face by President Trump on a potential deal.BodyMicrosoft is moving forward with a bid to buy the U.S. operations of TikTok, the popular video-sharing social media app owned by Chinese tech company ByteDance, after President Donald Trump injected himself into a debate about whether the site compromises national security. Microsoft said in a statement Sunday evening that discussions with ByteDance over the potential purchase of the app's U.S. operations would continue following a conversation between Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Trump. The president has imposed a 45-day deadline for a potential deal, according to Reuters. [READ:Trump Floats Delaying November Election, Sows Discord on Mail-in Voting]The move represents an about-face for Trump and the deal, if completed, could escalate tensions between the U.S. and China. Late Friday evening, Trump said he would use executive authority to ban TikTok from the U.S. over concerns that the data collection practices on the Chinese-owned app posed a national security threat. But Microsoft's statement signals that he has changed his mind. "Microsoft appreciates the U.S. Government's and President Trump's personal involvement as it continues to develop strong security protections for the country," the company said in the statement. Wresting TikTok's U.S. operations from Chinese ownership would be a win for the Trump administration and would save the president from intervening in the controversy in a way that would alienate younger voters ahead of the November election. Microsoft said that the discussions would be finished by Sept. 15. In addition to the app's U.S. operations, a potential deal would also include the app's services in Canada, New Zealand and Australia. Microsoft's statement came after an eventful weekend that threw the future of the platform in the U.S. into doubt. ByteDance and Microsoft have been engaged in talks about the sale of the app's U.S. services for weeks, according to The Wall Street Journal. Those talks have also reportedly included Trump administration officials. Those discussions became public Friday through several media reports. Later that evening, Trump said he did not support Microsoft's bid and said he would ban the app. The announcement immediately sparked panic among users, leading to a frenzy of videos from TikTok creators -- some of whom have created livelihoods on the app -- urging their followers to connect with them on Instagram, YouTube and other platforms in case TikTok became inaccessible. India recently banned the app after a conflict on its border with China. TikTok collects data from users and utilizes a unique artificial intelligence algorithm to feed users videos it believes aligns with the users' interests and likes. Business and government leaders have expressed long-standing concerns about the fact that TikTok's Chinese parent company collects and controls so much data on users from the U.S. Some federal agencies have banned the app from employees' government-issued cellphones. Tik Tok has stressed that it does not share data with the Chinese government. The company pulled the app out of Hong Kong after the Chinese Communist Party imposed a controversial new security law there. Lawmakers and others, however, are worried that the company could be forced to hand over their data to the Chinese government. Trump changed his mind about a potential ban after urging from his advisers and some Rebpublican lawmakers, according to reports. Several lawmakers released statements praising the potential deal after Microsoft said it was moving forward with negotiations. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina and one of Trump's staunchest allies, called the news a "positive development." "Thank you President Trump for protecting American consumers from the Chinese Communist Party and bringing jobs back to the US. A win-win in the making," Graham said in a tweet. Microsoft, for its part, has promised to keep data from U.S. users within the country if it acquires the app. "Among other measures, Microsoft would ensure that all private data of TikTok's American users is transferred to and remains in the United States. To the extent that any such data is currently stored or backed-up outside the United States, Microsoft would ensure that this data is deleted from servers outside the country after it is transferred," Microsoft said in its statement. According to Reuters, negotiations between Microsoft and ByteDance will be overseen by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., which has the power to block any agreement. Microsoft warned that a deal isn't guaranteed and said it does not plan to issue any more updates until there is a "definitive outcome" to the negotiations. Claire Hansen is a staff writer who covers immigration, gun policy and marijuana policy, as well as general news.

European Central Bank president warning banks are unlikely to fully recover from coronavirus before 2022.We got Home Depot numbers out right now. Let's get right to Cheryl Casone with the very latest. Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Strong numbers, Maria. Good morning to you. A double beat for Home Depot, a lot of anticipation with this earnings report. The expectation $3.71 a share, they came at $4.02 per share. Take a look at the revenue. The expectation, $34.53 billion, Home Depot clocked in at $38.05 billion, and look at the stock go in the premarket, up more than 0.25 percent right now.U.S. same-store sales, a jump of 25 percent, which is pretty incredible. Overall, same-store sales jumped about 23.4 percent. The CEO actually going into this earnings report and we are not getting guidance yet, but we are looking for - well, we will see what they do on the call.But traffic at their stores in the U.S. had jumped about 35 percent according to analysts' expectations. Maria, also they are telling us, they did have to spend on higher labor costs because of the pandemic. They spent about $1.3 billion on higher labor costs, as well as benefits to employees' health benefits and they had to spend a lot more on cleaning their stores.Now before COVID, the stock was coming in 50 percent profit on their sales. That never looks like it's jumping as well. Average ticket is up 10 percent. Whatever we see on the Home Depot story, we are going to get Lowe's tomorrow - I'll send it back to you, Maria - is that basically during the pandemic and the lockdown, Home Depot stayed open, people were planting, they were building, and they were painting and these numbers reflect that.BARTIROMO: Alright. Stock is up and that's certainly lifting many boats, it is listing the Dow Industrials as well. Home Depot shares are 2.75 percent. Cheryl, thank you so much.Some of the stories that we are watching this morning, attacks on President Trump dominating night one last night of the Democratic National Convention. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D-VT): We have a President who is not only incapable of addressing these crises, but is leading us down the path of authoritarianism. Nero fiddled while Rome burned; Trump golfs. While Joe and I disagree on the best path to get universal coverage, he has a plan that will greatly expand health care and cut the cost of prescription drugs. Joe will move us forward.MICHELLE OBAMA, FORMER FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES: Donald Trump is the wrong president for our country. He has had more than enough time to prove that he can do the job, but he is clearly in over his head. He cannot meet this moment. He simply cannot be who we need him to be for us.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The two-hour virtual convention focused on unity. Tonight's theme is leadership matters, featuring speeches from former President Bill Clinton and Joe Biden tonight. The keynote address will feature 17 rising stars of the Democratic Party tonight.Meanwhile battleground blitz this morning. President Trump is traveling to Iowa and Arizona later today. The President making campaign stops in Wisconsin and Minnesota yesterday, where he doubled down his attacks on Joe Biden. President Trump says if Biden were elected, the country will descend into a socialist regime.And Democrats are slamming President Trump over his resistance to mail-in voting and changes to the postal service ahead of the election. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accusing the president of trying to scare voters. House Republicans meanwhile are firing back, accusing Democrats of making up a crisis. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy is scheduled to testify before the House Oversight Committee next week.And the World Health Organization raising new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by people between 20 and 40 years old who are asymptomatic. Currently, there are more than 5 million confirmed cases of coronavirus currently in the United States.Let's take a look at markets this morning, with the firmer tone, a big week for retail earnings. Heavy hitters like Walmart and Kohl's among those reporting this morning. We just heard from Home Depot and the stock is up about 3 percent this morning. As you see, that is also lifting the Dow Industrials.Joining me right now is Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management's Chief Investment Strategist Brent Schutte. And Brent, great to see you. Also joining the conversation this morning, The Wall Street Journal Senior Writer Jon Hilsenrath; and The Hill media reporter Joe Concha.Brent, let me get your thoughts on the retail earnings that we are looking at this morning. Home Depot - we are waiting on some others - gives us a good outlook or sort of feeling for what's going on in retail right now. How do you see it?BRENT SCHUTTE, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, NORTHWESTERN MUTUAL WEALTH MANAGEMENT: Absolutely. I mean I think you saw the economy bounce back pretty strongly here in the third quarter. And certainly, retail sales for example are past where they were before the pandemic.And so, you have seen a big push on the retail side, certainly some of the home stores, you mentioned Home Depot, have benefited from that. And it's not surprising that, given that backdrop, it was monetary stimulus, fiscal stimulus that retail sales have spiked and that has benefited Home Depot.BARTIROMO: So do you think that continues second half of the year? What kind of a recovery are you expecting after that 32.9 percent contraction that we saw in the second quarter?SCHUTTE: Well, certainly I think the third quarter right now is shaping up for a pretty big rebound. The fourth quarter I think is still up for grabs given the virus and what happens with it. But I do think the economy will continue to recover, albeit probably more wavy, and in past we had a bit of a slower pace.But right now, you have strong parts of the U.S. economy that are pushing it forward. Certainly there are still weak parts, but that's usually the case. You do have stronger parts, some weaker parts, but overall we do continue to expect the economy to push forward over the coming quarters.BARTIROMO: Jon Hilsenrath, jump in.JON HILSENRATH, SENIOR WRITER, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Brent, I would like to hear what you have to say about the breakdowns in retail of winners and losers. I mean, clearly we are seeing people, Home Depot just reported, people flocking out to do yard work and work in their homes. Online retailers are doing very well. How do you see the breakdown also of the losers and how does that unfold as the year progresses?SCHUTTE: Well, I think the big secular trend is towards more online retailers and so you certainly, at least in my house, see more things, shop each day at the door rather than going out into the public.Now I do think some of that's probably overdone just a bit, because certainly I think as the virus hopefully ebbs, you will see people go back out and go into shopping. But the trend longer term is certainly towards more of the convenience of getting things at your house.I'm not so sure that Home Depot is as impacted by that as other places and other stores. And so I think that narrative continues albeit probably at a slower pace than over the past few quarters just given the fact that a lot of people were either forced to stay home or chose to stay home because of fear of the virus.BARTIROMO: So how do you want to allocate capital here, Brent? You got the S&P 500 inching closer to record territory, finishing yesterday just shy of a record high. The NASDAQ, of course, has been on fire, yesterday another record close there. Do you want to be buying some of these leadership names that have taken this market up near records over the last several months?SCHUTTE: Yes. I mean, I think certainly you want to begin inching out of the stay at home name, so you mentioned some of the NASDAQ and the S&P 500 which is dominated by 4 or 5 stocks that benefit some people staying at home.I think you want to start inching out to where things are cheaper and where quite frankly eventually people will return as I mentioned with my comments on the retailers, towards being out in the wild. And so, there are parts of the market that are cheap versus parts that are expensive.Value stocks which have been out of favor for years should get a tick up as the economy continues to recover. And size, the small-caps in the U.S. are cheap relative to large caps. In some measures, it's cheap as they have been since 1999 and we do like small-cap stocks, as a place where as the economy recovers, as people push back out, you will get that cyclical uplift coming out of this recession in both value stocks and for that matter small-cap stocks.BARTIROMO: All right, we will be watching. Brent, great to see you this morning. Thanks so much, Brent Schutte joining us this morning with the market that is higher, and Brent, you just mentioned technology, that's our morning mover this morning.And it is Oracle, the stock up this morning, up better than 3 percent. The software giant, as I just mentioned, reportedly in talks to acquire TikTok's U.S., Canadian, Australian, and New Zealand assets from its Chinese parent company ByteDance. This follows Microsoft's bid to acquire those assets.President Trump has issued an executive order for ByteDance to divest itself from U.S. ownership within 90 days or TikTok will be banned in the United States. All of the stocks involved this morning trading up.We're just getting started right now. Coming up, night one of the Democratic National Convention, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and former First Lady Michelle Obama making the case for former Vice President Joe Biden. We will get into it at 7 a.m. this morning.We got the word on Wall Street where investors are watching this morning and how you should be allocating your money. Plus Ohio Congressman Tim Ryan is here talking about the DNC, the battle over the Post Office; and former White House Press Secretary Fox News Contributor Sarah Sanders will weigh in on the impacts from the first night of the convention at the DNC and all of the convention speeches, coming up.Amazon's real estate play, the technology giant makes moves to bolster delivery options.And then in the 8:00 a.m. hour, we will talk to former Foreign Policy Adviser to Donald Trump, Carter Page is here on the revelations in the investigation into the wrongdoing at the FBI. What does he have to say about Kevin Clinesmith pleading guilty?Plus former Pennsylvania Governor and DNC Chair Ed Rendell, former Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, and former interim DNC chair Donna Brazile are here on the DNC's best moments so far.You're watching Mornings with Maria live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Night one of the Democratic National Convention now in the history books. The first ever virtual event featuring speakers including former First Lady Michelle Obama, Senator Bernie Sanders, and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo all wasting no time, slamming President Trump. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: Donald Trump is the wrong president for our country. He has had more than enough time to prove that he can do the job, but he is clearly in over his head. Going high is the only thing that works, because when we go low, when we use those same tactics of degrading and dehumanizing others, we just become part of the ugly noise that's drowning out everything else. We have got to vote for Joe Biden like our lives depend on it.GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): Today, we trail the world in defeating COVID. We have over 5 million cases. Americans learned a critical lesson, how vulnerable we are when we are divided and how many lives can be lost when our government is incompetent.SANDERS: We have a president who is not only incapable of addressing these crises, but is leading us down the path of authoritarianism. Any of the ideas we fought for that just a few years ago were considered radical are now mainstream. But let us be clear, if Donald Trump is reelected, all the progress we have made will be in jeopardy.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Another big night tonight when Sally Yates, Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez, former President Bill Clinton and Dr. Jill Biden will speak tonight at Day 2 of the DNC. Joining me right now is the Washington Examiner editorial director, Hugo Gurdon. And Hugo, it's always a pleasure. Thanks for being here. Your reaction to night one of the DNC last night.HUGO GURDON, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: Well, Maria, it was very interesting. I think that what we were watching last night was a kind of repair job on an image problem that Joe Biden has had over the last 3 or 4 months.He ran to win the primary as a centrist and ever since then, he's been moving sharply left, for example, supporting the Green New Deal and subscribing to the awful idea that America was systemically racist, et cetera. What we were watching last night with the appeals to centrism and the Republicans who came on to say vote for Joe Biden, was not just trying to unite his party, but it was also to try and tell voters actually no he is a centrist.This - I think one statistic really gets to it and that is that Michelle Obama was given twice the time that Bernie Sanders was given. What they want voters to do is to say - is to think of Joe Biden, to see Joe Biden as the heir to Obama and to present that amazingly as a kind of centrist platform and not to present him as the sort of radical supporter of Bernie policies, which is what he has been doing for the past 3 or 4 months.BARTIROMO: Well, that's the thing. I mean they are saying that, but that's not what he's doing and that's the point. You've also got Bernie Sanders there on stage talking about how he's worked with Joe Biden.Joe Concha, what about their unity pact, which includes all sorts of ideas that are way to the left progressive? So did that resonate that Joe Biden is supposed to be moderate? And then the media is also saying Kamala Harris is supposed to be moderate, meanwhile she's voted the most left in the Senate?JOE CONCHA, MEDIA REPORTER, THE HILL: A pragmatic moderate I believe is the way The New York Times put it, Maria. And yes, as you said, GovTrack rates her as the most liberal Senator in the Senate in the country in 2019.And as you said, Joe Biden is also tracked way to the left. You look at the Green New Deal, just yesterday he did an interview, not with Chris Wallace or not with Maria Bartiromo, but with Cardi B where he shared that there should be free college for everyone, and also basically endorsed universal health care.So given all the money we spent during this pandemic, and given all the money that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris want to spend, you have to believe the only way to generate that sort of revenue to pay for it all is to raise taxes on all levels of income.But what I found very interesting last night, and you mentioned Michelle Obama before and Hugo did as well, she's obviously an excellent speaker like her husband. She was the star of the night, but here you had the first African-American First Lady not broaching, even mentioning the first woman of color to be on a Democratic Presidential ticket or any presidential ticket for that matter in Kamala Harris.And the reason why, according to several reports, is that Michelle Obama apparently taped this more than a week ago, which is kind of odd when you consider how many people may have been watching last night, maybe 20 million.You couldn't just do this after the announcement of Kamala Harris as opposed to before? So that stood out to me that that wasn't even mentioned. I found that to be disorganized quite frankly when you have your star speaker not bringing up one of the bigger stories of the year, and that is the selection of Kamala Harris to the Joe Biden ticket.BARTIROMO: Yes, I think you make a great point, what about that? And also, you have got John Kasich, John Kasich former Ohio Governor, 2016 Republican Presidential candidate, speaking last night, urging Americans to vote for Joe Biden. Here is John Kasich real quick.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN KASICH, FORMER GOVERNOR OF OHIO: America is at the crossroads today. The stakes in this election are greater than any in modern times. I'm a life-long Republican. In normal times, something like this would probably never happen, but these are not normal times. We are being taken down the wrong road by a President who has pitted one against the other.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Your reaction, Hugo?GURDON: Yes, I mean I don't think anybody really in the - on the conservative side takes John Kasich very seriously anymore. I mean he started his career on the - as a sort of hardline conservative and he's moved left and left and left. The whole array of Republicans who were there to support Joe Biden are not people who have any influence in the Republican Party anymore.I just wanted to mention one thing that - about Michelle Obama and that is that she was really trying to appeal to black voters to stay with Biden because Trump has made inroads into that section of the voters.BARTIROMO: Yes. Do you think he has the black vote? Do you think he has strong support from the African-American community, Hugo, real quick, the president?GURDON: Yes, I think that Trump has actually gained some and they are very worried that Kanye West will actually take a few votes away and perhaps give Trump some successes, where they think that they really need the black votes.BARTIROMO: That makes sense. All right, Hugo, thank you. Hugo Gurdon, we'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Joe Biden embracing progressive policies, Biden making promises about health care and education during a conversation with Cardi B for Elle Magazine. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: If I get elected President, free college education for four years of college, flat out. Anybody with a family less than $125,000, you are going to get free education.The way we can pay for all of this is doing practical things like making sure that no corporation making a profit should pay less than 15 percent tax on their profit.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: So Joe Concha, we talked about this a moment ago. Is this Biden trying to appeal to younger voters? Is he saying what he's going to do, or should we not believe it?CONCHA: It's hard to tell with Joe Biden, right Maria, because he's only been in politics for four decades and it seems that Joe Biden only does things that are politically expedient at the time. So yes, tell people what they want to hear. Boy, that sounds pretty good if I'm a young person and I got all this debt facing me if I'm going to college.It's going to be free for me if my family makes more than $125,000, sign me up. I get free health care, sign me up. And again, you're not going to have a Cardi B in these situations actually ask the simple question, which is, how do you pay for this exactly?So Joe Biden, it's a very interesting candidacy at this point. As I said, he is not doing any interviews where he's facing anything remotely resembling scrutiny. And in the two public appearances with Kamala Harris last week, they both ran off the stage like Usain Bolt before any reporters could ask any questions even at public events.So look, this works in August, that's fine. But after Labor Day, when people start paying attention, Joe Biden is going to have some questions to answer as will his running mate where they had proposed a lot of things and they haven't proposed how they are going pay for it.BARTIROMO: Well, I mean you make a good point, Joe, because last night we heard a lot of beating up on Donald Trump, but what did we hear in the way of policy?Jon Hilsenrath, did you hear solutions? I mean we hear that they are moderates, we hear that they are not all the way to the left, but then you see things like Bernie Sanders, AOC, Elizabeth Warren, all over the docket in this DNC this week.HILSENRATH: Yes, so I would say two things. First, on the question of how are we going to pay for it? We live in an environment now where nobody is asking that question in Washington, frankly.We had a trillion-dollar budget deficit before the coronavirus crisis, and now it's going to $2 trillion and $3 trillion. So frankly no one in Washington is talking at all about debt and paying for things. In fact, the President is talking about eliminating payroll tax which funds social security. So I think this is something that goes in both directions. I think in terms of this convention--BARTIROMO: Yes, I'm not just talking about debt, Jon. I'm not just talking about debt. I'm talking about Medicare for All or Green New Deal that costs $2 trillion, a $4 trillion tax increase.(CROSSTALK)HILSENRATH: Right, and that's my point is Washington spends money without regard for how to pay for anything, and that is a bipartisan issue that I think is kind of inarguable right now. We had a trillion-dollar budget deficit before the coronavirus crisis. There's just no focus in Washington on debt or how to pay for things whatsoever.In terms of the convention, I think we have two narratives. On the one hand, the Democrats are trying to present themselves as a big tent that are bringing in not only the Bernie Sanders side, but also moderate Republicans.But I think what Republicans see when they watch this convention is people like Bernie Sanders and a move to the left. So I think we have competing narratives on exactly what the Democratic Party is going to look like if it's elected.BARTIROMO: Yes, absolutely. Our quick break and then when we come back, working it out, finally New York gyms are getting the green light to reopen. But New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is still pushing back. I'll be speaking with one gym owner on the other side of this. And then, thinking twice about that next drink, the new warning directed at men.You're watching Mornings with Maria live on Fox Business.MARIA BARTIROMO, ANCHOR, MORNINGS WITH MARIA: A new warning directed at men -- you're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, good Tuesday morning everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, August 18th. Let's take a look at markets this morning, it's 6:32 a.m. on the East Coast. We have a firmer tone, futures indicating a gain at the start of trading with the S&P 500 nearing an all-time record high when it opens for trading. The Dow Industrials up five and three-quarters -- I'm sorry, the Dow Industrials up 69, the Nasdaq up 37 and the S&P up five and three-quarters. Strong results this morning from Home Depot lifting the Dow.Meanwhile, the Nasdaq notching a record close yesterday on Wall Street. Let's take global markets here, European indices are mixed, the -- yesterday, the Dow was down 86, but take a look at European indices which are higher across the board. FTSE 100 up 15, the CAC Quarante up 19 and the Dax Index higher by 81. The European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde is warning banks are unlikely to fully recover from coronavirus before 2022. In Asia overnight, markets were mixed, South Korea seeing a steep decline as concerns grow over coronavirus spikes as you can see.The Kospi index was down 2.5 percent overnight. New settlement demands in the nationwide opioid lawsuit meanwhile, Cheryl Casone with those details right now. Cheryl?CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS: That is right, Maria. At least, a dozen attorneys general reportedly demanding $26.4 billion from drug companies. These settlement talks include opioid distributors McKesson, another source Bergen, Cardinal Health and Johnson & Johnson. States and local governments blame these companies for the opioid epidemic. Taking a look at those stocks in the pre-market right now, red across the board and particular from McKesson down more than 1 percent. Well, Boeing is offering buyouts to employees for the second time this year as demand plunges amid global travel restrictions due to the pandemic.This new round is going to be extended to employees in the commercial airlines division, services division and corporate offices. Back in May, the airline had laid off nearly 7,000 U.S. workers. The stock is higher today by three-quarters of a percent. It was actually one of the drags on the Dow yesterday we should add. Finally, Maria, here's one expensive drink, actor Ryan Reynolds Aviation American gin has sold for a whopping $610 million, the new owner is spirit's giant Diageo which already owns brands like Johnny Walker and Smirnoff.Reynolds is going to still hold an ongoing ownership interest in the company. And here's Diageo in the pre-market. Stock is up more than 1.5 percent. Something else people do during the pandemic, Maria, make cocktails, back to you.BARTIROMO: Yes, Cheryl, thank you so much. And on that note, work it out, gyms in New York can reopen as soon as next week now with limited capacity and mandatory mask-wearing. Governor Andrew Cuomo laying out strict health measures for gym owners including ventilation guidelines, local inspections. But New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is still pushing back, he says not so fast. De Blasio says inspectors will not get to fitness centers until they're done with schools which is a top priority. Joining us right now is the co-owner of Slope Fitness in Brooklyn, New York, Michael Carlin. Michael, it's great to have you this morning, thanks very much for joining us.Your thoughts on reopening with de Blasio's push-back here. What are you doing to get back up and running?MICHAEL CARLIN, CO-OWNER, SLOPE FITNESS: Well, thank you so much for having me this morning, Maria, and giving us the opportunity to speak to your audience and everyone out there. We've been ready for months. The signs behind me are our COVID reopening protocols, have been in place and ready to go. We've been following CDC guidelines, I'm part of the New York Fitness Coalition where we presented to the governor himself around safety protocols and a lot of them were mimic in the 17 pages he released yesterday.The push-back right now from Mayor de Blasio, I'm unaware if Mr. de Blasio received the information just like we all did yesterday. I can understand his situation where he can't send out health inspectors right now to get us up and running. The governor did say gyms can open as of August 24th, which that was great to hear, but the final part of that piece was leaving it up to localities to determine whether you can and inspect. And now, with over 2,000 gyms in New York State, do we have enough health inspectors to go around and inspect us.And based on all the guidelines that are out there, what are the testing protocols to go in and give us a grade.BARTIROMO: Michael, let me ask you to take us through your business. How significant --CARLIN: Yes --BARTIROMO: Has the shutdown been in terms of enabling you to stay -- keep business afloat? Compare your business, where you were back in February and what has taken place in these last several months so that the audience can understand what you -- what you've been up against.CARLIN: Well, being a small business owner and owning a health club, I'm not part of the big chain. I don't have big investors. It's myself, it's my daughter, it's my wife, it's my family and it's the members of this community. The impact -- my business was bringing in between $75,000 and $80,000 a month. We have lost at this point over $400,000 in gross income. I've laid off the staff, coming back now, when we were able to open up outdoor fitness, we turned around and we brought back certain amount of members that we were able to reactivate and follow us with, you know, the outdoor model, not even 10 percent of our membership base came back.I've lost over a 100 members since the shutdown because 95 percent of them have moved out of New York. What has happened to the health fitness industry, whether it's marshal art studio, whether it's kickboxing, whether it's CrossFit, a yoga studio, Pilates studio, they're shutting down by the dozens. You know, we were hoping to be considered part of one of the phased-in models, phase 2, phase 3 and then we thought phase 4 for sure. The signs behind me --BARTIROMO: Right --CARLIN: I made back up in June, welcoming people back. That's money we will never be able --BARTIROMO: And you've -- and you have the confidence that once people come back when you're able to get back to normal, that you have the process in place that will minimize risks for those people working out? I mean, you just mentioned doing your fitness outside, that certainly opens you up to enabling business to go on with lower risks, right?CARLIN: Yes, the governor had mentioned back in June when he ruled out fitness centers and malls because of MERV, eating the MERV filters. I have been using MERV filters in my gym for eight years, it's not new science. Upgrading it to the MERV 13 for my club is fine, durable. I've already swapped out and put a MERV -- 13 filters since then. Sanitizing products, individual ones being given out to members as they come in, so there's no cross-contamination by touching one that might be hanging up on a wall that everyone is touching.Sanitizing solutions on walls or every desktop that you walk by, wearing masks and limiting -- before the shutdown, at the end of February, beginning in March --BARTIROMO: Right --CARLIN: We had already limited the capacity, every other machine was out of order. We were already taking steps. You know --BARTIROMO: Yes --CARLIN: The idea that -- gyms are fitness centers, yoga studios, training studios, CrossFit, we're all there for --BARTIROMO: Sure --CARLIN: One mission, to improve people's health and their mental well- being. You know, this -- we don't --BARTIROMO: Right --CARLIN: We did not -- prior to the end of June, we didn't have -- did not have a voice, being part of the New York Fitness Coalition led by Charlie Cassara as well as trusted safe with Kevin Godfrey(ph). We put together on protocols and submitted them to the governor, and which we believe he --BARTIROMO: Yes --CARLIN: His staff could look at them because they're in here. And we were following CDC guidelines --BARTIROMO: Well, Michael, it certainly feels like -- it certainly feels like the toughest time anybody -- any of us have seen, and certainly you're really feeling the brunt of it as a small business owner. Thanks very much, Michael for sharing your story. We will be watching the situation --CARLIN: Thank you so much --BARTIROMO: And we wish you the best, Michael Carlin joining us there. Coming up, taking on Microsoft, Oracle reportedly gets into the fray to acquire TikTok now, we've got a bidding war underway. Then thinking twice about that second drink, a new warning for men. You don't want to miss it, you're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business, stay with us.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Coming this Fall, an election season for the ages as President Trump squares off against former Vice President Joe Biden. And we'll have every angle covered with our expert analysis and all-star cast from the party nominations to the all important presidential debates. MORNINGS WITH MARIA is on the scene until the very last votes are counted. MORNINGS WITH MARIA, we are invested in you.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Well, there's a new player in the TikTok bidding war, it is Oracle now exploring an option to acquire the popular video app, according to "The Financial Times" this morning, the company already speaking with ByteDance; the Beijing-based company that owns TikTok. Oracle pinning itself against Microsoft, Oracle stock is up in the pre-market on this news, take a look, it is up about 3 percent. There's a -- there's a timeline here. Jon Hilsenrath, your reaction?JON HILSENRATH, SENIOR WRITER, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Well, I think it's a good thing to see a competitive process building, and not a situation where the United States government is just handing this entity over to Microsoft, so that's a good thing. The other thing I'd say is, you know, the president speculated a week or so ago that the U.S. government should get a cut of any deal, and frankly, I just don't think that's the role of a free market -- of a government running a free market economy. I think, you know, the government has made its decision, TikTok should not be in the hands of China, it should stay out of the process of a transaction, though.BARTIROMO: Yes, you know, my question on this whole story is how many people from Microsoft will end up getting -- how many people will they get from TikTok and how many TikTok employees would go to Oracle? Because the Chinese Communist Party, Joe Concha, has been very effective at stealing intellectual property from within. You've got -- you know, people working within companies that they've either identified or actually sent there to get -- to get the job to actually send data and information back to the CCP.So the question becomes how many Chinese-Americans or employees that are answering to the CCP will actually end up working for these American technology titans, Oracle and Microsoft?JOE CONCHA, MEDIA REPORTER, THE HILL: It's the ultimate Trojan-horse scenario, right, Maria, and that's something that needs to be considered here in terms of security, in terms of safety, in terms of protecting that intellectual property that you were talking about. But to Jon's point, it's good to see Oracle is jumping in here, obviously, that would drive the price up with a competitor with Microsoft, and even though they don't have the intention of buying it, perhaps, you know, that makes life a little more difficult for Microsoft who was the only big player at this point, but, boy, is this a big company? Eight hundred million active users, more than 1 billion users.I mean, we're talking three-times the size of the U.S. population, and it's worth about $75 billion. So that makes it the most valuable privately-held company in the world. So, certainly enticing, but as you said, a lot of variables around this that we really should start considering at this point in terms of protecting intellectual property.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, I know that, you know, Brad Smith at Microsoft has been trying to convince the administration that it can actually acquire TikTok and lessen any worry about national security, Jon.HILSENRATH: Well, you know, I think you're raising an important point about what role American companies are playing in their business activities in China and with the Chinese government. I think the bloom is off the rose for politicians and the American public for decades. American companies went over to China, lobbied in Washington on behalf of China because they saw it as such a big and important market. I think a lot of American companies got burned by that, and are now dealing with business practices in China with some more skepticism.But they still have very big eyes about the Chinese market, and you know, I think, the American public should be putting a lot more scrutiny not only on how Washington deals with China, but how American business manages its allegiances and its conflicts with the big Chinese market versus American national interest.BARTIROMO: Yes, don't forget what Bill Barr told us a couple of months ago where he said that the CCP is not looking to trade with you, they're looking to raid you. They're looking to raid your business. And by the way, it's not just corporations, I've got a -- I've got a press release here from the Department of Justice from last night, former CIA officer arrested and charged with espionage. This is Alexander Yuk Ching Ma, 67 years old, a former CIA agency officer arrested on a charge that he conspired with a relative of his who was also former CIA to communicate classified information of the top-secret level to Intelligence officials of the People's Republic of China.This just happened, this arrest last night from the DOJ of a former CIA officer. We will take a break, when we come back, sucking that money away, Americans are boosting savings during quarantine. We're taking a look at the numbers, you're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, time for the Morning Buzz. First up, one drink maximum, new federal recommendations show men should consume no more than 1 alcoholic drink a day. Scientists updating research from two drinks a day as more people turn to alcohol during this pandemic. Joe, your reaction.CONCHA: More people, Maria, in terms of 26 percent, that is the rise in alcohol sales since the pandemic began. And we already have a nation that kind of likes to tip it back a little bit or more than a little bit, 27 percent of people ages, 18 or older, reported they engaged in binge drinking in the past month alone. So, that was pre-pandemic, now you can imagine where people are at this point. So I think that's why the CDC put that out there, not a lot to do, you can't really travel, you can't go to a ball game, you're stuck at home and after a while, you know, perhaps getting some liquid courage and turning to the bottle seems to be the only option.So, this is good guidance because obviously, having two drinks a day means 14 a week, and that's probably not very good for your liver, Maria.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's right, Jon.HILSENRATH: You know, my wise-guy response is, can I hold off for a few days and then just throw down 7 shots on Friday, which is a way I'm feeling some weeks for now. But I'm kind of just being a wise guy, I think -- you know, I guess -- I guess I'm just going to have to stick to one glass of wine or --BARTIROMO: Seven shots, yes, I think so --HILSENRATH: Yes.BARTIROMO: Let me ask you this, super savers, here is something else we're doing during this pandemic. More than one in five Americans have saved at least $1,000 while in lockdown according to a new survey. This extra loot - - the result of less spending, less on Summer fun like travel and night life. Jon, the savings rate is up.HILSENRATH: It sure is. And you know, I've made two points about this. The first one is that, I really do think that there's pent-up demand in this economy that as we open things, people will go out and spend money, and they've been stockpiling it, and I think people are ready to let loose and tired of sitting around and drinking every night. So, that's the good news for the economic outlook, but it also raises, I think some interesting policy questions. There's talk in Washington now about eliminating the payroll tax, about creating a payroll tax holiday until next year.And I'm not sure that solves the problem at hand. The problems that we've got for the economy are A, small business, making sure that we can keep them afloat like that gym that you had on earlier, and people who lose their jobs. I don't know that we need to bolster savings right now.BARTIROMO: Well, we're going to talk about retail, next. Wal-Mart's quarterly numbers out moments from now. We will take a look at what to expect and get a better sense of savings and spending next hour of MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business, stay with us.Load-Date: August 18, 2020End of Document

Welcome to the new campustimes.org. Rochester's Mayor Warren sued over limiting gatherings in recent emergency order An international student's COVID-19 dilemma Rocky X Future collab: Wear A MaskCampus Times: University of RochesterAugust 16, 2020 SundayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 664 wordsByline: Corey Miller-WilliamsBody"A lot of Chinese are brainwashed by the Chinese govern­ment, just like a lot of Americans are brainwashed by Donald Trump," UR senior and former president of the Chinese Students' Association Sampson Hao said in an interview with Hong Kong newspaper South China Morning Post. On Aug. 5, a month after the article's July 4 release, CSA revoked Hao's membership.The Morning Post article, a piece looking into UR's controversies last fall surrounding the College Republicans Tibet event and subsequent tunnel painting war over Hong Kong's fight against China for autonomy, had interviewed Hao due to his position of president at the time.Hao wrote that he had chosen not to rerun for the presidency during e-board elections back in March, but remained as a member of the club. After learning of his quote in the Morning Post, Hao said the current CSA e-board chose to remove him from the club entirely, without any other official process.CSA e-board posted on WeChat - a ubiquitous Chinese social media, messaging, and mobile payment platform used by nearly all Chinese students at UR - about their decision on Aug. 10, condemning Hao for taking the interview without going through the proper channels. In the post, they wrote that CSA members "can only accept [an] interview after obtaining the consent of all e-board members," which Hao did not. The post goes on to announce that "CSA e-board members unanimously decided to revoke Simeng [Sampson] Hao's CSA membership" in an "organized discussion." Junior and current CSA president Yisheng Zhong wrote to CT that Hao's words were "politically sensitive," and described them as "his personal judgment which is not affiliated with CSA." To represent CSA in any capacity after knocking the Chinese government would be inappropriate, he explained. In a second post on Aug. 11, they wrote that "URCSA has always maintained a correct political stance and strives to create a safe and interesting study abroad life for the majority of Chinese students. We do not agree with any inflammatory speech or behavior.""Can [an e-board] remove someone? I don't know," Hao wrote. He added that he'd been planning on leaving anyway after facing the negative attention his quote gained.Hao stressed that he respected CSA's decision, and held no ill will towards the group. "CSA has the right to do whatever they want to do," he wrote. "I do not want to judge anyone here." "I felt like I got 'canceled' only because I said something that [is] indeed questionable," Hao wrote. He later said that his words were intended to represent his opinions as an individual and not the opinions of CSA."If they have a problem with my quote, that is totally fine," he wrote. "I apologize for the fact that people thought I was representing CSA and this whole thing is a misunderstanding."The Aug. 11 post further said that Hao has contacted SA and the South China Morning Post about the article, accusing the latter of "tampering with his original words" and "inducing speech." It also reported that CSA had cut ties with Hao and asked him for an apology, which is included in the post. In this apology, Hao says that the article was "politically guided and distorted my personal speech," but accepts blame for making "unjustified remarks containing political content."Specifically, he states that the Morning Post reporter, Eric Fish, said he was a writer instead of a reporter, and "repeatedly emphasized that it had nothing to do with the South China Morning Post." Hao also says that he had refused to conduct the interview under his CSA title, but the reporter marked him as its president anyway. Neither Hao nor Zhong would share or discuss the posts with the CT, citing a desire to keep the conflict and coverage to a minimum."At the end of the day, most people will remember the good work I have done for this organization," Hao wrote. "The interesting and peaceful dialogue that I host with HKSA, great Mid-Autumn Festival, China Nite and many many more."Load-Date: August 17, 2020End of Document

Thank you for being here.First up, Goldman Sachs is warning that the approval of a Covid-19 vaccine could upend markets. Goldman telling clients that the approval could spark a selloff in bonds, shifting money from technology stocks to cyclical stocks.David, your thoughts on this? What kind of movements would you expect should a vaccine happen sooner rather than later?DAVID BAHNSEN, CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER, BAHNSEN GROUP: Yes, I thought their piece was interesting, Maria, because it did kind of suggest that something ominous would happen. And then you read the piece and most of it sounded quite positive.I think a rotation from the big tech and some of those real cyclicals into some of the areas that have been underappreciated would be a good and healthy thing for markets and certainly the yield curve steepening would be really appreciated by the banks and some of the financial stocks. And so I'm not sure that I would see it as a totally negative.The only thing I might disagree with is that they don't believe that a vaccine has been that priced into markets yet. I think a lot of it has been. I think that the markets largely expect a vaccine is coming. There's certainly more upside ahead if it were to come. But I'm not -- I'm not sure that it would be upending of markets as much as it would just sort of shift some of the underlying ingredients.BARTIROMO: Yes, I think I agree with you. I mean no surprise that we would see a rotation, right? I mean, you know, toward -- toward the companies or securities that investors think will be the growth stories post a vaccine. So that's not such a surprise, I guess.Initial jobless claims are going to be coming out this morning, 8:30 a.m. Eastern today. We'll have those numbers in an hour and a half. That's, of course, ahead of tomorrow's jobs report. The ADP report yesterday reported a major miss in private payroll additions.Steve, what are you expecting today and do you expect a weak spot that we're entering in terms of jobs right now for the month of July?STEVE DUDASH, PRESIDENT, IHT WEALTH MANAGEMENT: Has there ever been a time where estimates have been so wildly apart? I mean you've got people saying plus millions on the upside, plus millions on the downside. And, I mean, frankly, we think that it won't be as strong as it was in June. We'll see some gains, marginal gains. But there's a lot of uncertainty still around there.However, like you guys were just touching on, the most important part moving the market here moving forward is the fact in the next 60 days we should have clarity on what the vaccine path looks like. Maybe not the final results, but -- and who the ultimate winner is, but a really good idea of what the path is.And that's why we keep telling people right now, you know, if you made money on the tech run in the Covid world, that's great, congratulations, but you have to start positioning yourself now for the post-Covid world. What does this world look like one year from now? Is it still going to be the same handful of tech companies that have run through the roof? Probably not. You guys had just mentioned it, there needs to be some rotation. The Zooms of the world that have done wonderful in the last six months, do you think we're still using it to the same degree of six, 12 months from now? Because I don't. I think a lot of people are Zoomed out. And so if you're going to buy or stay in the tech world, be specific on it. And if you're not, look at the ones that are getting crushed right now, like the airlines. The government has come out and put a floor on it, or -- not officially, but they're coming out to put a floor on it.BARTIROMO: Yes.DUDASH: Don't you think the world travels more 12 months from now? Don't you think that people are sick of doing this, the video calls. Wouldn't -- I would much rather be sitting in your -- in your office right now talking about it versus doing it video, virtual like this.BARTIROMO: Yes.DUDASH: That is happening across the world.BARTIROMO: Yes. No, I think you make good points.DUDASH: So picture what it is 12 months from now and buy into that world, not today.BARTIROMO: So you want to get ahead of it, how our world changes within a year?DUDASH: Get ahead of it. Absolutely. Buy the airlines. Buy the casinos. Buy the telemeds.BARTIROMO: David Bahnsen, I see you -- yes, I see you nodding. It sounds like -- OK. Yes.So you -- so telemed is something we're doing now. So I guess then you believe there are some things that will still penetrate in the digital economy once we get out of this, like telemedicine.DUDASH: Exactly. I 100 percent agree. There's going to be winners. Amazon is a winner. I don't care what happens with the vaccine tomorrow, Amazon is going to keep doing what they've been doing. People aren't going to change it. But parts of our lives will be fundamentally changed forever.BARTIROMO: Yes.DUDASH: The telemed world, which to be, full disclosure, I own a piece of, but those have fundamentally change how people have the doctor experience. That won't go away.BARTIROMO: Yes.DUDASH: The Zooms of the world that are more short-term flashes, I think those revert back to the mean a little bit.BARTIROMO: OK.DUDASH: So if you're going to stay in the tech world, if you're a robin hooder and you made a bunch of money, congrats. But you've got to be a lot more selective. And like you were just saying, and Goldman has said, start rotating your portfolio now. Don't wait for that vaccine announcement to come out 60 days from now.BARTIROMO: Yes. What -- what about the dollar? It's still struggling. The high number of Covid-19 cases could slow U.S. economic recovery.Lee, you're -- well, you're focused on the dollar. What's your take?LEE MUNSON, PRESIDENT AND CEO, PORTFOLIO WEALTH ADVISORS: You know, the dollar's been my sort of post-Covid trade. As opposed to tech, I've been really in the gold miners, energy. I've been long the emerging markets. And that's -- that's helping those positions.I think the dollar -- what nobody's really talking about is with this dollar decline, I think we see a pause here. Everybody in the narrative has said that the weaker dollar has helped stocks in July. I think that's going to continue. I think it's going to -- I think the real story is nobody's talking about the 10-year Treasury being, you know, at 0.5 something for the last two weeks. I think we're going to get an opportunity here, just on a technical basis. If you look at the charts, for those people that look at charts, everybody's looking at the dollar and thinking that this decline we're at, this sort of kiss or kill moment where the dollar's found support on a technical basis, but if that continues to drop -- because, honestly, we're printing more money than Japan, which just kind of sounds weird if you would have told me this a year ago. That's going to continue to get momentum behind things like the gold miners and the gold trade, which is directly inverse to what the dollar is doing.And I also think it's going to give a lot of credence to people like me who like the cyclicals, like the first guess, you know, we love the value names. You know, that's like the next big trade for next year. But also it's causing your entire emerging market basket to rise.So I think if you see a little dollar strength over the next week or so, I think that's your opportunity to get into those emerging market names. Definitely stay away from Europe, stay away from Japan. There's a million reasons why I think those economies are just not going to have the oomph that emerging markets. And so if you want to diversify out of the United States, you know, get -- not just be in tech or not be in my favorite places, which are the cyclicals, the banks, the industrials, things like that, then I think that the dollar weakness, if that subsides over the next week, I think you get into the emerging market names and I think you ride that. I think that is going to continue because the Fed's balance sheet is going to have to continue to expand for the next six to 12 months, period.BARTIROMO: Getting into emerging markets, meaning going into those local markets, like China, India, Brazil, et cetera, or buying companies that are exposed to the emerging markets, Lee?MUNSON: I would much rather own the actual foreign companies through -- you know, you can just get a diversified ETF that's invested in China or that's invested in emerging markets in general. Because we have to remember, the emerging market performance over the past three months rivals that, if not has done slightly better than the Nasdaq, than the Qs have been. And that's, again, based on that dollar weakness.BARTIROMO: OK.MUNSON: And so that's -- that's where I'm at. I understand the play and why we want to buy caterpillar or plays that, you know, sell a lot there. I want to buy those little (INAUDIBLE).BARTIROMO: Yes.MUNSON: Also, Maria, remember, a few months ago, these things were selling at book value.BARTIROMO: Yes.MUNSON: So I think to get the same type of oomph as the Nasdaq 100 with a completely different valuation structure, you can make money being a value oriented guy like me today in this market but you have to -- you have to look at the dollar to help you make that money.BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Great conversation, guys.David Bahnsen, Lee Munson, and Steve Dudash. We'll see you soon. Thank you so much.DUDASH: Thank you.BARTIROMO: We've got a market that has completely rolled over. It is now firmly negative, down 57 points.Coming up this morning, CVS Health President and CEO Larry Merlo will join me on second quarter earnings, the future of the company, coming up.And then dude ranch vacations. How Americans are spending time off during this pandemic.In the 8:00 a.m. hour I'll be speaking with Moody's Analytics Chief Economist Mark Zandi. He'll react to the weekly jobless claims number and where we are in the economy today.The top travel destinations for Americans planning your next year's vacation.Don't miss it. You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Social media and misinformation. FaceBook, Twitter and Google owned YouTube all taking down a clip posted by the campaign which was part of President Trump's interview from "Fox and Friends" yesterday, citing coronavirus misinformation.Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This thing's going away. It will go away like things go away. And my view is that schools should be opened. If you look at children, children are almost -- and I would almost say definitely, but almost immune from this disease.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The Trump campaign responding, saying, quote, the president was stating a fact that children are less susceptible to the coronavirus. Social media companies are not the arbiters of truth.While not immune, the World Health Organization has stated recently of the 6 million infections recorded between February and July, only 4.6 percent were children aged five to 14.Dagen, what do you make of this?MCDOWELL: I think that this is a move by these social media companies -- using the word immune, it's the wrong one. If you listen to the testimony of Dr. Anthony Fauci last week on Capitol Hill, the Democrats kept going at that -- it -- this phrase that the president has used in the past, almost immune, and they kept using it, trying to get him on the record to basically disagree with the president. Fauci would just simply say, children can get this disease, although the complications or death are rare for children.That being said, these social media companies are on the lookout for any reason to censor the president, the administration, and take down things he says. That is just -- they are -- they are desperate to appease the left, appease the blue check mark crowd and satiate their desire to shut up and shut down this president. So when they see an opening, they do it.BARTIROMO: Yes, and I think that they like to wear it as a badge of honor, that they took down a tweet, that they pushed back on the president.This has been going on the entire term of this president. They wear it as a badge of honor.Joseph, do you see that?PINION: I mean at this point we just need to call -- go ahead and call it what it is, which is election tampering. I mean it's hard to tell if the DNC is not perhaps the largest shareholder at Twitter through some network of secret LLCs because at this point, you know, when you talk about the type of censorship that we see on conservative speech, I mean their true measure, their true standard, this truth in media or truth in tweets, then there are a wide variety of Democratic politicians who tweet mistruths all the time. There's -- FaceBook is permeated with mistruths that are perpetrated by the left all the time.So the issue seems to me that they're not interested in truth, they're interested in cutting down the president, they're interested in cutting down conservatives. And that is why I think inevitably they are digging their own graves even if it doesn't happen before this election is over.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, Ryan, you've -- you've had tweets from "The Global Times," which is state-run media of China. They've never taken anything down there. You've had -- you've had tweets from the head of Iran with -- with fighting words. Never took that down either.PAYNE: Yes, exactly right. And Elon Musk had a quote that was very similar to what Trump said back in March. That wasn't taken down. So I think it also -- just the bigger picture is, if big tech can get involved in censorship, doesn't that speak to the fact that they should be regulated then because if, you know, the government is really the one that's supposed to be involved with censorship, I think that just speaks to their -- again, like Joseph just said, they're kind of digging their own grave in terms of regulation. And I think they're just basically setting the pathway for that.MCDOWELL: Can we -- Maria, can we take this tweet down?BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: World Health Organization, January 14th, this year, preliminary investigations conducted by Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human to human transmission of the novel coronavirus.BARTIROMO: That's right.MCDOWELL: They can take that tweet and stick it where the sun doesn't shine if they're going to censor what is being said here in the United States.PINION: The tweet's still up, by the way.BARTIROMO: You're absolutely right. Bingo.All right, stay with us. We'll be right back. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.The nuclear arms race. "The Wall Street Journal" out with an exclusive report saying that Saudi Arabia has expanded its nuclear program with the help of China. A new facility in the country's northwest region is raising flags. It's reportedly being used to harvest yellow cake uranium.Joining me right now is presidential envoy for arms control, Ambassador Marshall Billingslea.And, Ambassador, thanks very much for being here.Can you give us the status check on what's going on in terms of this new facility in Saudi Arabia and the nuclear ambitions there?AMB. MARSHALL BILLINGSLEA, SPECIAL PRESIDENTIAL ENVOY FOR ARMS CONTROL: Well, it's great to be with you this morning, Maria. And let me start by congratulating you for the 25th anniversary of your reporting on the New York Stock Exchange. That's just an incredible trailblazing on your part. And as the father of two young daughters, I hope they can in due course blaze their own trails as you have.I saw the press reporting.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. I appreciate that.BILLINGSLEA: Absolutely.The press reporting highlights an issue actually that I was asked about in a Senate hearing two weeks ago and what I would say is that it's going to be crucial that the Saudis commit, and I'm sure they will, to full safeguards under the IAEA, the International Atomic Energy Agency. I also said that I think, with regard to U.S. nuclear cooperation, and, again, this is for civil nuclear purposes, for power generation, we should negotiate, and I'm sure we will, a set of agreements that forego enrichment and reprocessing, which are really the two kinds of technologies that would be most concerning in terms of pivoting from a civil program to a weapons program.But what's key here, Maria, is to recognize that the companies that the Saudis are doing business with in China are state-owned enterprises, and those very companies are the same ones involved in China's massive nuclear buildup, it's nuclear weapons crash program. And that's -- that's, I think, of great concern.BARTIROMO: And I know that China is also partnering with Iran on certain things, economic things. There was a report in "Forbes" magazine the other day, there's a $400 billion deal being talked about between Iran and China. Is that concerning to you? We know that Iran has the ambitions to get their own nuclear weapons, right?BILLINGSLEA: Right. I mean the president has been very clear that the JCPOA, the agreement that was cut under the Obama administration, was a bad deal for the United States because it did nothing to check the Iranian nuclear ambitions. And their doing business with the Chinese should ring all kind of alarm bells.You know, today marks the 75th anniversary of Hiroshima, which ushered in the nuclear area. And I think it's entirely appropriate that today we talk about what the president has been doing in driving the next generation of nuclear arms control agreements. It's essential that we do not see a destabilizing nuclear arms race emerge, particularly in Asia. And, unfortunately, the Chinese are taking us there.BARTIROMO: Yes.Well, President Trump speaking with Russian President Vladimir Putin over the phone a few weeks ago, looking to renegotiate the New Start program, the last nuclear arms treaty between the U.S. and Russia. We're waiting on details of that. They've not been released.But last week the president said that -- this outside of Marine One. He said, right now we are the great nuclear power. We've upgraded our nuclear tremendously since. We have the most power, Russia is second, and China is third. China is surging, they'll be there at some point. And, yes, we would want to talk to China eventually about this.Meanwhile, China's doing these side deals, Ambassador.BILLINGSLEA: Right.BARTIROMO: And the one with Iran, to me, seems most concerning.BILLINGSLEA: Well, it is. But I would actually suggest that most concerning is what China is doing itself. Just with -- like with the coronavirus, China is throwing up a great wall of secrecy to the world regarding its nuclear buildup. In the last segment you mentioned "The Global Times," which is the Chinese Communist Party's mouthpiece. And nothing is written from an editorial standpoint in that paper that isn't sanctioned at the highest levels of the Chinese government. That newspaper, just a few months ago, called for China to have 1,000 deployed nuclear warheads. Just for comparison, the United States and Russia, under the New Start Treaty, have limited themselves to 1,500 warheads. So we are talking about a really alarming and secretive buildup by the Chinese Communist Party under Chairman Xi.BARTIROMO: Wow. This is very concerning.And I know that "The Global Times" is an asset of the CCP because of the way they report things. In the middle of the pandemic, "The Global Times" comes out with a report saying, well, maybe we should question whether or not China should export prescription drugs if the United States wants to kill -- keep poking General Xi about tariffs. So pretty much what the CCP wants the world to know, they do it through "The Global Times."BILLINGSLEA: That's right.BARTIROMO: And so I'll be watching to see what they report on the nuclear situation as well.Ambassador, this is a very important subject. We hope you'll come back and continue this conversation. Thank you so much, sir.BILLINGSLEA: Thanks for having me so much.BARTIROMO: Ambassador Marshall Billingslea joining us there in Washington.Coming up, CVS Health in focus. President and CEO Larry Merlo is here to discuss second quarter earnings and the future of the company. It is among the big testers out there of Covid.Plus, dude ranch vacations. Americans getting a test of -- taste of the old west. You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, August 6. A look at markets right now, 7:32 A.M on the east coast, futures indicating a decline at the start of trading this morning, although we are well off of the lows, the DOW futures down 33 points, the NASDAQ futures down 7 and the S&P 500 down 4.5.The NASDAQ reporting its third record close in a row yesterday. The S&P 500 is within 2 percent of the new record high close. Yes, because I keep hearing myself back. Global markets this morning are mostly lower. Take a look at European indices after -- I can't, it's too much coming back at me.Bank of England warning of a slow economic recovery. It held rates steady at the meeting today at a record low, one tenth of a percent at the meeting, European indices are down across the board with the FT down 111 points right now. They keep hitting new lows this morning in Europe. The CAC is down 50 and the DAX index this morning is down 84.Let's check Asian markets here, and they are mixed. The Kospi index hit a 22 month high. It is up better than 60 percent from its March 19th low. The others, as you see, fractionally moving. Well, at least nine people are dead this morning in the wake of that massive tropical storm. Cheryl Casone now with the details, Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FBN HOST: That's right Maria, good morning.And one of the victims from Isaias was a 5-year-old girl. Police found the body of Eliza Talal near her home in Pennsylvania. Eliza who had autism, walked out of her home during the storm. Nearly three million people are still without power days after Isaias brought heavy rain, tornadoes and misery to the East Coast.Crews are working to restore service after high winds brought down trees. And then check this out, this is incredible video from New York's bravest and finest, the FDNY saved two people stranded on a boat near queens in almost zero visibility. That of course the video from inside of the cab of their fire truck. Well, check your refrigerator, the USDA is putting out a public health alert.A number of products, including salads, sold at some Walmart, Kroger, and HGB stores in five states may contain recalled onions. The affected states are Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas, and Mississippi. The onions from Thompson International may be contaminated with salmonella.Well, certain travelers headed to New York city better be ready to quarantine. They're not messing around now. Police are cracking down and setting up check points at major entry points at main bridges and tunnels, airports, even at the train stations.Right now 35 high risk infectious states and Puerto Rico who come from those states into New York City, you've got to quarantine for 14 days. If you don't, you could face a hefty fine.And then on the west coast the mayor of Los Angeles is cracking down on those who throw big house parties, threatening to cut off their utilities. Eric Garcetti authorizing the move to stop the spread of coronavirus, Maria. And those are you headlines from the news room. Back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl. Thank you so much. CVS Health posting solid second quarter earnings, also raising its outlook for the year. The drug store giant saying that it's prepared to whether the COVID-19 pandemic. Revenue from its insurance business, Aetna offsetting lower foot traffic in the stores and pharmacies.Joining me right now is the CEO and president of CVS health, Larry Merlo. Larry, it is great to have you this morning. Thanks very much for joining me. Characterize the quarter for us. Tell us what struck you most and what were the leading headlines in the quarter.LARRY MERLO, CEO AND PRESIDENT, CVS HEALTH: Well, Maria, thanks for having me and congratulations on 25 years. And Maria, the story in the quarter is really the acceleration of our strategy.You now CVS and Aetna came together about 18 months ago and we set out to make healthcare more accessible by meeting people where they are, whether it's in the community and the home or in the palm of your hand.And the pandemic has really created the need for us to accelerate that transformation. And we've seen very, very tangible and meaningful examples of that come to life. Whether it's testing in the community or what are infusion nurses are doing in the home, freeing up the important hospital bed capacity or simply the growth of tele-medicine, providing care from the palm of your hand.So we're quite proud of what our CVS product is able to do.BARTIROMO: You've done such a great job, Larry, you're overseeing many acquisitions as well as dealing with this disaster of COVID. There is some worry about test result weight times. Tell me where we stand in terms of your COVID-19 testing and -- and whether you can -- you can get those weight times down.MERLO: Yes, Maria, we saw a spike in the demand for testing coming out of the July 4th holiday. And -- and obviously that was accompanied by a spike in the turnaround times from testing.And you know those delays were -- were far too long. We took immediate action in terms of actually reducing the number of test we were doing by about 25 percent while working with our labs as they were working to increase their capacity.And you know since that time we now have four labs processing these results across the country and you know we have already seen dramatic improvements in that turnaround time.You know and I would say within the next 7 to 10 days, we'll be back in that three to four day turnaround time range.BARTIROMO: What do you see in terms of margins on -- on prescriptions, Larry? What can you tell us in terms of in store investments and response to the COVID and -- and what you're seeing at the pharmacy?MERLO: Well, Maria, one of the biggest priorities that we've had going back to March was insuring the safety and health of our colleagues and our customers. And we've certainly invested whether it's PPE or some of the protective -- I'll refer to them as barriers across the store to create, I'll say social distancing and certainly cleaning protocols.There have been schematic (ph) cost there. But again, I couldn't be prouder of the work of our colleagues in terms of what they've been able to do to continue to satisfy the needs of our -- of our customers.We have seen a dramatic increase in the utilization of home delivery for prescriptions. And again, that's another service that -- that we've been able to provide. And you know -- and Maria, when you talk about the cost of pharmaceuticals. What's -- you know what's interesting today is about 90 percent of all the prescriptions that are dispensed in the country are -- are of the generic variety.And that has proven to lower cost per plan sponsors as well as consumers. And you know our pharmacy benefit manager chair mark, over the past year, you know as we look at the work that they do with their clients.They actually held year over year growth to less than 1-1/2 percent. And importantly, they'll also reduce member out of pocket cost by 3-1/2 percent. So it's really a great story in terms of what they PBM continues to reduce the overall cost of pharmaceuticals.BARTIROMO: So tell me how the company looks different in -- in two or three years, Larry, in terms of the investments that you're planning in the second half of the year and all of the things that need to change as a result of what we're living through right now.MERLO: Well, Maria, it's really the integration of these assets as i mentioned earlier that are coming to life in meaningful ways. And the opportunity -- we all see the complexities that we face in healthcare. It's a system that is very difficult to use and navigate. We've got to make it simpler. We talk about our North Star as helping people on their path to better health.And Maria, you look today, we've got more than two-thirds of all Americans that have one or more chronic diseases. We know their names, it's diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, asthma, and it's those conditions that are accounting from 70 to 80 percent of healthcare costs.But yet, those individuals are not achieving their best health outcomes. So this combination of assets we believe can, again, make healthcare more simple and accessible in terms of how to use it, how to navigate the system. And at the same time, help people achieve a better health outcome and in doing so reduce overall healthcare costs. And, again, we're well on our way.BARTIROMO: Yes.MERLO: We have tangible evidence of that coming to life.BARTIROMO: What -- what you're saying is so important, Larry. And i know that it's certainly resonating with our audience. I mean, the key here is getting ahead of some of these diseases that ultimately will -- can send you bankrupt, costing so much money just treating some of these things that are actually preventable.Let me -- let me switch gears and ask you about facial recognition, because as you know, Rite Aid has been called -- has been called out using facial recognition software in its stores. Do you use facial recognition throughout CVS stores?MERLO: No, Maria, we -- we don't today and -- and by the way, we have no plans to do so as we think about the future.BARTIROMO: Larry, it's great to have you, sir. Thanks very much. Good to see you, Larry. Thank you, Larry Merlo. Coming up, please come back, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo desperate to get people back to New York City. What he is offering and promising if you go back to the big city.Then get back on that horse, Americans getting a taste of the old west, dude ranch vacations gaining popularity during COVID-19. Plus it's time to ask the panel. Send us your questions, ask the panel will debut later this month. Send us a video question and we may very well put it on-air by our panelists. You're watching "Mornings With Maria" live on fox business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, time for the Morning Buzz. First up, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo making a small offer, begging New Yorkers who have fled the city to come back.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): I literally talk to people all day long who are now in their Hamptons house or in their Hudson Valley house or in their Connecticut weekend house. And I say, you've got to come back. When are you coming back? We'll go to dinner. I'll buy you a drink.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joseph, with crime rising and high taxes, a possible dinner or drink, I don't know if it's going be enough. What do you think?PINION: There's clearly a theme developing here, because first he's legalized boozy ice cream, now he wants to buy everyone a drink and I think it's because you'd have to be drunk to want to return to New York State and live under the rule of King Cuomo and his exorbitant in taxes and if opposed by Mayor De Blasio or AOC running Amazon out of town. So, I-- the moral of the story is, drink up and you'll see things through rose colored Cuomo glasses.BARTIROMO: My god. Oh my god. Look, there's a bigger story here Joseph. It's getting bad. New York City is loosing revenue left and right and crime is rising in the double digits.MCDOWELL: Yes, New York City's Upper East Side reported a 286 percent increase in robberies, shootings, murder, frankly no one in this city wants to be seen with the governor in public, because he's an embarrassment and he's one of the reasons that we're suffering the way that we are right now. And all those elderly people died in nursing homes because of his order.BARTIROMO: Oh, don't forget about Mayor De Blasio, Dagen, he's up there too. Come on, I mean, when you talk about crime in New York City, look, let's talk motivation for a second. When it comes to motivation, competition rules apparently. Sixty-seven percent of workers say competing with colleagues pushes them to do a better job according to a new study.Research shows less than 50 percent of those asked says job performance reviews are helpful. Ryan, does competition motivate you?PAYNE: A hundred percent. I think if wasn't for competition I'd be the laziest man in the world. So, you know, I have the lazy gene, but I have the competitive gene and that's what basically gets me through every single day.BARTIROMO: I like it. Me too. Same. Finally this, yesterday -- yesterday was mac and cheese for breakfast. Well now it's Cheetos getting in on the game, putting out its own version of the kid favorite with three flavors. They hit Walmart shelves on Saturday.Dagen, I don't know if this is vegan. Would you try it?MCDOWELL: It's not vegan. By the way, vegan, that fake vegan cheese does make very delicious mac and cheese, because it melts really well, because it's essentially oil. What is that Cheetos, the real hot one, somebody get in my ear and tell me. The flaming hot, my mother loved flaming hot Cheetos.She used to eat bags of them and we would find -- she would get up in the middle of the night because she couldn't she sleep when she was fighting cancer and she'd walk around the house eating bags and bags of flaming hot Cheetos and there'd be Cheeto dust everywhere.And you're like, what is that all over my shirt. And it was Joyce McDowell flaming hot Cheeto dust everywhere.BARTIROMO: Joyce would like this segment right now.MCDOWELL: She would.BARTIROMO: By the way, that -- that stuff stains I feel like.MCDOWELL: It does.BARTIROMO: All right, President Trump just tweeted on mail-in -- right? President Trump just tweeted out on mail-in ballets. Here's what the president just wrote. "How can voters be sending in ballots starting, in some cases, one month before the presidential debate. Move the first debate up, a debate to me is a public service, Joe Biden and i owe it to the American people" writes the president this morning.We'll slip in a break and then we got a lot more on the other side of that. Stay with us, coming up dude ranch vacations, are you in. Americans getting a taste of the old west. We're checking it out. You're watching "Mornings With Maria" live on fox business.How about some horsing around, dude ranches spurring interest, growing in popularity this year. Grady Trimble is live this morning from Cedar Creek Ranch in Cedar Point, Illinois with more.Grady, good morning.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)GRADY TRIMBLE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, good morning Maria. I am on Carly, the horse that's drake in front of me there and Paul Williams, the owner of Cedar Creek Ranch. We're about to do a little creek crossing here for you, so bear with us. But yes, this has been big business lately. Paul, tell us what you've been seeing, people just -- city slickers like us trying to get out and explore the outdoors.PAUL WILLIAMS, OWNER, CEDAR CREEK RANCH: You know, Grady, it's been awesome. We've been able to give people an experience to come out and enjoy the outdoors, come out and be with nature. And splash through the water and see the wild west out here at Cedar Creek Ranch in Cedar Point.TRIMBLE: And you've got all sorts of options for people. If they don't want to ride a horse, they can do duck boats, ATV's, you've even got a petting zoo for the little kids. A lot of options out here.WILLIAMS: Absolutely.TRIMBLE: This isn't quite a dude ranch, but I know dude ranches have been booming as well. You don't really do overnights here, but out west, people just kind of want to control their environment. What have you seen compared to previous years? After the shutdown, things started opening back up, what happened?WILLIAMS: Yes, we're very fortunate to be back open and now that we can give people the outdoor experience, we're just a two hour drive from Chicago so people can come down for the day, spend the day on the ranch and have a great outdoor experience with our animals, with our houses and all kinds of stuff here on the ranch.TRIMBLE: And a lot of people trying to get last minute trips in while summer is still here, especially in Chicago it doesn't last too long, so trying to take advantage of it, Maria, while they can and explore the great outdoors.(END VIDEO TAPE)BARTIROMO: I love it. Looking good on that horse, Grady. Thank you so much.Who wouldn't like that? Dagen, you in?MCDOWELL: I am definitely in. So I lust after my friends' vacations on Instagram and my old friend from high school, Julie Caldwell (ph), took her family to the Sweet Grass Ranch, which is actually a working cattle ranch and it's a cattle operation that's family owned and it's a guest ranch that's out in Montana.And I am so jealous of just what they got to do in terms of it because they were literally helping work the ranch. And I'm -- I'm jealous. I'm stuck in a 500 square foot apartment and you know this place.BARTIROMO: It -- it's -- it's awesome. I mean look, you can't be on the horse on you blackberry or you phone, by the way. You go there and you lose your city slicker ways and you actually go and relax and get on the horse and enjoy the outdoors.MCDOWELL: Yes.BARTIROMO: I would love it. Thank you.MCDOWELL: You better pay attention that animal you're riding.BARTIROMO: That's true. Still ahead, business is moving. One industry seeing in a major bump for the first time in years. How the coronavirus is helping boost profits there. We're going to check it out. And then it's time for you to ask the questions. "Ask the Panel" will debut late this month.Send us a video clip of the question that you'd like answer and we'll put it on air by our panelist, more "Mornings with Maria", next live on Fox Business.Load-Date: August 6, 2020End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 27 of 599U.S. opens new fronts in China lobbying strategy  Page 29 of 599Trump's actual goal is to ban TikTok, ByteDance CEO says  Page 32 of 599American Action Forum: New Executive Order Starts the Clock on Potential TikTok Ban  Page 34 of 599Fight with China: Donald Trump sets September 15 as deadline for TikTok sale  Page 37 of 599Meet The Politician Who Lives on TikTok  Page 40 of 599The week in GRC: SEC approves Reg SK changes, and Storebrand divests over corporate lobbying  Page 42 of 599Bannon's Chinese host an irritant to Communist Party  Page 44 of 599Tik Tok files a lawsuit against the U.S. ban.  Page 46 of 599Chinese official press accuses United States of wanting to steal TikTok  Page 48 of 599Zoom doesn't want to follow in TikTok's footsteps: suspended sales of its products with China  Page 50 of 599Qingdao is together with all Chinese enterprises in taking the big test of COVID-19  Page 52 of 599The War for TikTok: China News Agency's Hard Column  Page 54 of 599U.S. blacklists 24 Chinese firms, escalating military and trade tensions  Page 57 of 599The US has lots to lose and little to gain by banning TikTok and WeChat  Page 59 of 599New problems arise for TikTok: you can't sell your assets without China's approval  Page 61 of 599International Republican Institute: Report Exposes China-Linked Disinformation Targeting Taiwan's Presidential Election and COVID-19 Response  Page 63 of 599Tik Tok sale is at risk over new restrictions in China for technology export  Page  of Sen.
