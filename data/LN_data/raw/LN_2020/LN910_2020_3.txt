China proposes global data protection standardsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 8, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 585 wordsBody(Bloomberg) -- China on Tuesday presented a list of rules to prevent foreign governments from acquiring nationally stored data, in an attempt to counter Washington's accusations that services such as TikTok and WeChat share confidential user information with Beijing.Foreign Minister Wang Yi revealed proposals for global data security after addressing the plan with the Group of 20 last week, part of China's attempt to set global standards for the digital sphere. They involve prohibiting governments from gaining access to data acquired by business operations abroad, according to a statement published on the ministry's website.The rules support Beijing's concept of data sovereignty, or limit the flow of information across borders, an idea that is gaining momentum as concerns about national security increase. The Trump Administration has banned ByteDance Ltd. from TikTok and WeChat from Tencent Holdings Ltd., and sanctioned Huawei Technologies Co., accusing them of sharing U.S. data with the Chinese government."To reduce the deficit in global digital governance, countries face a pressing need to intensify communication and coordination, build mutual trust and deepen cooperation between them," Wang said in the communiqué.Washington's measures against TikTok and WeChat underscore how the concept of internet decoupling is becoming a reality. Data control, from private details such as locations and emails to sophisticated extracted information such as personal profiles and online behavior, is a key facet of China's broader cyber-sovereignty concept.The world's second-largest economy already requires foreign companies to store data nationwide, which is why companies like Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. have developed massive data center operations along with local partners.The Trump administration has sought to establish "clean networks" to prevent China from accessing user data, arguing that Chinese law forces companies to share information with authorities in Beijing. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo highlighted the lack of confidence in last month's comments.'Distrust them'"You have to distrust them," Pompeo said when asked if the U.S. can trust China. "You have to question everything they say. You have to go check it out when you make a promise."Currently, there are few global standards governing cross-border data flows. China wants to fill the void, saying it is willing to contribute its "wisdom." Data security must be viewed "objectively and rationally" to keep "global supply chains open, secure and stable," he said.Under the proposal, Beijing will not require Chinese companies to share foreign transaction data in violation of the laws of another country. Information technology would not be used to damage other countries' critical infrastructure or steal important data, the ministry said. Tech companies would not incorporate backdoors into their products and services to illegally obtain user data, something Washington has accused of doing to Huawei in particular, and which the Chinese company has repeatedly denied.The plan also advocates measures to prevent and curb personal data breaches, and said technology should not be abused to conduct large-scale surveillance of other countries or illegally collect personal information from citizens. Access to cross-border data bypolice must be resolved through judicial assistance and other channels, as proposed. Original Note:China Proposes Global Data Rules to Counter U.S. Moves on TikTok©2020 Bloomberg L.P.Load-Date: September 9, 2020End of Document

China moves forward with digital currency plansUPIOctober 27, 2020 Tuesday 1:30 PM ESTCopyright 2020 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 342 wordsByline: ELIZABETH SHIMDateline: Oct. 27 BodyChina is one step closer to issuing the world's first digital currency following trials in several cities and the passage of a draft law on Friday.The People's Bank of China is to issue the country's sovereign digital currency, officially referred to as the Digital Currency Electronic Payment system. The payments can be converted like cash, the South China Morning Post reported Tuesday.China's DCEP will have no domestic competitors, according to Mu Changchun, head of digital currency research at China's central bank. Services in China including WeChat Pay and Alipay are only electronic wallets, the official said, according to the Post.DCEP's "centralized management will be good to fight against cryptocurrencies and global stable coins and prevent their erosion of currency-issuance rights," Mu said.China's central bank "will also face anti-counterfeit issues in the digital era, and...lower the cost" of use for citizens across the tech divide, the official said.The Chinese government has reportedly been conducting trials with digital currency in four cities. In Shenzhen, a major Chinese city adjacent to Hong Kong, authorities gave out $1.5 million worth of digital currency in 50,000 packets to local residents, or about $30 each. The giveaway earlier this month was available to spend at 3,389 designated businesses, according to China Central Television.China has typically undervalued its currency to lower the price of exports and gain an edge in global markets, but it has also been importing more goods from the United States.Chinese news service Caixin reported Tuesday China imported nearly 3.9 million tons of U.S. crude oil in September, a 652.41% increase year-on-year.Report of the data from Chinese customs comes after the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said progress has been made in implementing agricultural provisions in the Phase One Agreement between the two countries.China has implemented at least 50 of the 57 technical commitments under the Phase One Agreement, the U.S. office said in statement on Friday.Load-Date: October 27, 2020End of Document

Successful TikTok platform becomes focus of US-China warCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 26, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 585 wordsBodyThe TikTok platform, known for its short-format videos popular with teenagers, has become a global social media sensation and, at the same time, the epicenter of a geopolitical war between the United States and China.The President of the United States has assured that the application is a risk to national security, as, according to Trump, TikTok and his Chinese parent, ByteDance, give Beijing's intelligence services the information they collect from their users.The executive order of the representatives prohibits further downloads of TikTok from Sunday and will vetate its final use in the United States from November 12 unless an agreement materializes to restructure your property.- 700 million users -TikTok has had about 2 billion downloads and is estimated to be 700 million, making it one of the great players in the social media space.He is known for his short videos, 15 to 60 seconds, many of them with dances, parodies or comments on the news. Filters and special effects can be added.The coronavirus pandemic has helped TikTok expand its base beyond smartphone users as new content types and popular "influencers" join the platform.Created in 2016 under the name Muscal.ly, the app was acquired by ByteDance in 2017 and renamed as the global version of the Chinese application known as Douyin.According to the company, TikTok has 100 million users in the United States alone, with 50 million of them using it every day. Before July, when information about a possible crash began circulating, TikTok added 400,000 U.S. users each day.- Espionage threats? -While his outlandish videos seem harmless, TikTok has provoked questions about potential security threats.Republican Senator Marco Rubio requested an investigation into TikTok's ties to Chinese authorities in 2019, and in 2020, the Department of Defense asked all of its staff to eliminate the app.TikTok has denied being tied to the Chinese government and claims that its servers are inaccessible to Beijing."We store all US user data in the United States, backed up in Singapore," TikTok said in a recent statement."TikTok's data centers are located completely outside China."But an executive order from the White House in August stated that TikTok "automatically captures vast swaths of information from its users" and that this "threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party to access american-owned and personal information."This, according to the White House, could allow China to "track the location of federal employees and contractors, build records of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage."- Achieve an agreement -Trump has tried to get TikTok out of Chinese control and has given his blessing to an agreement that would make Silicon Valley giant Oracle the data partner for the app.It is not yet clear whether Beijing would approve such an agreement, the terms of which are unclear.One of the crucial details is what would happen to TikTok's recommendation algorithm, which is seen as the key to its success.The system uses machine learning to determine user preferences and deliver videos to keep people involved, but without too much repetition.China last month issued new rules that would prevent the export of artificial intelligence algorithms and technologies.ByteDance has claimed that it would keep controlOracle could simply inspect the data and source code for security flaws. Trump has said he won't accept an agreement that allows China to maintain control of TikTok.dt-juj-rl/ch/mps/dgaLoad-Date: September 27, 2020End of Document

US bans WeChat, TikTok from app stores citing security riskThe Vista: University of Central OklahomaSeptember 18, 2020 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 760 wordsBodyThe U.S. Commerce Department said Friday it will ban Chinese-owned TikTok and WeChat from U.S. app stores on Sunday and will saddle the apps with technical restrictions that could seriously limit their functionality in the U.S.The order, which cited national security and data privacy concerns, follows weeks of dealmaking over the video-sharing service TikTok. President Donald Trump has pressured the app's Chinese owner to sell TikTok's U.S. operations to a domestic company. It is not clear how the latest prohibitions will affect a deal recently struck by California tech giant Oracle aimed at satisfying U.S. concerns over TikTok's data collection and related issues.TikTok expressed "disappointment" over the move and said it would continue to challenge President Donald Trump's "unjust executive order." The Commerce Department is enacting an order announced by President Donald Trump in August. TikTok sued to stop that ban.Google and Apple, the owners of the major mobile app stores, did not immediately reply to questions. Neither did WeChat owner Tencent. Oracle, which has proposed a deal with TikTok aimed at averting such a ban, also did not reply."At the President's direction, we have taken significant action to combat China's malicious collection of American citizens' personal data, while promoting our national values, democratic rules-based norms, and aggressive enforcement of U.S. laws and regulations," Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a prepared statement.The action is the Trump administration's latest attempt to counter the influence of China, a rising economic superpower. Since taking office in 2017, Trump has waged a trade war with China, blocked mergers involving Chinese companies and stifled the business of Chinese firms like Huawei, a maker of phones and telecom equipment.China-backed hackers, meanwhile, have been blamed for data breaches of U.S. federal databases and the credit agency Equifax, and the Chinese government strictly limits what U.S. tech companies can do in China.The order requires WeChat, which has millions of U.S. users who rely on the app to stay in touch and conduct business with people and companies in China, to end payments through its service as of Sunday and prohibits it from getting technical services from vendors that could seriously impact its functions.Similar technical limitations for TikTok don't go into effect until Nov. 12, shortly after the U.S. election. Ross said early Friday on Fox Business Network that access to that app may be possible if certain safeguards are put into place. TikTok says it has 100 million U.S. users and 700 million globally.Nicholas Weaver, a computer science lecturer at UC Berkeley, said the actions taking effect Sunday are short-sighted and suggest that "the U.S. is not to be trusted and not a friendly place for business." Users, meanwhile, face a security "nightmare" because they won't be able to get app updates that fix bugs and security vulnerabilities, he said.WeChat users have sued to stop the ban, and a federal judge in California appeared sympathetic to WeChat users in a hearing Thursday, but did not issue an injunction against the government. The Justice Department had said in a filing in that case that they would not target WeChat users with criminal or civil penalties for using the app for messaging.Like most social networks, TikTok, owned by China's ByteDance, collects user data and moderates users' posts. It grabs users' locations and messages and tracks what they watch to figure out how best to target ads to them.Similar concerns apply to U.S.-based social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, but Chinese ownership adds an extra wrinkle because the Chinese government could demand cooperation from Chinese companies. The administration has provided no specific evidence that TikTok has made U.S. users' data available to the Chinese government, leading several cybersecurity experts to question whether the administration's efforts are more political efforts against China than tied to concern about data security."If there are direct national security threats, that information should be shared with the U.S. population," said David Kennedy, CEO of cybersecurity firm TrustedSec, before the Commerce Department's regulations were announced. "We're not taking about what needs to happen policy-wise, we're trying to hack this together to hurt China."TikTok says it does not store U.S. user data in China and that it would not give user data to the government, and does not censor videos per dictates from China.Load-Date: September 18, 2020End of Document

US bans WeChat, TikTok from app stores, threatens shutdownsAssociated Press Financial WireSeptember 18, 2020 Friday 10:24 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; DOMESTIC NEWS; POLITICAL NEWSLength: 955 wordsByline: TALI ARBEL, MATT O'BRIEN and MATT OTT, AP Technology WritersBodyThe U.S. Commerce Department said Friday it will ban Chinese-owned TikTok and WeChat from U.S. app stores on Sunday and will bar the apps from accessing essential internet services in the U.S. — a move that could effectively wreck the operation of both Chinese services for U.S. users.TikTok won't face the most drastic sanctions until after the Nov. 3 election, but WeChat users could feel the effects as early as Sunday.The order, which cited national security and data privacy concerns, follows weeks of dealmaking over the video-sharing service TikTok. President Donald Trump has pressured the app's Chinese owner to sell TikTok's U.S. operations to a domestic company to satisfy U.S. concerns over TikTok’s data collection and related issues.California tech giant Oracle recently struck a deal with TikTok along those lines, although details remain foggy and the administration is still reviewing it. Trump said Friday said he was open to a deal, noting that “we have some great options and maybe we can keep a lot of people happy,” suggesting that even Microsoft, which said its TikTok bid had been rejected, might continue to be involved, as well as Oracle and Walmart.Trump noted that TikTok was “very, very popular," said “we have to have the total security from China," and added that “we can do a combination of both.”The new order puts pressure on TikTok's owner, ByteDance, to make further concessions, said James Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Trump had said this week that he does not like the idea of ByteDance keeping majority control of TikTok.TikTok expressed “disappointment” over the move and said it would continue to challenge President Donald Trump's “unjust executive order.” The Commerce Department is enacting an order announced by President Donald Trump in August. TikTok sued to stop that ban.WeChat owner Tencent said in an emailed statement that it will continue to discuss ways to address concerns with the government and look for long-term solutions.Google and Apple, the owners of the major mobile app stores, did not immediately reply to questions. Oracle also did not reply.“At the President’s direction, we have taken significant action to combat China’s malicious collection of American citizens’ personal data, while promoting our national values, democratic rules-based norms, and aggressive enforcement of U.S. laws and regulations," Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a prepared statement.The action is the Trump administration’s latest attempt to counter the influence of China, a rising economic superpower.

US bans WeChat, TikTok from app stores, threatens shutdownsThe Telegraph (Nashua, New Hampshire)September 19, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 The TelegraphDistributed by Tribune Content AgencySection: BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWSLength: 983 wordsByline: The Telegraph, Nashua, N.H.BodySept. 19--     Sep. 19--The U.S. Commerce Department said Friday it will ban Chinese-owned TikTok and WeChat from U.S. app stores on Sunday and will bar the apps from accessing essential internet services in the U.S. -- a move that could effectively wreck the operation of both Chinese services for U.S. users.TikTok won't face the most drastic sanctions until after the Nov. 3 election, but WeChat users could feel the effects as early as Sunday.The order, which cited national security and data privacy concerns, follows  weeks of dealmaking over the video-sharing service TikTok. President Donald Trump has pressured the app's Chinese owner to sell TikTok's U.S. operations to a domestic company to satisfy U.S. concerns over TikTok's data collection and related issues.California tech giant Oracle recently struck a deal with TikTok along those lines, although details remain foggy and the administration is still reviewing it. Trump said Friday said he was open to a deal, noting that "we have some great options and maybe we can keep a lot of people happy," suggesting that even Microsoft, which said its TikTok bid had been rejected, might continue to be involved, as well as Oracle and Walmart.Trump noted that TikTok was "very, very popular," said "we have to have the total security from China," and added that "we can do a combination of both."The new order puts pressure on TikTok's owner, ByteDance, to make further concessions, said James Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Trump had said this week that he does not like the idea of ByteDance keeping majority control of TikTok.TikTok expressed "disappointment" over the move and said it would continue to challenge President Donald Trump's "unjust executive order." The Commerce Department is enacting an order announced by President Donald Trump in August. TikTok sued to stop that ban.WeChat owner Tencent said in an emailed statement that it will continue to discuss ways to address concerns with the government and look for long-term solutions.Google and Apple, the owners of the major mobile app stores, did not immediately reply to questions. Oracle also did not reply."At the President's direction, we have taken significant action to combat China's malicious collection of American citizens' personal data, while promoting our national values, democratic rules-based norms, and aggressive enforcement of U.S. laws and regulations," Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a prepared statement.The action is the Trump administration's latest attempt to counter the influence of China, a rising economic superpower. Since taking office in 2017, Trump has waged a trade war with China, blocked mergers involving Chinese companies and stifled the business of Chinese firms like Huawei, a maker of phones and telecom equipment.China-backed hackers, meanwhile, have been blamed for data breaches of U.S. federal databases and the credit agency Equifax, and the Chinese government strictly limits what U.S. tech companies can do in China.The order requires WeChat, which has millions of U.S. users who rely on the app to stay in touch and conduct business with people and companies in China, to end payments for business transactions through its service as of Sunday and prohibits it from obtaining vital technical services from vendors. The Justice Department said in a filing that it would not target users with criminal or civil penalties for messaging on the app.WeChat users have sued to stop the ban, and a federal judge in California on Friday set an emergency hearing for Saturday at 1:30 p.m. Pacific time.Similar technical limitations for TikTok don't go into effect until Nov. 12, shortly after the U.S. election. Ross said early Friday on Fox Business Network that access to that app may be possible if certain safeguards are put into place.

US judge sets up fresh roadblock in Pres Trump bid to ban China's TikTok ASEAN TribuneOctober 31, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 ASEAN Tribune All Rights ReservedLength: 343 wordsBody 31 October 2020 (NAM NEWS NETWORK) A US federal judge issued an injunction temporarily blocking an executive order by President Donald Trump aimed at banning TikTok, throwing up a legal roadblock ahead of a Nov 12 deadline.The order would have knocked the Chinese-owned video-sharing app offline by cutting it off from US businesses providing website hosting, data storage and other fundamentals needed to operate.But TikTok influencers suing the president over the ban convinced US District Court Wendy Beetlestone to issue the injunction against it.It is the second restraint issued in favor of TikTok by US judges against a set of executive orders issued by Trump which sought to ban new downloads of the app beginning in September, and ban it outright by Nov 12.A temporary injunction issued in September in a separate suit filed by TikTok itself prevented the government from removing it from mobile application download platforms.Judges in both cases said in rulings that the chances of proving in court that Trump overstepped his authority were good.They also equated TikTok to films, photographs, and news wires with legal protections.Beetlestone noted in her ruling that concerns expressed by the US in justifying the ban were expressed hypothetically.Trump's administration has insisted on a need to ban TikTok, which has 100 million users in the US, due to national security concerns.The White House claims TikTok has links to the Chinese government through its parent firm ByteDance.TikTok has repeatedly defended itself against allegations of data transfers to the Chinese government.It says its servers where user information is stored are located in the United States and Singapore.The company has also said the ban is unnecessary since negotiations are underway to restructure the ownership of TikTok to address national security issues raised by the administration.A tentative deal has been unveiled that would make Silicon Valley giant Oracle the technology partner for TikTok and a stakeholder in a new entity to be known as TikTok Global. Load-Date: November 2, 2020End of Document

US weighs on restricting use of Chinese payment platforms Alipay and WeChat PayCE Noticias Financieras EnglishOctober 8, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 475 wordsBodyFollowing his assault on ByteDance-owned TikTok and WeChat, Tencent's courier, U.S. President Donald Trump's administration wants to go further and sets its sights on two payment services in China. According to Bloomberg, its officials propose to restrict the use of Alipay, part of Ant Group, and WeChat Pay, owned by Tencent, claiming that both digital platforms pose a risk to the country's national security.If this process continues, the most immediate impact would be on Ant Group, which plans to trade simultaneously in Shanghai and Hong Kong, in a IPO that many already outline will become the world's largest public offering for sale (OPV), grossing approximately $35 billion. The company of Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba, points to a valuation of $250 billion, making it one of the most valuable financial firms in the world, even ahead of Bank of America.U.S. officials have been concerned about the growing popularity of Alipay and WeChat Pay internationally, which gives China unprecedented access to bank details that could ultimately also include personal information about hundreds of millions of Americans.At first, Alipay's foray into the U.S. market was limited to places busiest by Chinese consumers, such as luxury stores in New York. However, last year, the payment platform reached agreements with multiple home retailers, such as the Walgreens pharmacy chain, exposing its service to millions of U.S. consumers.At the same time, in November, Visa and Mastercard announced agreements that allow their cards to be added to the WeChat Pay and Alipay wallets, making it easier for foreign cardholders to buy in China, where apps already dominate all forms of e-commerce and conventional.It should be remembered how the Trump administration has already taken steps to ban WeChat and TikTok in the US. ByteDance, the parent company of the popular video app, reached an agreement with Oracle and Walmart to form a new company, US-based TikTok Global, to allow its services to continue operating normally. However, both the US and Chinese governments must still offer their final verdict to this operation. Meanwhile, bans on downloading both apps on U.S. platforms activated by the U.S. Department of Commerce were blocked by several federal judges. On November 4, there is a hearing scheduled for a magistrate to decide whether or not to allow the Trump Administration to prohibit transactions with TikTok.Trump also added Chinese telecom giant Huawei to the Department of Commerce's blacklist in mid-2019 also citing national security concerns and banned U.S. companies from operating with the company in May. Last August, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced his initiative, "Clean Network," which seeks to take strong action against Chinese applications and services.commentsforum0WhatsApp  Facebook  TwitterLinkedin       Load-Date: October 9, 2020End of Document

US bans Chinese TikTok and WeChat apps from SundayCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 18, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 288 wordsBodyDownloads of Chinese TikTok and WeChat apps will be banned in the United States starting Sunday,commerce said Friday citing threats to "national security.""The Communist Party of China has shown that it has the means and intent to use these applications to threaten U.S. national security, foreign policy, and the economy,"the U.S. department said in a statement.The United States thus meets the threat posed by president Donald Trumpagainst these two Chinese applications, against a back-to-back of great tensions between the two economic giants.Washington leaves, however, an open door for TikTok,a very popular app among young people to share short videos, before banning it altogether from operating on its territory."The president leaves until November 12 to resolve TikTok's national security issues. Bans could be lifted if necessary,"Commerce said.TikTok, which belongs to the Chinese group ByteDance, had been operating under conditions in the United States since early August.Trump, who accuses him of spying for the Chinese government, then signed a decree to demand the sale of his U.S. activities by September 20, under penalty of ban in the country.American giants Microsoft and Walmart made an offer to buy those TikTok activities, but ByteDance turned it down on Sunday.California's Oracle software group submitted an offer to become TikTok's "trusted technology partner," although no details have been disclosed."Although the threats posed by WeChat and TikTok are not identical, they are similar. Each collects significant amounts of user data,"Commerce noted.The WeChat platform, which belongs to chinese giant Tencent,is ubiquitous in chinese life for messaging, remote payments and bookings, among other uses.Load-Date: September 19, 2020End of Document

Trump Backs Proposed Deal to Keep TikTok Operating In U.S.BillboardSeptember 21, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Prometheus Global Media, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; TAGLength: 918 wordsByline: Associated PressHighlight: The popular video-sharing app TikTok will partner with Oracle and Walmart and form a U.S. company.BodyPresident Donald Trump said Saturday he's given his "blessing" to a proposed deal that would see the popular video-sharing app TikTok partner with Oracle and Walmart and form a U.S. company.Trump has targeted Chinese-owned TikTok for national security and data privacy concerns in the latest flashpoint in the rising tensions between Washington and Beijing. The president's support for a deal comes just a day after the Commerce Department announced restrictions that if put in place could eventually make it nearly impossible for TikTok's legions of younger fans to use the app.Trump said if completed the deal would create a new company likely to be based in Texas."I have given the deal my blessing," he said. "If they get it done, that's great. If they don't, that's OK too."Trump said the new company will be hiring at least 25,000 people and making a $5 billion contribution to a fund dedicated to education for Americans. "That's their contribution that I've been asking for," he said.TikTok said Oracle and Walmart could acquire up to a cumulative 20% stake in the new company in a financing round to be held before an initial public offering of stock, which Walmart said could happen within the next year. Oracle's stake would be 12.5%, and Walmart's would be 7.5%, the companies said in separate statements.The deal will make Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok's U.S. user data and securing computer systems to ensure U.S. national security requirements are satisfied. Walmart said it will provide its ecommerce, fulfillment, payments and other services to the new company."We are pleased that the proposal by TikTok, Oracle, and Walmart will resolve the security concerns of the U.S. administration and settle questions around TikTok's future in the U.S.," TikTok said in a statement.Trump has been demanding that the U.S. operations of TikTok be sold to a U.S. company or else be shut down. He's also been targeting WeChat, another Chinese-owned app.The administration contends that the user data collected by the two apps could be shared with the Chinese government. On Saturday, Trump said the U.S.-based TikTok "will have nothing to do with China." TikTok says it has 100 million U.S. users.On Friday, the U.S. Commerce Department said it would bar TikTok from U.S. app stores as of late Sunday. Further restrictions that would prevent TikTok from accessing essential internet services in the country would go into effect on Nov. 12. Commerce said Saturday that it will delay the barring of TikTok from U.S. app stores until Sept. 27 at 11:59 p.m.Commerce is imposing similar restrictions on WeChat, although all of the restrictions on that app are set to go into effect Sunday night at 11:59 p.m.Earlier Saturday, WeChat users asked a U.S. judge to block the government's actions, saying they would restrict free speech. WeChat is an all-in-one app with instant-messaging, social media and other communication tools. The U.S. government argued that it is not restricting free speech because WeChat users still "are free to speak on alternative platforms that do not pose a national security threat."U.S. Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler asked lawyers for the government and WeChat users whether the prohibitions would cripple WeChat as soon as the clock ticked from Sunday night into Monday morning without a resolution. An attorney for the government said they would likely lead to a "degradation" of WeChat over time.Judge Beeler did not rule immediately on the motion.WeChat has millions of U.S. users who rely on the app to stay in touch and conduct business with people and companies in China and around the world. In court filings, the founder of the Mental Health Association for Chinese Communities, who is a U.S. citizen in California, said that the group's primary tool to reach out and provide services to Chinese Americans is WeChat."Since many of the Chinese community members we serve are not fluent in English, WeChat is the only online tool that they rely on," Elaine Peng said.The Trump administration's aggressive tactics are part of its latest attempt to counter the influence of China, a rising economic superpower. Since taking office in 2017, Trump has waged a trade war with China, blocked mergers involving Chinese companies and stifled the business of Chinese firms like Huawei, a maker of phones and telecom equipment.China-backed hackers, meanwhile, have been blamed for data breaches of U.S. federal databases and the credit agency Equifax, and the Chinese government strictly limits what U.S. tech companies can do in China.China's ministry of commerce condemned the U.S. moves and urged it to stop what it called bullying behavior. It also said China may take "necessary measures" to protect Chinese companies.The U.S. Treasury Department said Saturday that TikTok's deal still needs to close with Oracle and Walmart, and it also needs documentation and conditions to be approved by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.That, of course, also leaves the potential for more roller coasters of emotion for TikTok users, such as Haley Hoffman Smith, a 24-year-old who moved to Manhattan this year to pursue her dream of becoming a talk-show host. She said she had just hit 100,000 followers on TikTok and was crushed on Friday to hear it may be headed for a shutdown."TikTok is an inextricable part of my dream chasing story," she said, "and to lose it forever would not only be an inconvenient setback, but an absolute heartbreak."Link to ImageLoad-Date: September 21, 2020End of Document

The Nasdaq Composite increased 0.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 finished flat.The S&P 500 started the day lower by 0.9%, extending the month's pullback and briefly turning negative for the year, before the dip buyers stepped in. By the afternoon, the benchmark index was up 1.3% but sellers regained control on no specific news. The inability to sustain another rebound was disappointing for the bulls but not necessarily bearish.Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished in positive territory, even as declining issues edged out advancing issues at both the NYSE and Nasdaq. The utilities (+1.2%), consumer staples (+0.8%), and information technology (+0.6%) sectors outperformed in a defensive-minded trade that excluded the health care sector (-0.5%).Generally, investors remained nervous about election volatility, the prospects for another fiscal relief bill, the trajectory of the coronavirus, and U.S.-China relations. On stimulus, House Speaker Pelosi (D-CA) will reportedly introduce a $2.4 trillion relief bill, but it's unlikely to have the support of Republicans.Regarding the economy, the labor market remained in poor standing as weekly jobless claims increased by 4,000 to 870,000 (Briefing.com consensus 825,000). New home sales, however, rose 4.8% m/m in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.011 million (Briefing.com consensus 875,000) -- its highest rate since November 2006.Interestingly, a pair of analysts turned bullish on some battered financial stocks. Goldman Sachs (GS 195.11, +8.99, +4.8%) was upgraded to Buy from Hold at UBS, and Wells Fargo (WFC 23.32, +0.49, +2.2%) was added to the Fresh Pick List at Robert W. Baird.U.S. Treasuries traded within another narrow range and closed little changed. The 2-yr yield was unchanged at 0.13%, and the 10-yr yield decreased one basis point to 0.67%.

WTI crude futures gained 0.9%, or $0.37, to $40.31/bbl.Reviewing Thursday's economic data:Jobless claims for the week ending September 19 increased by 4,000 to 870,000 (Briefing.com consensus 825,000) while continuing claims for the week ending September 12 decreased by 167,000 to 12.580 million.The key takeaway from the report is that initial jobless claims remain at stunningly high levels that point to the ongoing challenges U.S. businesses face getting back on a pre-pandemic track. In the same period a year ago, initial jobless claims were 215,000.New home sales in August did something they haven't done since November 2006 -- exceed a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.0 million. Specifically, they rose 4.8% m/m to 1.011 million (Briefing.com consensus 875,000) and were up 43.2% yr/yr.The key takeaway from the report is that it reflects strong demand for new homes at more affordable price points, as the South region, which is the largest homebuilding region and features lower average prices, saw sales increase 13.4% m/m.Looking ahead, investors will receive Durable Goods Orders for August on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +18.9% YTDS&P 500 +0.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -6.0% YTDRussell 2000 -13.0% YTD16:21BMY Bristol-Myers: Phase 3 CheckMate -274 trial met primary endpoints of improving disease-free survival vs placebo (58.25 -0.74)Bristol Myers Squibb today announced that CheckMate -274, a pivotal Phase 3 trial evaluating Opdivo (nivolumab) after surgery in patients with high-risk, muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma, met its primary endpoints of improving disease-free survival (DFS) versus placebo in both all randomized patients and in patients whose tumor cells express PD-L1 > or =1% (programmed death-ligand 1).

On September 11, the company learned that subsidiaries of Signature that lease facilities from the company will be issued an audit report containing a qualified opinion due to substantial doubt about their ability to continue as a going concern in relation to the uncertainty around future cashflows caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.To date, Sabra has received no rent relief requests from either Genesis or Signature, and both tenants remain current on their rental obligations.

The Nasdaq Composite increased 0.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 finished flat.The S&P 500 started the day lower by 0.9%, extending the month's pullback and briefly turning negative for the year, before the dip buyers stepped in. By the afternoon, the benchmark index was up 1.3% but sellers regained control on no specific news. The inability to sustain another rebound was disappointing for the bulls but not necessarily bearish.Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished in positive territory, even as declining issues edged out advancing issues at both the NYSE and Nasdaq. The utilities (+1.2%), consumer staples (+0.8%), and information technology (+0.6%) sectors outperformed in a defensive-minded trade that excluded the health care sector (-0.5%).Generally, investors remained nervous about election volatility, the prospects for another fiscal relief bill, the trajectory of the coronavirus, and U.S.-China relations. On stimulus, House Speaker Pelosi (D-CA) will reportedly introduce a $2.4 trillion relief bill, but it's unlikely to have the support of Republicans.Regarding the economy, the labor market remained in poor standing as weekly jobless claims increased by 4,000 to 870,000 (Briefing.com consensus 825,000). New home sales, however, rose 4.8% m/m in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.011 million (Briefing.com consensus 875,000) -- its highest rate since November 2006.Interestingly, a pair of analysts turned bullish on some battered financial stocks. Goldman Sachs (GS 195.11, +8.99, +4.8%) was upgraded to Buy from Hold at UBS, and Wells Fargo (WFC 23.32, +0.49, +2.2%) was added to the Fresh Pick List at Robert W. Baird.U.S. Treasuries traded within another narrow range and closed little changed. The 2-yr yield was unchanged at 0.13%, and the 10-yr yield decreased one basis point to 0.67%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 94.33. WTI crude futures gained 0.9%, or $0.37, to $40.31/bbl.Reviewing Thursday's economic data:Jobless claims for the week ending September 19 increased by 4,000 to 870,000 (Briefing.com consensus 825,000) while continuing claims for the week ending September 12 decreased by 167,000 to 12.580 million.The key takeaway from the report is that initial jobless claims remain at stunningly high levels that point to the ongoing challenges U.S. businesses face getting back on a pre-pandemic track. In the same period a year ago, initial jobless claims were 215,000.New home sales in August did something they haven't done since November 2006 -- exceed a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.0 million. Specifically, they rose 4.8% m/m to 1.011 million (Briefing.com consensus 875,000) and were up 43.2% yr/yr.The key takeaway from the report is that it reflects strong demand for new homes at more affordable price points, as the South region, which is the largest homebuilding region and features lower average prices, saw sales increase 13.4% m/m.Looking ahead, investors will receive Durable Goods Orders for August on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +18.9% YTDS&P 500 +0.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -6.0% YTDRussell 2000 -13.0% YTD16:21BMY Bristol-Myers: Phase 3 CheckMate -274 trial met primary endpoints of improving disease-free survival vs placebo (58.25 -0.74)Bristol Myers Squibb today announced that CheckMate -274, a pivotal Phase 3 trial evaluating Opdivo (nivolumab) after surgery in patients with high-risk, muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma, met its primary endpoints of improving disease-free survival (DFS) versus placebo in both all randomized patients and in patients whose tumor cells express PD-L1 > or =1% (programmed death-ligand 1).

There is some modest strength in the Nasdaq, helped by some modest gains in technology stocks, but the broader market is relatively flat as there hasn't been much conviction on the part of investors.Early trading ranges are narrower than they were yesterday, but there has still been a fair bit of chop within the narrow ranges.The lack of conviction can easily be attributed to feelings of uncertainty over some key issues (e.g. politics, growth prospects), but the volatile trading activity implies that no particular move can be taken for granted. Trends can shift in a hurry, particularly with month-end and quarter-end rebalancing efforts as part of the equation.To wit, the S&P 500 hit a session low of 3228.44 close to 10:15 a.m. ET, but traded back up to a session high of 3253.44 only 15 minutes later on no news at all. Such is the nature of the stock market beast at the moment.Five sectors are trading higher and six sectors are trading lower. The only sector with a move of at least 1.0% is the energy sector (-1.1%), which has been brutalized this week. Including today's loss, the sector is down 9.5% for the week.The Nasdaq Composite is up 0.6%; the Russell 2000 is up 0.5%; the S&P 500 is up 0.1%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is flat.10:31SOXX Industry Briefing: Chipmakers (290.54 -0.71)The PHLX Semiconductor Index (-0.3%) started today's session behind the broader market but it is rallying of its opening low.

Another ten group components show losses of 1.0% or more while the remaining listings trade closer to their flat lines.Notable movers:Micron (MU 48.44, -1.03, -2.0%): weakest performer in the group, falling back below its 200-day moving average (49.45) toward its 50-day moving average (48.00). ASML (ASML 354.90, -5.26, -1.5%): slipping to its lowest level in over two weeks. Microchip (MCHP 96.37, -1.38, -1.4%): dipping below its 200-day moving average (96.51). Applied Materials (AMAT 57.41, -0.38, -0.7%): remaining below its 200-day moving average (57.92). Analog Devices (ADI 111.57, -1.11, -1.0%): touched a two-month low before narrowing its loss. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSM 77.98, -0.40, -0.5%): dipping back below its 50-day moving average (78.54). Company plans to begin production of 3nm chips in 2022.

On September 11, the company learned that subsidiaries of Signature that lease facilities from the company will be issued an audit report containing a qualified opinion due to substantial doubt about their ability to continue as a going concern in relation to the uncertainty around future cashflows caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.To date, Sabra has received no rent relief requests from either Genesis or Signature, and both tenants remain current on their rental obligations. As of June 30, Sabra's exposure to Signature was 7.2% of Sabra's annualized cash NOI, and its exposure to Genesis was 2.5% of Sabra's annualized cash NOI exclusive of residual rents from previously completed sales representing 2.0% of Sabra's annualized cash NOI. Sabra and its auditors are evaluating the circumstances giving rise to the going concern issues for these tenants.In the event it transitions the leases with these tenants to cash-basis accounting, it would write-off approx. $14.4 mln of straight-line rental receivables and lease-related intangible assets, which would be recorded as a reduction to rental revenues but would have no impact on Normalized FFO, AFFO, Normalized AFFO, and distributable cash flow.09:05HA Hawaiian Holdings to offer guests drive-through pre-travel COVID-19 tests (12.40 )08:54QURE uniQure CORRECTION: Co reported "no significant safety concerns were noted to prevent further dosing of Phase I/II clinical trial of AMT-130" (37.16 )Our prior comment incorrectly said there were safety concerns.

Canadian Solar Inc., Case No. 4:20-cv-02169-JST (N.D. Cal.). Canadian Solar countersued with claims requesting that the Court declare, as Canadian Solar believes, that: (1) none of the products at issue in the case infringe the Solaria patents; (2) Solaria withheld key evidence from the U.S. Patent Office when seeking its patents; and (3) this, among other reasons, renders the asserted claims both invalid and unenforceable.07:02TELA TELA Bio presents additional data from BRAVO study of OviTex for ventral hernia repair (15.27 )The first poster titled, "Surgical site infections and occurrences (SSIs & SSOs) after ventral hernia repair (VHR) with reinforced tissue matrix (RTM), 30-day data from the BRAVO study," demonstrated that ventral hernia repair using OviTex led to a low incidence of surgical site infections and occurrences. Among patients who experienced an SSO or SSI at 30 days, none required surgical intervention or implant removal. The study consisted of 85 subjects, of which 75% met the criteria for Ventral Hernia Working Group (VHWG) grade 2 or grade 3. Over 50% of the patients were obese, over one-third had undergone a previous ventral hernia repair, and 16% had a history of surgical infections. No patient experienced a hernia recurrence within the first 30-days.The second poster, "Final outcomes of the initial 20 subjects reaching two year follow up in the BRAVO Ventral Hernia Study," is the first look at long-term outcomes data for the initial 20 patients who had ventral hernia repair using OviTex. Among these patients, no patient experienced a hernia recurrence. Five patients experienced an SSO during the two years and none required surgical intervention or implant removal. The make-up of the 20 patients in this long-term data was similar to the previous data set, with over 85% meeting the criteria for VHWG grade 2 or grade 3.07:01MSCI MSCI announces the appointment of Andrew Wiechmann as CFO, effective immediately (346.12 )Linda S.

The Nasdaq Composite increased 0.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 finished flat.The S&P 500 started the day lower by 0.9%, extending the month's pullback and briefly turning negative for the year, before the dip buyers stepped in. By the afternoon, the benchmark index was up 1.3% but sellers regained control on no specific news. The inability to sustain another rebound was disappointing for the bulls but not necessarily bearish.Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished in positive territory, even as declining issues edged out advancing issues at both the NYSE and Nasdaq. The utilities (+1.2%), consumer staples (+0.8%), and information technology (+0.6%) sectors outperformed in a defensive-minded trade that excluded the health care sector (-0.5%).Generally, investors remained nervous about election volatility, the prospects for another fiscal relief bill, the trajectory of the coronavirus, and U.S.-China relations. On stimulus, House Speaker Pelosi (D-CA) will reportedly introduce a $2.4 trillion relief bill, but it's unlikely to have the support of Republicans.Regarding the economy, the labor market remained in poor standing as weekly jobless claims increased by 4,000 to 870,000 (Briefing.com consensus 825,000). New home sales, however, rose 4.8% m/m in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.011 million (Briefing.com consensus 875,000) -- its highest rate since November 2006.Interestingly, a pair of analysts turned bullish on some battered financial stocks. Goldman Sachs (GS 195.11, +8.99, +4.8%) was upgraded to Buy from Hold at UBS, and Wells Fargo (WFC 23.32, +0.49, +2.2%) was added to the Fresh Pick List at Robert W. Baird.U.S. Treasuries traded within another narrow range and closed little changed. The 2-yr yield was unchanged at 0.13%, and the 10-yr yield decreased one basis point to 0.67%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 94.33. WTI crude futures gained 0.9%, or $0.37, to $40.31/bbl.Reviewing Thursday's economic data:Jobless claims for the week ending September 19 increased by 4,000 to 870,000 (Briefing.com consensus 825,000) while continuing claims for the week ending September 12 decreased by 167,000 to 12.580 million.The key takeaway from the report is that initial jobless claims remain at stunningly high levels that point to the ongoing challenges U.S. businesses face getting back on a pre-pandemic track. In the same period a year ago, initial jobless claims were 215,000.New home sales in August did something they haven't done since November 2006 -- exceed a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.0 million. Specifically, they rose 4.8% m/m to 1.011 million (Briefing.com consensus 875,000) and were up 43.2% yr/yr.The key takeaway from the report is that it reflects strong demand for new homes at more affordable price points, as the South region, which is the largest homebuilding region and features lower average prices, saw sales increase 13.4% m/m.Looking ahead, investors will receive Durable Goods Orders for August on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +18.9% YTDS&P 500 +0.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -6.0% YTDRussell 2000 -13.0% YTD16:21BMY Bristol-Myers: Phase 3 CheckMate -274 trial met primary endpoints of improving disease-free survival vs placebo (58.25 -0.74)Bristol Myers Squibb today announced that CheckMate -274, a pivotal Phase 3 trial evaluating Opdivo (nivolumab) after surgery in patients with high-risk, muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma, met its primary endpoints of improving disease-free survival (DFS) versus placebo in both all randomized patients and in patients whose tumor cells express PD-L1 > or =1% (programmed death-ligand 1).

There is some modest strength in the Nasdaq, helped by some modest gains in technology stocks, but the broader market is relatively flat as there hasn't been much conviction on the part of investors.Early trading ranges are narrower than they were yesterday, but there has still been a fair bit of chop within the narrow ranges.The lack of conviction can easily be attributed to feelings of uncertainty over some key issues (e.g. politics, growth prospects), but the volatile trading activity implies that no particular move can be taken for granted. Trends can shift in a hurry, particularly with month-end and quarter-end rebalancing efforts as part of the equation.To wit, the S&P 500 hit a session low of 3228.44 close to 10:15 a.m. ET, but traded back up to a session high of 3253.44 only 15 minutes later on no news at all. Such is the nature of the stock market beast at the moment.Five sectors are trading higher and six sectors are trading lower. The only sector with a move of at least 1.0% is the energy sector (-1.1%), which has been brutalized this week. Including today's loss, the sector is down 9.5% for the week.The Nasdaq Composite is up 0.6%; the Russell 2000 is up 0.5%; the S&P 500 is up 0.1%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is flat.10:31SOXX Industry Briefing: Chipmakers (290.54 -0.71)The PHLX Semiconductor Index (-0.3%) started today's session behind the broader market but it is rallying of its opening low. The high-beta group remains down 0.9% for the week, widening its September loss to 5.2%.Today's underperformance is owed to losses in all but ten components of the SOX index. Another ten group components show losses of 1.0% or more while the remaining listings trade closer to their flat lines.Notable movers:Micron (MU 48.44, -1.03, -2.0%): weakest performer in the group, falling back below its 200-day moving average (49.45) toward its 50-day moving average (48.00). ASML (ASML 354.90, -5.26, -1.5%): slipping to its lowest level in over two weeks. Microchip (MCHP 96.37, -1.38, -1.4%): dipping below its 200-day moving average (96.51). Applied Materials (AMAT 57.41, -0.38, -0.7%): remaining below its 200-day moving average (57.92). Analog Devices (ADI 111.57, -1.11, -1.0%): touched a two-month low before narrowing its loss. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSM 77.98, -0.40, -0.5%): dipping back below its 50-day moving average (78.54). Company plans to begin production of 3nm chips in 2022.

Any broader weakness could be short-lived, though, just based on the market's recent volatility and month-end/quarter-end rebalancing activity.On a related note, Amazon was resumed with an Overweight rating at Piper Sandler with a $3860 price target.09:15HTHT Huazhu Group forms special committee to investigate recent short seller allegations (42.45 )Huazhu Group announced that the company's board had formed a special committee to conduct an investigation of the allegations raised in a short seller report issued by Bonitas Research LLC on September 22.

The company believes that industry prescription tracking databases are not accurately reflecting the consistent underlying demand for ANNOVERA seen in orders to wholesalers, retail pharmacies and online distributors.

The company believes it is well positioned to meet or exceed Q3 total net revenue consensus, putting the company on a strong trajectory for Q4.09:05SBRA Sabra Health Care REIT provides update on recognition of rental revenues under leases with Genesis Healthcare and Signature Healthcare (13.80 )In the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 that Genesis filed with the SEC on August 10, Genesis stated that the impact of COVID-19 on its future results of operations, its current financial condition and liquidity sources, and uncertainty regarding future governmental funding support raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. On September 11, the company learned that subsidiaries of Signature that lease facilities from the company will be issued an audit report containing a qualified opinion due to substantial doubt about their ability to continue as a going concern in relation to the uncertainty around future cashflows caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.To date, Sabra has received no rent relief requests from either Genesis or Signature, and both tenants remain current on their rental obligations. As of June 30, Sabra's exposure to Signature was 7.2% of Sabra's annualized cash NOI, and its exposure to Genesis was 2.5% of Sabra's annualized cash NOI exclusive of residual rents from previously completed sales representing 2.0% of Sabra's annualized cash NOI. Sabra and its auditors are evaluating the circumstances giving rise to the going concern issues for these tenants.In the event it transitions the leases with these tenants to cash-basis accounting, it would write-off approx. $14.4 mln of straight-line rental receivables and lease-related intangible assets, which would be recorded as a reduction to rental revenues but would have no impact on Normalized FFO, AFFO, Normalized AFFO, and distributable cash flow.09:05HA Hawaiian Holdings to offer guests drive-through pre-travel COVID-19 tests (12.40 )08:54QURE uniQure CORRECTION: Co reported "no significant safety concerns were noted to prevent further dosing of Phase I/II clinical trial of AMT-130" (37.16 )Our prior comment incorrectly said there were safety concerns.

The Nasdaq Composite increased 0.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 finished flat.The S&P 500 started the day lower by 0.9%, extending the month's pullback and briefly turning negative for the year, before the dip buyers stepped in. By the afternoon, the benchmark index was up 1.3% but sellers regained control on no specific news. The inability to sustain another rebound was disappointing for the bulls but not necessarily bearish.Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished in positive territory, even as declining issues edged out advancing issues at both the NYSE and Nasdaq. The utilities (+1.2%), consumer staples (+0.8%), and information technology (+0.6%) sectors outperformed in a defensive-minded trade that excluded the health care sector (-0.5%).Generally, investors remained nervous about election volatility, the prospects for another fiscal relief bill, the trajectory of the coronavirus, and U.S.-China relations. On stimulus, House Speaker Pelosi (D-CA) will reportedly introduce a $2.4 trillion relief bill, but it's unlikely to have the support of Republicans.Regarding the economy, the labor market remained in poor standing as weekly jobless claims increased by 4,000 to 870,000 (Briefing.com consensus 825,000). New home sales, however, rose 4.8% m/m in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.011 million (Briefing.com consensus 875,000) -- its highest rate since November 2006.Interestingly, a pair of analysts turned bullish on some battered financial stocks. Goldman Sachs (GS 195.11, +8.99, +4.8%) was upgraded to Buy from Hold at UBS, and Wells Fargo (WFC 23.32, +0.49, +2.2%) was added to the Fresh Pick List at Robert W. Baird.U.S. Treasuries traded within another narrow range and closed little changed. The 2-yr yield was unchanged at 0.13%, and the 10-yr yield decreased one basis point to 0.67%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 94.33. WTI crude futures gained 0.9%, or $0.37, to $40.31/bbl.Reviewing Thursday's economic data:Jobless claims for the week ending September 19 increased by 4,000 to 870,000 (Briefing.com consensus 825,000) while continuing claims for the week ending September 12 decreased by 167,000 to 12.580 million.The key takeaway from the report is that initial jobless claims remain at stunningly high levels that point to the ongoing challenges U.S. businesses face getting back on a pre-pandemic track. In the same period a year ago, initial jobless claims were 215,000.New home sales in August did something they haven't done since November 2006 -- exceed a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.0 million. Specifically, they rose 4.8% m/m to 1.011 million (Briefing.com consensus 875,000) and were up 43.2% yr/yr.The key takeaway from the report is that it reflects strong demand for new homes at more affordable price points, as the South region, which is the largest homebuilding region and features lower average prices, saw sales increase 13.4% m/m.Looking ahead, investors will receive Durable Goods Orders for August on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +18.9% YTDS&P 500 +0.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -6.0% YTDRussell 2000 -13.0% YTD16:21BMY Bristol-Myers: Phase 3 CheckMate -274 trial met primary endpoints of improving disease-free survival vs placebo (58.25 -0.74)Bristol Myers Squibb today announced that CheckMate -274, a pivotal Phase 3 trial evaluating Opdivo (nivolumab) after surgery in patients with high-risk, muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma, met its primary endpoints of improving disease-free survival (DFS) versus placebo in both all randomized patients and in patients whose tumor cells express PD-L1 > or =1% (programmed death-ligand 1).

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.3%, and the Russell 2000 is up 0.7%.The trading range has been tighter than yesterday's range, suggesting a general lack of conviction amid ongoing uncertainties that include politics and the economy. Understandably, some investors are distrustful of today's advance given the downwards momentum, and volatility, this month and any tactical activity caused by month-end/quarter-end rebalancing.At this juncture, the S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.3%) is at the leadership position, followed by industrials (+0.8%) and real estate (+0.7%). The energy (-1.1%) and consumer staples (-0.3%) sectors underperform in negative territory.The mega-caps are stepping up today, with Apple (AAPL 110.27, +2.05, +1.9%) and Microsoft (MSFT 206.29, +3.14, +1.6%) trading comfortably higher.

There is some modest strength in the Nasdaq, helped by some modest gains in technology stocks, but the broader market is relatively flat as there hasn't been much conviction on the part of investors.Early trading ranges are narrower than they were yesterday, but there has still been a fair bit of chop within the narrow ranges.The lack of conviction can easily be attributed to feelings of uncertainty over some key issues (e.g. politics, growth prospects), but the volatile trading activity implies that no particular move can be taken for granted. Trends can shift in a hurry, particularly with month-end and quarter-end rebalancing efforts as part of the equation.To wit, the S&P 500 hit a session low of 3228.44 close to 10:15 a.m. ET, but traded back up to a session high of 3253.44 only 15 minutes later on no news at all. Such is the nature of the stock market beast at the moment.Five sectors are trading higher and six sectors are trading lower.

In addition, weekly inventory on hand reported by wholesalers remains consistent over the quarter. The company believes that industry prescription tracking databases are not accurately reflecting the consistent underlying demand for ANNOVERA seen in orders to wholesalers, retail pharmacies and online distributors. The company is working with industry prescription tracking databases to identify why this demand is not identified in their published numbers. The company believes it is well positioned to meet or exceed Q3 total net revenue consensus, putting the company on a strong trajectory for Q4.09:05SBRA Sabra Health Care REIT provides update on recognition of rental revenues under leases with Genesis Healthcare and Signature Healthcare (13.80 )In the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 that Genesis filed with the SEC on August 10, Genesis stated that the impact of COVID-19 on its future results of operations, its current financial condition and liquidity sources, and uncertainty regarding future governmental funding support raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. On September 11, the company learned that subsidiaries of Signature that lease facilities from the company will be issued an audit report containing a qualified opinion due to substantial doubt about their ability to continue as a going concern in relation to the uncertainty around future cashflows caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.To date, Sabra has received no rent relief requests from either Genesis or Signature, and both tenants remain current on their rental obligations. As of June 30, Sabra's exposure to Signature was 7.2% of Sabra's annualized cash NOI, and its exposure to Genesis was 2.5% of Sabra's annualized cash NOI exclusive of residual rents from previously completed sales representing 2.0% of Sabra's annualized cash NOI. Sabra and its auditors are evaluating the circumstances giving rise to the going concern issues for these tenants.In the event it transitions the leases with these tenants to cash-basis accounting, it would write-off approx. $14.4 mln of straight-line rental receivables and lease-related intangible assets, which would be recorded as a reduction to rental revenues but would have no impact on Normalized FFO, AFFO, Normalized AFFO, and distributable cash flow.09:05HA Hawaiian Holdings to offer guests drive-through pre-travel COVID-19 tests (12.40 )08:54QURE uniQure CORRECTION: Co reported "no significant safety concerns were noted to prevent further dosing of Phase I/II clinical trial of AMT-130" (37.16 )Our prior comment incorrectly said there were safety concerns.

The Nasdaq Composite increased 0.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 finished flat.The S&P 500 started the day lower by 0.9%, extending the month's pullback and briefly turning negative for the year, before the dip buyers stepped in. By the afternoon, the benchmark index was up 1.3% but sellers regained control on no specific news. The inability to sustain another rebound was disappointing for the bulls but not necessarily bearish.Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished in positive territory, even as declining issues edged out advancing issues at both the NYSE and Nasdaq. The utilities (+1.2%), consumer staples (+0.8%), and information technology (+0.6%) sectors outperformed in a defensive-minded trade that excluded the health care sector (-0.5%).Generally, investors remained nervous about election volatility, the prospects for another fiscal relief bill, the trajectory of the coronavirus, and U.S.-China relations. On stimulus, House Speaker Pelosi (D-CA) will reportedly introduce a $2.4 trillion relief bill, but it's unlikely to have the support of Republicans.Regarding the economy, the labor market remained in poor standing as weekly jobless claims increased by 4,000 to 870,000 (Briefing.com consensus 825,000). New home sales, however, rose 4.8% m/m in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.011 million (Briefing.com consensus 875,000) -- its highest rate since November 2006.Interestingly, a pair of analysts turned bullish on some battered financial stocks. Goldman Sachs (GS 195.11, +8.99, +4.8%) was upgraded to Buy from Hold at UBS, and Wells Fargo (WFC 23.32, +0.49, +2.2%) was added to the Fresh Pick List at Robert W. Baird.U.S. Treasuries traded within another narrow range and closed little changed. The 2-yr yield was unchanged at 0.13%, and the 10-yr yield decreased one basis point to 0.67%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 94.33. WTI crude futures gained 0.9%, or $0.37, to $40.31/bbl.Reviewing Thursday's economic data:Jobless claims for the week ending September 19 increased by 4,000 to 870,000 (Briefing.com consensus 825,000) while continuing claims for the week ending September 12 decreased by 167,000 to 12.580 million.The key takeaway from the report is that initial jobless claims remain at stunningly high levels that point to the ongoing challenges U.S. businesses face getting back on a pre-pandemic track. In the same period a year ago, initial jobless claims were 215,000.New home sales in August did something they haven't done since November 2006 -- exceed a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.0 million. Specifically, they rose 4.8% m/m to 1.011 million (Briefing.com consensus 875,000) and were up 43.2% yr/yr.The key takeaway from the report is that it reflects strong demand for new homes at more affordable price points, as the South region, which is the largest homebuilding region and features lower average prices, saw sales increase 13.4% m/m.Looking ahead, investors will receive Durable Goods Orders for August on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +18.9% YTDS&P 500 +0.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -6.0% YTDRussell 2000 -13.0% YTD16:21BMY Bristol-Myers: Phase 3 CheckMate -274 trial met primary endpoints of improving disease-free survival vs placebo (58.25 -0.74)Bristol Myers Squibb today announced that CheckMate -274, a pivotal Phase 3 trial evaluating Opdivo (nivolumab) after surgery in patients with high-risk, muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma, met its primary endpoints of improving disease-free survival (DFS) versus placebo in both all randomized patients and in patients whose tumor cells express PD-L1 > or =1% (programmed death-ligand 1).

The major indices were mixed and leadership was sparse. There isn't any mystery now.The major indices have found their stride and are rising in unison, paced by some familiar mega-cap leaders whose relative strength has provided a lift for the broader market and the information technology sector (+2.0%) in particular.Their leadership status, however, isn't an isolated event. The industrials (+1.3%), health care (+1.3%), real estate (+1.3%), consumer discretionary (+1.3%), and utilities (+1.1%) sectors are all up more than 1.0%. In fact, there is only one sector in negative territory. That would be the energy sector (-0.5%), which is off its lows but still down 9.0% for the week, 14.4% for the month, and 50.0% for the year.Apple (AAPL 111.47, +3.25, +3.0%), Microsoft (MSFT 207.19, +4.00, +2.0%), Amazon.com (AMZN 3077.55, +57.56, +1.9%), Alphabet (GOOG 1440.60, +12.31, +0.9%), Facebook (FB 253.44, +3.91, +1.6%), and NVIDIA (NVDA 510.61, +16.69, +3.4%) are among the mega-cap mainstays doing today's heavyweight lifting.There isn't any specific piece of news accounting for their gains. Rather, it's their own price trend that is the news and the difference for overcoming the mixed and choppy trading seen at the start of today's session.The Nasdaq Composite is up 1.9%; the Russell 2000 is up 1.3%; the S&P 500 is up 1.2%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 1.0%.14:40COMDX Energy Settlement PricesNov Crude Oil futures fell $0.05 (-0.12%) to $40.26/barrel Nov Natural Gas settled $0.08 lower (-2.69%) at $2.821/MMBtu Nov RBOB Gasoline settled $0.01 higher (1.24%) at $1.1877/gallon Nov Heating oil futures settled $0.01 higher (0.51%) at $1.1322/gallon14:26AWK American Water Works subsidiary Illinois American Water acquires Granite City Wastewater Collection System (143.53 +2.87)This purchase adds approx. 12,150 customer connections to the company's customer base in southern Illinois.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.3%, and the Russell 2000 is up 0.7%.The trading range has been tighter than yesterday's range, suggesting a general lack of conviction amid ongoing uncertainties that include politics and the economy. Understandably, some investors are distrustful of today's advance given the downwards momentum, and volatility, this month and any tactical activity caused by month-end/quarter-end rebalancing.At this juncture, the S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.3%) is at the leadership position, followed by industrials (+0.8%) and real estate (+0.7%). The energy (-1.1%) and consumer staples (-0.3%) sectors underperform in negative territory.The mega-caps are stepping up today, with Apple (AAPL 110.27, +2.05, +1.9%) and Microsoft (MSFT 206.29, +3.14, +1.6%) trading comfortably higher. Smaller cyclical stocks are also seeing gains following some positive-minded analyst recommendations.Barclays upgraded cruise lines Norwegian (NCLH 16.08, +1.45, +9.9%), Royal Caribbean (RCL 63.80, +3.84, +6.4%), and Carnival (CCL 14.83, +1.09, +7.9%) to Overweight from Equal Weight. The Benchmark Company upgraded Norfolk Southern (NSC 217.62, +3.19, +1.5%) and CSX (CSX 77.54, +0.96, +1.3%) to Buy from Hold.Costco (COST 339.94, -7.06, -2.0%) is bucking the positive trend despite beating EPS estimates and reporting in-line revenue and comparable sales results. Telsey Advisory Group liked what it saw, raising its price target on the stock to $390 from $385 after the report.Reviewing today's economic data:Durable goods orders increased 0.4% m/m in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.9%) following an upwardly revised 11.7% increase (from 11.2%) in July. Excluding transportation, orders were also up 0.4% (Briefing.com consensus 1.0%) following an upwardly revised 3.2% increase (from 2.4%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that order increases were seen across most categories, as manufacturing needs continued to recover from their pandemic depression, yet total orders are still down 11.3% yr/yr (down 3.0%, ex-transportation).12:57SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- MobileIron (MOBL) gains on word of acquisition talks -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersLAC (8.92 +24.23%): Rebounds on higher than average volume from recent sell-off; the stock pulled back by approx. 30% earlier this week amid general volatility in the lithium industry and in the EV space.MOBL (6.53 +17.78%): Spiked as headlines circulated that co is in advanced discussions regarding an acquisition.

There is some modest strength in the Nasdaq, helped by some modest gains in technology stocks, but the broader market is relatively flat as there hasn't been much conviction on the part of investors.Early trading ranges are narrower than they were yesterday, but there has still been a fair bit of chop within the narrow ranges.The lack of conviction can easily be attributed to feelings of uncertainty over some key issues (e.g. politics, growth prospects), but the volatile trading activity implies that no particular move can be taken for granted. Trends can shift in a hurry, particularly with month-end and quarter-end rebalancing efforts as part of the equation.To wit, the S&P 500 hit a session low of 3228.44 close to 10:15 a.m. ET, but traded back up to a session high of 3253.44 only 15 minutes later on no news at all. Such is the nature of the stock market beast at the moment.Five sectors are trading higher and six sectors are trading lower.

In addition, weekly inventory on hand reported by wholesalers remains consistent over the quarter. The company believes that industry prescription tracking databases are not accurately reflecting the consistent underlying demand for ANNOVERA seen in orders to wholesalers, retail pharmacies and online distributors. The company is working with industry prescription tracking databases to identify why this demand is not identified in their published numbers. The company believes it is well positioned to meet or exceed Q3 total net revenue consensus, putting the company on a strong trajectory for Q4.09:05SBRA Sabra Health Care REIT provides update on recognition of rental revenues under leases with Genesis Healthcare and Signature Healthcare (13.80 )In the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 that Genesis filed with the SEC on August 10, Genesis stated that the impact of COVID-19 on its future results of operations, its current financial condition and liquidity sources, and uncertainty regarding future governmental funding support raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. On September 11, the company learned that subsidiaries of Signature that lease facilities from the company will be issued an audit report containing a qualified opinion due to substantial doubt about their ability to continue as a going concern in relation to the uncertainty around future cashflows caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.To date, Sabra has received no rent relief requests from either Genesis or Signature, and both tenants remain current on their rental obligations. As of June 30, Sabra's exposure to Signature was 7.2% of Sabra's annualized cash NOI, and its exposure to Genesis was 2.5% of Sabra's annualized cash NOI exclusive of residual rents from previously completed sales representing 2.0% of Sabra's annualized cash NOI. Sabra and its auditors are evaluating the circumstances giving rise to the going concern issues for these tenants.In the event it transitions the leases with these tenants to cash-basis accounting, it would write-off approx. $14.4 mln of straight-line rental receivables and lease-related intangible assets, which would be recorded as a reduction to rental revenues but would have no impact on Normalized FFO, AFFO, Normalized AFFO, and distributable cash flow.09:05HA Hawaiian Holdings to offer guests drive-through pre-travel COVID-19 tests (12.40 )08:54QURE uniQure CORRECTION: Co reported "no significant safety concerns were noted to prevent further dosing of Phase I/II clinical trial of AMT-130" (37.16 )Our prior comment incorrectly said there were safety concerns.

The Nasdaq Composite increased 0.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 finished flat.The S&P 500 started the day lower by 0.9%, extending the month's pullback and briefly turning negative for the year, before the dip buyers stepped in. By the afternoon, the benchmark index was up 1.3% but sellers regained control on no specific news. The inability to sustain another rebound was disappointing for the bulls but not necessarily bearish.Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished in positive territory, even as declining issues edged out advancing issues at both the NYSE and Nasdaq. The utilities (+1.2%), consumer staples (+0.8%), and information technology (+0.6%) sectors outperformed in a defensive-minded trade that excluded the health care sector (-0.5%).Generally, investors remained nervous about election volatility, the prospects for another fiscal relief bill, the trajectory of the coronavirus, and U.S.-China relations. On stimulus, House Speaker Pelosi (D-CA) will reportedly introduce a $2.4 trillion relief bill, but it's unlikely to have the support of Republicans.Regarding the economy, the labor market remained in poor standing as weekly jobless claims increased by 4,000 to 870,000 (Briefing.com consensus 825,000). New home sales, however, rose 4.8% m/m in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.011 million (Briefing.com consensus 875,000) -- its highest rate since November 2006.Interestingly, a pair of analysts turned bullish on some battered financial stocks. Goldman Sachs (GS 195.11, +8.99, +4.8%) was upgraded to Buy from Hold at UBS, and Wells Fargo (WFC 23.32, +0.49, +2.2%) was added to the Fresh Pick List at Robert W. Baird.U.S. Treasuries traded within another narrow range and closed little changed. The 2-yr yield was unchanged at 0.13%, and the 10-yr yield decreased one basis point to 0.67%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 94.33. WTI crude futures gained 0.9%, or $0.37, to $40.31/bbl.Reviewing Thursday's economic data:Jobless claims for the week ending September 19 increased by 4,000 to 870,000 (Briefing.com consensus 825,000) while continuing claims for the week ending September 12 decreased by 167,000 to 12.580 million.The key takeaway from the report is that initial jobless claims remain at stunningly high levels that point to the ongoing challenges U.S. businesses face getting back on a pre-pandemic track. In the same period a year ago, initial jobless claims were 215,000.New home sales in August did something they haven't done since November 2006 -- exceed a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.0 million. Specifically, they rose 4.8% m/m to 1.011 million (Briefing.com consensus 875,000) and were up 43.2% yr/yr.The key takeaway from the report is that it reflects strong demand for new homes at more affordable price points, as the South region, which is the largest homebuilding region and features lower average prices, saw sales increase 13.4% m/m.Looking ahead, investors will receive Durable Goods Orders for August on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +18.9% YTDS&P 500 +0.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -6.0% YTDRussell 2000 -13.0% YTD16:21BMY Bristol-Myers: Phase 3 CheckMate -274 trial met primary endpoints of improving disease-free survival vs placebo (58.25 -0.74)Bristol Myers Squibb today announced that CheckMate -274, a pivotal Phase 3 trial evaluating Opdivo (nivolumab) after surgery in patients with high-risk, muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma, met its primary endpoints of improving disease-free survival (DFS) versus placebo in both all randomized patients and in patients whose tumor cells express PD-L1 > or =1% (programmed death-ligand 1). CheckMate -274 is the first and only Phase 3 trial in which immunotherapy has reduced the risk of relapse in the adjuvant setting for these patients. The safety profile of Opdivo was consistent with previously reported studies in solid tumors.The company plans to complete a full evaluation of the CheckMate -274 data, work with investigators to present the results at an upcoming medical conference, and submit the data to health authorities.

It is anticipated that this analysis will take place in the second half of 2021.An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) has been continuously monitoring the safety and efficacy of patients enrolled in the EMERALD trial. After enrollment of 70% of planned patients, the committee formally reviewed results of a futility analysis.

"Other measures in the Announcement issued on March 26 will continue to be implemented. While ensuring effective epidemic control, the Chinese government will continue resuming people-to-people exchanges in a step-by-step and orderly manner." The relaxing of restrictions comes after China suspended nearly all entry into the country by foreigners and halted all international flights in March as it struggled with travelers infected with COVID-19 entering the country. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs temporarily suspended entry into China by foreign nationals who held visas or residence permits, and entry by foreign nationals with business travel cards was also halted. China, where the COVID-19 pandemic began, has more than 90,400 cases of the coronavirus and has reported more than 4,730 deaths.Alexa Lardieri is a reporter and digital producer for the Civic section of U.S. News & World Report, where she writes about breaking news.

Pelosi: Congress to consider two bills targeting Chinese forced laborStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeSeptember 19, 2020 SaturdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: WORLD NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 498 wordsByline: Steven ClarkeBodyBeijing has come under fire for a network of detention centres which mostly house Muslim minorities.In a first ever, the Chinese government yesterday published a white paper providing a figure on the number of people housed in what the United Nations and a large part of the worldwide community consider "concentration camps".The United States and other countries have been ratcheting up pressure on China over its treatment of Uighur Muslims in the remote Xinjiang region, where the United Nations cites credible reports as saying 1 million Muslims held in camps have been put to work."These extraordinary human rights violations demand an extraordinary response", Kenneth Cuccinelli, the Department of Homeland Security's acting secretary told reporters at the time.The government has consistently insisted that mass "vocational education and training" is necessary in the region to combat terrorism and poverty."While there are no indications for forced labor in the Shangyu mill, we have chose to, until we get more clarity around allegations of forced labor, phase out our indirect business relationship with Huafu Fashion Co, regardless of unit and province, within the next 12 months", H&M said."Xinjiang has built a large knowledge-based, skilled and innovative workforce that meets the requirements of the new era", the report reads.Beijing has come under intense worldwide criticism over its policies in the resource-rich region.Firefighters Work to Save Mount Wilson Observatory From Bobcat FireIn the nearby Cooper Canyon area, air tankers have been deployed to help contain a large spot fire north of Highway 2. To date, the Bobcat Fire has engulfed more than 44,000 acres, according to the Angeles National Forest Twitter feed.It says the training provided includes written and spoken Mandarin, labour skills and "knowledge of urban life".However, the white paper warns there is a low level of vocational skills and says "terrorists, separatists and religious extremists" have encouraged the public not to learn Chinese, to "reject modern science, and refuse to improve their vocational skills".Stephen Lamar, president of the American Apparel and Footwear Association, said his industry is working hard to root out products made with forced labor from its supply chains, but Xinjiang, where China has detained over 1 million Muslim Uighurs, represents a unique challenge.Beijing has denied claims of forced labour and in Tuesday's report said it would take "resolute action" against it.They fall short of the region-wide ban that had been considered, officials said.The EU meanwhile has urged China to allow independent observers to travel to the highly-surveilled region.But human rights groups have said at least one million people have been incarcerated in camps which they describe as "re-education" centres.In a white paper on Xinjiang in March, China defended its controversial security crackdown and said almost 13,000 "terrorists" have been arrested there since 2014.Load-Date: September 19, 2020End of Document

Trump backs proposed deal to keep TikTok operating in USAssociated Press InternationalSeptember 20, 2020 Sunday 1:14 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; DOMESTIC NEWSLength: 932 wordsByline: STAN CHOE, AP Business WriterDateline: NEW YORK BodyNEW YORK (AP) — President Donald Trump said Saturday he's given his “blessing” to a proposed deal that would see the popular video-sharing app TikTok partner with Oracle and Walmart and form a U.S. company.Trump has targeted Chinese-owned TikTok for national security and data privacy concerns in the latest flashpoint in the rising tensions between Washington and Beijing. The president's support for a deal comes just a day after the Commerce Department announced restrictions that if put in place could eventually make it nearly impossible for TikTok's legions of younger fans to use the app.Trump said if completed the deal would create a new company likely to be based in Texas.“I have given the deal my blessing,” he said. “If they get it done, that’s great. If they don’t, that’s OK too.”Trump said the new company will be hiring at least 25,000 people and making a $5 billion contribution to a fund dedicated to education for Americans. “That’s their contribution that I’ve been asking for,” he said.TikTok said Oracle and Walmart could acquire up to a cumulative 20% stake in the new company in a financing round to be held before an initial public offering of stock, which Walmart said could happen within the next year. Oracle's stake would be 12.5%, and Walmart's would be 7.5%, the companies said in separate statements.The deal will make Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok's U.S. user data and securing computer systems to ensure U.S. national security requirements are satisfied. Walmart said it will provide its ecommerce, fulfillment, payments and other services to the new company.“We are pleased that the proposal by TikTok, Oracle, and Walmart will resolve the security concerns of the U.S. administration and settle questions around TikTok’s future in the U.S.,” TikTok said in a statement.Trump has been demanding that the U.S. operations of TikTok be sold to a U.S. company or else be shut down. He's also been targeting WeChat, another Chinese-owned app.The administration contends that the user data collected by the two apps could be shared with the Chinese government. On Saturday, Trump said the U.S.-based TikTok “will have nothing to do with China.” TikTok says it has 100 million U.S. users.On Friday, the U.S. Commerce Department said it would bar TikTok from U.S. app stores as of late Sunday. Further restrictions that would prevent TikTok from accessing essential internet services in the country would go into effect on Nov. 12. Commerce said Saturday that it will delay the barring of TikTok from U.S. app stores until Sept. 27 at 11:59 p.m.Commerce is imposing similar restrictions on WeChat, although all of the restrictions on that app are set to go into effect Sunday night at 11:59 p.m.Earlier Saturday, WeChat users asked a U.S. judge to block the government's actions, saying they would restrict free speech. WeChat is an all-in-one app with instant-messaging, social media and other communication tools. The U.S. government argued that it is not restricting free speech because WeChat users still “are free to speak on alternative platforms that do not pose a national security threat.”U.S. Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler asked lawyers for the government and WeChat users whether the prohibitions would cripple WeChat as soon as the clock ticked from Sunday night into Monday morning without a resolution. An attorney for the government said they would likely lead to a “degradation” of WeChat over time.Judge Beeler did not rule immediately on the motion.WeChat has millions of U.S. users who rely on the app to stay in touch and conduct business with people and companies in China and around the world. In court filings, the founder of the Mental Health Association for Chinese Communities, who is a U.S. citizen in California, said that the group’s primary tool to reach out and provide services to Chinese Americans is WeChat.“Since many of the Chinese community members we serve are not fluent in English, WeChat is the only online tool that they rely on,” Elaine Peng said.The Trump administration's aggressive tactics are part of its latest attempt to counter the influence of China, a rising economic superpower. Since taking office in 2017, Trump has waged a trade war with China, blocked mergers involving Chinese companies and stifled the business of Chinese firms like Huawei, a maker of phones and telecom equipment.China-backed hackers, meanwhile, have been blamed for data breaches of U.S. federal databases and the credit agency Equifax, and the Chinese government strictly limits what U.S. tech companies can do in China.China’s ministry of commerce condemned the U.S. moves and urged it to stop what it called bullying behavior. It also said China may take “necessary measures” to protect Chinese companies.The U.S. Treasury Department said Saturday that TikTok's deal still needs to close with Oracle and Walmart, and it also needs documentation and conditions to be approved by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.That, of course, also leaves the potential for more roller coasters of emotion for TikTok users, such as Haley Hoffman Smith, a 24-year-old who moved to Manhattan this year to pursue her dream of becoming a talk-show host. She said she had just hit 100,000 followers on TikTok and was crushed on Friday to hear it may be headed for a shutdown.“TikTok is an inextricable part of my dream chasing story,” she said, “and to lose it forever would not only be an inconvenient setback, but an absolute heartbreak.”___AP Business Writers Tali Arbel, Matt O'Brien and Barbara Ortutay contributed.Load-Date: September 19, 2020End of Document

Oracle's stake would be 12.5%, and Walmart's would be 7.5%, the companies said in separate statements.The deal will make Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok's U.S. user data and securing computer systems to ensure U.S. national security requirements are satisfied. Walmart said it will provide its ecommerce, fulfillment, payments and other services to the new company.“We are pleased that the proposal by TikTok, Oracle, and Walmart will resolve the security concerns of the U.S. administration and settle questions around TikTok’s future in the U.S.,” TikTok said in a statement.Trump has been demanding that the U.S. operations of TikTok be sold to a U.S. company or else be shut down. He's also been targeting WeChat, another Chinese-owned app.The administration contends that the user data collected by the two apps could be shared with the Chinese government. On Saturday, Trump said the U.S.-based TikTok “will have nothing to do with China.” TikTok says it has 100 million U.S. users.On Friday, the U.S. Commerce Department said it would bar TikTok from U.S. app stores as of late Sunday. Further restrictions that would prevent TikTok from accessing essential internet services in the country would go into effect on Nov. 12. Commerce said Saturday that it will delay the barring of TikTok from U.S. app stores until Sept. 27 at 11:59 p.m.Commerce is imposing similar restrictions on WeChat, although all of the restrictions on that app are set to go into effect Sunday night at 11:59 p.m.Earlier Saturday, WeChat users asked a U.S. judge to block the government's actions, saying they would restrict free speech. WeChat is an all-in-one app with instant-messaging, social media and other communication tools. The U.S. government argued that it is not restricting free speech because WeChat users still “are free to speak on alternative platforms that do not pose a national security threat.”U.S. Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler asked lawyers for the government and WeChat users whether the prohibitions would cripple WeChat as soon as the clock ticked from Sunday night into Monday morning without a resolution. An attorney for the government said they would likely lead to a “degradation” of WeChat over time.Judge Beeler did not rule immediately on the motion.WeChat has millions of U.S. users who rely on the app to stay in touch and conduct business with people and companies in China and around the world. In court filings, the founder of the Mental Health Association for Chinese Communities, who is a U.S. citizen in California, said that the group’s primary tool to reach out and provide services to Chinese Americans is WeChat.“Since many of the Chinese community members we serve are not fluent in English, WeChat is the only online tool that they rely on,” Elaine Peng said.The Trump administration's aggressive tactics are part of its latest attempt to counter the influence of China, a rising economic superpower. Since taking office in 2017, Trump has waged a trade war with China, blocked mergers involving Chinese companies and stifled the business of Chinese firms like Huawei, a maker of phones and telecom equipment.China-backed hackers, meanwhile, have been blamed for data breaches of U.S. federal databases and the credit agency Equifax, and the Chinese government strictly limits what U.S. tech companies can do in China.China’s ministry of commerce condemned the U.S. moves and urged it to stop what it called bullying behavior. It also said China may take “necessary measures” to protect Chinese companies.The U.S. Treasury Department said Saturday that TikTok's deal still needs to close with Oracle and Walmart, and it also needs documentation and conditions to be approved by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.That, of course, also leaves the potential for more roller coasters of emotion for TikTok users, such as Haley Hoffman Smith, a 24-year-old who moved to Manhattan this year to pursue her dream of becoming a talk-show host. She said she had just hit 100,000 followers on TikTok and was crushed on Friday to hear it may be headed for a shutdown.“TikTok is an inextricable part of my dream chasing story,” she said, “and to lose it forever would not only be an inconvenient setback, but an absolute heartbreak.”___AP Business Writers Tali Arbel, Matt O'Brien and Barbara Ortutay contributed.Load-Date: September 19, 2020End of Document

US MULLS CURBS ON CHINA'S WECHAT PAY, ALIPAY PLATFORMS: REPORTStates News ServiceOctober 9, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 595 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:The United States is looking at possible restrictions on two Chinese-owned digital payment platforms, amid national security concerns, according to recent media reports.The Trump administration is considering imposing curbs on Ant Group, owned by Chinese billionaire Jack Ma, and Tencent, amid concerns that their Alipay and WeChat Pay features could pose a security threat, Bloomberg reported this week.U.S. officials are concerned that Ant Group and other Chinese fintech platforms will come to dominate global digital payments, Bloomberg cited "people familiar with the matter" as saying.Such platforms could soon be used internationally, potentially giving the Chinese government access to the banking and personal details of hundreds of millions of people, the agency reported.Tzeng Yi-suo, head of cyberwarfare and information security at the Institute for National Defence and Security Research on the democratic island of Taiwan, said there are concerns that the information sent to China would be people's real names and other details."[China's] digital payment systems are real-names only," Tzeng said. "It's a bit different if you are in a democracy."But he said it would be hard to find legal justification for such restrictions, in the absence of any law-breaking by the companies concerned."They are going to expand their digital services," he said. "But on the other hand, neither Tencent nor Ant have done anything illegal.""They would have to prove national security risks before they could impose any restrictions on them."Francis Fong, honorary chairman of Hong Kong's Information Technology Federation, agreed that Tencent and Ant are looking to expand the use of WeChat Pay and Alipay internationally."Alipay has already started operating in countries and regions outside China including Japan," he said. "Right now Alipay and WeChat Pay are on an upward trajectory."Big US marketHe said the loss of the U.S. market could be huge for the companies."Tencent may have said that [the U.S.] only accounts for a small percentage of its overall business, but ... all of Alipay and WeChat Pay's competitors are based in the U.S., namely, Visa, Mastercard, Apple Pay and Google Pay," he said. "The U.S. market is pretty big."Fong said electronic payments are generally linked to the acquisition of customer personal data, and that data acquisition isn't just a feature of Alipay and WeChat Pay."Visa and Mastercard will also take these records and analyze them," Fong said. "The data can include the colors that customers like, what they like to eat, stuff like that. They publish annual consumption reports that can be viewed online.""The problems come when things are viewed politically, so the rest of the world will just think about customer data being sent to mainland China, and about privacy," Fong said.Ant looks set to list on stock markets in Shanghai and Hong Kong in the coming weeks, in an international public offering (IPO) of around U.S.$35 billion, the report said.Bloomberg cited a statement from Ant Group as saying that it was unaware of any such deliberations, and that its business is primarily in China anyway, while Tencent and U.S. officials declined to comment, its report said.Since President Donald Trump took office, the U.S. has imposed restrictions on top Chinese technology companies including TikTok and Huawei, citing security concerns.Reported by Gao Feng for RFA's Mandarin Service, and by Sing Man for the Cantonese Service.

Thanks so much for watching Strange Inheritance.And remember, you can't take it with you.MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good Monday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Monday September 21. Your top stories right now, 6 a.m. on the East Coast.We have a global selloff underway this morning. Futures are down sharply. Kicking off week underwater down 560 points right now. Investors on edge over political uncertainty as well as the coronavirus.The Dow, NASDAQ and the S&P 500 closer to third straight week of losses in a row last week, the longest losing streak of the year and the selling continues this morning.Questions over the TikTok deal as well. President Trump approving the agreement in concept, but the national security threat remains a concern. What Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told me about TikTok, coming up.The future of the Supreme Court hangs in the balance, the death of justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg sparking a fierce political debate. A closer look at that, plus her famous friendship with Justice Antonin Scalia coming up.White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany is here; and Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia will join me at 8 a.m. Eastern.Mornings with Maria is live right now this Monday morning.Global markets this morning under some selling pressure, take a look at this major selloff in Europe underway this morning. The FTSE 100 down 207 points; the CAC quarante down 153; and the DAX Index in Germany down 400 points, 402 lower.Concerns of growing about the UK economy and if it is going to go into a second lockdown over the coronavirus cases as they rise. People in the UK who violate self-isolation rules will face fines now of up to $13,000.In Asia overnight, declines across the board there as well on the heels of three straight weeks of declines in the U.S. As you can see, Japan is close for a holiday, but the worst performer was in Hong Kong. Hang Seng Index down better than 2 percent. The Hang Seng down 2 percent as HSBC shares slide to a 25-year low.We've got the news on banks this is morning, a report detailing lapses in "suspicious" activity reports for a number of banks, Hong Kong's Hang Seng, HSBC, rather, among them.Now some of the top stories that we are watching this morning.The debate is intensifying over whether President Trump should fill the seat of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg ahead of the November election. Joe Biden is calling on Republican senators not to push through a replacement.Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: If Donald Trump wins the election, then the Senate should move on his selection and weigh the nominee he chooses fairly. And if I win this election, President Trump's nominee should be withdrawn. And as a new president, I should be the one who nominates Justice Ginsburg's successor.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi even threatening impeachment to stop the process.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): We have our options, we have our arrows in our quiver that I'm not vowed to discuss right now. But the fact is, we have a big challenge in our country. This president has threatened to not even accept the result of the election with statements that he and his henchmen have made.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The White House responding, saying the speaker threatened to impeach the president again for simply fulfilling his constitutional obligation. Numerous Democrats are threatening to pack the court and say things like 'nothing is off the table'. These are bizarre and dangerous power grabs by Democrats who is will stop at nothing to erode the Constitution to enact their radical agenda.Judges Amy Coney Barrett and Barbara Lagoa are believed to be at the top of President Trump's list to replace Ginsburg.President Trump giving his blessing to an agreement that would give Walmart and Oracle a 20 percent stake in TikTok, creating a new U.S.-based company called TikTok Mobile.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: I have given the deal my blessing, if they get it done that's great, if they don't that's OK too. I approved the deal in concept, yes.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The deal which is still pending final approval by the companies is worth $60 billion and would have Oracle become responsible for hosting all U.S. user data. In response to the deal, the commerce department has delayed its ban on new downloads of the app for one week. We've got more on this story coming up.The U.S. on the verge of surpassing 200,000 coronavirus deaths. California reporting more than 4,000 new cases for a second straight day. And in Arizona, new cases are slowing after a two-day spike last week. This as health experts warn the nation could experience at least one more cycle of the deadly virus this upcoming fall or winter.Violence in some of the nation's biggest cities meanwhile rising. Figures from the NYPD show, fatal shootings in New York have nearly doubled this year with 209 fatalities so far this year compared to 109 over the same period a year ago. This coming as 39 people were shot over the weekend in Chicago, 6 people were killed. It follows 54 people shot last weekend, 12 others who died.A global market selloff is underway this morning. Futures indicating a sharp decline right out of the gate. As you see, Dow Industrials down 560 points, battles over the Supreme Court as well as the coronavirus stimulus stalemate weighing on investors this morning.Joining me right now is Northern Trust Wealth Management Chief Investment Officer Katie Nixon; also joining the conversation all morning is Fox Business' Dagen McDowell; The Wall Street Journal's assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman.Great to see you guys this morning. Thank you so much for being here.Katie, let me kick this off with you. I know that we had a quadruple witching technical issue for investors last week, is that part of this this morning? To what do you attribute this big selloff going on?KATIE NIXON, CIO, NORTHERN TRUST WEALTH MANAGEMENT: That's no part of it this morning, Maria. And thank you for having me.I think you covered really well in the upfront what's going on in the market right now. It is really the two Ps, we have the negative news on the pandemic, not just here in the U.S. but certainly the conditions abroad are worsening. We have a spike in the UK leading to fears of another lockdown and we have some hot spots in Europe also that are very worrisome, as well as the data here in the U.S. which is, sort of, with fits and starts going in the wrong direction.So I think, regardless of whether Europe or the UK, or even the U.S. goes into some sort of another lockdown, I think, people are just going to adapt to the growing risk and that's going to mean more social distancing and a less robust recovery.The second P is on policy, and as you said, the election - this election was going to be interesting in any case and it just became a lot more interesting over the weekend by the death of Justice Ginsburg, which I think will probably exacerbate the potential for contested election. But it will also really - I'm sorry, minimize the potential for a really much needed fiscal package coming out of D.C. So the political scene, I think, is really driving market volatility here as well.And the last thing I should say is, we're in kind of a tough part of the calendar year to begin with, so this has not - never been a particularly great period, the next couple of weeks, for investors. So that's probably not helping either.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's true. October is usually a messy month for investors. But what's your take on the backdrop here, economic growth, Katie? I mean do you expect that we are going to see growth, will earnings improve by year-end? Let's look at fundamentals for a moment.NIXON: Exactly. That's the interesting thing is that we've got these risks out there. But the macro backdrop is really healthy. We've gotten some great numbers. You've covered really well the incredible improvement we've had on the unemployment picture. And just for some context, it took 5 years pass the global financial crisis to get down to 8.4 percent unemployment, this time it took five months.We've got robust housing, robust consumer spending. So the macro backdrop here is pretty solid, and we expect decent earnings in the third quarter and going into the fourth quarter.So a real nice recovery in earnings growth, but the vulnerability is around the lack of a fiscal package, because what we do know is that some of the programs are running out in September and October. And so we do expect to see, sort of, more fragility around that macro backdrop as we head into 2021.BARTIROMO: So there are real questions about TikTok and this new plan for Oracle and Walmart to be major investors. Under this plan, ByteDance currently owns an 80 percent stake in TikTok Global. But after a deal, that ownership goes down. Oracle and Walmart are expected to have the remaining stake, but remember U.S. investors like Sequoia and others will be major investors here.I spoke with insiders at Oracle yesterday and they tried to convince me that, in fact, as this deal goes forward, the Chinese government will have a less and less exposure here. The question is how much will the Chinese own, after an IPO it's said to be about 30 percent. What's your take on this and how this impacts the market, once this deal is complete, Katie?TikTok Global is going to be listed on an American stock exchange and at that time the Chinese ownership goes down to 30 percent. But there are still real skeptics on this, because the data may very well go back to the Chinese Communist Party of American users.NIXON: Indeed. Well, this is a very fluid story, Maria. As you know, and we'll see over the next coming days and into the November 12 deadline how this shapes up. But I think for investors, one thing is super clear and that is that the hard line around China remains. And President Trump and probably the next president will continue to take a very skeptical view of China, and continue to play hardball, frankly, with some of these things.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, like I said, the executives and the sources that I spoke with at Oracle yesterday, do believe that they will stop any information from going to the communist government. And they, of course, have among the safest autonomous technology on the market. But we'll have to keep talking about this and get the latest on where this goes.Katie, it is good to see you this morning. Thank you so much.NIXON: Thanks, Maria.BARTIROMO: Katie Nixon this morning.NIXON: Thank you.BARTIROMO: From Northern Trust.Check out your morning mover and that's Deutsche Bank. The stock is under severe pressure after leaked files accuse the bank of over $1 trillion dollars in suspicious transactions. Other banks include JPMorgan Chase, HSBC and Bank of New York Mellon, this is doing business with either sanctioned companies or individuals. This is what this is about.We're just getting started this morning.Coming up, stay with us, we're going to look at the fight for Florida. We're taking a look at the major money being spent to influence the presidential race in the key battleground state.Then at 7 a.m. Eastern, the word on Wall Street, what investors are watching this morning as the political debate takes center stage.Indiana Congressman Jim Banks is here on the counter to threat from China. Plus White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany joins us on President Trump's possible pick for the Supreme Court.In the 8 a.m. hour this morning, I'll be speaking with Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia giving us an inside look in his father Justice Antonin Scalia's famous friendship with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.Stay with us. You're watching with Mornings with Maria live on Fox Business.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We said that, if for any reason, we have a vacancy of the United States Supreme Court, we will fill that vacancy. I will be putting forth the nominee next week. It will be a woman.BIDEN: If Donald Trump wins the election, then the Senate should move on his selection and weigh the nominee he chooses fairly. But if I win this election, President Trump's nominee should be withdrawn. And as a new president, I should be the one who nominates Ginsburg's successor.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: A Supreme Court clash, a political battle already underway over the Supreme Court vacancy left by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.Joining me right now is Former Arkansas Governor, Fox News contributor, Mike Huckabee. Governor, it's good to see you this morning. What's your view on all of this?MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS: I think we ought to follow the advice the Democrats universally and absolutely gave us in 2016 was that, follow the constitution, let the president make this nomination and bring it up before the Senate. They were all in agreement, Hillary, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Chuck Schumer, Bernie Sanders, there was no exception. Everyone of them said, let's go through. That's the law.And to quote President Barrack Obama, "elections have consequences". I know it pains the Democrats to accept this, because they haven't accepted it. But Donald Trump was elected president and he's still the president.So, people can say, well, the Republicans are being disingenuous because they didn't think that they had to do it. But let's just be real clear, one-third of all U.S. presidents have nominated someone in an election year. That's just a fact. This is not unusual.What really is unique here is that because of Harry Reid in 2013 and his blowing up the filibuster, a majority, a simple majority of the Republicans in the Senate and the Republicans hold the Senate majority, and they hopefully will continue to, they can get this done, and they should get it done. And anything to the contrary is just political talk, but that's what the constitution says.It is what political power means. And this president, thank god, wants to use it. And any Republican that doesn't - in the senate, that doesn't want to go along with him, doesn't belong there anymore.BARTIROMO: And the president said that he plans to nominate a woman, you heard him in that soundbite for the seat as soon as possible.HUCKABEE: Yes.BARTIROMO: Some of the top contenders are judges Amy Coney Barrett and Barbara Lagoa and Allison Jones Rushing, these are the three that apparently are the top of the president's list. Do you know any of these ladies, Governor?HUCKABEE: Not personally, I don't. I know them by reputation, all have fine reputations, good legal scholars. What I think is significant is that this president has been so transparent about not just the specific people he would nominate to the court, he's done that, he has given us the list. But more importantly, the--BARTIROMO: Yes.HUCKABEE: --kind of person, he wants someone who is not necessarily a liberal, a conservative, but someone who is a constitutionalist. Maria, I have always contended that I don't want conservatives on the court, anymore than I want liberals on the court. I just want people.BARTIROMO: Yes.HUCKABEE: Who when they read the constitution, read it for what it says, and say that's what we're going to do.BARTIROMO: That's right. Absolutely.Let me bring in James Freeman. Go ahead, James.JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL: Thanks, Maria. Governor, good to see you this morning.As you look at these nominees, potential nominees, you like their reputations. You talked about the importance of judges who follow the constitution, I think for a lot of people. They're particularly interested in the first amendment, their freedom of speech, their freedom to exercise religion. I know that's important to you as well, and I'm wondering as you look at these potential candidates through that lens, do you see first amendment champions in this group?HUCKABEE: Well, from what I know, Amy Coney Barrett is certainly one of those people. I don't know as much about the other two, but some of her decisions have reflected that. And I'm glad you brought up the first amendment, because we've seen it challenged this year during the COVID crisis when mayors and governors have told people, It's OK to go to casino, you're fine; go to Walmart, you're OK; go to church, you're gong die, and we're going find you and shut you down and put yellow tape on the church doors.People recognize, I think, in a way they haven't ever in their lives that some big government people would trample all over the First Amendment and, in fact, not just would, they have. So we need a court that has people, who when they read the First Amendment, recognize that as the text says, "Government shall make no law", and that's something that we hope these folks will take care of in the hearings.BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there.Governor, great to get your insight this morning. Thank you, sir. Have a good day, and we will see you soon.HUCKABEE: Thank you. Good to see you. You bet.BARTIROMO: Governor Mike Huckabee joining us there.Stay with us. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Worries persist this morning over TikTok's partnership with Oracle and Walmart. The president did give it his blessing, but ByteDance currently owns 80 percent of TikTok. After this transaction is complete, those numbers go lower.Inside Oracle, I spoke with sources there yesterday, ByteDance, while currently owning 80 percent, after the transaction that will drop to 53 percent, then they'll do an IPO and it will continue going lower.The Chinese ownership is expected to drop into the 30s percent range after an IPO, and once again the concern resolves around the CCP getting access to American user data.Here's Marco Rubio yesterday with me on Sunday Morning Futures.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: What are your thoughts on the proposal being presented so far? The Communist Party wants to own a majority state in this TikTok agreement with Oracle, the U.S. wants to own it. What do we need to know about this situation? Because we already know that the Communist Party is trying to get swaths of people's information and mine that data of American citizens.SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL): I think Oracle has worked really hard to put together the best deal possible. My concern remains this, if that code, the code that gives the instructions to the system on what to do, if China continues to control the code, as I understand they would in this deal, they could put in that code and instruction to secretly send data back to China, to the mainland, no matter where the actual data is housed. There can be something better than that code that sends it the other way.Oracle says that no way, that they know enough about this and they can prevent it from happening. I think we have to be very careful in looking at that provision, because if anything - if there is any opportunity whatsoever for China to continue to collect personal data on Americans, then we can't be supportive of that deal.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Now don't forget after a transaction, 40 percent of this company will be owned by American investors, already 40 percent is owned by American investors. And my sources at Oracle said that all of the data is at a U.S. data center, the most secure data is on Oracle. It is run by Oracle second-generation data cloud centers.I asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about it also on Sunday Morning Futures.Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Can you explain how this is not a national security risk, Secretary, because ByteDance, the Chinese company, still don't own 80 percent of this TikTok Global. And we know that if the Chinese company - the Chinese Communist Party wants that data of American citizens, they are going to get it, given the civil-military fusion laws in China. So how is this not a risk?MIKE POMPEO, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: Yes, Maria. Listen, you've nailed at a right point with respect to WeChat, TikTok and all other Chinese telecommunications companies, we've been working on Huawei for years now.The single rule is this, we don't want American data in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party for the exact reasons you described. It will end up in hands of their MSS, their security apparatus, their military, their civil-military fusion program.So that's the rule President Trump laid down. As with the transaction around TikTok, I've seen the outlines, the president now has said he's conditionally OK with what they're doing. This deal, if approved, in the end, if ultimately approved, we'll ensure that no American's data has any access to anyone in China that has any capacity to move this to a place we don't want it.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: So as I've said many times, it really depends on how much ByteDance will own of this company and how many employees from China will go work at the new TikTok Global.I spoke with sources in this deal yesterday, Dagen McDowell, four out of the five board members will be American and the fifth one will likely be Japanese, (inaudible) from Japan also taking an 11 percent stake here.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: The Wall Street Journal also raises another problem with this deal and that it reeks of crony capitalism, that the editorial page says "We'll damage the U.S. government's credibility and reputation for free market rules".You got to look at who is buying - who is involved in this deal. Larry Ellison, big Republican donor; CEO, Safra Catz was on the executive committee for the Trump transition team in 2016; and then venture fund Sequoia Capital's global managing partner also donated heavily to Republicans, leading the lobbying of the Trump administration.To wrap this thought up, CFIUS, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. was established to protect national security, not to be used as leverage to steer investment to certain companies. "Better to ban TikTok", The Wall Street Journal editorial page writes, "Outright than negotiate a deal that only the French would be proud of".So that was a hammer down on how this deal wound up working out.BARTIROMO: Yes. There's a lot of questions about this.James, what do you think? Do you think American data is safe from China even with Oracle in charge? And let me just point out that my sources at Oracle say, "At no time will the data be unsafe. This is the most secure data in all of the cloud. It is run on Oracle second-generation data cloud center". So they are out in force trying to explain the situation, James.FREEMAN: Yes. The part of this deal as Dagen mentioned, that's troubling is the U.S. government role in picking who the new owners are in blessing the certain types of transactions. But the concern that originally motivated this about the Chinese telecom and technology companies being integrated into the U.S. and getting a lot of user data, I think, is legitimate.You've covered with Huawei, we see with TikTok, where these Chinese companies are saying they would never share data if under Chinese law requested by the government, as if directives from the Chinese Communist Party are optional for companies in China. This is just not credible. So I think that issue does need to be addressed, and I would just hope that if there's an open competition of American firms in this space.BARTIROMO: Yes. That's exactly right. All right.Stay with us. We're going take a short break and come right back. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, good Monday morning everybody, thanks so much joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, September 21st. Let's take a look at markets this morning, 6:32 a.m., where we are looking at a sea of red this morning. Sharp selloff expected right out of the gate this morning. The Dow futures are down better than 500 points. Political uncertainty, coronavirus cases weighing on investor sentiment this morning, and the momentum is to sell certainly has been the case for two weeks now. Markets are down across the board, Nasdaq down 130 right now and the S&P right now down 48 points.The Dow, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 posted their third weekly decline in a row last week, with the markets down across the board even if it was just fractional moves lower last week. In Europe this morning, the momentum on the downside continues, sharp decline across the board amid rising coronavirus cases and a possible second lockdown in London. The FTSE 100 is down 200 points, the CAC Quarante is down 160 and the Dax Index is lower by 415 points. In Asia overnight, Hong Kong was the worst performer, the Hang Seng index down better than 2 percent and Nikkei as you see was closed in Japan for a holiday. Meanwhile, back in America, the Gulf Coast bracing for more severe weather this morning. Cheryl Casone back with the details right now. Cheryl?CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS HOST: Oh, good morning, Maria, great to see you again. Yes, with Tropical Storm Beta is expected to make landfall actually tonight. The storm could dump up to 20 inches of rain in parts of Texas and Louisiana. Rescue teams are on alert as some areas experience flooding that will only get worse.More than 10 million people are under storm warning this morning. Beta is the 23rd-named storm of this hurricane season, and this is only the second time the National Hurricane Center has turned to the Greek alphabet to get new names. Well, some global banks under fire, HSBC and Standard Chartered among those facing allegations they move large sums of allegedly elicit funds over the last two decades, despite red flags over where the money came from.According to reports, thousands of suspicious activity reports were filed with the Department of Treasury by other banks and financial firms. Both banks have released statements, saying they have taken steps to combat future financial crime. And finally, this Bryson DeChambeau saved his best round for last, clinching the 2020 U.S. Open yesterday by 6 shots. The win marks DeChambeau's first major championship. The tournament was originally scheduled for June, but was pushed back because of the pandemic. It was played actually here in New York at Winged Foot Club, but Maria, as you know, with no fans, so golf was quieter than usual. And those are your headlines from here. Back over to you.BARTIROMO: Yes, of course, no fans, but a lot of sports on this weekend, thank you. Cheryl, it is countdown to election day. President Trump kicking off the week with a visit to Ohio tonight as the Biden campaign and Democrats say that they have more than $460 million of cash on hand. Biden is getting a major boost in the sunshine state, thanks to New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg who is pledging more than $100 million. I asked Florida Senator Marco Rubio about Bloomberg's big pledge.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The top Super PAC backing Joe Biden is using an infusion of cash from the multi-billionaire. Mike Bloomberg, to go with new TV commercials in the crucial election. What's your take on this? What can $100 million do?SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL): Look, it's a lot of money, there's no doubt. And -- but in the end, I think this is part of a national trend, you know, all across the country. The Biden campaign, our candidates for Senate and House are being dramatically outspent. And it's not that they're not raising a lot of money, it's that their opponents are raising a tremendous amount of money through ActBlue and through all of these Super PACs. Democrats used to attack and criticize Super PACs, now their Super PACs have a lot more money, billionaires all over the country in an effort to sort of take over the government, the House, the Senate, the White House.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is former Bernie Sanders presidential campaign senior adviser, and "Tio Bernie" author Chuck Rocha and former Trump presidential campaign communications Director, Republican strategist and Mercury Partner Bryan Lanza. Great to see you guys this morning, thank you so much for joining us. Chuck --BRYAN LANZA, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Good morning, good to see you --BARTIROMO: Let me kick this off with you. What do you make of Bloomberg, one individual, being able to put a $100 million into the campaign?CHUCK ROCHA, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER, BERNIE SANDERS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: Well, it's a big infusion unlike Senator Rubio said, it'll have a big and dramatic impact. And I think the reason that you're seeing this outside of just the pure money moving around is, it's hard to find an electoral map that gives Donald Trump a victory if you don't have Florida in it.So, you see people doubling and tripling down. I think the Bloomberg money would have went a lot further if this would have happened three months ago. I think people in Florida, many of them have already made up their mind. I don't think that the undecided universe of voters down there is that big. I do think it still helps, and I think it helps in a dramatic way, but it would have been so much more helpful, probably 60 days ago.BARTIROMO: I mean, it's just so much money for one individual, Brian, and we've got these new 2020 polls numbers from the "Wall Street Journal" and "NBC News" show that Joe Biden has a 62 percent lead of Latino support compared to 26 percent who backed President Trump. These numbers also reflect the same level that President Trump had at this period during the 2016 election I should point out as well. Bryan, your reaction.LANZA: Listen, I think you know, when you look at polling, national polling for Hispanics, I mean, there are hard different Hispanics in Florida than are in California where I'm from. You know, I have a Mexican mother and a Bolivian father, and none of those agree on what's important to the Hispanic community because they come from different areas.So you know, I look at the Hispanic vote in individual states that matter most, you know, Florida is doing really well with Hispanic vote, Florida matters. Obviously, he's not well with the Hispanic vote in California because California doesn't matter. But I do want to at least talk about the $100 billion from Bloomberg. I'm glad that, you know, as Americans, we have decided that individuals contributing to political campaigns is no longer illegal.The Democrats used to say this was wrong, this was outrageous, you buying - - you know, buying the state, I'm glad Democrats no longer feel that way about corporate, rich contributions to political campaigns because we can now get over the charade. Let's just -- let's just fight it out, let's have our issues or ideas and let's move forward rather than complain about how campaigns are being funded.BARTIROMO: Dagen?MCDOWELL: Chuck, it's so good to see you. So I want to raise an issue with you that you have raised on social media. What worked for the Bernie Sanders campaign under your leadership was hiring Latino individuals and consultants to get the vote out. If you want to increase your support among Latino voters in this country, then you go to the Latino communities directly. You've been sort of critical of how the Biden campaign and particularly Mike Bloomberg with this huge influx of money were spending that. Are they -- are they listening to you and committing that money to Latino consultants?ROCHA: Dagen, it's good to see you, too. Both of me and you, both on the TV, so we're -- tomorrow, we may have to have a translator focus in New York City. But anyway, to your point, I think you're exactly right. I thought the key to Bernie's --what we did with Bernie, we started early and we went to the community and we had a conversation early. Keep in mind, I was trying to get Latinos to like an old white Jewish socialist Democrat from Vermont. And I was rolling up into Nevada, going -- this guy is going to be the next Cesar Chavez. So we had a lot of work to do just like Joe Biden has a lot of work to do, and the key to doing that work is showing up early, talking to young people on their cell phone and digitally talking to your grandmothers or your abuelitas, in Spanish language -- the newspapers, in telemundo ads, all of those things are strategic strategy that Joe Biden hasn't had the luxury or the time to do.And then the coronavirus -- and this is where you see me been critical -- made him start later. So it's been a soft number for him which also gave Donald Trump an opening to spend $1.5 million on Spanish language while Biden was down. That's why you see Donald Trump at historic levels with Latinos in many states.BARTIROMO: Chuck, it's an interesting point. Bryan, what do you say to that? I mean, you know, Florida was all in for Donald Trump and now we're talking about the potential of going purple.LANZA: You know, I think the Hispanic community is with Donald Trump because of the tremendous amount of Hispanic opportunities that's taken place during the last three and half years. That's hard to reverse. You know, with the TV ad, I mean, people feel it in their pockets and people in my community, my neighbors, you know, they feel it. They're opening small businesses where they were employees for a very long time, now they're small business owners. That is a net effect of a Trump presidency and that's what Biden is competing against.Sure, you're going to be able to spend a lot of money, you're going to be able to do a lot of things -- you know, and Chuck is right, Biden started really late and his argument isn't that strong with the Latino community. It's just like raise taxes and I'll figure it out and open borders. We both know that open borders actually hurts the Latino community more than any other community out there. So, you know, not only Biden starting late, he's wrong on the issues and wrong on the policies that the Latinos care about. So, I'm not surprised that President Trump is doing well in certain Latino states such as Florida and Texas. I wish we were doing better in California, but as a Californian, I know that California is a lost cause for America and for Republicans.BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there, Bryan and Chuck, great to see you both, thank you so much. Of course, we'll be watching and covering it. We'll slip in a break, when we come back, New Jersey's big money-maker, how sports betting is paying off for the Garden State, we will get into it with a lot of sports on this weekend. Then speed demons, the car and its drivers reportedly getting the most speeding tickets. Find out if it's sitting in your driveway. You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A record-breaking month for sports gambling. In one state, New Jersey, sports books reporting a $668 million in wages last month, that's a record for any state with legal sports betting. Joining me right now is SportsGrid President and Co-founder Lou Maione, and Lou, it is great to see you this morning, thank you so much for being here.LOU MAIONE, PRESIDENT & CO-FOUNDER, SPORTSGRID: Yes, Maria how are you? These numbers are blowouts --BARTIROMO: Well, it was a really busy -- it was a blowout number and it was a really big weekend of sports. It coincides with the return of some major sports. I'll tell you, I was flipping around the channels this weekend, so many channels I went to, whether it was the NFL, the NBA, MLB, you have a lot of sports. Are you seeing a big impact?MAIONE: Maria, the impact is unbelievable, the numbers were crazy yesterday. All states, we're seeing revenues north of 50 million just on online. That to me is just unbelievable. New Jersey, 20 million yesterday, you're talking unbelievable numbers. Like I haven't seen numbers like this -- I mean, these are tasty numbers like Mama Maione, Sunday, you know, sauce. Come on, this is unbelievable.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: Well, with the success in New Jersey, other states are also looking to get involved, they want to capitalize, Lou, including New York. If approved in the Big Apple, will that affect your business?MAIONE: Maria, Big Apple has got to come on. It's going to, obviously, affect our business. But, I mean, they need it to help their constituents. They need to help their people that live there. I mean, they need the revenue. New York better get on in the next 12 months -- I mean, Cuomo better make sure that, that prop 17 passes. I mean, it has to go down. I mean, it's going to help on fees that they're going to bring in, revenue -- governor.BARTIROMO: Yes -- no, so, I want to know how important it is, the revenue from gambling for the state. I mean, you know, it's these people, flee for low tax states -- just last week, New Jersey announced a new millionaire's tax. People are leaving in droves because of the high taxes. How important do you see this as filling up the state coughers?MAIONE: Maria, we talked to my parents this weekend about that millionaire tax. I'm going to go. I'm going to have to leave just like I threatened to leave New York and move my company out of New York back when fantasy wasn't going to be legal. Now, it's the same thing, you've got a storm going on here in New Jersey and New York, and I'm going to tell you right now, I'm not going to stand for it personally and they're going to lose people like me and many more. You know, this is not a smart move, this millionaire tax. So I'm telling you right now, instead of doing the millionaire tax, how about we bring on New York online gambling, keep everybody in their respective states, that would be a better idea. Don't you think?BARTIROMO: Yes, well, for sure. Look, the big online sports folks, obviously, a winning in the state casinos operating limited capacity, right? I mean, the big winners were the online sports book taking in 90 percent of August handle. FanDuel and DraftKings also still dominating sports books, generating revenue of 17.6 million and 10 million respectively. Take us inside, Lou, who are the people who are playing? What do you see in terms of the backdrop here?MAIONE: Yes, so, my sources are telling me that you see, you know, definitely FanDuel is number one. You have DraftKings right there, DraftKings get a lot of press because of the IPO, they've stopped moving nicely, they make some nice announcements here and there. You know, just the last week, they made the announcement with New York. So you see these moves, but sports book FanDuel is the leader and they're moving in a way that gives them this margin over, I think DraftKings and the rest of the competition is way down. There's a huge gap between second and third. But you see DraftKings making a great move and fantasy, I think they're overtaken in the market by 2-1.So two different strategies, right? And that's what I'm looking at. But just look, Barstool just came into the business, Maria, that's going to help bring the younger demographic into this sport and bring it into this engagement, I mean, he has a hold on these young people, and that's going to benefit FanDuel and DraftKings for sure.BARTIROMO: Yes, I loved -- I loved coming to visit you at the race track, the other day -- a couple of years ago, and Lou, I so appreciate it. Great to see you and congrats on all of this success, we will keep following it.MAIONE: I can't wait, Maria, thank you, have a great day.BARTIROMO: Lou Maione joining us there. Coming up, the Emmys looking a little different this year due to the coronavirus. We'll take a look at the moments making a buzz this morning. You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, time for the Morning Buzz. First up, TV royalty parties virtually, your favorite television stars getting together for the 2020 Emmys and "Schitt's Creek" was the big winner, a record-breaking night with nine wins for "Schitt's Creek", Eddie Murphy also snagged an award for his return to "Saturday Night Live", Dagen, were you up? Did you watch it?MCDOWELL: I watched some of it, and to paraphrase what the "National Review" writer, Kyle Smith said, watching Jimmy Kimmel with no audience really crystallizes how painfully unfunny he is, that it really was -- I walked away from the night, thinking, how does this guy even have a job? You know, a case of the shingles is funnier than he is. And even the bits, when they trotted out people, there was a whole bit they did with a guy as a mail carrier who was speaking Russia, and it was supposed to be -- I don't even know what it was supposed to be. But it -- everything just landed with a thud that he attempted.BARTIROMO: Wow --MCDOWELL: Contract renewal, don't know if that's in his future.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: Next up, speed demon. A new study finds Subaru WRX drivers are more likely to get a speeding ticket, 20 percent of WRX drivers reportedly receiving a citation which is twice the national average, Dagen. You're our resident car expert, what do you think about this, these wheels, are you surprised?MCDOWELL: It doesn't surprise me that people driving cars that aren't inherently fast are the ones who get caught speeding. The danger is, is these cars are not designed to handle as well at very high speeds as say real sports cars. I --literally drive in 75,000 miles in last year, very dangerous. You need to like -- take your foot off the gas, people.BARTIROMO: Yes, I'd say, finally out of this world, check this out, hotels.com wants to be the first online travel site providing hotel bookings in space. The site gives a glimpse to what the future of outer space hotel life could look like, James.FREEMAN: Yes --BARTIROMO: You booking your stay?FREEMAN: I will be, it's exciting. And you know, I don't often give Barack Obama credit for a lot of things, but he did survive in 2015 an important law, allowing for the commercialization of space. So people can develop property and they own it. Whether they want to mine or hotels -- so, the future of possibilities are tremendous here.BARTIROMO: That's unbelievable. All right, still ahead, monumental choice for the Supreme Court. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany is here on who President Trump may choose as the next Supreme Court Justice next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.Load-Date: September 21, 2020End of Document

UN: ON 75TH ANNIVERSARY, RECOMMIT TO HUMAN RIGHTSStates News ServiceSeptember 16, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 954 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:United Nations member countries should use the General Assembly session ahead of the world body's 75th anniversary to recommit to human rights, Human Rights Watch said today. The largely virtual high-level session of the General Assembly will begin on September 22, 2020.UN members should soundly reject China's apparent long-term efforts to severely undermine the UN's human rights pillar and the United States attempts to selectively reinterpret international human rights standards. Members should reinforce and recommit to gender equality, including during the session on the 25th anniversary of the 1995 Fourth World Conference on Women."The creation of the United Nations 75 years ago should be a moment of unabashed celebration, but abusive leaders still harness every crisis to stomp on basic freedoms and ride roughshod over the rights of women, minorities, and marginalized people," said Louis Charbonneau, UN director at Human Rights Watch. "The world needs more countries, big and small, willing to demonstrate global human rights leadership and publicly call out abusive governments, such as China, Saudi Arabia, and Russia, and democracies like the United States."Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will be one of the few leaders to speak from the General Assembly podium. He should urge UN members to heed his recent Call to Action on Human Rights. In that appeal, Guterres pledged to rekindle the UN's attention to rights issues, warning that "disregard for human rights is widespread" around the world.The secretary-general should drop his aversion to criticizing specific countries. In particular, he should publicly condemn China's abusive national security law for Hong Kong and its mass detention of Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang. His reluctance to speak out publicly on China's abuses runs counter to the spirit of his Call to Action. He has not responded to a June letter from nongovernmental organizations, including Human Rights Watch, urging him to appoint a special envoy to monitor abuses in Hong Kong and elsewhere in China.The secretary-general should also publicly express concerns about US plans to promote the Trump administration's Commission on Unalienable Rights. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is expected to host a side event on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to promote the commission, an exercise to "re-examine" internationally recognized rights."The US Commission on Unalienable Rights is a deeply misguided enterprise with the potential to undermine human rights protections that governments find disagreeable," Charbonneau said. "The commission promotes the false premise that too many people, particularly lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people and women, are asserting their rights."UN members that participate in another possible Trump administration event during during the General Assembly's high-level week on the Women's Global Development and Prosperity initiative should reject the US government's notion that one can separate women's economic rights from other human rights, including the right to live free of violence or the right to health.While the United States has reduced its influence at the UN withdrawing from the Human Rights Council, withholding funds from the UN Population Fund, and possibly leaving the World Health Organization China has been doing the opposite.The Chinese government has sought to expand and deepen its influence on UN affairs, but it has used that influence to undermine and try to defund mechanisms on human rights, one of the UN's three fundamental pillars, alongside peace and security and development. China has constantly lobbied the UN budget committee to deny funding or reduce staff for missions that monitor human rights violations or gather evidence of serious crimes in places like Syria and Myanmar.UN delegations should use the October 1 high-level meeting celebrating the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action to strongly reaffirm their commitment to gender equality. The Covid-19 pandemic, school closures, and economic crisis exacerbate existing inequalities, with profound consequences for women and girls, such as increased caregiving roles, greater exposure to gender-based violence, and increased barriers to education and economic empowerment."Many of the hard-fought gains on women's rights over the past 25 years are under threat, including through stepped-up attacks on sexual and reproductive health and rights from the US," Charbonneau said. "China has harassed and intimidated women's rights activists and censored social media accounts and posts promoting gender equality."The Covid-19 pandemic has killed nearly a million people worldwide this year. Lockdowns and a global economic downturn have disproportionately affected those living in or vulnerable to poverty. The pandemic's lasting impact on the economic and social rights, including access to adequate health care, of those in precarious situations is of special concern. UN member countries should take advantage of the UN General Assembly session to accelerate discussions on recovery efforts that will permanently reduce economic and social inequalities."UN members at the General Assembly should condemn all attempts to turn back the clock and weaken the global human rights framework," Charbonneau said. "China wants to recreate the UN's human rights pillar in its anti-rights image. The US is urging the world to cherry-pick the rights they like and reject the ones they don't. World leaders should respond with a resounding 'no' and demand that human rights be respected and expanded, not curtailed or cast aside."Load-Date: September 17, 2020End of Document

The demise of WeChatThe Technique: Georgia TechOctober 12, 2020 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: OPINIONS; Pg. 1Length: 732 wordsBodyThe recent events surrounding TikTok read like a dramatic, three-part saga: its initial ban by the Trump administration, its acquisition by Oracle and Walmart, and now the uncertain state that it remains in. But substantially fewer people know about the other Chinese social media giant, WeChat, that has also been vying for the attention of US national security talks and a barrage of executive orders. If Tiktok is the slicker, better-looking younger brother, then WeChat is the older, more self-possessed sibling, with less notoriety but a broader audience at home. The New York Times called WeChat China's true "Powerhouse App," and for good reason. WeChat, owned by Chinese company Tencent, boasts over a billion users worldwide and over 3 million active monthly users in the US. It is the equivalent of Facebook Messenger, Twitter, Instagram, and Apple Pay rolled into one omnipresent service -and that's an understatement of its utility in mainland China. Its mobile payment function has rendered credit cards and cash obsolete there, even normalizing street vendors selling meat and produce through virtual transactions.I'm no national security expert, but it seems to me that there are several things wrong with the national measures being taken to eventually ban the app. While there is truth to WeChat promoting Chinese propaganda and its uses for social control, the premise of the ban - that WeChat is a national security threat because it collects data from Americans for the Chinese government and promotes fake news - is hypocritical. The idea that there be limits on free speech to "protect people's privacy" is paternalistic and draconian, and assumes that users are so dim that they cannot discern for themselves what information deserves merit (notably not a stance taken by US social media networks).The truth is that collecting and storing people's data and spreading misinformation may very well be the intent of the Chinese government, but WeChat was modeled on the tactics and practices of Silicon Valley. To unilaterally declare a ban without acknowledging the role of tech giants like Facebook and Twitter in spreading serious misinformation does not project strength - one only has to look at the role Facebook played in the Rohingya genocide in Myanmar. It also makes little sense that an app with relatively small reach among U.S. residents would be considered a higher-priority action item than domestic terrorism incited by white supremacists, which the Department of Homeland Security recently called "the gravest terror threat" to our nation, encouraged by Russia.This is not an attempt to distract from the very real problems posed by the Chinese government with a "what-aboutism" pivot to Russia. This opinion merely highlights the fact we are hardly in a position to accuse foreign social media networks as perpetrators of fake news. This action is emblematic of an administration that is too arrogant to publicly engage with our own problems of election meddling from foreign governments and privacy concerns from domestic companies in a constructive way.It is an easy way to seem 'tough on China' in an election and pandemic year, without actually employing the high-level diplomacy and forethought that we have come to associate with the "leader of the free world."It is also deeply concerning for the immigrants and expatriates of the Chinese diaspora, who have relied on WeChat to maintain contact with friends and family across the world. Banning WeChat would also dissolve the countless smaller communities that Chinese American families have formed locally. It is also unclear, but possible, that Apple and Alphabet Inc. would be crippled by a partial US ban. According to Bloomberg, Apple relies on China for a fifth of its sales and a large portion of its manufacturing, and a ban of WeChat on Apple products would make them useless to Chinese consumers. Shang-Jin Wei, a Professor of Economics at Columbia University, has suggested that the US could order Tencent to "stop sending push notifications or advertisements to users registered with a U.S. phone number, or who are traveling in the U.S.," or issuing a pop-up warning from the US government to anyone downloading the app.At any rate, it seems that if we continue along this path, we are embracing isolationism at the expense of exhaustively vetting creative diplomatic and economic options.Load-Date: October 13, 2020End of Document

And this is a big smoking gun.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Well, the e-mails show Hunter Biden being asked whether he could use his influence to help stop politically motivated actions against the company. Another e-mail shows a Burisma advisor thanking him for "Giving an opportunity to meet your father and spend time together".All this discovered by the owner of a computer repair shop in Delaware who says Hunter Biden brought his computer in for service back in 2019 and never picked it up. Once he found those e-mails on the computer's hard drive, he turned it into the FBI.(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is there any thought in your mind that this could not - that this might not have been Hunter's and might have been somebody trying to set Hunter up?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No. No.(END AUDIO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The Biden campaign denies any wrongdoing here, saying the Post never reached out to the campaign.

Republicans are ready to go, I am ready to sign", writes the president.Mnuchin, meanwhile, casting doubt on getting a deal done before the election. He says it would be difficult to even though there is $300 billion from the first package that remains unspent and could be used to provide immediate relief.And the final day of testimony from Judge Amy Coney Barrett in her Supreme Court confirmation hearing this morning. Yesterday, she took questions on a range of topics, including abortion, the affordable care act, and her interpretation of first amendment rights.Republicans are optimistic over her confirmation with top committee leaders saying that they have the votes.

The Dow was down 165; the NASDAQ was lower by 95; and the S&P was lower by 23 at 4:00 on Wall Street.Joining me right now is Lebenthal Global Advisors President, Dominick Tavella. Also joining the conversation all morning this morning is Fox Business' Dagen McDowell; Republican strategist, Pinion Enterprises Founder and CEO, Joseph Pinion.Great to see everybody this morning. Happy Thursday to you.Dominick, let me kick it off with you here. What are you expecting in terms of driving this market? Why such weakness at the beginning of earnings period, yesterday down in the triple digits and we are looking at a decline now of 265 points on the Dow.DOMINICK TAVELLA, PRESIDENT, LEBENTHAL GLOBAL ADVISORS: So we've had a very nice bounce off of the September lows and the market basically recovered pretty much what we had lost during September. But I think now the markets are really starting to focus on two things, this virus that simply will not go away and obviously is getting worse on a day-to-day basis.And the second thing is there at least the possibility of a blue wave coming in the election and if that were to happen, what does that really mean from an economic perspective? Global economic perspective. Those two things are starting to worry people, and I think people in general, investors in general are trying to get defensive and prepare for it.BARTIROMO: So what do you want to do now going into the election? Do you sit on the sidelines, sit on cash until we know what policies are going to drive the day, or do you buy into some of this weakness?TAVELLA: Well, I think in the short run, you look at your winners. I mean, if you've owned some of these large company tech stocks, if you've owned healthcare year-to-date, you've done very, very well. And with the prospect at least that you could have a higher capital gains rate next year, why not harvest some profits, raise cash a little bit. We're sitting with about 10 percent cash. I don't want to go into the election with anything less than 10 percent cash.And if we get some volatility after the election, that would be, I think, a great buying opportunity. But you have to at least contemplate that we could be looking at higher taxes next year. That regulatory events are going to be much, much stricter next year, that we could be looking at environmental and energy impact with a different administration in Washington.So these are real important issues that you have to start focusing on now. You cannot wait till January to do that kind of work.BARTIROMO: Yes. I've been looking at the capital gains tax and the fact that you're going to see that capital gains tax go from, what, 23 percent all the way up to 39.6. Would indicate to me that that's going to be the thinking after the election, if investors are sitting on a lot of gains they're going to say I'm going to realize those gains now while I can get a 23 percent tax rate, rather than 39.6 next year.In that vein, if Joe Biden wins, do you believe we'll see a market selloff after Election Day?TAVELLA: Well, that's what scares me, Maria, is that people are going to wait until after the election and then make those decisions. We could already have at least a 10 percent pullback just in that contemplation. So why not harvest some profits now before the results of the election are there and then you can always buy back in. There's never, never anything wrong with harvesting some profit.So we've had some good winners in our portfolios. It's time to put that money on the sidelines and be prepared. I think we're going to have a pullback. I don't think it's going to be dramatic. I think 10 percent is reasonable and I think that does give us a buying opportunity for next year. But you don't wait until after the storm hits to start boarding up your house. You do it ahead of time.BARTIROMO: Understood. Dominick, good to see you this morning. Thanks so much. Dominick Tavella this morning.Your morning mover right now. Alcoa, take a look at the stocks selling off in the premarket after reporting quarterly earnings after the bell last night. Alcoa says, it's expecting a decline in aluminum business due to anticipation of higher power costs in Europe. Maintenance expenses, labor costs and tariffs is also possible, restructuring charges of about $30 million to $40 million in the fourth quarter.The CEO of Alcoa did say that China's demand for raw aluminum has snapped back as the country sees an industrial rebound. The stock this morning down 4.60 percent.We are just getting started this morning.Coming up, potential wrongdoing in the Biden family. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani will talk about the corruption report surrounding Joe Biden son Hunter Biden cashing in on his father's position.Next hour, the top market moves investors are watching this morning with the word on Wall Street coming up.And then confirming Judge Amy Coney Barrett, North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis is here talking about the odds of getting Judge Barrett officially confirmed onto the bench.Then former deputy Trump campaign manager Rick Gates on his new book and experience being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller.In the 8:00 a.m. hour, Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton is here on the Hunter Biden corruption reports and Big Tech's censorship of the story. What will this mean for tech companies?And then NFL Hall of Famer, Fox NFL lead game analyst Troy Aikman joining us on the league's upcoming games.Don't miss a moment of it. You're watching "Mornings with Maria" live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Bombshell new e-mails released, the New York Post obtaining e-mails that reveal Hunter Biden introduced his father, then Vice President Joe Biden, to a top executive at Ukraine energy company Burisma, prior to the VP pressuring officials there to fire a prosecutor who was investigating the company.The Biden campaign is denying the reporting saying the schedule logs show no meeting took place at the time. President Trump speaking out in Iowa yesterday about this scandal.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Vice President Biden, you owe the people of America an apology because it turns out you are a corrupt politician. OK?Joe Biden must immediately release all the mails, meetings, phone calls, transcripts and records related to his involvement in his family's business dealings, influence peddling around the world, including China and including Russia, including Russia.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, Big Tech companies are under fire for censoring the story. Twitter locked out White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany from her personal Twitter account after she shared the New York Post's story.Facebook is also censoring it. They will not distribute this story.Joining me right now is former Whitewater Independent Counsel, former Federal Prosecutor and Partner at Thompson & Knight, Robert Ray is here. Robert, good to see you this morning. Thanks very much for joining me.What do you make of this story? Is there criminality here?ROBERT RAY, FOMER WHITEWATER INDEPENDENT COUNSEL: It's hard to know at this point, although from the story in the New York Post, we do know the FBI took an interest in this and apparently took possession of the laptop and the hard drive that apparently belonged to Hunter Biden and did so sometime at the end of 2019.And when asked about it, the FBI referred comment to the U.S. attorney's office for the district of Delaware. And they declined the comment one way or another about confirming the existence or nonexistence of an investigation. So it was significant enough that it had attracted the attention of law enforcement, which means that obviously somebody looked into it but we don't know what the status of that investigation, if there is one, and whether that's ongoing or not.As to criminality, I mean, the first issue here is that it's obvious now that Vice President Biden was not telling the truth. He actually did apparently meet with the Ukrainian company Burisma, and official with that company and Hunter Biden was obviously involved in setting that up while he was on the payroll for Burisma.So the question naturally arises, if the vice president wasn't telling the truth about that. What else is he not telling the truth about?And within a year's time, we also know that the vice president was leading the effort to have the prosecutor in charge removed, who has since indicated that one of the things that he intended to do was to investigate this company and Hunter Biden's role.So there's a lot of questions that are out there. But the opener here from this laptop and the e-mails contained on the laptop is that there was involvement, that what Hunter Biden was hired to do, which everybody suspected, but now has been confirmed, was the to use his influence and with the vice president and the vice president actually did meet with an official at that company.BARTIROMO: It's just extraordinary to me, because earlier this year there was an impeachment trial against President Trump and there were actually no articles of - there wasn't any criminality. They impeached him even though there wasn't a crime. And this whole trial was talking about Ukraine and what the president said to the Ukrainian leadership on a phone call and no comment whatsoever about the fact that Joe Biden's son was on the board of Burisma, that obviously there was conversation around this.Now we get the smoking gun e-mails and Facebook censors it, Twitter censors it. I tweeted out yesterday, Robert, where are we, communist China? And what's going on? That social media companies have decided that they've chosen a side and they're not going to put a spotlight on any wrongdoing.Obviously, it appears that Hunter Biden was trying to cash-in on his father being vice president and he was getting paid $50,000 a month. So we'll look for criminality. But as far as wrongdoing, inappropriate behavior, making $50,000 a month from a government company in Ukraine and then an impeachment trial against his opponent, it's just extraordinary to me.RAY: Well, me too. I mean, look, there's no question, there's a skunk here and after all this is involving a candidate for the presidency of the United States who has the Democratic nomination and we're three weeks away from an election. I would be looking at, for example, whether or not - and the president is right to say this. Look, we know the dates now. This was apparently April of 2015.What does the vice president's e-mail show that reflects whether or not this meeting took place and what he knew about it and what was discussed and you would be wondering about whether or not there's a violation of either the federal gratuity statute or the federal bribery statute, which prohibits a public official. He was a public official then, he was the Vice President of the United States of receiving things of value in exchange 404 because of official acts that he could take among others to get the United States government to apply pressure to the Ukraine to have a government official there removed.BARTIROMO: Unbelievable. And this is all merging into the other story that we continue to follow, and that of course is the FBI wrongdoing. We did get news that finally Bruce Ohr is stepping down from the Department of Justice. He was under fire because of his connections to Christopher Steele. He announced that he is retiring.Ahead of his likely firing, President Trump spoke about it last night and we know that Bruce Ohr was the individual who was passing on Steele dossier information and his wife, Nellie Ohr, worked for Fusion GPS.Real quick reaction to Bruce Ohr finally stepping down. 3.5 years into our investigating, what took place here, Robert?RAY: I don't know whether he committed any wrongdoing again in terms of criminality. They put him in a broom closet. It just goes to show you how long it takes to actually get effective action. And it raises serious questions that remain about the justice department and the FBI and individuals that at fairly significant levels with significant responsibility acting not in the best interest of the country, but in connection with political purposes or to advance political purposes. That is very troubling and remains--BARTIROMO: It sure does. It sure does.Robert, thank you so much. Good to see you, sir, Robert Ray.We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Tech censorship, Facebook and Twitter limiting the distribution of the New York Post's bombshell about Hunter Biden's e-mail exchanges with an advisor to Ukrainian Energy Company Burisma, and how he tried to cash-in on his father's position.Twitter locked several accounts for sharing the story, including White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany's personal account, noting it violated their hacked materials policy.Later in the day, Twitter Head Jack Dorsey address the controversy, saying that it was unacceptable.Facebook also announced it was limiting distribution of the story while it looks at it, investigates it.Dagen McDowell, your reaction.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: Thank you, Twitter and Facebook for showing the American people what we always thought about you, that you would quickly censor thought that your minions on the left didn't agree with, that you would quickly censor any news report that doesn't reflect well on your chosen presidential candidate, your chosen political candidate.Thank you for showing us what you are made of, because now as a nation, we can go elsewhere. This is censorship. It's not communist, because it's not by the government. But it's still dangerous. I'm just going to read a couple of tweets from Sohrab Ahmari, who is the opinion editor at the New York Post.This is what he said yesterday. By the way the New York Post account, last time I looked, it's still shut down and it's frozen by Twitter.This is a big tech information coup. This is digital civil war. I and editor of the New York Post, one of the nation's largest papers by circulation, cannot post one of our own stories that details corruption by a major party presidential candidate. This is unacceptable. I don't know where it goes from here.Maybe Twitter's rules are just being formed and that turns into a mess, but it does seem like they are singling out stories that are damaging to their preferred presidential candidate. It's breathtaking to me, but this is what we suspected all along in terms of the censorship of conservative ideas, conservative reporting.And by the way, on Twitter, if you want to share a story or two or five about the Steele dossier, which we know is essentially Russian disinformation, that is inaccurate, you could still do that on Twitter. Twitter never censored stories that were incorrect by CNN about Jim Comey's testimony.I'm going to retweet Sohrab Ahmari's.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's a good point.MCDOWELL: I'm going to retweet Sohrab Ahmari's editorial piece from the New York Post today. Let's see if it actually gets out there, but he goes through a list that Jim Comey was about to dispute Trump's claim that the FBI Director reassured him that he wasn't under investigation. CNN reported and had to retract that story about what Jim Comey was going to say.So again, what are they up to? They're silencing a story that reflects badly on their preferred presidential candidate and it must stop.BARTIROMO: Dagen, some of them got Pulitzer prizes for it, ok. The New York Times and the Washington Post got Pulitzer prizes for reporting that Donald Trump colluded with Russia. I mean, it's outrageous. And the fact that this is coming today, so specific and in our faces, that they are censoring this information is exactly the reason that you are going to see legislation come of down on these technology companies to remove that protection that they enjoy, they cannot get sued.Because the whole reason that that liability protection was put in place, this is rule 230 in the Telecommunications Act. The whole reason that that was even put in place is because these companies came up with an analysis of themselves saying we're bulletin boards. Everybody's thoughts goes on the bulletin boards. We're bulletin boards, isn't that right, Dagen? Obviously, they are not bulletin board. They're only a bulletin board for the narratives that they want to believe and they want to disseminate to readers.MCDOWELL: Well, and Mark Zuckerberg, I know that you have Rudy Giuliani coming up shortly, but he had originally tried to push the - what I call, the let it fly rule. He didn't want Facebook in the middle of basically censoring content or having to judge the accuracy of it or not. He wanted to step back. But it looks like at least, we heard from this guy, Andy Stone yesterday, the Facebook Policy Communications director on this. Well, he has a long history of working for Democrats. He was a former staffer for Barbara Boxer, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee --MARIA BARTIROMO, ANCHOR, MORNINGS WITH MARIA: Right --MCDOWELL: And the house majority PAC. So again, we -- they're not looking out for their users. They're looking out for -- well, Joe Biden.BARTIROMO: Yes, we will talk more about this with New York City mayor -- former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. He's coming up next on the Hunter Biden corruption report with the election rapidly approaching. You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Oh, yes. Welcome back, good Thursday morning everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, it is Thursday, October 15th. Let's take a look at markets this morning, 6:33 a.m. on the East Coast. We've got a selloff underway, futures indicating a decline of almost 300 points on the Dow, right out of the gate, Dow Industrials down 284, the Nasdaq is down 188 and the S&P 500 down 37 points, as markets continue the selloff. That started yesterday. Markets finished near the lows of the day Wednesday. Take a look, Dow Industrials down 165, the Nasdaq down 95, S&P 500 down 23, investors no longer expecting any stimulus before the election.Meanwhile, COVID cases in Europe surpassing cases in the United States for the first time since the Spring time. Cheryl Casone with the details there. Cheryl?CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS: That is right, Maria, good morning. The European Union and the U.K. have seen the seven-day new infection average jump to more than 78,000, this is forcing France to declare a state of emergency and impose a curfew in the Paris region. The United States meanwhile confirming more than 50,000 new cases were confirmed yesterday after reporting 41,000 the day prior. Cases in the U.S. topping 7.8 million with more than 216,000 people dead. Well, Wells Fargo firing more than 100 employees for defrauding the small business administration. An internal memo says the staffers made, quote, "false representations in applying for coronavirus relief funds for themselves through the economic entering disaster loan program.Taking a look at that stock in the pre-market, this is Wells Fargo, the value reported earnings, it is down a quarter percent. Increasing diversity. Starting next year, Starbucks is going to link its executive pay to inclusion initiatives. The coffee giant also mandating anti-bias training for higher ups. The goal to have 30 percent of its corporate employees and 40 percent of its used retail positions to be held by people of color like 2025. Let's take a look at Starbucks in the pre-market, down almost 1 percent. Well, and there's this. A St. Louis couple who waved guns at protesters have pled not guilty to firearms and obstruction charges. Mark and Patricia McCloskey said they were defending their home.They're due back in court at the end of the month. The couple says they have talked to the president about the case. The governor of Missouri plans to pardon them if they are convicted, Maria. And those are your headlines from here. Back over to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thank you so much. We've been talking about this bombshell "New York Post" report. We have got a new report this morning in the "New York Post". Let's show you yesterday, new e-mails show Hunter Biden being asked whether he could use his influence to help stop politically-motivated actions against the Ukrainian energy company Burisma whose board, the vice president's son had recently joined. This morning, the new "New York Post" headline is the following. They just released e- mails revealing Hunter Biden purchased lucrative deals involving China's largest energy company as well.Here's the headline of the post, "e-mails reveal how Hunter Biden tried to cash in big on behalf of family with Chinese firm." All this discovered by the owner of a computer repair shop in Delaware, who says Hunter Biden brought his computer in for service back in 2019, and then he never picked it up.The shop owner turned the hard drive over to the FBI, but also provided a copy to Rudy Giuliani's lawyer, Robert Costello. Joining me right now is former New York City Mayor and President Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani. Rudy, it's good to see you this morning. You've been talking about this, something was to come for some time. First, tell me what happened here. They gave it to the FBI, but you also had a copy of it. We haven't heard any of this out of the FBI, so when did you first receive this information and turn it over to --(LAUGHTER)RUDY GIULIANI, FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: Well, of course, you haven't heard anything --BARTIROMO: Well, what's funny? Tell me --GIULIANI: You didn't hear anything about the -- well, it isn't funny --BARTIROMO: Right --GIULIANI: I shouldn't have laughed. It's actually very sad that --BARTIROMO: No --GIULIANI: I was just laughing at the thought of the FBI --BARTIROMO: Exactly --GIULIANI: Would actually do anything. I mean, I haven't seen the FBI do anything since Louis Freeh was there, I think. But I mean, the reality is - - and I shouldn't say that because the men and women of the FBI are terrific and I love them. The leadership of the FBI --BARTIROMO: It's -- it was the leadership.GIULIANI: Somewhat -- the best I can say is pathetic. And the reality is, they had that, you know, Brennan note for four years. It would have ended any necessity for any kind of investigation and they withheld it and covered it up. I can't understand that. I never will.BARTIROMO: That's right --GIULIANI: And now --BARTIROMO: That's right --GIULIANI: This one, if you take a look at this hard drive and you're an FBI agent, you're compelled to do something about it. Because there are things on it that haven't come out yet that if any FBI agent sat by and watched it, they shouldn't be an FBI agent. So, what are these about today?BARTIROMO: Right --GIULIANI: What these are about today are --BARTIROMO: Tell me, yes --GIULIANI: At the beginning of a vast number -- at the beginning of a vast number of inter-relationships that the Biden crime family had with the Chinese Communist government. This particular deal involves what I call the family. You know, like they could be a mafia family for the number of crimes they're committing. And they team up with a guy named Ye JinMing(ph), who is one of the high level members of the Chinese Communist Party. By the way, an intelligence operative. Meaning, these people who gather information for the Chinese government so they can extort us and they try to turn people to make them spies. So, he through a man named Stanley Ho who is now in federal prison, and another gentleman named Guan Wang Dong(ph) get into a partnership with Hunter Biden, James Biden, and James Biden's wife.Basically, they're going to get $10 million a year and then after JinMing(ph) makes his 10 million back, that they're going to share it 50- 50. There's a breakdown of equity for the partners here and Hunter is going to get money, James is going to get money, Sarah is going to get money. And then there's a little notation in one column that says -- and 10 percent goes to H for the big guy. Also, Joe Biden and Jill Biden are provided with room keys to be part of the office, that is being sponsored largely by the money of a Chinese communist.And this is what we want for a president. We want a president whose son and brother are partners with Chinese communists, and who himself appears to be benefiting from it. Maybe that big guy is somebody else. I don't know. Maybe it was suggested. Maybe it never was written down.BARTIROMO: So, the e-mails --GIULIANI: There is a notation that says 10 percent for the big guy and --BARTIROMO: The e-mails said that a portion of this is for the big guy.GIULIANI: Yes, right at the bottom, 10 percent to H for the big guy --BARTIROMO: Wow --GIULIANI: Also, when the keys are given out to the new office for this Chinese communist basically owned business, Joe Biden and Jill Biden are given keys to the office. And we also put out an e-mail yesterday that suggested that Hunter Biden for 30 years has been paying all the expenses of the family, and he has to kick half the salary back to his dad. That's in a text or e-mail, I've forgotten -- I think an e-mail to his daughter complaining about more or less the way his father treated him. He says for 30 years, I've had to support this family --BARTIROMO: This is serious allegations here.GIULIANI: And unlike pop -- unlike pop, Maria, unlike pop, I'm not going to ask for half the salary back. Now, tell me what that is, and tell me how they lie their way out of this. And there's more to come, Maria.BARTIROMO: Unbelievable.GIULIANI: They're crooks. Well, the Democrat Party has to just come to the reality, they've got to face reality, sort of the "New York Times", they've been protecting a crime family for quite some time. This guy you see on the screen is a complete, absolute, almost --BARTIROMO: Yes --GIULIANI: Habitual drug addict. He couldn't earn $10. You wouldn't pay him $10. You wouldn't let him go buy you newspapers in the morning --BARTIROMO: But Rudy, let me ask you, you know --GIULIANI: And it's a tragedy what his father did to him. It's a tragedy that his father put his kid in that position --BARTIROMO: I want to -- I want you to tell me about the national security -- the national security risk because let me take you back --GIULIANI: Oh, wow --BARTIROMO: To 2016 and 2017. The whole crux of the narrative that Trump was colluding with Russia was because Russia had something on Trump. That there was some damaging information that Russia had on Trump. That's where it started. That was the crux of the --GIULIANI: Right --BARTIROMO: Dossier. We understand, we know that the dossier was garbage. It wasn't true. This was a coup to take down President Trump and then candidate Trump. But what you have here is actual leverage on Joe Biden and his son, if these allegations are true. That Ukraine and China had something on them. This is exactly what the Democrats tried to say about Trump, but once again, in fact, it was going on --GIULIANI: Phony liars --BARTIROMO: With them in their own backyard.GIULIANI: Well, you know --BARTIROMO: Tell me about national security issues.GIULIANI: I think -- well, I mean, the national security issues are extreme here. The Chinese communist possess a thousand pictures in which Hunter Biden is doing things that -- well, some are illegal, straight out illegal. Some are horribly illegal or suggest horrible illegality, not sure that there's a suggestion to that. And then the rest of them are extraordinarily embarrassing. And since the -- and since the vice president pretends he's a good boy, he's easily able to be leveraged, right?I mean, he wants to keep this image that he's a good boy. And there are some things in there that are extraordinarily embarrassing. I have a very hard time with knowing whether to release them or not. And maybe I should have some members of the press come and look at them, and you decide whether you think they're proper to release or not.I know some of them -- as a United States attorney, I know some of them would have arrested the guy the next day if I saw or read what I read. And I mean, I think it's perfectly proper to put out all the ones where he's sitting in a closet, smoking crack. There are -- because I -- what they show, in addition to a national security threat is that all this idea that he was getting money, of course, is ridiculous.BARTIROMO: Yes --GIULIANI: Because everybody who he was doing business with was a major criminal. That's another thing that's interesting. The --BARTIROMO: Yes --GIULIANI: Vice president has a son --BARTIROMO: Well --GIULIANI: Who is a drug addict, gets thrown out of the Navy for a -- and he puts him in -- and he puts him in with three of the most dangerous criminals in the world. What kind of judgment is that? What kind of caring about your son is that?BARTIROMO: Well, I want to ask you about that --GIULIANI: You know, people say, you've got to be sensitive.BARTIROMO: I want to talk about what Joe Biden had said about this --GIULIANI: He's a drug addict, his father should have been sentenced -- yes, and he just lied --BARTIROMO: Biden has answered this on many occasions, saying that it was debunked -- stay with us, Rudy, let's take a break, and then I want to zero in on exactly how Joe Biden has been dealing with this in the past few months. Rudy Giuliani is with us this morning, and we've got more right after this.BARTIROMO: And we're back with Mayor Rudy Giuliani, after damaging e-mails were released, showing Hunter Biden tried to cash in on his father's position. President Trump, Mr. Mayor, demanding Joe Biden release all of his business dealings. He called for this in a tweet, calling for the immediate release of all e-mails, meetings, phone calls, transcripts, records, related to the former vice president's involvement in his family business dealings including in China --GIULIANI: Not going to happen --BARTIROMO: And Russia. Rudy, what do you think is most damaging in these e-mails? Walk us through these e-mails so that people understand where the wrongdoing, potential criminality is.GIULIANI: Well, I mean, there's no question this money is for Joe Biden. When you -- he's being bribed, massive bribes for Joe Biden. So in the case of Ukraine, he was bribed in order to fix the case on Burisma. And in the case of China, he was bribed to go nice and soft on China which he's done for five, six years. He's getting this money just as he's negotiating for the United States and caving in on tariffs, caving in on the islands.He was sent there to get China to back off the islands. No, China expanded, but Hunter came away with $1.5 billion commitment. And how can we elect a president with what has to be done with China whose family has been in business with China. Both with the Chinese communist government and with some of its highest level members of the Chinese communist government.And with a country that possesses a dossier on him, that's not a phony, that's real. I think the Democrats came up with these charges from the process of projection because they charged him with what they do. I mean, they have become a totally --BARTIROMO: Yes, that's right --GIULIANI: Corrupted political party by putting this man on the top of their ticket. The man has been a criminal for 30 years.BARTIROMO: Well --GIULIANI: Hunter Biden said I've been supporting this family for 30 years. That's when he got his phony job --BARTIROMO: They've been doing this -- they've been doing this --GIULIANI: With a bank in Delaware --BARTIROMO: For -- I have music in my ear, please get it out. They're doing this now for at least, what? I mean, a couple of years because we know that they've been charging Donald Trump with collusion. We know Hillary Clinton actually colluded. Obstruction, we know actually Hillary Clinton obstructed. She destroyed 30,000 e-mails and destroyed her devices. And now, they try to attack the president for these things that we know that all of this money was coming in --GIULIANI: And --BARTIROMO: So, Rudy, let me ask you this, how much money totally do you believe Hunter Biden received?GIULIANI: From the Chinese?BARTIROMO: You believe Hunter Biden made in all of this?GIULIANI: I would say he received between -- I would say Hunter Biden received a minimum of about 12 million from the Ukrainians to a maximum of 20 --BARTIROMO: I don't hear anything.GIULIANI: I think he received -- I would say that he received a minimum of 10 million to a maximum of --BARTIROMO: Inslee is here --GIULIANI: Maybe 20. And then I would say that from China, it ranges from about 20 to 30 million, and that money is going to dad. That money is not for him.BARTIROMO: Unbelievable. Rudy, it's great to get you on the program this morning to walk us through all of this. Thank you so much, Rudy Giuliani, good to see you sir. We'll see you soon, we'll keep following it. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Calls for social media regulations, this after the July Twitter hack where prominent accounts such as Elon Musk and the Vice President Joe Biden were used to promote a cryptocurrency scam. The New York Department of Financial Services releasing a report recommending increased regulations for social media giants. This is separate and apart from what we learned yesterday where social media was trying to stop the dissemination of the reports on Hunter Biden. Joining me right now is cybersecurity expert and attorney Leeza Garber. Leeza, great to see you, give us the risks here.LEEZA GARBER, ATTORNEY & CYBERSECURITY EXPERT: Great to see you too. And this actually does tie into the other story, unfortunately, because it's all about what these social media giants are doing to protect their users. And so, when we talk about the New York State Department of Finance investigation in terms of the July Twitter hack, which was when we saw all these major celebrities offering to double people's cryptocurrency amounts, if they submitted a certain amount, they would get it back double or triple. And this investigation actually turned out that this was done by a very simple hacking maneuver, it was a phishing scheme, they took advantage of certain policies and procedures that were not up to par.So, what we're finding out is that Twitter, which has 330 million global users per month, actually wasn't protecting any cyber security measures as it should be, and that follows along the tales of what are these social media giants doing in terms of protecting their users and what they can see in their feeds.BARTIROMO: Well, these companies have become more powerful than anybody expected. I mean, you look at a company like Google, owned by Alphabet. Google controls 90 percent of all search. You know, there's just -- they're dominant in market share for search. You've got Twitter also dominant as well as Facebook in some corners. So, are we going to see this liability protection taken away? Are we going to see, do you think legislation that enables people to start suing these companies because that's why -- where they are protected under the --GARBER: Exactly --BARTIROMO: Section 230.GARBER: Exactly. Section 230 really is the federal law from the '90s that says there's a shield up against suing these platforms, Facebook, Twitter, Google. And the problem is that -- sorry, I have music in my ear right now. The problem is that these lawsuits are just not allowed because section 230 dictates that they can't be liable for what users post.Load-Date: October 15, 2020End of Document

First Huawei and now TikTok: what interests are behind the spy speech?CE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 13, 2020 SundayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 2792 wordsBodyIn recent months the U.S. government has overused the word "espionage" in the speech used to refer to Chinese digital companies. First it was with Huawei, and now again with TikTok and WeChat. In this article we will review the events followed by an analysis of the interests behind this discourse.In May Huawei was banned and blacklisted in the USA. The supposed reason that from Washington was repeated to tiredness was that huawei's 5G facilities posed a risk to American national security, because they could "spy."Last January, the British government, an old friend of the US, had decided to let Huawei participate in the installation of its 5G network in the UK, despite pressures and warnings from Washington. But last July 14th he took a 180-degree turn, indicating that Huawei will be excluded from its 5G networks, with a deadline for 2027, adding that the purchase of Huawei 5G equipment will be banned from December 31 of this year.In an article we published in February, we looked at the interests behind Huawei's ban and the American espionage speech (which we'll review in this article), in which we had said we'd probably see Trump do the same with other Chinese tech companies. And so it was. As he did with the multinational mobile phone company, Trump again used this argument against the Chinese apps TikTok (social video network belonging to the Chinese company ByteDance, widely used by young people around the world) and WeChat (instant messaging app similar to Whatsapp that also allows payments and money transfers, belonging to the Chinese company Tencent , used worldwide, but mostly in that same country). While huawei had said that espionage would be through 5G installations, in these cases the spy speech endures, even though there are no 5G in between.On August 6, Trump signed a decree to cease U.S. activity on those platforms held by China, and on August 14 he signed another that forces The Chinese group ByteDance to sell TikTok's activities in the United States before September 15, or else it would be banned. Since then, Microsoft, Twitter and Oracle have been in a competition for who stays with it.It is said to "spy" on the action by which one individual, or collective, observes another without the latter knowing. Digital platforms, as we will discuss below, generate their profits from the personal and usage data of their users. The user is obliged to accept the "terms and conditions" and "privacy policies", which he probably never read due to its long extension, in which, in a diffuse and misleading way, this point is mentioned. In this way, companies play a kind of game that causes some confusion in users, something like: "We warn that they will be observed, therefore it is not espionage".Digital platforms range from espionage to forced observation. They know more about us than many people assume, from where we've been (click here to see it), to all kinds of preferences. And if we want to use them, we are obliged to allow it.The closest example of the espionage implied in Washington's accusations is the one they made against their population themselves, made known by Edward Snowden, who leaked information in which he demonstrated that the US National Security Agency spied on its citizens through digital technology. By spying here we meant that they listened to conversations, read chats, and even watched throughof their cameras.But no military base or entity that handles important confidential information would use Chinese technology to communicate knowing that there is a danger that the PCCh is interfering with communication. The British, for example, at first, before yielding to pressure from Washington, had said they would not veta Huawei and its 5G networks, but would exclude it from the vicinity of military and nuclear areas. This leads to the thought that while Chinese espionage is a possibility, it is probably not Washington's biggest concern.Importantly, this "digital battle" is framed by the U.S.-China trade war, in which the U.S. is trying to curb the economic and geopolitical advance of the Asian giant that threatens American hegemony. In this sense, Huawei, TikTok and WeChat are companies that play a role that is of great concern to Washington, because they could mean important pieces for China on this battlefield. In the following part of the article we will discuss some of these aspects.It is necessary before we go into analyzing this new field of dispute and the interests at stake, to make a small parenthesis to try to understand a little of what technologies gave birth to this fight.The basis of this digital battle comes from major advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) over the past decade. As already known, AI is the area of science that creates computer programs that try to mimic a human task. But one of the most important branches within AI, and as a result of the great importance it has taken at the social, economic and political level, we see ourselves in the need to talk about it, is known as Machine Learning (ML).ML is the area that groups the algorithms that are characterized by "learning from experience". That is, unlike AI programs in general, ML is the particular case where these programs are made in a way that improves their results as they perform this task with new data.For example, a YouTube algorithm created in order to recommend videos that may interest us is ML. As more searches the user performs, the more videos they see, the more comment, the more they use the "like" or "dislike", the greater the database that the program will have to analyze of that user, that is, the greater the "experience", and therefore, the greater the accuracy that will be having in the recommendations in relation to the user's tastes.To give the reader a clearer idea of how such ratings are made, it is recommended to see which tags Google has awarded you by clicking here.This new way of advertising, known as "targeted advertising," prevents users from being bombarded with ads for products they would never consume, such as television advertising. With targeted advertising, the user receives ads only from products that are likely to be of interest to them, paying more attention to it, thus increasing the possibility of purchase.In recent years, targeted advertising has become the basis of sales and a fundamental tool of trade and the economy. Companies need these platforms to sell their products, and platforms need users and their personal data. The more data per user, the greater the accuracy of the algorithms; and the more accurate and more users, the greater the sale of products.If a digital platform that advertises directed advertising manages to be used by a large part of a country's population, it becomesin an important means of selling the products of the companies that trade in it. Having the power of these platforms means having mastery of an important part of trading, which makes our data an important field of business dispute.While the economic consequences of the Covd-19 hit the industry and trade of different countries, the GAFA group has only grown due to the multiplication of its sales during confinement. This is largely because they managed to take advantage of the paralysis of product sales premises to run them off the board and take their place. The market value of these companies already resembles, or exceeds, the GDP of several countries. It should come as no surprise if in a few months we start to see economic aid plans applied to crisis-hit countries in exchange for fully introducing them into their market. Indeed, Google has already announced that it will invest $10 billion in India, which many begin to see as the cheap labor that China represented a couple of decades ago, in a context in which the U.S. has been making trade and geopolitical alliances with the South Asian country, which also banned a total of 59 Chinese apps last June.Chinese digital companies are trying to be part of this game. Its expansion around the world implies that these are made of the personal and consumer data of a large number of people. This, as we have seen, allows the characterization of millions of users according to their consumer profile and the sending of targeted advertising of Chinese products according to that profile. That is, the expansion of Chinese digital platforms are an important key to expanding the country's market. In the context of trade war and tensions between the U.S. and the Asian giant, Washington will not want to allow this development.In this sense, the New Chinese Silk Road initiative, through a network of sea and land routes, aims to connect China with the rest of the Asian continent, Europe, Africa, the Arctic, and even Latin America. This project would represent the transfer of Chinese merchandise to the rest of the countries involved, while digital platforms, means of sale.The digital terrain had been undeniably dominated by American companies in recent decades, but to Washington's surprise, Chinese digital companies began to gain ground rapidly in recent years. Digital battle is not only intended to bring digital companies themselves to the top of the global market, but involves, as we have seen, the economy of the respective country as a whole.In China there is no Google, there is Baidu; there is no Amazon, there is AliExpress; there is no Whatsapp, there is WeChat; there is no PayPal, there is Alipay. In China there are no American digital platforms, there are Chinese digital platforms.Let's think that a child who is 12 years old today will probably use the internet for the rest of his life. In 30 years digital platforms will have so much data from this person, that they will be able to characterize it with enormous precision. Owning the characterizations of an entire population according to their consumer preferences, and having the means to deliver advertisements and products, would give the Chinese economy a significant advantage over the American economy.In huawei's particular case there are two aspects that make it fundamental to Chinese interests. First, there's the fact that, before the veto, it was one of the best-selling mobile phones in the U.S. and Europe. Smartphones are the most effective means of targeted advertising. They are the most personalized and accurate database that companies can get to have about their potential consumers. We browse the Internet, we chat,we access social networks, read, watch videos and movies, sell and buy, all through the mobile phone. And as time goes on, the more diverse its usefulness, and therefore more data it collects.Secondly, there are the famous 5G networks. While these play a key role in the race in which the U.S. and China compete to dominate in the field of technology (which has major economic implications), they are also the basis of the "Internet of Things," which would become a new type of technology related to the digital interconnection of everyday objects with the internet, which is believed to be mass-based in the coming years. If Huawei had the dominance over 5G, which before the U.S. veto was on track enough to do so, it would lead it to dominate also in the field of the Internet of Things, which would mean that it has a very large database on what each individual does, uses and consumes day by day. This, as we have already seen, would imply an advantage for China at the trade level.WeChat, on the other hand, in addition to being a messaging app, allows you to make payments through AliPay (belonging to the Chinese companies Alibaba and Ant Financial). In China the movement of capital through these platforms is very large. It would be expected that in a few years most payments and transfers around the world will be made through platforms like these. If so, the most widely used payment platforms would have a large database of transactions between people, which would imply that they know almost entirely the consumption data or activities of individuals. Moreover, cash is likely to go extinct over the years, giving way to digital money (in this sense, it is no coincidence that the Asian giant is working on its digital currency, called DCEP). In this context, the expansion of WeChat with its online means of payment could, in the not too distant future, become another important piece for the advance of the Asian giant in the economic and commercial field.But China doesn't have it easy. Digital platforms, smartphones, and 5G networks play a very relevant role in their business expansion, yet the economic and geopolitical dominance maintained by the U.S. in the rest of the world is not something that can be circumvented only by commercial moves. The U.S. has the power, among other things, to cut off the supply networks China needs to manufacture its technology, or to put complications into moving its goods, as well as to pressure other countries to join the vetoes, such as the UK, India, Australia, or New Zealand. The U.S., in addition to dominating economically and commercially, also dominates in the military and geopolitical. If China wants to take the hegemony away from the U.S., it will have to beat it on every terrain.It is important to note that on sites like Google or YouTube, the order in which pages or videos appear when we perform a search is not random, but follow the patterns set by the algorithms of those platforms. These are designed to provide us with an order in searches as they see fit. These algorithms will largely depend on which pages or videos will be most viewed, and which pages and videos will not.The same goes for social media with posts from the contacts we follow, which are selected by ML algorithms so that we can see them, or not, in a certain order on our wall. This way, an algorithm might decide which publication can go viral and which publication can't.ML algorithms allow you to classify millions of comments or videos according to their content. So, having aDigital platform with a large percentage of the society that uses it, and deciding how its algorithms work to select and sort searches and publications, means having control over which topics will be discussed in it and which topics will not. Social media control is a tool of relevance to influence public opinion.The traditional media, such as television, radio and the print newspaper, which are increasingly losing audiences, were gradually being replaced by digital platforms. It is mostly people over the age of 35 who continue to use traditional means to form their opinion. Younger generations use mostly digital platforms.TikTok, in addition to being a digital platform that works with the personal data of its users, it is also a social network where millions of young people opinion and listen to other opinions through short videos.Washington's executive order forcing the sale of TikTok came weeks after Korean pop fans campaigned for people to book attendance tickets to a Trump election event, and not to go. This inconvenienced the American president, who was expecting a filled stadium, and encountered many empty places. It was probably the drop that overflowed the glass, and forced to sell it.At this point it is important to clarify that social media, like traditional media, is, as we said, another tool for influencing public opinion, but they are not decisive. It would be a mistake to fall into the doctrine that with "new technologies" the ruling classes maintain absolute control of the population, and that therefore nothing can be done to change it. Social media is an important point to keep in mind for those of us who militate for the socialist revolution, but it must be made clear that they do not determine our opinion as a society, let alone our behavior.However, TikTok is increasingly away from the Chinese government. Currently, the social platform stores the data of its international users on servers located in the US and Singapore, and aims to open its first European data center in Ireland. Although it belongs to ByteDance, which is headquartered in Beijing, it is intended to be a reliable technology supplier independent of the Chinese authorities.In this new decade we're entering, the digital battle is just beginning. We'll probably keep hearing about espionage and seeing new vetoes for some time. Whoever has the most used digital platforms on their side will have much to gain.First, we need to wage a permanent fight against any attempt by companies to move forward with the handling of our personal data, its privatization and its commercialization. But our ultimate goal has to be to aspire to a society where we democratically discuss the meaning and how science and technology develop, including digital platforms and social media.Load-Date: September 14, 2020End of Document

IU student Dilyar Muradil shares experience growing up as an UyghurIndiana Daily Student: Indiana UniversitySeptember 17, 2020 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: ARTS; Pg. 1Length: 825 wordsBodySophomore Dilyar Muradil stands for a picture. Muradil was born in Kashgar, a city in Xinjiang, China.Courtesy PhotoIU sophomore Dilyar Muradil was born, further than many fellow students, in the autonomous region of Xinjiang in northwestern China.That province is the ancestral home of 11 million Uyghur people, a Muslim Turkic minority group facing oppression under Chinese rule. Muradil was born in Kashgar, a city in Xinjiang.The Uyghur culture has been systematically dismantled by the Chinese government because of a fear of separatists. At least a million Uyghur people have been incarcerated in camps by the Chinese government that were kept secret until satellite images revealed them. Laws are passed to restrict religious freedoms, surveil Uyghurs and more.Victims of a crisis happening millions of miles away in China can be found studying in the stacks of Herman B Wells Library.Muradil, 19, said he is one of three Uyghur students he knows that are currently studying at IU.Just like any other IU student, Muradil studies for class and hangs out with his friends. But he said in the back of his mind he's always thinking about his relatives and the Uyghur people going through such difficult things .Muradil lived in Kashgar with all his relatives until he was about 5 years old. Then, his family moved to Japan for seven or eight years. Muradil's family would always take a trip back to Kashgar at least once a year. They went back and forth until around 2014, when Muradil said the situation between the Uyghur people and the Chinese government worsened."We had to make a choice between staying in a different country or going back to our homeland," Muradil said.His family made the difficult decision to immigrate to the U.S. because they couldn't return to Kashgar and found it's difficult to live as foreigners in Japan over the long-term.Muradil came to IU after graduating from high school in Indiana."My dad thought it would be better if we go to a place where we can be, part of a community and actually have all kinds of freedom and not face any kind of religious difficulty," Muradil said.Muradil joined the Japanese Student Association at IU and found a passion for computer science . He often reads Japanese and English novels in his free time. Yet, the reality of the situation in Xinjiang continues to affect him.Muradil said he was never directly persecuted or discriminated against, but his life would have been completely different had he stayed in Xinjiang ."About the whole situation, it's really hard because part of me is just really upset that I had to go through things like this and it's really depressing," Dilyar said. "I'm just sad, simply."His family hasn't been able to contact their relatives for about two years, and those relatives try to avoid contacting them out of fear of getting in trouble with the Chinese government.Muradil's family received shocking news last year after a long period of no communication, which was delivered to them by a friend of his mother who got a message out from Beijing, where communications are less strictly controlled."About a year ago, my mom's older sister was actually in a camp as far as we understand," Muradil said. "That time she was so depressed she couldn't even go to work, and she also lost her parents."Muradil's family learned his grandparents died and his aunt was in one of China's re-education camps where Uyghurs are forced to learn how to be ideal Chinese citizens with no regard for their traditional culture. There are many reports that indicate these are also centers of forced labor, but the Chinese government continues to defend them in the face of global outrage."It was just a really hard time for our family," Muradil said, close to tears.The plight of his people back home haunts Muradil. But there are a lot of good things about growing up with Uyghur culture.Muradil's parents encouraged the use of the Uyghur language at home. Now, Muradil can speak Uyghur, Japanese and English, and he hopes to learn how to read and write in the Uyghur language in the future.His family often listens to Uyghur songs and enjoys a traditional style of Uyghur comedy. They make sure to celebrate their culture's holidays as well."One thing I really like about Uyghur culture is how close we are to our relatives and how we always try to connect to our people in general," Muradil said.That hospitality extends beyond the Uyghur community, which his friends can attest to."I met his family and they were so welcoming," Alghafri said. "They didn't make me feel like a stranger."Muradil said he is grateful people are giving more attention to Uyghur issues. He said he is pleasantly surprised to not have to explain who the Uyghur people are when he says he is oneof them."We can all work together to hopefully one day solve this problem," Muradil said.Like what you're reading?

Q&A: What does a deal between TikTok and Oracle mean?Associated Press InternationalSeptember 14, 2020 Monday 4:49 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 1158 wordsByline: ZEN SOO, AP Technology WriterDateline: HONG KONG BodyHONG KONG (AP) — ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns the popular video-sharing app TikTok, has chosen Oracle over Microsoft as a new American technology partner to help keep the app operating in the U.S. TikTok confirmed the decision Monday, echoing earlier statements from Oracle and the U.S. treasury secretary.ByteDance faces a Sept. 20 deadline to sell TikTok to an American company or risk being banned in the U.S. over national security concerns. But a lot remains unclear, including how the social media company would fit inside a business software company like Oracle and whether whatever arrangement the companies reach will be acceptable to the U.S. officials who will need to approve it.Here are some questions and answers about the deal.Q. WHAT IS TIKTOK?A. The app is a home for fun, goofy videos that are easy to make and to watch. That’s made it immensely popular, particularly with young people, and U.S. tech giants like Facebook and Snapchat see it as a competitive threat. TikTok says it has 100 million U.S. users and hundreds of millions globally. It has its own influencer culture, enabling people to make a living from posting videos on the service, and hosts ads from major U.S. companies.ByteDance Ltd., a Chinese company, launched TikTok in 2017, then bought Musical.ly, a video service popular with teens in the U.S. and Europe, and combined the two. A twin service, Douyin, is available for Chinese users.Q. WHAT CONCERNS U.S. OFFICIALS ABOUT THE APP?A. TikTok, like most other social networks, collects user data and moderates what’s posted. It grabs people’s locations and messages they send one another, for example, and tracks what people watch to discern what kinds of videos they like and how best to target ads to them.Similar concerns apply to American social networks, but Chinese ownership adds an extra wrinkle because the Chinese government could order companies to help it gather intelligence. In TikTok's case, that's a hypothetical threat, Samm Sacks, a researcher at Yale Law School’s Paul Tsai China Center has said.TikTok says it does not store U.S. user data in China and that it would not give user data to the government. But experts say if the Chinese government wants information, it will get it.There are also concerns about TikTok censoring videos critical of China, which TikTok denies, or pushing propaganda. Some critics say the company is violating children’s privacy laws.The U.S. has given parent company ByteDance a Sept. 20 deadline to complete a sale of TikTok’s U.S. assets to an American company, or risk being banned in the country.Q: IS ORACLE BUYING TIKTOK, AND WHAT ASSETS ARE INVOLVED?Oracle was among the pool of bidders, including Microsoft and Walmart, to buy TikTok’s American operations. Microsoft on Sunday said that ByteDance will not be selling TikTok’s U.S. operations to the company. Oracle, in confirming it was the winning bidder Monday, didn't refer to the deal as a sale or acquisition, instead saying it was chosen as TikTok's “trusted technology provider.”It’s unclear at this point what assets, if any, Oracle would actually acquire.TikTok has found popularity around the world thanks in part to its content-recommendation algorithm, which suggests videos to users based on their viewing history. But the Hong Kong newspaper South China Morning Post reported Sunday, citing an unnamed person, that ByteDance will not sell the algorithm. China has tightened its controls and requires companies to get permission to export such technologies.“The Chinese government has implied it may block export of TikTok’s AI systems, so that might complicate a direct sale,” said Tiffany Li, a visiting professor at the Boston University School of Law. “One of TikTok’s competitive advantages is its AI-backed video recommendation system.”Q: WHAT IS ORACLE'S RELATIONSHIP TO TIKTOK LIKELY TO BE?Oracle is known for providing enterprise software including cloud computing services. So it could provide cloud services such as storing TikTok’s data in the U.S., or computing services for the app.“Oracle could be a technology partner, but a sale or divestiture of the US operations for TikTok remains the focus,” Wedbush Securities analysts said in an analyst note.Q: WILL THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION GO FOR THE ARRANGEMENT?A: A TikTok-Oracle deal must be approved by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which vets deals that may have national security implications. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC on Monday that the group will review the proposal this week and later make a recommendation to President Donald Trump.CFIUS earlier greenlighted Chinese PC maker Lenovo's purchase of IBM’s computer server business in 2014, after concluding the deal did not pose significant security risks. It also cleared SoftBank’s acquisition of Sprint in 2013, but only after SoftBank agreed not to use Huawei Technologies and ZTE equipment in the U.S.If Oracle and TikTok can show they can safeguard user data in the U.S., CFIUS and the Trump administration might accept the arrangement.TikTok said in a Monday statement that its proposal aims to “resolve the Administration’s security concerns” and emphasized the importance of its app to the 100 million users it claims in the U.S.A Chinese Foreign Ministry official said Monday that it had no comment on Oracle, but described the situation as a “typical government-coerced transaction."Q: HOW MUCH DOES ORACLE'S CLOSENESS TO THE ADMINISTRATION MATTER?A: Trump hasn't said if he preferred Oracle or Microsoft but in August described Oracle as “a great company” that could handle the sale.Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison is unusual among tech executives for his public support of President Donald Trump.“Oracle’s connections with the Trump administration are interesting. It’s possible they may be able to negotiate an outcome that allows TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. without a full sale, with ByteDance still retaining something,” said Boston University's Li.Mnuchin said Monday that “we have a lot of confidence in both Microsoft and Oracle,” but noted that ByteDance has chosen Oracle.Q: WHAT MIGHT THIS DEAL MEAN FOR USERS?If it is finalized and approved by CFIUS, TikTok would be allowed to continue operating in the U.S.“Trump’s executive order that effectively banned TikTok’s U.S. business would likely no longer apply, as TikTok would no longer be owned by Bytedance,” said Li.“Executive orders can be revoked or modified at any time,” she said.However, Oracle's plans remain unclear.“I doubt we’ll see the creativity and consumer-friendliness that we might expect with a different owner,” Li said.Paul Haswell, partner at law firm Pinsent Masons, expects Oracle to strive to keep TikTok's users.“If the app changes or the user experience changes then the users might abandon the platform which completely undermines the value of TikTok and Oracle’s acquisition,” he said.Load-Date: September 14, 2020End of Document

But experts say if the Chinese government wants information, it will get it.There are also concerns about TikTok censoring videos critical of China, which TikTok denies, or pushing propaganda. Some critics say the company is violating children’s privacy laws.The U.S. has given parent company ByteDance a Sept. 20 deadline to complete a sale of TikTok’s U.S. assets to an American company, or risk being banned in the country.Q: IS ORACLE BUYING TIKTOK, AND WHAT ASSETS ARE INVOLVED?Oracle was among the pool of bidders, including Microsoft and Walmart, to buy TikTok’s American operations. Microsoft on Sunday said that ByteDance will not be selling TikTok’s U.S. operations to the company. Oracle, in confirming it was the winning bidder Monday, didn't refer to the deal as a sale or acquisition, instead saying it was chosen as TikTok's “trusted technology provider.”It’s unclear at this point what assets, if any, Oracle would actually acquire.TikTok has found popularity around the world thanks in part to its content-recommendation algorithm, which suggests videos to users based on their viewing history. But the Hong Kong newspaper South China Morning Post reported Sunday, citing an unnamed person, that ByteDance will not sell the algorithm. China has tightened its controls and requires companies to get permission to export such technologies.“The Chinese government has implied it may block export of TikTok’s AI systems, so that might complicate a direct sale,” said Tiffany Li, a visiting professor at the Boston University School of Law. “One of TikTok’s competitive advantages is its AI-backed video recommendation system.”Q: WHAT IS ORACLE'S RELATIONSHIP TO TIKTOK LIKELY TO BE?Oracle is known for providing enterprise software including cloud computing services. So it could provide cloud services such as storing TikTok’s data in the U.S., or computing services for the app.“Oracle could be a technology partner, but a sale or divestiture of the US operations for TikTok remains the focus,” Wedbush Securities analysts said in an analyst note.Q: WILL THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION GO FOR THE ARRANGEMENT?A: A TikTok-Oracle deal must be approved by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which vets deals that may have national security implications. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC on Monday that the group will review the proposal this week and later make a recommendation to President Donald Trump.CFIUS earlier greenlighted Chinese PC maker Lenovo's purchase of IBM’s computer server business in 2014, after concluding the deal did not pose significant security risks. It also cleared SoftBank’s acquisition of Sprint in 2013, but only after SoftBank agreed not to use Huawei Technologies and ZTE equipment in the U.S.If Oracle and TikTok can show they can safeguard user data in the U.S., CFIUS and the Trump administration might accept the arrangement.TikTok said in a Monday statement that its proposal aims to “resolve the Administration’s security concerns” and emphasized the importance of its app to the 100 million users it claims in the U.S.A Chinese Foreign Ministry official said Monday that it had no comment on Oracle, but described the situation as a “typical government-coerced transaction."Q: HOW MUCH DOES ORACLE'S CLOSENESS TO THE ADMINISTRATION MATTER?A: Trump hasn't said if he preferred Oracle or Microsoft but in August described Oracle as “a great company” that could handle the sale.Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison is unusual among tech executives for his public support of President Donald Trump.“Oracle’s connections with the Trump administration are interesting. It’s possible they may be able to negotiate an outcome that allows TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. without a full sale, with ByteDance still retaining something,” said Boston University's Li.Mnuchin said Monday that “we have a lot of confidence in both Microsoft and Oracle,” but noted that ByteDance has chosen Oracle.Q: WHAT MIGHT THIS DEAL MEAN FOR USERS?If it is finalized and approved by CFIUS, TikTok would be allowed to continue operating in the U.S.“Trump’s executive order that effectively banned TikTok’s U.S. business would likely no longer apply, as TikTok would no longer be owned by Bytedance,” said Li.“Executive orders can be revoked or modified at any time,” she said.However, Oracle's plans remain unclear.“I doubt we’ll see the creativity and consumer-friendliness that we might expect with a different owner,” Li said.Paul Haswell, partner at law firm Pinsent Masons, expects Oracle to strive to keep TikTok's users.“If the app changes or the user experience changes then the users might abandon the platform which completely undermines the value of TikTok and Oracle’s acquisition,” he said.Load-Date: September 14, 2020End of Document

This explains the support of international institutions for this campaign backed by dark interests joined by Brazilian, exploitative and anti-patriotic associations, with the aim of harming the government and Brazil itself," he added.Strong crossoverBut it was the second speech of the day that definitively marked the climate of dominant political tension this year as a pandemic - forcing all leaders to record a message from their countries - and a global economic crisis."The Chinese Government and the World Health Organization (WHO), which is virtually controlled by China, falsely stated that there was no evidence of human transmission; they then falsely said that people without symptoms would not spread the disease. The United Nations must hold China accountable for its actions," Trump said, according to the AFP news agency.In addition, the representative, who presented himself as the "peacemaker" of the world because of the recent diplomatic relations normalization agreements he achieved between Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain in the Middle East and the peace negotiations in Afghanistan, made a new defense of nationalism."For decades, the same tired voices proposed the same failed solutions, pursuing global ambitions at the expense of their own people, but only when you take care of your own citizens can you find a real basis for cooperation," he said.When it was his turn, Chinese President Xi Jinping did everything to get against Trump, though he never named him."You should not be allowed to do what you want and act like a hegemon, a bully, or the head of the world; no one should be subdued by those who raise their fists, there should be no practices of exceptionalism or double standards, nor should international politics be distorted or used as a pretext to delegitimate the rights and interests of other countries," said Xi, quoted by Chinese news agency Xinhua.He also replied to UN Secretary-General António Guterres, who had opened the week of speeches with a strong warning: "avoid a new cold war."Guterres had stated that it is "moving in a very dangerous direction":"Our world cannot afford a future in which the two largest economies create a great rift that divides the planet, each with its own trade and financial rules and its own Internet and intelligence capabilitiesartificial," he warned.Xi argued that he has "no intention of fighting a cold war or a hot one with any country" and presented himself as an advocate of multilateralism and dialogue.With that same conciliatory tone, Russia's President Vladimir Putin stressed that his country was the first in the world to pass a coronavirus vaccine - even though it is still in the final stage of development - and offered free doses to the UN to immunize its employees.This year, Putin chose to avoid controversies and sensitive issues, and only tangentially referred to one of America's most recent unilateral decisions that caused the most unrest at the UN and even among its allies: the revival of international sanctions suspended by the 2015 multilateral nuclear deal, which Trump abandoned.Putin warned in his speech of the long-term economic effects of the current crisis and defended the need for the entire international community to work together to drive growth, emphasizing the importance of removing barriers, restrictions and, above all, "illegitimate sanctions" in international trade.Clearer and more forceful was the President of France, Emmanuel Macron."France, with its German and British allies, will maintain its demand for full and full implementation of the 2015 Vienna agreement," the representative said to remind Iran that they will not accept progress in its nuclear development, but also sent a message to Trump"We will not, however, compromise on the activation of a mechanism that the United States is not in a position to activate," he added, recalling that Washington unilaterally abandoned the agreement it now invokes.Iran also joined the discussion today. "We are not an element of negotiation in the US election or in his domestic policy," President Hasan Rohani complained in a recorded speech and warned of next November's US presidential election: "Any U.S. government after the election will have no choice but to give in to the resilience of the Iranian nation."NEWSLETTER 9AM From Monday to Friday, the selection of our editors of the most relevant information for each day.

Kayleigh McEnany is Interviewed about the Supreme Court, TikTok, and Stimulus; Jobs in America; Interview with Rep. Jim Banks (R-IN); Political Fight over the Supreme CourtMORNINGS WITH MARIA MORNINGS WITH MARIA 7:00 AM ESTSeptember 21, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; FinancialLength: 6961 wordsByline: Maria Bartiromo, Andrew Napolitano, Dagen McDowellGuests: Kayleigh McEnany, Michael Rosenbaum, James Freeman, Lindsey Piegza, Kathryn Rooney Vera, Heppenstall, Jim BanksBodyMARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Welcome back. Good Monday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Monday, September 21st.Your top stories this morning, 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.We have a global selloff underway this morning. Futures sharply lower to start the week as investors on edge over political uncertainty, coronavirus and charges of fraud in the banking sector.The Dow Industrials down 519 points, bank stocks sharply lower after a new report reveals several major banks were involved in moving more than $2 trillion worth of suspicious funds. The markets are down across the board after the Dow, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 posted their third straight week of losses in a row, their longest losing streak of the year.Questions over the TikTok deal meanwhile, President Trump approving the agreement in concept but the national security threat remains a concern. What Oracle is telling me this morning, coming up straight ahead.The future of the Supreme Court hangs in the balance, the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg sparking a fierce political debate. A closer look this morning at that, plus her famous friendship with Justice Antonin Scalia.White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany is here.And Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia will join me at 8:00 a.m. Eastern.MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live right now.Global markets this morning are also selling off, take a look at European indices this morning with the FT 100 down 193 points. The CAC 40 down 155. And the DAX index in Germany lower by 426 points. That is about 3.25 percent. Concerns are growing that the U.K. could go into a second lockdown as coronavirus cases rise. People in the U.K. who violate self-isolation rules will face fines of up to $13,000.In Asia overnight, declines across the board there as well. Take a look. The Hong Kong market was the hardest hit, down 2 percent on the Hang Seng index. HSBC shares are down to a 25-year-low this morning after a report details lapses in suspicious activity reports. We'll have more on that coming up. Japan is closed for a holiday overnight.Meanwhile, some of the top stories that we're watching this morning.A Supreme Court showdown. President Trump is expected to announce his pick to fill the seat of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg this week as his Democratic Joe Biden rival calls on Republican senators to hold off a vote until after the election.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: If Donald Trump wins the election, then the Senate should move on his selection and weigh the nominee he chooses fairly.If I win this election, President Trump's nominee should be withdrawn. As the new president, I should be the one who nominates Justice Ginsburg's successor.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi even threatening impeachment to stop the process.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: We have our options. We have arrows in our quiver that I'm not about to discuss right now but the fact is, we have a big challenge in our country.This president has threatened to not even accept the result of the election with statements that he and his henchmen have made.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The White House responded saying this, "The Speaker threatened to impeach the president again for simply fulfilling his constitutional obligation. Numerous Democrats are threatening to pack the court and say things like nothing is off the table. These are bizarre and dangerous power grabs by Democrats who will stop at nothing to erode the constitution to enact their radical agenda."Judges Amy Coney Barrett and Barbara Lagoa are believed to be at the top of President Trump's list to replace the Justice's seat.President Trump is giving his blessing to an agreement that would give Walmart and a Oracle a stake in TikTok creating a new U.S.-based company called TikTok Global.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I have given the deal my blessing. If they get it done, that's great. If they don't, that's ok too. I approved the deal in concept, yes.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The deal which is still pending final approval is worth $60 billion and would have Oracle become responsible for hosting all U.S. user data. Inside Oracle sources tell me while ByteDance owns 80 percent now, after the transaction that number drops to 53 percent and then after a planned IPO the Chinese ownership is expected to drop in the 30 percent range.In response to the deal, the Commerce Department has delayed its ban on new downloads of the app for one week. Four out of five people on the board are expected to be American.The U.S. on the verge of surpassing 200,000 coronavirus deaths, California reporting more than 4,000 new cases for the second straight day.In Arizona, new cases are slowing after a two-day spike last week, this as health experts warn the nation could experience at least one more cycle of the deadly virus this fall or winter.A woman accused of sending the poison ricin to President Trump was arrested at the New York/Canada border. The letter appearing to originate from Canada was intercepted earlier this week before reaching the White House. CPB officers say the woman was arrested near Buffalo and is expected to face federal charges. Her name has not been released.Nikola stock is plunging this morning in the premarket after it was reported last night that its founder, Trevor Milton, will step down amid reports that the company is being investigated by U.S. regulators. In a tweet Milton details his decision to step aside and vows to fight the allegations. He will be replaced by a board member Stephen Girsky who is taking the title of chairman of Nikola.Joining the conversation all morning this morning: Dagen McDowell and James Freeman. It is great to see you guys this morning.JAMES FREEMAN, "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL": You too. Great to be here.BARTIROMO: And it is time for "The Word on Wall Street".Joining me right now is Bulltick Capital Markets head of capital research, Kathryn Rooney Vera, Stifel chief economist Lindsey Piegza, and Penn Mutual Management chief investment officer Mark Heppenstall.Great to see you guys. Thank you so much for being here today. Let's talk about this global market sell off under way.Futures indicating a sharp decline at the start of trading. We've got a lot of worries here. First of all, a major investigation into the major banks over how they're conducting business and whether or not they did business with sanctioned companies, sanctioned individuals. You've got political battles over the Supreme Court, and of course, the coronavirus stimulus stalemate also among the issues out there.Lindsey, how do you see things? What do you attribute to this selling?LINDSEY PIEGZA, CHIEF ECONOMIST, STIFEL: I think right now it's reflecting the ongoing uncertainty THAT we see BOTH from an economic and political standpoint. We already had a very contentious debate going on in Washington over the next round of stimulus bill. Now you layer on a Supreme Court vacancy and this is likely to only exacerbate the political divide and the very visceral tone that we see from our officials in Washington.So this may make it increasingly less likely that we see a near term stimulus package actually come to fruition, something that the market has already been pricing in.BARTIROMO: So would you step in here and buy or do you think that the backdrop in terms of the economy, Lindsey, is going to come back?PIEGZA: I think right now the economy is seeing a bit of an up-swing as a result of coming off of those extremely low levels in the second quarter. But as we look out to the end of the year, if we do in fact see that reemergence of the virus and we do see a surge in cases and deaths and we don't see a stimulus package come into fruition to help businesses and help individuals, I think we could be in the position where we do see the economy slow back to a very anemic level or potentially fall back into negative territory by the end of the year.So I think it's a very difficult position to be in right now with the risks at a higher point rather than beginning to abate.BARTIROMO: One step closer to a deal for TikTok, meanwhile. Under the current plan, ByteDance will lower its 80 percent stake to 53 percent into the new TikTok Global. Oracle and Walmart will have a stake as well as American investors, which are contributing 40 percent ownership from American investors. They already own 40 percent of this company.Oracle sources are telling me that Oracle will hold all U.S. user data, out of the grasp of the Chinese Communist Party. Once the deal is complete TikTok Global will be listed on the American stock exchange within the year.And Kathryn my sources say that that ownership by the Chinese will go down even further after an IPO into the 30 percent range. What's your take on this? Do you think this goes through? Will this fly?KATHRYN ROONEY VERA, HEAD OF GLOBAL RESEARCH, BULLTICK CAPITAL MARKETS; : I think it's -- in essence, it's a good deal, Maria. And if in fact ByteDance's ownership does collapse from 80 to sub 50, that would be probably the best news out of all of this.This is great for Oracle. Oracle from a cloud-computing standpoint, Maria has trailed Amazon, Microsoft and Google substantially so it's very good for them. It's also good for Walmart which gets to tap, you know, this massive amount of young people, 100 million users of TikTok. So it's good for both U.S. companies.My concerns of course, would lie specifically with the ongoing interactions which would have to occur in algorithmic operations between, you know, the U.S. component and the Chinese component, which doesn't -- can't avoid pressure, ongoing pressure from the Chinese government.So I think the national security risk at least in the meantime remains. But in a sense, I think Maria, it's generally a good deal.BARTIROMO: Finally, shaking up the S&P 500, you've got Etsy, Teradyne and Catalent joining the broad market index today. H&R Block, Coty and Kohl's will come out of the index. Mark, this usually moves the index and the stocks involved because of course, those money managers that mimic the S&P 500 will now be buying these additional stocks. Your view.MARK HEPPENSTALL, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, PENN MUTUAL ASSET MANAGEMENT: Well, I do think, you know, the news there is obviously going to impact those stocks in particular but I think, you know, you referencing the Nikola news is significant today because clearly there's been a lot of wealth created with the some of these tech high fliers. So it makes sense that this news has a negative impact on some of those stocks. I think it could be a more significant story for today's headlines.BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Thank you so much, everybody. Kathryn Rooney Vera, Lindsey Piegza and Mark Heppenstall, great to talk with you this morning on "The Word on Wall Street".PIEGZA: Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: Coming up next, Indiana Congressman Jim Banks is here on the threat from China amid the TikTok deal while White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany will join me on President Trump's possible pick for the Supreme Court.And then in the 8:00 a.m. hour, don't miss Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia. He'll be here live, giving us an inside look at his father, Justice Antonin Scalia's famous friendship with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Worries persist over TikTok's partnership with Oracle and Walmart because the current ownership has ByteDance owning 80 percent of TikTok. But after the transaction is complete, China's ByteDance's 80 percent stake goes down to 53 percent. Then after a planned IPO, the ownership will drop to around 30 percent.Once again, the concern revolves around the Chinese Communist Party getting access to American user data. I spoke with insiders at Oracle yesterday who told me at no time will the data be insecure because it will run on Oracle's autonomous second generation cloud technology.Oracle points out that 40 percent of the company is owned by American investors already. They point out that four out of the five board members will be American and the fifth will be Japanese. Japan's Masasan (ph) will own 11 percent.I spoke with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about it yesterday on "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES". Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Can you explain how this is not a national security risk, Secretary? Because ByteDance, the Chinese company, still is going to own 80 percent of this TikTok Global and we know that if the Chinese company -- the Chinese Communist Party wants that data of American citizens, they're going to get it, given the civil military fusion laws in China.So how is this not a risk?MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Maria, you've nailed the right point with respect to WeChat and TikTok and all other Chinese telecommunications companies. We've been working on Huawei for years now.The single rule is this. We don't want American data in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party for the exact reasons you describes. It will end up in the hands of their MSS, their security apparatus, their military, their civil military fusion program. So that's the rule President Trump laid down.As for the transaction around TikTok, I've seen the outlines of it. The president now has said he is conditionally ok with what they're doing. This deal if approved in the end, if openly approved, will ensure that no American's data has any access to anyone in China that has any capacity to move this to a place we don't want it.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, Oracle sees other uses for TikTok as well, not just as a social media app but also as a way to revolutionize American education.My source says that we're likely to see TikTok videos teaching history, for example. Also TikTok technology being used for police body cameras.Joining me right now is Indiana Congressman and House Armed Services Committee member Jim Banks.Congressman, it's great to have you this morning. Thank you so much for joining us.REP. JIM BANKS (R-IN): Great to be with you.BARTIROMO: And I know you've got a new bill countering -- introduced that counters Chinese propaganda. I'm going to get to that in a moment.But you've studied China a lot, putting this bill together. Your reaction to what we're hearing from Oracle and Walmart in terms of this deal with TikTok?BANKS: Maria, this is a big step forward and every American owes a debt of gratitude to our president for being the first president certainly in my lifetime to be tough on China.When we talk about the president being tough on China, this is what we're talking about. He forced this deal to happen for TikTok to give up control of the data of users of 100 million users in the United States of America and to secure it with a great American company like Oracle.That never would have happened under previous presidents and dare I say that if Joe Biden were the president, he would never have the guts to take on China in the way that President Trump has to force this deal to happen.This isn't a silver bullet, though. China still controls the algorithms within TikTok and that's still concerning to me. I hope there's a solution to that down the road but I'll sleep a lot better at night knowing that Oracle and Walmart and American companies are securing the data of users of Americans who download TikTok on their devices.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, I'll point out that Oracle has not done business with the Chinese Communist Party, you know, as opposed to Microsoft and Google who have A.I. labs and big business operations in China. The A.I. lab of Google is right there in Beijing.So they create code in China and then it goes to Oracle and they test the code, looking for security vulnerabilities. My sources at Oracle say there is absolutely no way a back door back to the CCP will be put in there without Oracle knowing it. But can you be sure, knowing that ByteDance is going to own 30 percent of this thing?BANKS: Yes, the vulnerabilities that exist are something that we should study, we should learn more about. And as a member of Congress, I hope that we will take a strong look at the deal that's emerging and look at how we might secure protections for those vulnerabilities.But at the end of the day, Maria, this is a big step forward. It wouldn't have happened without President Trump's leadership and I appreciate that greatly.BARTIROMO: I know, I agree with that.You recently introduced the Countering Chinese Propaganda Act. Tell me about that because more often than not, what I've seen in these state-run media companies are exactly that, propaganda. You had the "Global Times" just a couple of months ago come out and threaten us that they were going to stop sending prescription drugs that we need so badly in the United States if President Trump keeps poking Xi Jinping about tariffs.Then you had another news service do the same thing just weeks ago. Is that the kind of propaganda you're referring to?BANKS: Yes, Maria, the United Front is the arm of the Chinese Communist Party that is all around us. We might not see it but it's everywhere we look, especially in a place like Washington, D.C. It's the arm of the CCP that funds their efforts, their propaganda and espionage efforts on college campuses through efforts like Confucius institutes and also what funds their propaganda efforts -- I often talk about how I get the China daily newspaper on my doorstep on Capitol Hill every day. I ask and I scream at times, where does this come from and nobody can tell me where.Well, it comes because of the propaganda efforts by the Chinese Communist Party's United Front. So what my bill would do is what we haven't done yet and what we need to do is to sanction this shadowy effort that the CCP has all around us and put a stop to it.And finally, we have an administration who has taken us seriously as well. I don't have any -- I'm not naive, Maria. I know Nancy Pelosi is not going to allow my bill to sanction the United Front, the arm of the CCP to pass in the congress because at this point the Democrats are on the side of the pro-China side of the equation. Republicans are on the tough on China side of the equation.But I introduced this bill because it's the right thing to do. But I also introduced it to show the American people that Republicans are serious about addressing the China threat and Democrats are fully willing to turn a blind eye still at this point today.BARTIROMO: Well, why is that? I mean, Kevin McCarthy has come on this program a number of times saying what does China have on the Democrats. You know, Nancy Pelosi won't allow any of her members to be part of the GOP leaders China task force. What is it? Why won't they denounce China's Communist Party's behavior?BANKS: Yes. By the way, Kevin McCarthy is a hero on this subject because he set up this China task force that I'm proud to serve on. But at the end of the day, the only thing I can come up with, Maria, is that Nancy Pelosi doesn't want any member of her party to be on the same side as President Trump who has been the toughest president that we've ever had in addressing the China threat.It comes down to -- sadly, I believe it comes down to the politics of the matter. The American people aren't blind to that. They know that one party is tackling the biggest threat that we face and the other party is turning a blind eye.BARTIROMO: Congressman, thank you very much. Congressman Jim Banks. Stay with us. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.A nation mourning the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. She died Friday after a long battle with cancer. She was 87. The loss of one of the court's most liberal voices setting up a fierce political battle in Washington over her replacement.Joining me right now is Fox News senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano. Judge, great to have you this morning. How do you see it?JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Good morning.Well, I mean, I see it as Tip O'Neill's comment that all politics is local and this is an exception to it. I think this is the national issue and it will animate the races in the Senate. And there are six Republican senators who are right now losing to their Democratic opponents in their races for reelection and they'll make decisions as to how they vote on the president's nominee whom we can expect to learn the identity of in a couple of days on the bass of what helps them politically.The president is determined to offer this nominee and Senator McConnell is determined to have a vote on it but they're not going to have a vote on it if they don't have 50 votes to support the person.So a lot of it is politics. A lot of it will depend upon how the public perceives this. Does the public want to wait until January where a reelected Donald Trump or a newly-inaugurated Joe Biden gets to make this pick. Or does the public want the president to pounce on this opportunity that he now has to mold the Supreme Court in the image and likeness that he has told the American public he plans to do.BARTIROMO: Well, you know, there's so many levers here. I mean, if you don't have a ninth judge, what if the election is contested and you only have four and four? And then in terms of policy, here's what Cowen and Company writes this morning, "The politics of the Supreme Court vacancy are broadly negative for housing and for financials as it makes it difficult for us to see how Congress passes a phase four stimulus before the inauguration in January.So there's just replacing Judge Ginsburg but then there's also the vacancy that opens up all these questions about actual policy and what gets done if you have four and four in the Supreme Court, Judge.NAPOLITANO: Well, if you have four and four and just because you have eight doesn't mean it would be a four to four tie but if you have four to four, that upholds the decision of the court below. It's a little empty and a little hollow when that happens but that's the law of the land. A tie affirms the decision being appealed.So if there were a dispute, for example, over the votes in Colorado as to whether or not they were properly counted and whether the electoral votes should go to Trump or Biden and a federal district judge ruled and the Tenth Circuit, which is the federal appeals court that oversees federal district judges in Colorado ruled, and then it were appealed to the Supreme Court and it were to a four to four tie, the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit would be upheld.Sometimes these very difficult decisions do not come down to politics. Justice Scalia many, many times was on the same side as Justice Ginsburg. On the ideological issues, obviously they were not.But the absence of a ninth justice is a legitimate argument for the president and Senator McConnell to make as they battle the Democrats on this issue.BARTIROMO: Well, that's what I'm saying, Dagen. I mean, there's a real business fallout here. Please jump in, Dagen.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Indeed. And judge, what about Nancy Pelosi's threat, you know, would not rule out an impeachment of the president to stop this, any Supreme Court nomination from moving forward. Really truly legally, what power does Pelosi have or even Chuck Schumer in the Senate to stop this?NAPOLITANO: Well, Chuck Schumer needs to pry loose four Republicans. He succeed in doing so with two already -- Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski. If only 49 Republicans want to go forward with this and 51 Democrats and Republicans don't, then it's not going to happen.But Mrs. Pelosi has zero -- zero say in this. The idea that there is an impeachable offense out there that they haven't already scrutinized and even if there were and even if the House on impeachment, Donald Trump is still the president during the impeachment. This does not prevent him from nominating a justice to the Supreme Court and it certainly doesn't prevent the Senate from scrutinizing and rejecting or affirming that nominee.So I'm not sure where she's going, other than a weekend temper tantrum.MCDOWELL: Yes, I don't think she knows where she's going, quite frankly, but that's a story for another day. And you're not a doctor.BARTIROMO: Right.NAPOLITANO: No.BARTIROMO: Judge, thank you. Really --MCDOWELL: God love you, Dagen.BARTIROMO: Really important point.NAPOLITANO: You're welcome.BARTIROMO: Judge Andrew Napolitano.Thank you, judge. Have a good day.We'll be right back. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Monday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Monday, September 21st. A look at markets this morning at 7:33 a.m. on the East Coast.We've got a sea of red underway this morning. Investors are selling and we are looking at a selloff of better than 500 points right out of the gate.Political uncertainty. Coronavirus case worries weighing on investor sentiment. As you see, the Dow futures are down 540 points, the Nasdaq down 183, and the S&P down 56.This after the Dow, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 posted their third weekly decline in a row last week. As you see, it was a fractional loss on the week, but, nonetheless, a third losing week.In Europe, sharp declines there as well. Bank stocks are weighing on the broader markets there. A new report alleges several global banks defied money laundering crackdowns and moved trillions of dollars in illicit funds for criminal networks and questionable characters. All the banks, as you can see, are down sharply, and that is part of the selloff this morning across the world. The FT 100 down 200 points, the CAC quarante down 164, and the DAX index lower by 442.Check Asian markets overnight. Hong Kong was the worst performer. As you see, down better than 2 percent on the Hang Seng index. Japan was closed for a holiday.President Trump is promising a female replacement for late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. A few names already appearing as favorites for the nomination. On President Trump's list, Judges Amy Coney Barrett, Barbara Lagoa and Allison Jones Rushing among the top contenders.Joining me right now is White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany.And, Kayleigh, it is great to see you this morning. Thank you so much for joining me once again.KAYLEIGH MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Good to join you.BARTIROMO: Your reaction to the president's work on this. When do you expect we will have a name which, of course, will -- will get a vote in the Senate?MCENANY: Yes, you'll hear from the president who his nominee is this week, certainly. And there's precedence for this. Unlike the last time around when Justice Scalia passed, last time you had Republicans who were in the Senate, you had a Democrat president. Now we have a -- an emboldened Republican majority, elected in 2014, expanded the majority going to 2018. So you have unified government in that sense between the Senate and the president.So the president is doing what is his constitutional obligation, and you'll hear that name shortly.BARTIROMO: But, Kayleigh, do you think that there's time? I mean you're talking about, what, 44 days until Election Day. Will that person get the time to get the vetting, to get into a -- into the Senate for a vote and perhaps get conclusion on this before the election? What's your time?MCENANY: We do -- yes, do think that there is time. We honor Justice Ginsburg's legacy today and going forward. But she was confirmed in 42 days. There are justice that have been confirmed in shorter time than that. So there is time to do this, but it means putting forward that name. It will be a highly qualified woman. The president's confirmed that it will be a woman. And we do believe with 53 votes in the Senate that we can get this through and that Republican senators will unite behind what will be a very qualified nominee.BARTIROMO: You know -- you know that Nancy Pelosi and the president's critics are insane over this. They do not want him to name another Supreme Court justice, which would be his third. An incredibly consequential presidential administration this is.Let me run a sound bite of Nancy Pelosi with George Stephanopoulos this weekend, Kayleigh. Not only did she say she would actually consider looking for another impeachment trial if this goes forward, but she also had a very strange moment.Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): Ten states, as I said on Friday, started their early voting the day that we lost Ruth Bader Ginsburg.GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS: But -- but to be clear, you're not taking any arrows out of your quiver, you're not ruling anything out?PELOSI: Good morning. Sunday morning. The -- we have a responsibility. We take an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. We have a responsibility to meet the needs of the American people.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Did you -- did you catch that in the middle of it, she said Sunday morning, good morning. I -- I don't know -- I'm -- I'm not sure what was just going on there, Kayleigh.MCENANY: Yes, that was -- that was a very odd exchange.And Nancy Pelosi, boy is she disgraceful by even entertaining the idea of impeachment, impeaching the president for doing his constitutional duty and obligation.The two worst things that happened to Democrats were Justice Kavanaugh and impeachment. And now they want to potentially combine the two. Really bad idea from Nancy Pelosi. Unsurprising, though, to hear that kind of partisan, bizarre, disgraceful, gamesmanship from the speaker.BARTIROMO: So the president has talked about him probably naming a woman. He said it's going to be a woman this weekend. What other qualifications is he looking for? How specific in terms of the constitutionality is he wanting to name someone? Is he looking for a true constitutionalist is what I'm trying to say, Kayleigh?MCENANY: Yes, that's absolutely what he's looking for. I've spoken to him about his a few times. He wants a constitutionalist, a textualist (ph), an originalist, someone who will put fidelity to the constitution as a top priority, who will interpret the statutes and their plain meaning, the plain meaning of the words there, not try to reinvent the will of Congress or the words of our Constitution and our founding fathers. So he wants someone in the ilk of Justice Thomas and Justice Alito and the other great justices that President Trump has appointed, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh.BARTIROMO: Kayleigh, there are questions over the TikTok deal. I know the president approved this agreement in concept. But national security threat remains a concern. This is what keeps coming up in terms of the data potentially going to the CCP. This is the first president that has really poked back on China and its bad behavior of the communist party.You know, I'm not sure what you think of this deal, but you're still having a Chinese company, ByteDance, owning at least 30 percent of this TikTok global after the transaction. Doesn't that make it vulnerable for the CCP to order data being sent to them?MCENANY: So I won't get ahead of the president in formally announcing that deal. He said we have the workings of a deal. But rest assured, Maria, that this president is putting the safety of the American people first. The Chinese Communist Party having access to the data of millions of Americans is not a tenable situation. But I'll leave it to him to announce exactly what that deal looks like.BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, we're still deadlocked over a new relief package. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle deadlocked over a package. But the president indicated last week that he could support a bigger spending pledge.This also, you know, opens the question of the next Supreme Court justice because if you're talking about four on one side, four on the other side, Kayleigh, what if we have a contested election? What about, you know, a CARES two package? We're not going to get any decisions here, anything that goes up to the Supreme Court, if we don't have a ninth judge in there. Where are we on a spending package, Kayleigh?MCENANY: Yes, so on the spending package, unfortunately, we're where we were last week, which is the speaker playing games on the backs of the American people. She's been fundamentally unserious this entire time. She's put forward an unserious proposal and, you know, she asked for a certain amount for school funding. We exceeded that. And then she rejected the number that exceed her own number. It's just bizarre the way she's been trying to go about this. That's why the president took action on evictions and unemployment insurance.But Nancy Pelosi needs to come to the table. As you noted, the president said he's willing to go up in his number. But Nancy Pelosi's not willing to come to the middle or to really even seriously come to the negotiating table.BARTIROMO: Well, by the way, congratulations to President Trump for being nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize thanks to his incredible work overseeing new Middle Eastern promise with regard to Israel and normalized relations there.Nancy Pelosi also, last week, called it a distraction, Kayleigh. She said, I'm glad the president has a distraction when, in fact, you've got, for the first time in decades, the United Arab Emirates, now Bahrain, recognizing Israel and do you expect Oman and Kuwait to be behind and also poised to do the same?MCENANY: You know, the president had said there's a number of other countries that he thinks will come on -- come to this Middle East peace agreement. So we'll see which countries those are.But what I will say is this. I mean calling it a distraction, Middle East peace, I mean that's just absolute crazy talk when this is Middle East peace, normalization of relationships, the first time in 26 years this has happened and in the span of 29 days, the president does not just two peace deals, but a third one, economic normalization for Serbia and Kosovo. Those two Nobel Peace Prize nominations were well deserved. And we'll see which other countries come into the fold and go the way of peace. And it's all under the leadership of President Trump.BARTIROMO: All right. Pretty incredible, Kayleigh, thanks very much for joining me this morning. We will keep watching all of the developments.Kayleigh McEnany -- thank you, Kayleigh -- at the White House this morning.MCENANY: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Coming up, the next jobs in America. The careers set to grow over the next decade. You cannot miss this.Then, whatever it takes. Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson going to the extreme to make sure he wasn't late for work.You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.The next big jobs in America constantly evolving as the country reopens. The Bureau of Labor Statistics released a list of the fastest growing American jobs between 2019 and 2020. The list made up of mainly healthcare, technology and green energy related jobs.Joining me right now is Arena Founder, Chairman and CEO, Michael Rosenbaum.Michael, it's good to have you this morning.Tell us about the top jobs on this list and where you see them growing in the last 10 years.MICHAEL ROSENBAUM, FOUNDER, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, ARENA: Thanks for having me, Maria.This list, interestingly, is actually just percentages growth. So in some of the clean tech jobs, for example, there aren't actually that many jobs. But when you look at the broader trends, what we're interested in is absolute numbers. So, for example, healthcare, which is a lot of the jobs on this list, you know, the same report said that healthcare itself was going to grow by something like 2.4 million jobs between now and 2029. And that actually understates certain job segments like areas where there may not be licenses required or social services. If you include those you're probably talking about something like 3 to 4 million jobs.In tech, as of the beginning of this year we had a million jobs in tech in the United States we couldn't fill. Those are accelerating. And that doesn't even include things like the fact that in India there are 3 million people who are doing tech roles for U.S. companies. And so when we think about the sort of broader trends, tech and a healthcare are the massive growth areas and Covid only seems to be accelerating that.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, think about it, you know, we're living longer. We're getting ahead of disease. Wellness has become a real priority. Not to mention the marriage of healthcare and technology continues to create so many opportunities.But these projections do not include the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. So where do you think the virus will have the largest impact on job trends in the near future? How is coronavirus changing things?ROSENBAUM: I mean, I think that early evidence is that we're seeing massive acceleration in these two areas from the coronavirus. So Arena, the company that I run, predicts the likelihood an individual will achieve an outcome in a job using machine learning. And if you think about sort of where that's relevant, it's particularly relevant if a hiring manager is trying to figure out whether or not someone who's worked in a Taco Bell would be really good as a manager in a maternity ward.So Arena's deployed into organizations whose applicants are almost 18 percent of the entire U.S. healthcare workforce. So it is deployed pretty broadly. And, today, we are seeing, in our client base, something like 20 percent of the entire base of our client's employment base, as of the end of February, has been hired since April. So you're talking about massive hiring over the last few months, driven by coronavirus and some of the reorganization in healthcare that's being driven by coronavirus.BARTIROMO: All right. That's a really good point.Michael, great to get your instincts on this. Thank you so much, sir. We will keep watching the next jobs in America.ROSENBAUM: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Michael Rosenbaum.We'll be right back.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Time for the "Morning Buzz."First up, a gate is no match for "The Rock." After a power outage prevented his front gate from opening, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson took matters into his own hands, actually ripping the gate off himself since he was running late for work. The actor documenting the ordeal on social media, James.How do you like that, he was not going to be late.FREEMAN: Yes. I mean, we've all been there. One of the reasons that Dwayne and I work so hard to maintain our muscle mass and power is because you never know when this is going to happen. I don't like to generally rip an iron gate off its hinges because I can tweak something in the lower back, but, you know, if it has to happen, MORNINGS WITH MARIA starts at 6:00 a.m. Eastern sharp, not 6:05, not 6:10.BARTIROMO: That's right. And --FREEMAN: So if it comes to that, I'm ready to do my duty.BARTIROMO: Well, that's what you and "The Rock" have in common, right?FREEMAN: Exactly.BARTIROMO: I mean when you're late for work, you and "The Rock," you just rip down gates. Yes. I get that.Next up, glamming up your Christmas countdown. Sephora unveils a new advent calendar, Dagen, where beauty lovers can open up a new item every day in December until Christmas. The calendar includes lip balm, eye pencils, body scrubs, other signature goodies. It is available online for $45.You in?MCDOWELL: No, because if you use all those items at one time or simultaneously you will look crazy. You only need Bismarck Romos Masonnette (ph), my makeup artist who I love dearly. You only need about eight items to do a full face. You don't need all that.By the way, I went out to brunch over the weekend and very clearly people were wearing every single item they bought online shopping during the entire coronavirus shutdown all at one time because people had on everything from like hats, and they were carrying parasols. It was the craziest thing I'd ever seen.BARTIROMO: Oh, boy.All right, finally, man's best friend could also be your mind's best friend. New studies confirm that owning a dog makes you happier. Neuropsychologists say that simply petting a dog causes your brain to release serotonin and dopamine, which leads to lower stress and a better mood.I have to agree, Dagen. There's Dusty with her shades on. Oh, wait, they were my shades. I put them on her. And she makes me happy just looking at her running on the beach.MCDOWELL: They're her shades now, Maria Bartiromo. They belong to her.BARTIROMO: That's right.MCDOWELL: I -- I -- I'm a living example of this happening. I waited -- I think I waited too long --BARTIROMO: There's Charlie and Dale.MCDOWELL: As a --BARTIROMO: There's Charlie and Dale. Those cuties.MCDOWELL: There's Ramone. That's Ramone in the background.BARTIROMO: OK.MCDOWELL: I waited too long to start rescuing animals and they really -- I would have 20 dogs if I could because they really do fill up your heart and make -- and make you realize life isn't about just you and yourself.BARTIROMO: I agree 100 percent. I wish I knew sooner about rescue dogs. They really are so grateful.MCDOWELL: They are.BARTIROMO: Adopt, don't shop.MCDOWELL: Yes.BARTIROMO: Says Dagen and me.Still ahead, all eyes on the Supreme Court. Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia is here on the famous relationship his father, Justice Antonin Scalia, had with the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg.And then Michigan's health emergency.

TikTok's US ban is on hold. What comes next?CNN WireOctober 6, 2020 Tuesday 2:35 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 917 wordsDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  TikTok averted a ban in the United States last week when a federal judge ruled that Washington couldn't block it from app stores just yet. The short-form video app is still accessible, but its fate in the country is far from certain. The court ruling is only temporary, and could be appealed by the US government. The ruling could also eventually be thrown out: The judge only weighed in because TikTok challenged the ban, and the company could lose its court case.To make things more confusing, TikTok's court case isn't the only thing governing the future of the app. TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance, is racing to close a deal with the American firms Oracle and Walmart that might be enough to satisfy the Trump administration's concerns about the app and stave off US pressure once and for all.What started all of this?US President Donald Trump and his administration have been attacking TikTok for months because of its ties to China. They claim the app is a risk to national security because the user data it stores on Americans could wind up in the hands of the Chinese government. Those attacks came to a head in August, when Trump issued executive orders that would effectively ban TikTok in the United States. He later said that the ban could be avoided if a "very American company" buys it.TikTok, meanwhile, has pushed back against the claim that it poses a security risk, saying that the user data it keeps on Americans is stored stateside, with a backup in Singapore. Its opposition to the ban spurred TikTok to sue the Trump administration in federal court. What happened to the ban? A ban on the ability to download TikTok from US app stores was originally supposed to go into effect Sept. 20, according to the US Commerce Department. That date was delayed by a week to Sept. 27 after Trump gave his tentative blessing to the agreement with Oracle and Walmart. Then that deadline was postponed indefinitely after federal judge Carl Nichols temporarily blocked the ban, in response to TikTok's legal challenge.What's next?The US Commerce Department has said that it intends to "vigorously defend" its order, and there have been no major developments in the court case since the judge issued his ruling last week. But the app store ban is not the only TikTok deadline on the US government's radar.Confusingly, one of Trump's executive orders gave TikTok a much longer Nov. 12 deadline to find a US buyer. After that date, the Commerce Department said internet backbone companies would be banned from carrying the app's traffic, effectively shutting down TikTok's US operations.TikTok could also try to push that deadline back. The company has until Oct. 14 to file a request to temporarily block those restrictions.What's happening with that deal?The agreement with Oracle and Walmart is still a work in progress. The two firms would own at least part of a new entity called TikTok Global, which would be headquartered in the United States. But some core elements of the proposal remain unclear. Trump has said he won't approve the deal unless Americans control the company. That demand has caused confusion, since an initial announcement about the tie-up with Oracle and Walmart implied that ByteDance would continue to own a majority of Tiktok going forward. (In the days after that, a person familiar with the deal told CNN Business that TikTok Global would be partially owned by ByteDance's international and Chinese investors, but that ByteDance itself will hold zero percent of the company to be created by the deal to run the app outside of China.)What about China?ByteDance applied to the Chinese government last month for a license to export its technology, indicating that the company needs some kind of approval from China before the deal can go forward. China's role in signing off on the deal is murky, though. In August, Chinese regulators introduced new rules that govern the sale of certain kinds of technology to foreign buyers. Experts pointed out that the change would likely require ByteDance to obtain government permission before selling TikTok to a foreign company.But ByteDance has said that the US deal does not involve the transfer of its algorithms and technologies --- just that Oracle would be able to review the app's source code.The deal has also received aggressive pushback from Chinese state media, which last month encouraged Beijing to kill the deal.What about WeChat?There's another Chinese-owned app that's also facing pressure in the United States. One of Trump's August orders called for a ban on transactions using WeChat, not just TikTok. The app, which is owned by Tencent, is ubiquitous in China and is widely seen as equivalent to if Facebook, Paypal, LinkedIn and other platforms were all rolled into one. It's also a popular way for people to stay in touch with friends, family and business contacts in China. Federal judge Laurel Beeler temporarily blocked the WeChat ban Sept. 20 after it was challenged in court by a group of US-based WeChat users. The judge said those users had shown "serious questions" in their claim that the executive order threatens the users' First Amendment rights.Last Friday, the US Justice Department said it would appeal that decision, which could stretch out litigation over the future of the app. In addition to the appeal, Beeler is expected to reconsider her temporary halt on the ban Oct. 15. TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Trump lashs out at China for Covid-19 in middle of UN meetingCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 22, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 886 wordsBodyGENEVA, Switzerland.- U.S. President Donald Trump and China President Xi Jinping on Tuesday hardened their clash at a U.N. General Assembly marked by the coronavirus pandemic and the growing tension between the world's two great economic powers.With international leaders intervening through pre-recorded videos, the opening day of this General Assembly lacked the drama of live and face-to-face speeches, but not the crosses of accusations between powers.Trump, in a short message of just seven minutes, went straight for Beijing, whom he held responsible for the emergence of the virus and for allowing it to spread across the globe."The United Nations must hold China accountable for its actions," said the US representative, who insisted on referring to Covid-19 as "China's virus."Xi, aware of where Trump's message was going to go, used his to make it clear that coronavirus is everyone's problem and that now the fundamental thing is cooperation to get ahead."Any attempt at politicization or stigmatization with this issue must be rejected," stressed the Chinese leader, who reached out to the world - especially vulnerable countries - to work together.Thus, Xi promised that the possible vaccines that China is developing, with several in the last phase of trials, will be considered a "global public good" and will be distributed as a priority to developing countries.The UN has insisted from the outing point that a "popular vaccine" is needed that is available to all, and so its Secretary-General, António Guterres, on Tuesday criticised that "some countries" are closing agreements for the exclusive benefit of their citizens."This vaccinationism is not only unfair, but counterproductive. None of us will be safe until we are all safe," he said of the Portuguese diplomat.         Donald Trump lashed out directly at China in his involvement with the UN     Russian President Vladimir Putin, for his part, took advantage of his intervention to breastfeed the rapid development of a vaccine in his country, which he offered free of charge to the United Nations to protect its officials."A New Cold War"Although the pandemic has triggered it, tension between the Trump and Chinese governments comes from afar and is noted on many fronts, including geopolitical, economic and environmental.It is a fracture that Guterres believes is "a very dangerous direction" and poses the risk of "a new Cold War," with two major areas led respectively by Washington and Beijing and with their own trade and financial standards, internet and artificial intelligence capabilities."A technological and economic gap poses the risk of inevitably becoming a geostrategic and military gap. We must avoid this at all costs," stressed the head of the United Nations.Faced with this situation, French President Emmanuel Macron called for the construction of "a new world order" that is not defined by the "rivalry" between the US and China and in which Europe fully assumes its responsibility.Trump, however, claimed american economic and military might and his "destination as a peacemaker" of the world, asserting its recent mediations in the Middle East or Afghanistan, but always from a "force" position.On the other side, Xi stressed that his country will not keep any kind of war, "neither cold nor hot," and will never seek"hegemony," but cooperation and multilateralism.Taking advantage of Trump's aversion to international organizations, Beijing has strengthened its foreign stake in recent years and, according to many analysts, is gaining influence in the UN and other forums.Xi maintained that line today, promising more money for multilateral funds, attacking U.S. protectionism, and committing to do more against climate change.The dispute over IranAs usual, leaders touched on several international conflicts and crises in their speeches, including the dispute over Iran, its nuclear program, and the US pressure campaign, which has had its most recent chapter at the UN.After leaving the 2015 atomic agreement and imposing tough action against Tehran, Trump last month activated a mechanism at the United Nations to restore all international sanctions against the Persian country.The movement, however, has not been recognized by the UN Security Council, as the other powers consider that Washington cannot invoke that clause as it is no longer a member of the nuclear agreement, evidence of US isolation in this area."This is a victory not only for Iran, but for the global community," said Iranian President Hasan Rohaní, who devoted virtually all of his speech to attacking the US and ensuring that his country will resist unilateral sanctions.Europe, which is trying to save the nuclear deal, is determined not to give in to Washington's attempt, Macron stressed.The new format of the General Assembly, with leaders intervening from their capitals, has enabled the UN to bring together more heads of state and government this year than ever before.Meanwhile, the organization's headquarters in New York, usually a swarm of activity on these dates, remains semi-empty, with only two hundred diplomats authorized to follow the debates from the Chamber."The Covid-19 pandemic has changed our annual meeting to make it unrecognizable. However, it has also made it more important than ever," Guterres stressed.  Load-Date: September 24, 2020End of Document

University of California Law: Making Sense of the Mayhem Surrounding Social Media Apps TikTok and WeChatTargeted News ServiceOctober 14, 2020 Wednesday 8:00 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1042 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: BERKELEY, California BodyThe University of California Law campus issued the following news:Teenagers are rarely captivated by international trade wars. But that all changed August 6, when tensions between the United States and China spilled into the social media realm with President Trump's executive order against the wildly popular video app TikTok.Suddenly, everyone from middle schoolers to tech law scholars were scrambling to suss out the situation. Citing national security concerns, the order announced that TikTok would be blocked from processing transactions for American citizens and from being downloaded in U.S. app stores after 45 days -- and banned unless sold to a U.S. company by November 14. Another executive order sought to ban downloads of the Chinese messaging app WeChat.The Asia Society of Southern California recently tapped three leading legal scholars, including Berkeley Law Dean Erwin Chemerinsky and Berkeley Center for Law & Technology Executive Director James Dempsey, to unpack the core issues and assess their implications. You can watch the event here.Moderator Seagull Song, a Berkeley Law LL.M. (2007) and J.S.D. (2010) graduate, described the controversy's far-reaching nature. "We're trying to talk about constitutional law, cybersecurity, data privacy, and international relations," she said. "What are the risks identified by the Trump Administration and how valid are they?"TikTok, a platform for sharing short self-produced video clips, has more than 100 million users in the U.S. WeChat, which offers messaging, social media, and payment services, has more than 3 million American users and helps family and friends in China and the U.S. stay connected."There has been a multi-year growing concern about Chinese products and services in the U.S. telecommunications ecosystem," said Dempsey, who outlined the dispute's statutory framework. "The concern began with hardware, and more recently shifted over to data. It's clear to me that this concern is here to stay."Trump administration lawyers argued that ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, is a mouthpiece for the Chinese government and that U.S. users' personal information is at risk. TikTok countered that the Chinese government is not granted access to such information and that ByteDance does not process user data in China. On September 27, a district court judge blocked the order to remove TikTok from U.S. app stores.Similar concerns were raised in the order targeting WeChat, which users widely acknowledge is likely monitored by the Chinese government. On September 19, one day before WeChat faced removal from U.S. app stores, a judge temporarily blocked the order and will hear the administration's appeal on October 15.Regulating speechChemerinsky, one of the nation's most renowned constitutional scholars, anticipates that the U.S. Supreme Court will eventually hear the issue assuming that the matters are not resolved in other ways."Generally, the Supreme Court sides with the president in matters involving foreign relations," he said. Even so, and even with a strongly conservative bench, he thinks the court "will rule against President Trump on First Amendment grounds as district courts have done."Chemerinsky, who submitted a declaration in the case, argued that the orders against TikTok and WeChat constitute clear violations of the First Amendment by regulating speech."These orders restrict the ability of people to speak and receive information," Chemerinsky said. "TikTok and WeChat are ways people transmit information to others and receive information. The Supreme Court has said that any restrictions of speech over social media or the internet have to meet the most exacting levels of constitutional scrutiny. The government can't meet that level of scrutiny to justify this."Chemerinsky highlighted how the Supreme Court previously ruled that even sexual offenders could not be denied internet access because it had become such a vital means of communication. He explained how the U.S. government is legally required to show a compelling need for such an action and that there is no other way to achieve it. This instance, Chemerinsky asserted, plainly fails to meet that high bar."Never before has a president tried to ban a medium of communication," he said. "That's what he's done with TikTok and WeChat. Imagine if a president tried to ban a newspaper. Everyone would agree that violates the First Amendment. This is so much more than that."Emblematic ordersUC San Diego professor Susan Shirk, former deputy assistant secretary of state during the Clinton administration, said the executive orders reflect the Trump administration's hostility toward China. Noting that WeChat has been around for more than 20 years and TikTok for more than two, she wondered why the orders were suddenly issued -- and why they drew little distinction between the two companies."We haven't seen any evidence in reality of Chinese exploitation of data with TikTOk, while with WeChat ... people know it's censored but exercise care and stay away from political speech," Shirk said.Dempsey described how the executive orders were made under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. It enables the president to regulate international commerce in response to an extraordinary threat to the U.S. which has its source, in whole or substantial part, outside the country.The law has been used by presidents mainly to impose economic sanctions against other nations, including President Obama in 2015 against North Korea for its cyber attack on Sony Motion Pictures. Last year, however, Trump used the act to declare an extraordinary emergency with communications services offered by Chinese companies in the U.S."That order didn't ban anything, didn't sanction anything, but it set in motion a process and signaled the president's intent to look at Chinese participation in U.S. telecommunications services," Dempsey said.The law has two main exceptions, which explicitly state that the president has no authority to regulate or prohibit any personal communication or any import or export of any informational material."That's become critical to the debate around TikTok and WeChat," Dempsey said.Contact:Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7264878 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: October 14, 2020End of Document

TikTok, WeChat ban: U-M experts can discussMichigan Independent: University of Michigan - Ann ArborSeptember 18, 2020 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEW; Pg. 1Length: 572 wordsBodyEXPERTS ADVISORYThe Trump administration is adding more restrictions on TikTok and WeChat. University of Michigan experts are available to discuss its implications.Mary GallagherMary Gallgaher is the Amy and Alan Lowenstein Professor of Democracy, Democratization, and Human Rights and director of the International Institute."It's well known that the Chinese government blocks many U.S. social media corporations from freely operating in China, including Twitter, Facebook and Google," she said. "And many Chinese citizens do not support their government's restrictions on their access to information."Rather than banning WeChat and Tiktok, which many Chinese are rightly proud of for their innovative technology, the U.S. government should highlight the lack of reciprocity in market access for U.S. firms and the Chinese government's inexcusable restrictions on free speech and expression for U.S. firms and Chinese citizens alike.

His areas of expertise include public law, regulatory policy and Chinese corporate law."Parties seeking to enjoin the implementation of President Trump's executive order concerning WeChat-whether users or the platform itself-have extremely robust legal arguments on their side, arguments that should be familiar from similar challenges to the president's 'travel bans' or new questions regarding citizenship on the U.S. census," he said."Those arguments are grounded in U.S. constitutional law, including equal protection and First Amendment or free speech concerns-the power of the U.S. government to act in this way without a legislative mandate and pursuant to remarkably thin 'national security' justifications, notwithstanding. Because this is directed at a platform associated with the People's Republic of China, there remains a question in my mind as to whether our federal courts are able to navigate an environment soaked in the 'China Threat' hostility fanned by the administration in recent years, and properly enjoin the implementation of the executive order in its present form."Contact: nhowson@umich.eduErik GordonErik Gordon is a clinical assistant business professor. His areas of interest include entrepreneurship, venture capital, private equity, mergers and acquisitions, and the biomedical, IT and digital marketing industries.He thinks that America's perception of China's actions has eliminated the ability of China or the companies to avoid the ban by making promises."The powerful lever of credibility has been broken," Gordon said. "It is unlikely that the U.S. will accept mere promises from a company controlled directly or indirectly by Chinese entities. The nominal location of the company's headquarters doesn't matter if the company is controlled by Chinese entities."If a U.S. company has sole access to and control over data that never leaves the U.S., it might be possible for the U.S. to accept an arrangement in which Chinese entities derive revenue from operations in the U.S. It seems less valid for the U.S. to impose a ban if there is sufficient data protection and the sole purpose of the ban is to force the company to sell its U.S. operations to a U.S. company.Contact: rmegordo@umich.edu, 734-764-5274Load-Date: September 19, 2020End of Document

Thus far, the United States and some of its allies have attempted either full or partial bans to mitigate the risk associated with the presence of Huawei equipment. However, while both of these strategies may work in different ways in the short term, they are unlikely to effectively mitigate the cybersecurity risk associated with Huawei's 5G equipment in the long run."The actions of the Chinese Communist Party prove that it is impossible to be truly neutral about a company's country of origin. Alliances are crucial to mitigating risk within global systems, but we should not assume other actors, even traditional allies, will automatically follow U.S. global leadership.* * *REPORT: https://www.rstreet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Final-No.-204-Lessons-6G.pdf[Category: Economics]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7241082 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: September 22, 2020End of Document

TikTok Ditches Microsoft, Tries Ties with OracleRealMoneySeptember 14, 2020 Monday 9:07 AM EDTCopyright 2020 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1551 wordsByline: Alex Frew McMillanHighlight: TikTok tries to satisfy the Gordian Knot of Trump push and Chinese pull through partnership deal with Larry Ellison's Oracle.BodyThe parent of TikTok, ByteDance Ltd., appears to be resisting the sale of the U.S. operations of the world's most-popular app, pursuing a so-far vaguely defined partnership with the software company Oracle  instead.It's unclear whether that will satisfy the concerns over national security raised by U.S. President Donald Trump, although Oracle Executive Chairman Larry Ellison is a prominent Trump backer and China basher. Trump has pushed for TikTok to be sold, with a deadline of next week for U.S. companies to cease doing business with it.Rival bidder Microsoft  says it is definitely out of the running. "ByteDance let us know today they would not be selling TikTok's U.S. operations to Microsoft," Microsoft  on Sunday.Oracle has reached a preliminary "technical partnership" with ByteDance for TikTok's operations, according to the Financial Times. Everyone agrees Oracle is doing a deal with TikTok. Quite what kind of deal isn't clear, since neither ByteDance nor Oracle has commented.The partnership/deal/whateveryouwannacallit does not apparently include a full sale of TikTok. This would attempt to keep both the U.S. and Chinese governments happy, since the United States has ordered TikTok to be sold, and China has essentially ordered that it cannot be sold.Oracle, which is primarily an enterprise software provider, would likely become TikTok's "preferred technology partner." This would see it run TikTok's cloud operations and store the data of U.S. users, gaining TikTok as a customer. TikTok says it currently stores all U.S. data in the United States, with backup in Singapore and none of the information inside China or in the clutches of the Chinese government. For the time being, it uses the cloud operated by Google owner Alphabet  .ByteDance is already backed by the venture-capital companies Sequoia Capital and General Atlantic. They will also likely be part of the new ownership structure alongside Oracle, which would take a minority stake, too.The whole deal is going to get run up the flagpole of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS. That's the body now charged with supervising the TikTok sale and these talks.But it is actually impossible to satisfy the governmental demands of both China and the United States on this one. China has basically banned the sale of TikTok's "secret sauce" to an overseas company. Trump, meanwhile, has ordered that it has to be sold off.The former chief security officer at Facebook  , Alex Stamos,  that a "deal where Oracle takes over hosting without source code and significant operational changes would not address any of the legitimate concerns about TikTok, and the White House accepting such a deal would demonstrate that this exercise was pure grift."It's been grift all along. Trump has always been pushing for the sale of a supremely popular app to land TikTok in U.S. hands. This is ironic, since Big Tech in the United States is being investigated for anti-competitive oligopolistic behavior. And Big Tech has finally found a competitor that they have yet to beat at its game.TikTok was the world's most-downloaded app in August,  , with 63.3 million installs, and broke through 2 billion downloads in April. It has around 100 million daily active users in the United States.It allows users to make 15-second video clips. My teenage daughter loved using it for dance moves. Millions of other teens and tweens use it that way, too. Yes, you could get on there and do really embarrassing things, and if you're dumb illegal things. But it scores pretty low on the list of security threats.K-Pop fans  and organized to book tickets to Trump's rally in Tulsa, Okla. back in June. They then didn't show up, tanking attendance. But in this case, TikTok is just the tool. It could have been any other communication app. Likewise, TikTok could be used to train facial recognition. Like any other photo or video app.Anyway, it's really, really popular. So U.S. and Chinese politicians just have to get involved. If it's popular, that means "concerned citizens" are worried about it. Like  , or gangsta rap. Parents can't stand their kids using it so much.In response to efforts by Trump to force a cut-price sale of TikTok, China on August 28 updated its export controls on 23 types of technology, the first time it had made a change since 2008. China now needs to approve any sale to a foreign company -- and thus a tech "export" -- of any tech that deals with artificial intelligence, 3D printing, drones, lasers, facial recognition and recommendation "push" algorithms.Beijing's move applies to essentially all technology. But it seems clearly designed with TikTok in mind; the app uses AI and predictive technology to figure out what you've been doing in its videos, and to recommend what videos you'd like to watch next. Beijing said it needed to make these changes to safeguard economic and national security. It also says it will defend the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese businesses.TikTok has quite rightly  . It says it is being denied due process. I agree. I said last month that I think they're  . And I said at the get-go that Trump's action  .Reuters has reported that Beijing would rather see TikTok shut down than allow its sale. TikTok already pulled the plug on operating here in Hong Kong. Faced with the unpleasant choice of refusing to hand over user data to the Hong Kong police, who might be tracing democracy activists, and therefore angering China, or handing over the data and angering the United States, it simply stopped its app from working here.Trump issued his first executive order against TikTok on August 6, the same day he also issued an order against the WeChat app operated by Tencent Holdings (TCEHY). Chinese-owned apps are proliferating and "threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States," Trump states in the order.TikTok could be used by the Chinese Communist Party to track federal employees and contractors, gather information to use for blackmail, and to conduct corporate espionage. The order also notes that TikTok "reportedly censors" politically sensitive material on topics like Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests and China's treatment of Uighurs in western China. ByteDance certainly does do this within China; TikTok says it never has outside the country.All U.S. companies must stop doing business with ByteDance (and Tencent's WeChat) within 45 days, those orders stipulate -- meaning they would kick in next Monday, September 21.But one order wasn't good enough. On August 14, Trump issued a second order on TikTok, saying that parent ByteDance's purchase of rival lip-synch app Musical.ly was prohibited -- a little late, since it already went ahead in August 2018. Shanghai-based Musical.ly was TikTok's springboard into the United States, where it had a big U.S. user base, although Musical.ly itself was also a Chinese-owned app.As a result of the second Trump order, ByteDance has 90 days from the date of that order to divest itself of all TikTok assets and property that relate to the United States. That would take us through November 13. It's not specified what would happen if ByteDance doesn't comply, but the U.S. attorney general is "authorized to take any steps necessary to enforce this order."Microsoft was teaming with Walmart  in an attempt to buy TikTok's business in the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. "We are confident our proposal would have been good for TikTok's users, while protecting national security interests," the company said.Microsoft says it would have "made significant changes to ensure the service met the highest standards for security, privacy, online safety, and combatting disinformation," doing its level best to imply that will now not happen. "We look forward to seeing how the service evolves in these important areas."The former Facebook security officer Stamos believes this throwaway line from Microsoft "is an attempt to poison the well against an Oracle deal where they only take over hosting. And MSFT is right to do so," Stamos says.The Chinese owner Beijing Kunlun Tech was forced to sell the gay dating app Grindr this March to a group of U.S. tech and media investors for US$609 million, due to security threat concerns and what some have cited as blackmail potential.But ByteDance may point to the sale, approved by CFIUS two years ago, of U.S. insurer Genworth Financial to China Oceanwide Holdings. In that deal, China Oceanwide pledged to use a U.S.-based third-party service provider to store data on Genworth's U.S. policyholders. U.S. authorities agreed this was an effective way to ensure the data did not fall under Chinese rules or control.The idea that TikTok could be used to spread disinformation or censor content is a valid one. But it applies to all communications tools, even phone lines. Facebook was used by Russian spies to peddle misinformation; having a U.S. owner offered no protection. Police how TikTok vets the information that its users share.If TikTok user data is too hot for Communist Chinese officials to handle, just make sure it doesn't fall into their hands. Order it to be stored on U.S. shores, and make sure that it is. Then our teens can get on with making dance clips. And we can all move on.Load-Date: September 15, 2020End of Document

Growing veto for Huawei clears road to Nokia and Ericsson in 5GCE Noticias Financieras EnglishOctober 25, 2020 SundayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 895 wordsBodyHelsinki, 25 Oct (EFE).- The growing veto of Western countries to The Chinese company Huawei, which the United States accuses of spying for Beijing, is clearing the way for Nordic manufacturers Nokia and Ericsson towards global hegemony in the fifth generation (5G) mobile phone market.Given the endless applications and business opportunities it offers, 5G technology has become a strategic issue globally, and its security and reliability, in one of the top priorities of governments.In addition, it is a succulent market. According to a recent Nokia study, 5G technology has the potential to contribute $8 trillion to the global economy by 2030, in areas such as industrial automation, IoT (Internet of Things) or driverless vehicles.Huawei currently holds global leadership in the 5G network sector, with a share of between 35 and 40%, well above Ericsson (20-25%) and about twice as much Nokia (15-20%), according to data from consultancy Dell'Oro.As a result, the great beneficiaries of the Western veto to Huawei are the only two other manufacturers capable of providing complete 5G equipment and services - the Nordic Ericsson and Nokia - that are taking most of the new 5G network tenders globally outside China.EXPANSION OF VETO TO HUAWEIThe last country to join this veto has been Sweden, home of Ericsson, whose authorities decided last Tuesday to ban Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE from accessing contracts for the deployment of 5G technology, arguing could damage national security.Sweden follows the path taken by the U.S., whose president, Donald Trump, last year decreed a ban on U.S. companies using Chinese suppliers' 5G technology for security reasons and called on the European Union (EU) and other countries to do the same.Both the Chinese authorities and Huawei have on numerous occasions denied U.S. accusations and called on companies and governments not to exclude Chinese manufacturers from deploying 5G networks for what they consider political reasons.To date, however, countries such as Australia, Canada, Britain, Slovenia and Japan have already joined the US blockade, as well as for strategic reasons or by pressure - and even threats - from the Trump administration.Other countries dare not veto Huawei directly for diplomatic reasons and for fear of possible retaliation by the Chinese government, although they are recommending that their telecom operators not purchase 5G equipment from Chinese manufacturers.This is the case in France, where the Director General of the National Information Systems Security Agency (Anssi), Guillaume Poupard, said last July that his country will strongly - albeit without banning - the use of Huawei's 5G networks for reasons of "sovereignty and independence"."We're seeing a snowball effect and there are many reasons why this is happening now. One is the geopolitical tension between the U.S. and China, another that Huawei has become too important a player in the global network market," Mikael Rautanen, analyst at consulting firm Inderes, explains."Another important reason is that it is the deployment of 5G, an infrastructure much more critical for countries than 4G, as vital as water and electricity," Rautanen adds.OPERATORS FEAR DOING BUSINESS WITH HUAWEIThe fear of operators losing their licenses in the future if their governments decide that Huawei's 5G networks may pose a risk to national security is leading many of them to exclude the Chinese manufacturer from their plans from "own motu"5G deployment.A good example of this is the Spanish teleco Telefónica, which last month left Huawei out of its plans to expand 5G networks in Spain, betting exclusively on Nokia and Ericsson, although the Spanish Executive has not officially spoken out about the possible risk of using Chinese equipment.Months earlier, Telefónica had already announced its intention to "progressively" reduce Huawei's presence at the core of its 5G network, until it was completely eliminated by 2024, a measure similar to that announced by Vodafone for its entire 5G network in Europe."Operators also see that there is a political risk when buying equipment from Huawei. That simple risk is enough for customers to buy from Ericsson or Nokia even in those countries where there are no restrictions on Huawei at the moment," Rautanen says.At the same time, teleoperators must ensure the competitiveness and functionality of their 5G networks, if possible by diversifying their investments so as not to rely on a single supplier and become vulnerable."In the short to medium term, the veto for Huawei is positive for Nordic suppliers, but in the long run it is difficult to say what will happen. Operators don't want to see a Nokia and Ericsson duopoly, so there will be demand for alternatives and that will bring new competition," Rautanen predicts.South Korean giant Samsung is emerging as the main rival of The Nordic manufacturers in the global 5G market, as it has managed to put its share between 10 and 15%, according to Dell'Oro, although at the moment it does not have the same capacity as Nokia and Ericsson to offer 5G equipment compatible with 3G and 4G technologies.It remains to be seen what the Chinese government's response will be if the veto to Huawei spreads across Europe and America, but at the moment it cannot be ruled out that it ends up causing a large-scale trade war. Juanjo GalánLoad-Date: October 26, 2020End of Document

'Mulan' has a lackluster box office debut in ChinaCNN WireSeptember 13, 2020 Sunday 3:45 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 503 wordsDateline: NEW YORK (CNN Business) BodyNEW YORK (CNN Business) --  "Mulan" was designed to be a blockbuster in China. But so far, the Disney film is off to a pretty anemic start at the Chinese box office.According to the studio, the live-action remake of the 1998 animated classic brought in an estimated $23.2 million opening in China this weekend. To put that number into context, "The Lion King," another live-action remake of a Disney animated film, opened to $54 million in the country last year, according to Comscore. The film also brought in less money than Warner Bros.' "Tenet," which opened to roughly $30 million in China last weekend. "Mulan" has made roughly $38 million internationally overall so far."Mulan's" opening is disappointing since the film was built for success in China. The film, which stars Yifei Liu, is led by an international cast and tells the story of a legendary female Chinese warrior who disguises herself as a man to fight for her country. "For a film that was tailor-made for the Middle Kingdom, this lackluster debut has it coming apart at the seams," Jeff Bock, senior analyst at entertainment research firm Exhibitor Relations, told CNN Business.The reasons why the film, which cost $200 million to make, failed to launch in China is likely due to several factors. Predominantly among them is the coronavirus pandemic, which has ravaged the theater industry. About 90% of theaters in China are open and theaters limited to half capacity.However, according to the analytics firm Gower Street, China is the nation closest to rebounding to pre-pandemic levels and has already had a blockbuster of its own with "The Eight Hundred," a film produced by China's CMC Pictures. That film has accumulated more than $300 million in China since its opening in late August.It also didn't help that "Mulan" has been mired in controversy.In the credits of the film, Disney thanked a Chinese government agency accused of human rights abuses in Xinjiang for its help in making the film. This revelation provoked a storm of criticism and caused a backlash online.Christine McCarthy, Disney's chief financial officer, acknowledged that the uproar over the film had caused "issues" for the company at a Bank of America conference on Thursday.And last year, Liu expressed her support for Hong Kong police as they faced allegations of excessive violence against protesters. That led pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong to call on people to boycott the film.China, the second-biggest movie market in the world, is especially vital to "Mulan's" success since the film did not have a theatrical release in the US. After multiple delays, the studio released the film only on its new streaming service Disney+ in the US. To watch the movie, Disney+ subscribers had to pay $30 on top of their subscription fee.The company has not yet revealed how many people paid for the film on Disney+.--- Michelle Toh, Selina Wang and Ben Westcott contributed to this report.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

China's provocation to Taiwan: two aircraft from his army violated the island's airspace upon visit by US diplomatCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 17, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 408 wordsBodyThe Chinese regime's irritation at a senior US diplomat's visit to Taiwan was not left in words, as two People's Liberation Army aircraft caused a new scene of tension and confrontation.China "officially protested to the United States" over the visit of Keith Krach, undersecretary of state for Economic Growth, Energy and the Environment, who arrived on Thursday. "We will provide a necessary response based on developments," Beijing had warned.Prior to Krach's arrival, two Y-8 model aircraft entered the Air Defense Identification Zone through the southwest sector and were repelled by the Taiwan Air Force, forcing them to change course.As detailed by the Ministry of Defense, these are anti-submarine Shaanxi Y-8 aircraft, to which verbal radio warnings were sent to leave the area.Incursions are common for the Chinese regime over several disputed regions in which it claims sovereignty, but this occurred only hours before a US official's highest-ranking visit since 1979, when Washington changed its official diplomatic relations with Taipei to Beijing. On Saturday, Krach will participate in a tribute to the late Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui.The arrival from Krach to Taipei (Reuters) (POOL/)Beijing "strongly opposes" Keith Krach's visit, said On Thursday Wang Wenbin, spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. "America's insistence" on planning this trip "will embolden Taiwan's independence supporters in their arrogance and insolence," he lamented.This trip takes place one month after another senior American leader's visit to the island. The Chinese government opposes all these meetings that he believes legitimize the Taiwanese authorities.Keith Krach and Mike Pompeo (Reuters)In a message posted on her Twitter social media profile, the Taiwanese chancellery expressed her "warmest welcome" to Krach and Destro and hoped that the visit "deepens friendship and strengthens relationships between partners who think the same way."China-U.S. relations are becoming increasingly strained, odd to controversial issues such as Hong Kong, coronavirus management, treatment reserved for the Uighur minority, or trade issues. For its part, Taiwan has been governed autonomously since 1949.(With AFP and EFE information)MORE ON THIS TOPIC:A senior US official will visit Taiwan to extend the "strong ties" between the two nationsH&M; severed ties with a Chinese supplier accused of using forced labour by Muslim minority UighurLoad-Date: September 18, 2020End of Document

Following TikTok Deal, Judge Agrees to Delay U.S. Restrictions on WeChatBillboardSeptember 21, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Prometheus Global Media, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; TAGLength: 515 wordsByline: Associated PressHighlight: Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler in California said the government's actions would affect users' First Amendment rights.BodyA judge has approved a request from a group of U.S. WeChat users to delay looming federal government restrictions that could effectively make the popular app nearly impossible to use.In a ruling dated Saturday, Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler in California said the government's actions would affect users' First Amendment rights, as an effective ban on the app would remove their platform for communication.WeChat is a messaging-focused app popular with many Chinese-speaking Americans that serves as a lifeline to friends, family, customers and business contacts in China. It's owned by Chinese tech giant Tencent.The group of WeChat users requested an injunction after the U.S. Commerce Department said Friday it would bar WeChat from U.S. app stores and keep it from accessing essential internet services in the country beginning Sunday at 11:59 p.m.The Trump administration has targeted WeChat and another Chinese-owned app, TikTok, for national security and data privacy concerns, in the latest flashpoint amid rising tensions between Washington and Beijing. The administration contends that the data of U.S. users collected by the two apps could be shared with the Chinese government.On Saturday, President Donald Trump said he supported a proposed deal that would have TikTok partner with Oracle and WalMart to form a U.S. company. There is still a chance that TikTok could be banned in the U.S. as of Nov. 12 if the deal isn't completed, under the restrictions put in place by the Commerce Department.However, a restriction to bar TikTok from app stores in the U.S., similar to what WeChat faced, was pushed back a week to Sept. 27 after Trump backed the latest TikTok deal.On Sunday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News that the government will ensure that under the TikTok-Oracle-WalMart deal, no American's data would end up in the possession of the Chinese government.In the WeChat case, the users argued that the moves targeting the all-in-one app with instant-messaging, social media and other communication tools would restrict free speech.In her ruling, Beeler found that a WeChat ban "eliminates all meaningful access to communication in the plaintiffs' community," and that an injunction would be in the public's interest. Furthermore, specific evidence about WeChat posing a national security threat was also "modest," she wrote.The U.S. government earlier argued that it would not be restricting free speech because WeChat users still "are free to speak on alternative platforms that do not pose a national security threat."The White House did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the injunction, but Kerri Kupec, a spokesperson for the Department of Justice, said the department was reviewing the judge's order.The dispute over WeChat and TikTok is the latest attempt by the Trump administration to counter the influence of China. Since taking office in 2017, Trump has waged a trade war with China, blocked mergers involving Chinese companies and stifled the business of Chinese firms like Huawei, a maker of phones and telecom equipment.Link to ImageLoad-Date: September 21, 2020End of Document

US JUDGE HALTS GOVERNMENT BAN ON TIKTOKStates News ServiceSeptember 28, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 436 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK BodyThe following information was released by the Voice of America (VOA):A U.S. federal judge has temporarily halted a Trump administration order to ban the popular video app TikTok from U.S. app stores.The ban was due to go into effect at the end of the day Sunday by order of the U.S. Commerce Department, the latest move targeting what administration officials have said are security concerns with Chinese companies.The judge gave lawyers for TikTok and the administration until Wednesday to meet and propose a schedule for further proceedings in the case.TikTok lawyers argued at a Sunday hearing that banning the app would infringe on the free speech rights of its users, while also bringing irreparable harm to the company's business."We will continue defending our rights for the benefit of our community and employees," the company said in a statement welcoming the judge's decision.The U.S. head office of TikTok is seen in Culver City, California, Sept. 15, 2020.The Commerce Department said after the ruling that an executive order President Donald Trump issued in August outlining concerns that TikTok collects a wide range of data that could end up in the hands of the Chinese government "is fully consistent with the law and promotes legitimate national security interests."The statement said the government is complying with the injunction but intends to "vigorously defend" the executive order and its implementation from legal challenges.The Trump administration also sought to shut another popular app, WeChat, out of U.S. app stores, before a judge issued an injunction a week ago stopping that ban as well.China has rejected the U.S. allegations that the apps present security concerns, while accusing the United States of bullying Chinese companies.The Justice Department asked Friday for the WeChat ban to be allowed to go into effect while that legal case plays out, arguing that allowing the app to continue to be available to U.S. users will cause the country harm.TikTok has sought to alleviate U.S. concerns by forming a partnership with two U.S. companies, Oracle and WalMart. The deal has not been finalized, and there have been conflicting statements among the parties about how much of the new venture each would own.Trump initially said he gave his blessing to the arrangement, before stating it would not go forward if TikTok's parent company had any ownership stake in the new company.TikTok said after Sunday's ruling that it will "maintain our ongoing dialogue with the government to turn our proposal, which the President gave his preliminary approval to last weekend, into an agreement."Load-Date: September 28, 2020End of Document

The advisory alleges such actors are "one of the greatest threats" to U.S. national security systems, the defense industrial base and Defense Department information systems.The advisory includes descriptions of the "Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures" as well as recommended mitigations."NSA is aware that National Security Systems, Defense Industrial Base, and Department of Defense networks are consistently scanned, targeted, and exploited by Chinese state-sponsored cyber actors," the bulletin states. "NSA recommends that critical system owners consider these actions a priority, in order to mitigate the loss of sensitive information that could impact U.S. policies, strategies, plans, and competitive advantage."Additionally, due to the various systems and networks that could be impacted by the information in this product outside of these sectors, NSA recommends that the CVEs above be prioritized for action by all network defenders," the advisory continues.Last year, the NSA established a "cybersecurity directorate" to share unclassified threat intelligence, with a special focus on the defense industrial base."We hear loud and clear that it can be hard to prioritize patching and mitigation efforts," NSA Cybersecurity Director Anne Neuberger said in a statement released yesterday. "We hope that by highlighting the vulnerabilities that China is actively using to compromise systems, cybersecurity professionals will gain actionable information to prioritize efforts and secure their systems." -- Justin Doubleday   Load-Date: October 23, 2020End of Document

"While the bank account is still open, it hasn't been used for another purpose," headded.Since joining the White House in 2017, Trump has defined China as the greatest threat to the United States and world democracy.In 2008 Trump unsuccessfully attempted to build an office building in Guangzhou and in 2012 opened an office in Shanghai, the newspaper reported.In addition, the Trump Hotel Collection negotiated to undertake a project in Beijing with the State Grid Coroportation, China's fifth-largest electricity company,sources told the AFP agency. But the project was then abandoned.So far, Biden's tax returns and financial activities have shown no connections to China.Load-Date: October 22, 2020End of Document

Feds say US colleges 'massively' underreport foreign fundingAssociated Press InternationalOctober 20, 2020 Tuesday 11:35 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: DOMESTIC NEWS; POLITICAL NEWS; STATE AND REGIONALLength: 973 wordsByline: COLLIN BINKLEY, AP Education WriterBodyA scathing report from the Trump administration on Tuesday concluded that top U.S. universities have “massively underreported” funding they accept from China, Russia and other nations described as “foreign adversaries.”The Education Department released the report amid its effort to enforce a 1986 law requiring U.S. universities to disclose gifts and contracts of $250,000 or more from foreign sources. After going decades with little federal oversight, the law has become a priority for the Trump administration amid concerns over economic espionage and trade secret theft from abroad.The department’s findings are primarily based on investigations it has opened at 12 schools, including Harvard, Yale, Stanford and Georgetown universities. Federal officials began investigating the schools amid suspicion that they had failed to report millions of dollars in gifts and contracts from sources in China, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Qatar.According to early findings in the report, most of the 12 schools have had financial dealings with Huawei, the Chinese tech giant that some U.S. officials say is a threat to national security, and at least one had ties directly to the Chinese Communist Party. Others had deals with the Russian government and institutions in Saudi Arabia and Qatar.The report did not identify which universities were connected to those entities. Since coming under federal scrutiny, the 12 schools disclosed a combined $6.5 billion in foreign funding that was previously unreported, the department said.The Association of American Universities, which represents research universities, said the report is “less a serious security assessment than it is a partisan and politically driven attack on America’s leading research universities.”“While the Department of Education purports to be concerned about threats, it has consistently failed to respond to repeated requests for clarity, transparency, and guidelines,” the group said in a statement.Some universities had previously acknowledged errors in reporting and sought to correct them. Yale said it failed to submit foreign funding reports for the years 2014 to 2017 but later corrected the omission.The department said its review is ongoing and that it is still gathering information from universities.In announcing the report, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said her agency uncovered “pervasive noncompliance” from universities that have “significant foreign entanglement." "For decades enforcement was lax, but not anymore," she said. “We took action to make sure the public is afforded the transparency the law requires.”The report echoes warnings from federal authorities who say that competing nations are increasingly targeting U.S. colleges to steal research and technology. It cites recent cases of Chinese nationals accused of working or studying at American colleges while also working for the Chinese government.The department said its review is only meant to promote transparency and not to determine the appropriateness of specific financial ties. Still, it says the agency plans to wok with the Justice Department on any “potential enforcement against specific institutions.”Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., ranking member of the House Education and Labor Committee, applauded the Education Department for pressing for transparency.“For too long, adversarial foreign actors, including China, have utilized whatever means at their disposal to influence American higher education with little to no repercussion," she said. “If we want to protect the integrity of American education, we must require greater transparency and accountability of foreign money in our colleges and universities."It's not unusual for U.S. colleges to accept foreign funding for research projects or exchange programs, but federal reporting requirements have long been treated as an honor system. For years, little was done to verify the regular reports colleges submit to the federal government detailing foreign gifts and contracts of $250,000 or more.That began to change last year, however, after a bipartisan report in Congress raised alarms about colleges’ ties with China. It found that 70% of schools that house a Confucius Institute — a Chinese language program funded by the Chinese government — failed to disclose its financial ties to the Education Department.In response to that finding, DeVos began ordering broader investigations into universities' foreign funding.The department's new report finds that the nation's largest and richest universities have “aggressively pursued and accepted foreign money.” It concluded that colleges have “massively underreported” the resulting funding while also hiding details about funding they did disclose, including the names of donors from abroad.It cites Stanford as an example, saying the school anonymizes the names of foreign donors, including Chinese sources that have donated more than $64 million since 2010. The agency criticized Yale and Case Western Reserve universities for going years without reporting foreign donations, even as both were “rapidly expanding their foreign operations and relationships.”Universities have pushed back against criticism, saying they sought to follow the law but were given little federal guidance. Many also oppose new rules the department released this year requiring colleges to disclose greater detail about their ties to foreign companies and governments. Some worry that the new rules will deter foreign donors who want to remain anonymous.The department dismissed those concerns on Tuesday, along with complaints that the new rules are too burdensome.“Institutions manage to track every cent owed and paid by their students; there is no doubt they can – and indeed do – track funds coming from foreign sources, including those adversarial to American interests,” the report said.Load-Date: October 20, 2020End of Document

COULD TIME BE UP FOR TIKTOK?States News ServiceSeptember 24, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 880 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: SANTA MONICA, Calif. BodyThe following information was released by RAND Corp.:by Daniel Gonzales, Sarah Harting, Julia BrackupThe proposed TikTok deal with Oracle and Walmart has not been approved by the White House because ownership and national security concerns have yet to be resolved. TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, would still retain a significant ownership stake in TikTok Global if the proposed deal goes through.Is it possible for ByteDance to maintain ownership in TikTok Global while ameliorating U.S. national security concerns? At the heart of any deal should be a highly technical agreement on data security issuesone that not only the two companies but the two governments might have to agree to.There's reason for concern on the part of the U.S. government. Researchers have shown that TikTok has bypassed Google privacy safeguards in the Android operating system, enabling the company to track TikTok users even if they remove the app's tracking cookies. Also, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce the TikTok app sends a wide range of user data to cloud data centers in China, where it applies its closely guarded artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to identify and spread viral posts.Furthermore, it appears the app's communications with ByteDance servers in China are encrypted, making it difficult to discern exactly what data is transmitted to China. Such practices raise national security concerns: could that user data be used by the Chinese government to track individuals, conduct espionage, or for blackmail?All details of the proposed deal aren't public, although some reports indicate Oracle would host all of TikTok's U.S. operations in the United States in a secure Oracle cloud. This is a necessary first step but is not sufficient to guarantee the data of U.S. citizens is not transmitted to China. Much more will be required to fully protect U.S. user data.Oracle would need to address two major types of cybersecurity vulnerabilities.Front door vulnerabilities occur when an actor installs malicious code on a previously secure app or hardware component through a software update, unbeknownst to the user. Because ByteDance may maintain majority ownership of TikTok and control the app software, it may still supply the app's software updatesproviding a potential means for the Chinese government to access user data. To lock that front door, any agreement must allow Oracle to review and certify ByteDance's human readable source code for all TikTok software updates to ensure they do not include any malicious code.No software updates should be installable on TikTok user phones or servers directly from China.Share on TwitterFurthermore, no software updates should be installable on TikTok user phones or servers directly from China; Oracle must control the update process for U.S. users and verify that only reviewed software updates are used in TikTok's U.S. operations. The review of the source code would uphold and respect ByteDance's intellectual property rights while allowing Oracle to certify that the code does not pose a national security risk. Oracle could only inspect ByteDance's software, while a ByteDance representative in the United States maintained control of the source code.The proposal must also ensure that diagnostic data collected from user phones would be sent first to Oracle and not ByteDance. Oracle would scrub it of any personally identifiable information before sharing it with ByteDance software developers in China.That still leaves back door vulnerabilitiesmalware in the original source code. Such hidden code could potentially copy user data and transmit it to an unauthorized outsiderin this case, potentially the Chinese government.To lock both the back and front doors, Oracle will need to inspect all TikTok software to confirm that it does not contain any commands or processes that would send U.S. user data to China or any unauthorized servers. In addition to reading the source code, Oracle will also need to review ByteDance's algorithms that will run on U.S. servers to ensure this code is secure. However, ByteDance would retain control of the AI algorithms during the source code inspection process. In addition, ByteDance could also patent its AI algorithms in the United States to provide further protection of its intellectual property.Finally, if there is evidence that American's user data is going to China despite Oracle's efforts, the U.S. government should retain the right to inspect TikTok source code at any time.If this deal is to pass government scrutiny, Oracle will have to lock these front and back doors. If not, it might be that time's up for TikTok in the United States.Daniel Gonzales is a senior scientist at the nonprofit, nonpartisan RAND Corporation, and works on cyber security, cyber supply chain risk management, and intelligence issues.

TikTok sale raises international questionsThe Collegian: University of TulsaSeptember 7, 2020 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 609 wordsBodyFor most young people now, especially in the U.S., it is difficult to remember, or imagine, how life was without social media. The world seems to be run, or perhaps overrun, by so much information at the touch of a button or the swipe across a screen. One of the newest crazes to hit the internet is the platform known as TikTok. The app designed for dancing, lip-syncing and other forms of entertaining content that can be jammed into a one-minute video format has been a topic of discussion in the news off-and-on for quite a while now, especially after the app was faced with threats of being blocked in some countries or permanently shut down. However, most recently TikTok is making headlines because everyone wants to know the answer to this question: Is an American company buying it from its current Chinese parent company owners, ByteDance? This question is not easily answered, especially when considering the new rules set in place by the Chinese government.On Friday, Aug. 28, the Chinese government announced official revisions in regard to guidelines surrounding selling particular types of technologies to foreign buyers such as the U.S. These revisions affect TikTok specifically due to new rules regarding processing data and recognition technology, both for text and for speech. China has a catalogue of exports including this type of information technology that is strictly banned from any exportation, and the relationship with the United States and China over these sorts of bans and intellectual property are already tense without the addition of further prohibitions. The Ministry of Commerce in China claims that these actions are in the best interest of their own national security, and it is an effort to have a more formalized system of managing their export of technological resources and goods. These new regulations make it likely that the company responsible for TikTok, ByteDance, will first need to acquire permission from the Chinese government before the sale of the social media platform to a foreign company can even be considered.China is not the only nation that has voiced concerns about national security. President Trump and other politicians claim this as their reason for attempting to force ByteDance to sell all of Chinese operations of TikTok in the U.S. to an American company. Based on current reports, it appears that American companies and the United States government only want the sale of ByteDance's American TikTok assets and operations. This led to TikTok filing a lawsuit against the President and his administration. Despite the app's origin company denying national security threat allegations and the ensuing lawsuit, Walmart and Microsoft have still made offers to buy TikTok from ByteDance. So, where do deals to buy this popular app stand as of now? Will TikTok be officially banned in the United States?The situation only gets stickier. China's new regulations are blatantly pushing against any attempts to force ByteDance to sell their technology to an American company. Both countries are trying to force leverage over the other in this situation. How will this competition over technology affect the treatment of other China-based companies if the United States is successful in strong-arming TikTok from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce? At this time, it appears that the U.S. and the Chinese Ministry of Commerce have reached an impasse over ByteDance and the infamous TikTok social media service. Time will tell who will overcome the other in this arm-wrestling match, or if in the end they will be able to reach a reasonable compromise for both countries.Article written by Logan GuthrieLoad-Date: September 7, 2020End of Document

China seeks large investments to fund its climate targetCE Noticias Financieras EnglishOctober 27, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 394 wordsBody(Bloomberg) -- China is looking for international financial institutions and investors to help finance the country's drive toward carbon neutrality.In a set of guidance views backed by five government ministries, Beijing said it would encourage private investment and foreign capital to support green bonds and finance climate-friendly projects. The Government also said it plans to allow individuals and financial firms to participate at some point in its carbon trading scheme, which will be launched soon.Climate finance guidelines come a month after President Xi Jinping pledged to transform China from world's largest polluter to net zero emitter by 2060. The effort could cost up to $15 trillion as the country invests in renewable energy and hydrogen and carbon capture to help eliminate deep dependence on coal.The policy shows that consensus is being built in the Chinese government on the need for a transition to climate-friendly overseas investment, according to Dimitri de Boer, ClientEarth's chief representative in China. Approval was given by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, the National Development and Reform Commission and the People's Bank of China, as well as banking and securities regulators."It clarifies specific favorable projects under the government's green financing framework with the support of climate and financial regulators," said Fu Sha, Director of Strategy and Planning at San Francisco-based Energy Foundation China. "It could inspire climate investment from local authorities and financial institutes."Key details include:Expanding entities allowed in the country's carbon trading system to include individuals and financial institutions "in a timely manner" and support institutions in the development of related derivative products, such as carbon futures.Invite foreign entities to issue green bonds and maintain green yuan-denominated financial assets.Support yuan-denominated offshore trade on green financial products and cross-border transfers of green financial assets, and help national entities that want to create yuan-denominated climate funds for investments abroad.Coordinate clear standards for green financing and accelerate new standards for information disclosure for climate investment funds and projects.Original Note:China Seeks Big Money's Help Reaching Its Carbon-Neutral Goal©2020 Bloomberg L.P.Load-Date: October 28, 2020End of Document

Chinese chipmaker denies military ties as US steps up feudAssociated Press Financial WireSeptember 6, 2020 Sunday 4:25 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 414 wordsDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) — China’s leading maker of semiconductors has denied it has any links to the military following reports Washington is considering stepping up its feud with Beijing over technology and security by imposing export controls that could disrupt manufacturing for a national industrial champion.U.S. regulators are considering adding Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. to a list of foreign buyers that need government permission to acquire technology or components, according to The Wall Street Journal and other outlets. They said officials are looking at whether SMIC plays a role in Chinese military development.“We have no relationship with the Chinese military,” the company said in a statement. It said SMIC products are “solely for civilian and commercial end-users and end-uses.”The company said it is “open to sincere and transparent communication” with Washington to resolve “potential misunderstandings.”SMIC is a leader in a semiconductor industry built up by the ruling Communist Party in an effort to reduce China’s reliance on foreign technology.The Trump administration is trying block Chinese access to U.S. technology it worries might be used to make weapons or develop competitors to American industry.The U.S.-Chinese tariff war that erupted in 2018 was sparked in part by Washington's complaints about Beijing's technology ambitions. The United States and other governments complain Chinese development plans are based on stealing or pressuring foreign companies to hand over technology.Washington also worries about China’s development of long-range missiles, supercomputers that can be used in nuclear warhead development and other high-tech weapons. That comes amid tension over control of the South China Sea and other territorial disputes.Washington has imposed similar curbs on access to U.S. process chips and other components for China’s first global tech competitor, Huawei Technologies Ltd., one of the biggest makers of smartphones and network equipment. That threatens to cripple Huawei's business.Chinese companies including Huawei are developing their own processor chips and other technology. But factories that produce them require American manufacturing technology for which there are few alternatives.SMIC said it previously was granted “validated end-user status” by the agency that would impose the export controls. Such status allows a Chinese company to export U.S. technology without applying for a license for each shipment.Load-Date: September 6, 2020End of Document

Briefly Stated: Stories You May Have Missed Education WeekOctober 21, 2020Copyright 2020 Editorial Projects in Education, Inc All Rights ReservedSection: Pg. 2; Vol. 40; No. 10Length: 1779 wordsBodyFiscal Outlook Grim for School Funding in Next Few YearsTough financial times are ahead for school districts. Most district leaders are already attuned to that. Just how tough, though? Far worse than that of the Great Recession, with many governors asking their various agency heads to project budget reductions of 15 percent to 20 percent.So says the National Association of State Budget Officers in a new analysis.The analysis, in fact, shows that for the first time in roughly a decade, a majority of states closed their fiscal 2020 books with a decline in general-revenue funds. And NASBO's data don't even include New York, Texas, or three other states whose fiscal years ran beyond June.The 45 states that were done by then reported an average revenue shortfall of 6 percent in fiscal 2020, from a combination of sales, income-and corporate-tax collections, lottery and gaming revenue, and other funding sources falling short of projections.Overall, it will be several years before states fully dig themselves out of coronavirus budget holes, according to NASBO, and future revenue losses stemming from the current recession are forecast to surpass "the 11.6 percent drop states experienced over two years during and following the Great Recession."Education is not immune to what lies ahead. Districts rely immensely on state funding sources, and school systems with relatively large Black, Latino, and low-income student populations can in some cases receive more than half their revenue from state aid. Brian Sigritz, NASBO's director of state fiscal studies, said governors and lawmakers dealing with large shortfalls are going to have to make cuts in areas like K-12 education.The speed at which state coffers rebound will depend on several factors, he said, including whether Congress passes another COVID-19 stimulus package, which would lessen the need for spending cuts, and whether the country gets ravaged by a second wave of coronavirus during the fall and winter."If there is additional federal aid, if the economy does recover more quickly, it might lessen the need for these sorts of cuts by the states," Sigritz said. "Lessen. Not eliminate."Florida Appeals Court Sides With Governor Over Opening Schools for In-Person ClassesFlorida's governor has gotten his way to force schools to re-open and hold in-person classes even though coronavirus cases are on the rise in the state.A state appellate court this month overturned a trial judge and upheld, at least temporarily, a COVID-19 emergency order issued by Gov. Ron DeSantis' administration that required most public schools in the state to reopen in person by Aug. 31 or face a significant loss of state funding, Ã  la President Donald Trump's goal.The ruling comes in a closely watched legal battle over education during the pandemic between the Florida Education Association and other plaintiffs and the Republican administration. It is somewhat anticlimactic in that all but a few districts had opened for in-person instruction. Some schools later closed following confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19.The plaintiffs "have invited the judiciary to second-guess the executive's discretionary actions exercising emergency powers during a public-health emergency to address the health, safety, and welfare of students in Florida's public schools," said a unanimous three-judge panel. "The courts must decline the invitation."The panel's decision overturns an injunction by Leon County Circuit Judge Charles W. Dodson, who had said that the governor, education Commissioner Richard Corcoran, and the Florida education department had "arbitrarily prioritized re-opening schools statewide in August over safety and the advice of health experts."In the new appellate opinion, Judge Lori S. Rowe said the challengers of the emergency order were unlikely to succeed on the merits of their various claims under the state constitution.Rowe said the plaintiffs were unable to show that any students were denied the option to continue remote learning or "that any teacher was forced to return to the classroom, denied a requested accommodation from their employing school district, and then suffered harm."Said Andrew Spar, the president of the FEA: "The lower court got this case right, and the appellate court got it wrong. That's why we will appeal this misguided ruling."Trump Administration Urges Schools and Colleges to Reconsider Affiliation With Chinese ProgramIn its latest attempt to curb China's presence in the United States amid a battle over trade, the coronavirus, and human-rights issues, the Trump administration is encouraging schools and colleges to rethink their ties to the Confucius Institute, a program that brings Chinese-language classes to America but, according to federal officials, also invites a "malign influence" from that country.In letters to state education officials and universities, the U.S. Departments of Education and State said the program gives China a foothold on American soil and poses a threat to free speech. Schools are being advised to examine the program's activities and "take action to safeguard your educational environments.""The presence of this authoritarian influence on our campuses has never been more concerning, nor more consequential," said the letters signed by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos.The program brings Chinese-language classes to about 500 elementary and secondary classrooms, and more than 60 U.S. universities host the Confucius Institute through partnerships with an affiliate of China's Ministry of Education. China provides teachers and textbooks and typically splits the cost with the schools. The program has drawn mounting scrutiny from U.S. officials amid ratcheted tensions with China. In August, the State Department labeled the program's national office as a foreign mission of the Chinese Communist Party, which requires the program to submit reports about its operations and spending in the United States.In the most recent letters, which went out Oct. 9, U.S. officials drew attention to China's new national security law in Hong Kong, which critics say curtails free expression and other liberties.DeVos and Pompeo echoed long-standing complaints from academic groups that say schools give China too much control over what's taught in Confucius Institute classes. Teachers who are vetted and paid by the Chinese government "can be expected to avoid discussing China's treatment of dissidents and religious and ethnic minorities," the officials wrote.The letters do not explicitly urge schools to cut ties with the program but say the measure could avoid problems. Officials said many schools have built "excellent Chinese-language and culture programs" without the Chinese government.S.C. High Court Rejects Use of COVID Aid for VouchersSome states tried to send federal coronavirus aid to all students in private schools. But the federal judiciary knocked that idea down--several times. Then GOP governors in several states tried to send their discretionary coronavirus aid to private schools. And South Carolina's governor added the flourish of doing so via vouchers. Now that state's supreme court has put the kibosh on the program.The high court ruled that Gov. Henry McMaster's goal to allocate $32 million--of the state's $48 million--in aid to private and religious schools is unconstitutional because the public money would directly benefit the schools.In the court's opinion, Chief Justice Don Beatty acknowledged the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the lives of South Carolinians and the state's education system, and the "unprecedented challenges" faced by state leaders. But the difficulties of the pandemic could not dictate the court's decision, Beatty wrote."No matter the circumstances, the court has a responsibility to uphold the constitution," he wrote.The ruling came days after congressional leaders called on the U.S. Department of Education to review the program, arguing it violated "the plain text" of the coronavirus-aid package and guidance provided by the federal department.McMaster said the one-time program would cover about 5,000 grants of up to $6,500 for students to attend private schools this academic year and help parents who could not afford the expense otherwise.Lawyers for McMaster said the groups couldn't show how they were personally injured by the program because public schools were not inherently entitled to the funds. They said the funds only indirectly benefited the schools while directly benefiting the students and families who would receive the tuition grants.McMaster said he would request the court to reconsider its decision, noting the opinion could also jeopardize millions of federal aid dollars recently appropriated by the state legislature to directly reimburse private colleges and historically Black colleges and universities.Okla. Virtual Charter Blasted in State AuditAn embattled virtual charter school that has grown to become Oklahoma's largest public school used a "remarkably complex" infrastructure to divert tens of millions of taxpayer dollars into a for-profit business controlled by three men, says state auditor Cindy Byrd.A Republican with more than two decades of auditing experience, Byrd said the problems uncovered in the investigative audit of Epic Charter Schools and the company that manages it, Epic Youth Services, were among the worst she has seen.She released a scathing 120-page audit of the school's activities and finances from 2015 to 2020 that shows it funneled about $80 million into a "learning fund" managed by the school's founders, Ben Harris and David Chaney, that has never been audited. Another $45.9 million went directly into the for-profit management company controlled by Harris, Chaney, and the school's chief financial officer, Josh Brock."This arrangement presents an inherent conflict of interest," she said.Among the audit's other findings: The school recently spent $3 million over three months on advertising to attract new students; Epic Youth Services used $203,000 from the student-learning fund to help with startup expenses for expanding its operations into California; Harris and Chaney used Oklahoma school personnel and funds for its California operations; and they pledged credit from Epic bank accounts as collateral to secure loans to run their for-profit venture in California.An Epic spokeswoman described Byrd's press conference as "political theatrics" and said school officials dispute many of the audit's findings.The P-12 school has enjoyed explosive growth since it was founded in 2011 and now has an enrollment of about 46,000 students.Load-Date: October 31, 2020End of Document

Sweden bans Huawei, ZTE from 5G, calls China biggest threatAssociated Press Financial WireOctober 20, 2020 Tuesday 3:39 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; DOMESTIC NEWSLength: 404 wordsByline: KELVIN CHAN, Associated PressBodySweden is banning Chinese tech companies Huawei and ZTE from building new high-speed wireless networks after a top security official called China one of the country's biggest threats.The Swedish telecom regulator said Tuesday that four wireless carriers bidding for frequencies in an upcoming spectrum auction for the new 5G networks must not use equipment from Huawei or ZTE.Wireless carriers that plan to use existing telecommunications infrastructure for 5G networks must also rip out any existing gear from Huawei or ZTE, the Swedish Post and Telecom Authority said.The agency said the conditions were based on assessments by the Swedish military and security service. Huawei said it was “surprised and disappointed” by the rules.Sweden is the latest country to prohibit Huawei from playing a role in building 5G networks and its decision is likely to add to tensions between the Chinese government and Western powers. U.S. officials have waged an intense lobbying campaign in Europe to persuade allies to shun the company, saying Huawei could be compelled by China's communist rulers to facilitate cyberespionage. The company has consistently denied the accusations.The ban means more opportunities for Huawei's main rivals, Swedish company Ericsson and Finland's Nokia.New 5G networks, which are expected to usher in a wave of innovation such as smart factories and remote surgery, are considered critical infrastructure. Klas Friberg, the head of Sweden’s domestic security service, known as SAPO, said Tuesday that foreign powers have intensified their intelligence activity in recent years so 5G networks should be built in a secure way from the start.“China is one of the biggest threats to Sweden," Friberg said. “The Chinese state is conducting cyber espionage to promote its own economic development and develop its military capabilities. This is done through extensive intelligence gathering and theft of technology, research and development. This is what we must consider when building the 5G network of the future."Huawei denied it was a security risk.“Huawei has never caused even the slightest shred of threat to Swedish cyber security and never will," it said. "Excluding Huawei will not make Swedish 5G networks any more secure. Rather, competition and innovation will be severely hindered.___For all of AP’s tech coverage, visit https://apnews.com/apf-technology___Follow Kelvin Chan at twitter.com/chanmanLoad-Date: October 20, 2020End of Document

UPDATE 1-ByteDance and Oracle differ on terms of agreement by TikTokCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 21, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 553 wordsBodyBy Echo Wang and Yingzhi YangNEW YORK/PEKON, 21 Sep (Reuters) - ByteDance and Oracle Corp gave conflicting statements Monday about the terms of an agreement they reached with the White House over the weekend to allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States, questioning President Donald Trump's preliminary approval of the business.China's ByteDance hastily search to avoid any kind of sanction on TikTok, after the U.S. Department of Commerce said Friday that it will block new downloads and updates to the popular short video app.U.S. officials had expressed concern that the personal data of up to 100 million Americans using the app is being sent to the Chinese government.A successful deal would allow Trump to put behind his threat to shut down TikTok and avoid a conflict with his broad young user base before the November 3 election.ByteDance said Monday that it will own 80% of TikTok Global, a new American company that will own most of the app's operations worldwide. The Chinese firm added that TikTok Global will become its subsidiary.But Oracle and Walmart Inc - who agreed to take shares in TikTok Global of 12.5% and 7.5%, respectively - had said Saturday that TikTok's majority ownership would be held by the Americans.On Monday, Oracle said ByteDance's ownership of TikTok would be distributed to ByteDance investors and that the Beijing-based company will not have a stake in TikTok Global.Trump signed an executive order on August 14 giving ByteDance 90 days to sell TikTok, amid concern that personal data from up to 100 million Americans using the app could end up in the hands of the Communist Party of China government. On Saturday, Trump expressed his support for a principle of agreement that would allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States.OUTING TO BAGByteDance also confirmed monday plans for an initial public offering from TikTok Global. Oracle has said this will be done in less than 12 months on a U.S. stock exchange.The Beijing-based firm said TikTok Global's board of directors will include ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming as well as Walmart CEO Doug McMillon and current ByteDance board members.Oracle and Walmart said in a joint statement Saturday that four of the five board members will be Americans.The current plan for TikTok Global does not involve any transfer of algorithms or technologies, and Oracle will be able to inspect TikTok's U.S. source code, according to ByteDance.This is a formula similar to that of U.S. companies like Microsoft Corp that share their source code with Chinese technology experts, ByteDance added. Oracle and Walmart have said all TikTok technology will be in TikTok Global's possession.ByteDance also said the $5 billion tax payment that TikTok Global is supposed to make to the U.S. Treasury is based on the estimated revenue and other taxes the company will have to pay in the coming years and has nothing to do with the agreement reached with Oracle and Walmart.Last week, Trump had said there would be a $5 billion education fund as part of the deal, but ByteDance has said he wasn't aware of this.

The Nasdaq Composite increased 0.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 finished flat.The S&P 500 started the day lower by 0.9%, extending the month's pullback and briefly turning negative for the year, before the dip buyers stepped in. By the afternoon, the benchmark index was up 1.3% but sellers regained control on no specific news. The inability to sustain another rebound was disappointing for the bulls but not necessarily bearish.Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished in positive territory, even as declining issues edged out advancing issues at both the NYSE and Nasdaq. The utilities (+1.2%), consumer staples (+0.8%), and information technology (+0.6%) sectors outperformed in a defensive-minded trade that excluded the health care sector (-0.5%).Generally, investors remained nervous about election volatility, the prospects for another fiscal relief bill, the trajectory of the coronavirus, and U.S.-China relations. On stimulus, House Speaker Pelosi (D-CA) will reportedly introduce a $2.4 trillion relief bill, but it's unlikely to have the support of Republicans.Regarding the economy, the labor market remained in poor standing as weekly jobless claims increased by 4,000 to 870,000 (Briefing.com consensus 825,000). New home sales, however, rose 4.8% m/m in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.011 million (Briefing.com consensus 875,000) -- its highest rate since November 2006.Interestingly, a pair of analysts turned bullish on some battered financial stocks. Goldman Sachs (GS 195.11, +8.99, +4.8%) was upgraded to Buy from Hold at UBS, and Wells Fargo (WFC 23.32, +0.49, +2.2%) was added to the Fresh Pick List at Robert W. Baird.U.S. Treasuries traded within another narrow range and closed little changed. The 2-yr yield was unchanged at 0.13%, and the 10-yr yield decreased one basis point to 0.67%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 94.33. WTI crude futures gained 0.9%, or $0.37, to $40.31/bbl.Reviewing Thursday's economic data:Jobless claims for the week ending September 19 increased by 4,000 to 870,000 (Briefing.com consensus 825,000) while continuing claims for the week ending September 12 decreased by 167,000 to 12.580 million.The key takeaway from the report is that initial jobless claims remain at stunningly high levels that point to the ongoing challenges U.S. businesses face getting back on a pre-pandemic track. In the same period a year ago, initial jobless claims were 215,000.New home sales in August did something they haven't done since November 2006 -- exceed a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.0 million. Specifically, they rose 4.8% m/m to 1.011 million (Briefing.com consensus 875,000) and were up 43.2% yr/yr.The key takeaway from the report is that it reflects strong demand for new homes at more affordable price points, as the South region, which is the largest homebuilding region and features lower average prices, saw sales increase 13.4% m/m.Looking ahead, investors will receive Durable Goods Orders for August on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +18.9% YTDS&P 500 +0.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -6.0% YTDRussell 2000 -13.0% YTD16:21BMY Bristol-Myers: Phase 3 CheckMate -274 trial met primary endpoints of improving disease-free survival vs placebo (58.25 -0.74)Bristol Myers Squibb today announced that CheckMate -274, a pivotal Phase 3 trial evaluating Opdivo (nivolumab) after surgery in patients with high-risk, muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma, met its primary endpoints of improving disease-free survival (DFS) versus placebo in both all randomized patients and in patients whose tumor cells express PD-L1 > or =1% (programmed death-ligand 1). CheckMate -274 is the first and only Phase 3 trial in which immunotherapy has reduced the risk of relapse in the adjuvant setting for these patients.

Elacestrant is an oral Selective Estrogen Receptor Degrader (SERD) that is being studied in postmenopausal women and men with ER+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The study reached its enrollment goal of 466 patients overall, including 220 (47%) with tumors harboring an ESR1 mutation as detected in circulating tumor DNA by the Guardant Health Guardant360 liquid biopsy test.Patients will be followed until the required number of events to assess progression-free survival -- the primary endpoint of the study -- is reached at which time the primary analysis will be performed. It is anticipated that this analysis will take place in the second half of 2021.An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) has been continuously monitoring the safety and efficacy of patients enrolled in the EMERALD trial. After enrollment of 70% of planned patients, the committee formally reviewed results of a futility analysis.

In August, U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar became the highest-ranking U.S. official taiwan has visited in decades, when he traveled to the island apparently to discuss the pandemic.In response, Beijing increased military exercises around Taiwan. Nearly 40 Chinese warplanes crossed the middle line between the mainland and Taiwan on September 18 and 19, one of several departures that the island's president, Tsai Ing-wen, called the "threat of force."Meanwhile, in early October, U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper announced his "Battle Force 2045" plan, which envisages an expansion and modernization of the U.S. Navy of 500 ships with and without crew over a 25-year period.NEWSLETTER 9AM From Monday to Friday, the selection of our editors of the most relevant information for each day.

Trans-Pac spot rates edge higher amidst heightened regulatory scrutinyJournal of CommerceSeptember 18, 2020 Friday 9:48 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Commonwealth Business Media All Rights ReservedLength: 1049 wordsByline: Bill Mongelluzzo, Senior Editor | Sep 18, 2020 5:48PM EDTBodyhttps://www.joc.com/sites/default/files/field_feature_image/Shanghai%20Sept.%2018.png [caption caption="The West Coast spot rate Friday edged up 1.4 percent to a record-high $3,867 per FEU, and the East Coast spot rate increased 2.2 percent to $4,634. Photo credit: Shutterstock.com."][/caption]Container spot rates in the eastbound trans-Pacific continued their record-breaking two-month-long climb this week, even as carriers were notified by government agencies in China and the United States that they are closely watching capacity and freight rates and the potential for anti-competitive activity.The government warnings likely came too late to affect rates for the past week, but they will have an impact going forward. Some carriers are canceling blank sailings they had scheduled for the post-Golden Week holidays in China when cargo volumes will taper off due to factory closures.[caption caption="Click to enlarge." align="right"][/caption]Pricing from Asia to the US West Coast edged up 1.4 percent to a record-high $3,867 per FEU for the week ended Sept. 18, while the East Coast spot rate increased 2.2 percent to $4,634 per FEU, according to the Shanghai Containerized Freight Index that is published in the JOC Shipping & Logistics Pricing Hub.Friday's West Coast rate is 189 percent higher than the Sept. 20, 2019 rate of $1,338 per FEU; the East Coast rate is 97 percent higher than the $2,351 spot rate last year. The gains highlight the impact of the US import surge that began in late July on freight rates in the largest US trade lane. Demand for imports from Asia skyrocketed following the reopening of the economy after COVID-19 lockdowns and shows no signs of tapering off.US imports from Asia increased 13.4 percent year over year in August, and 16.5 percent from China, according to PIERS, a JOC.com sister company within IHS Markit.Short-term contract rates increase as wellThe relentless increase in the spot rates that accompanied the import surge is pushing up short-term contract rates that retailers have been negotiating with carriers as they seek to lock in favorable rates for cargo volumes that have exceeded their expectations. Most beneficial cargo owners (BCOs) and non-vessel operating common carriers (NVOs) signed their annual service contracts in May, locking in rates of about $1,300 to $1,400 per FEU to the West Coast and $2,300 to $2,400 per FEU to the East Coast through April 30, 2021.However, a number of BCOs and NVOs have found during the current import surge that their volumes are exceeding the weekly minimum quantity commitments (MQCs) in their contracts. Those importers are now paying spot rates approaching $4,000 per FEU to the West Coast for any weekly bookings above their MQC.As a result, many shippers are now negotiating short-term contracts lasting several months that allow them to increase their weekly bookings, according to several NVOs who spoke with JOC.com. The rates in these contracts are higher than what they are paying in their annual service contracts, but much lower than the current spot rates.Patrik Berglund, CEO and founder of Xeneta, said Asia-US West Coast rates on these shorter-term contracts as of Thursday averaged about $2,050 per FEU, which is up 44 percent from last month. He said shorter-term contract rates will most likely continue to climb, especially if space on vessels leaving Asia remains tight and spot rates remain elevated this fall. "These rates have just started to go higher. It's now beginning to play out," Berglund told JOC.com Thursday.  Spot rates have been volatile the past three years, increasing in late 2018 as retailers front-loaded imports to get ahead of tariff increases scheduled for early 2019 during the US-China trade war, then dropping last year as import volumes tapered off, and are now spiking during the economic recovery.Uncertainties over rates as Golden Week approachesAlthough carriers have pre-filed general rate increases (GRIs) for Oct. 1 with the US Federal Maritime Commission, as is required by law, it is unclear whether carriers will attempt to implement those GRIs. Some lines said they will heed warnings from regulatory agencies in China and the US and forego GRIs, Other lines, which had planned GRIs of $200 to $300 this week, scaled them back to $50 to $100 per FEU, according to NVOs, who suggested carriers may also mitigate GRIs on Oct. 1. Spot rate movements will also be affected by carriers' decisions involving blank sailings in October. Some lines still intend to cancel sailings in line with the Golden Week holiday in China, while others have decided to reinstate sailings they had previously announced would be canceled in October. Such decisions will apparently be made on a carrier-by-carrier basis.Cosco Shipping and OOCL, which are owned by the Chinese government, for example, have announced they will not blank any sailings in October. Maersk Line, in a customer advisory this week, said it is canceling all blank sailings scheduled for October, while CMA CGM, also in a customer advisory, announced it will blank one sailing to the Gulf Coast and one to the East Coast.Carriers are also adding single-voyage vessels, known as extra loaders. According to a listing of extra loaders provided to JOC.com by an NVO, carriers have deployed six extra loaders this week in the trans-Pacific trade and have scheduled 14 more through mid-October. The extra loaders range in size from about 2,900 TEU to 8,500 TEU in capacity."There's a lot of confusion," said Jon Monroe, who serves as an advisor to NVOs. It is difficult for customers to keep track of blank sailings, reinstated blank sailings, and extra loaders in the eastbound trans-Pacific, not to mention how those developments might impact freight rates, he said.Monroe noted that the base spot rate of almost $4,000 per FEU to the West Coast doesn't even include add-on surcharges of $300 to $500 for premium services such as a guarantee of container availability in equipment-constrained Asian load ports, and for priority loading, which means the shipment will not be rolled over to a subsequent voyage.With the additional fees, "rates are already more than $4,000," he said.Contact Bill Mongelluzzo at bill.mongelluzzo@ihsmarkit.com and follow him on Twitter: @billmongelluzzo.Load-Date: September 30, 2020End of Document

China threatens to annihilate TikTok deal over Trump's "extortion"CE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 23, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 521 wordsBodyThe farcific agreement between ByteDance, Oracle and Walmart has instigated a confusing crossover of positions on who will control TikTok Global, the resulting company, if all parties involved succeed in bringing the negotiations to fruition. However, two prominent headwaters related to the Chinese Communist Party urge Beijing to immediately fulminate what they see as a "dirty" and "unpleasant" agreement.The editorial boards of the China Daily and the Global Times have harshly criticized the result of the Trump Administration's "extortion" that will offer Oracle and Walmart at least a 20% stake in TikTok Global and implicitly also some presence in the application's matrix, Beijing-based ByteDance. "What the US has done with TikTok is almost the same as a gangster forcing unreasonable and unfair trade deal with a legitimate company," the China Daily said in a publishing house published Wednesday, which called the deal a "dirty and dishonest extortion." Like US President Donald Trump, the Chinese government will have to offer its blessing on the final agreement. However, the terms of it continue to cause deep confusion. The initial announcement over the past weekend, initially supported by Trump, indicated that Oracle and Walmart would take 20% of TikTok Global, offering the entity $60 billion worth. ByteDance would control the remaining 80% but since approximately 40% of China's parent company has U.S. investors such as Sequoia Capital and General Atlantic, the resulting company will be controlled by 53% OF US entities.On Monday, however, ByteDance claimed it would maintain control of TikTok Global, which in contraded the White House tenant, who indicated that only U.S. investors would be in charge of the new entity. Oracle issued a statement backing Trump while he could still torpedo the deal if the U.S. parties do not clearly have a majority stake. For his part, during Wednesday' day, Hu Xijin, director of the Global Times, stressed that Beijing will probably not approve the current agreement as it jeopardizes China's national security.While Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is confident trump will approve the transaction, U.S. national security officials have expressed concern that the operation does not include TikTok's algorithms or source code, so the app could continue to be used to influence public opinion, particularly before the November 3 election.At the expense of what happens to TikTok, the Trump administration sets its sights on Tencent after banning downloads of its WeChat messaging services in the US. A decision that was frozen Sunday by a California federal court judge. According to the New York Times, the U.S. Foreign Investment Committee (Cfius) would be investigating the chinese internet giant's agreements in the country, including investments in Activision Blizzard, Epic Games, Riot Games, Snap, Tesla, and Uber. According to consultancy Dealogic, in the last five years Tencent has been part of more than 40 transactions on this side of the Atlantic, with a combined value of more than $16 billion.commentsforum0WhatsApp  FacebookTwitter  Linkedin       Load-Date: September 24, 2020End of Document

ByteDance picks Oracle in high-profile bid for video app TikTokPolitico.comSeptember 13, 2020 Sunday 11:00 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 721 wordsHighlight: The win for Oracle came after its top rival, Microsoft, announced on Sunday that its effort had fallen short.BodyThe Chinese company behind TikTok has chosen Oracle as a key partner to help run its U.S. operations, rejecting an acquisition bid from Microsoft in a deal caught up in competing pressures from the Trump administration and Beijing.The exact value or structure of the deal, including whether Oracle would own part or all of TikTok's U.S. assets, was not immediately clear. A person familiar with the matter described Oracle as a technology partner to TikTok and did not characterize the transaction as an outright sale.President Donald Trump hasn't fully signed off on the deal as of this weekend, a senior administration official said Sunday night. Trump had set a deadline of next Sunday for TikTok to cease operating in the U.S. as a Chinese-owned company.The win for Oracle came after its top rival, Microsoft, announced on Sunday that its effort had fallen short. Microsoft's bid, which included retail giant Walmart, would have purchased TikTok's U.S. operations as a way of resolving the administration's concerns about the popular video sharing app's possible ties to the Chinese government."ByteDance let us know today they would not be selling TikTok's US operations to Microsoft," the company said Sunday evening.American interest in TikTok increased when the Trump administration signaled in early August that it was considering banning the app amid worries that U.S. data is being funneled to the Chinese government. Trump signed an executive order on Aug. 6 that would prohibit TikTok from conducting transactions in the U.S. effective Sept. 20.Beijing has since put in place regulations requiring the government to sign off on the sale of valuable technology, including algorithms like those that power TikTok. That means any transaction would need to win the approval of officials in China and the U.S., a challenging proposition as Chinese leaders have criticized Trump's effort to force a sale of the company.Trump's executive order declared TikTok a national security threat due to its alleged ties to the Chinese government and barred the company from transactions in the U.S. starting Sept. 20. A follow-up executive order gave TikTok's Chinese parent company ByteDance 90 days to sell its U.S. business - a deal that would require Trump's approval.In late August, China's Ministry of Commerce added artificial intelligence technologies to an export controls list, casting doubt about whether the government must green light the sale of TikTok to a foreign company. ByteDance said it would "strictly comply" with the new Chinese rules.The president's chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, told POLITICO on Aug. 27 that the administration had no preference for a TikTok buyer, so long as data from U.S. users doesn't flow to Beijing. Trump himself also appeared flexible so long as the Treasury Department is "well compensated" in the deal."I guess Microsoft wants it and so does Oracle, and probably so do other people, but they have to also make sure the United States is well compensated because we're the ones making it possible," the president told reporters at an event in Yuma, Ariz., in mid-August.Trump did lend a boost to Oracle's bid at the time, calling it a "great company" that "would be certainly somebody that could handle it." Oracle's Chair Larry Ellison hosted a high-dollar fundraiser for Trump in February and Oracle executives have been close advisers to his administration even when other tech giants shied away.Microsoft has cultivated its own positive relationship with the Trump administration, despite high-profile disagreements over issues like immigration and the environment. CEO Satya Nadella spoke with Trump directly in the days before he issued the TikTok executive order, helping to convince the president a sale would be better than an outright ban.Other companies reportedly interested in the app included Google's parent Alphabet, Twitter and the Japanese multinational SoftBank, although preliminary negotiations with those firms fell flat.TikTok has become a social media phenomenon that has only grown in popularity during coronavirus self isolation. The company recently said it counts 100 million monthly active users in the U.S. who generate a trove of lucrative personal data on the internet habits of, mostly young, consumers.Ben White contributed to this report.Load-Date: September 14, 2020End of Document

Trump ban backhand: TikTok gained overtime and will be able to continue operating in the U.S.CE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 28, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 583 wordsBody         We have something to offer you With our digital subscription you will enjoy more than 300 exclusive items per month and ship our sites without limits.

But the court has yet to consider the legal arguments about whether the social network should remain available to Americans.The platform claimed that a blockage of downloads, even temporary, would cause it irreparable damage by preventing its growth and damaging its commercial reputation.At an unusual telephone hearing, Judge Nichols heard lawyers from TikTok, owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, yesterday arguing about freedom of expression and national security.For attorney John Hall, a ban would be "punitive" and close a public forum used by tens of millions of Americans.In a paper filed before the hearing, TikTok's lawyers said the ban was "arbitrary and capricious" and would "undermine data security" by blocking updates and fixes to the app used by some 100 million Americans.The company also said the ban was unnecessary because negotiations were already underway to restructure TikTok's ownership to address the national security issues raised by the Government.Government lawyers argued that President Trump has the right to take national security measures, and said the ban was necessary because of TikTok's ties to the Chinese government through ByteDance.A government report called ByteDance a "spokesperson" for the Chinese Communist Party, arguing that it was "committed to promoting the party's agenda and messages."A spokesman for the Chinese Chancellery, Wang Wenbin, today called on Washington to provide a "fair" and "non-discriminatory" business environment in the United States and criticized "intimidation" against its companies.In this way, TikTok has become the new symbol of the battle between the United States and China for dominance of the state-of-the-art technology sector.In early August, Trump had signed a decree to force ByteDance to sell the platform to a U.S. company, arguing - without evidence - an alleged threat to "national security."According to the representative, TikTok spies for China through the collection of user data.Trump also alleges threats to national security to ban the popular Chinese weChat app, a decision that was suspended in a separate court case in the stateCalifornia.TECHNOLOGY Newsletter with the most important analysis and news, every Wednesday.

Facebook: Fake pages from China tried to disrupt US politicsAssociated Press Financial WireSeptember 22, 2020 Tuesday 11:17 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; DOMESTIC NEWS; POLITICAL NEWSLength: 569 wordsByline: BARBARA ORTUTAY and ERIC TUCKER, Associated PressBodyFacebook says it has removed a small network of fake accounts and pages that originated in China and focused on disrupting political activity in the U.S. and several other countries.The U.S.-focused activity was just a “sliver” of the accounts' overall activity and gained almost no following, Facebook said. Their primary focus was Southeast Asia, including the Philippines.In the U.S, the accounts posted material both in support of and against presidential candidates Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden and President Donald Trump.Facebook did not link the network directly to the Chinese government. It said the people behind the network tried to conceal their identity and location via virtual private networks and other methods.Concerns about foreign efforts to interfere in the election were underscored by a warning Tuesday from the FBI and Department of Homeland Security's cybersecurity agency that foreign actors and cybercriminals were likely to try to spread disinformation regarding the results of the election, including by creating fake websites or social media content aimed at discrediting the process. The agencies noted that even if a foreign actor managed to tamper with an election-related website, the underlying data would remain uncompromised.U.S. intelligence officials warned last month about ongoing or potential efforts by China, Russia and Iran to interfere in November's election. In an August public assessment, the country’s chief counterintelligence official, William Evanina, said officials had determined that Beijing regards Trump as unpredictable and wants to see him lose to Biden.The statement said that China had been expanding its influence operations ahead of the election to “shape the policy environment in the United States” and had been weighing the pros and cons of taking more aggressive action.Notably, though, the intelligence assessment was more specific in its characterizations of Russian interference, saying that Moscow was using a range of measures to denigrate Biden and that Kremlin-linked actors were propping up Trump’s candidacy on social media and Russian television.The question of which country poses the biggest threat to election security has emerged as a politically fraught issue.Trump and several senior administration officials have repeatedly insisted that China is more aggressive, even though that characterization is not in line with the August intelligence assessment. After FBI Director Chris Wray outlined the threat of Russian interference at a congressional hearing last week and warned of its ongoing danger, Trump harangued him on Twitter by calling China a “FAR greater threat than Russia, Russia, Russia.”Facebook said the network focused mainly on Southeast Asia, where it posted in Chinese, Filipino and English about global news and current events.These included Beijing’s interests in the South China Sea, Hong Kong, support for Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte and his daughter's potential run in that nation's 2022 presidential election, and criticism of Rappler, an independent news organization in the Philippines.Facebook also removed a second network originating in the Philippines. These accounts posted in Filipino and English about local news and events including domestic politics, military activities against terrorism, a pending anti-terrorism bill, criticism of communism, youth activists and opposition, the company said.Load-Date: September 22, 2020End of Document

Facebook takes down accounts it says were run from China and posting about 2020 electionCNN WireSeptember 22, 2020 Tuesday 8:24 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 665 wordsDateline: NEW YORK (CNN Business) BodyNEW YORK (CNN Business) --  Facebook on Tuesday said it had shut down more than 150 fake accounts it determined were run from China, including accounts posting about November's US presidential election.Facebook said the scale of the operation was small, but it is the first time the company has made public details about an operation it found to be run from China that had been posting about the US election. The accounts "posted content both in support of and against presidential candidates Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden and Donald Trump," Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of security policy, wrote in a post on the company's website. Graphika, a social media analytics company commissioned by Facebook to study the network of accounts, wrote in its report Tuesday, "In 2019-2020, the operation began running accounts that posed as Americans and posted a small amount of content about the US presidential election. Different assets supported President Donald Trump and his rival Joe Biden; one short-lived group supported former presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg. The operation did not single out either candidate for preferential treatment. Many of the accounts in this phase of the operation were barely active."Facebook did not say if the accounts were tied to the Chinese government, only that the accounts were run from China's Fujian province. The company did point out, however, that the accounts had been posting about "Beijing's interests in the South China Sea."Graphika said accounts in the network had defended Beijing. Gleicher stressed that most of the activity focused on South East Asia and only a very small amount of activity focused on the 2020 election. However, there was a sense of urgency in Facebook's announcement Tuesday.The company normally discloses takedowns like this once a month --- the next announcement is not due for another week or two.Gleicher told reporters Tuesday that given the nature of the company's findings "we thought that it was important that people should be aware of what we are seeing." Graphika said the operation exposed Tuesday began in late 2016 by posting about Taiwan. By 2018, it was posting about the Philippines and argued in favor of Chinese influence in the region. Also in 2018, the operation created a collection of pages that posted in defense of China's actions in the South China Sea.Graphika said that when the operation began to focus on the United States it "used fake accounts to pose as politically engaged users on both sides of the partisan divide." The company said the group did not build a viral following in the US. The operation included one Facebook Group called Biden Harris 2020, which had 1,700 members. "The way that it set up pages and accounts to support Trump, Biden, and Buttigieg did not suggest an attempt to support one candidate," Graphika concluded.It added: "It is possible that the intention was to further polarize America's political landscape by affirming each side's view of the other, but in that case, it is strange that the operation paid no attention to more progressive groups and candidates, such as senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren."Ben Nimmo, head of investigations at Graphika told CNN, "The US-focused content was the least and last part of the operation. It ran one group each to support President Trump, Vice President Biden and Pete Buttigieg; all together, they had under 2,000 members. Some of their fake accounts did not engage with political content at all, and liked content from the US military instead. Most of the US-focused assets were taken down when they were a few months old, so they didn't have time to build a substantial audience."Earlier this month, Facebook announced it had recieved a tip from the FBI that led it to exposing a fake leftwing news outlet posting about the 2020 election that Facebook determined was linked to people involved in a Russian troll group.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Huawei's Survival at Stake as US Sanctions LoomASEAN TribuneSeptember 14, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 ASEAN Tribune All Rights ReservedLength: 1237 wordsBody 14 September 2020 (Voice of America) China's telecom giant Huawei - once a symbol of Chinese technology prowess - will be cut off from essential supplies of semiconductors. Without those chips, Huawei cannot make the smartphones or 5G equipment on which its business depends, business analysts say.The sanctions against one of China's most successful technology companies were announced in August, when the United States introduced a new set of rules that prohibit foreign chipmakers that rely on U.S. technology from selling any chips to Huawei without first obtaining a special license.In recent weeks, suppliers from South Korea and Taiwan have all indicated they will comply with the sanctions and cease their supply of semiconductors to Huawei on Tuesday, the day the new moves against the Chinese company comes into force.'Unfortunately, in the second round of U.S. sanctions, our chip producers only accepted orders until May 15. Production of the chip will stop on Sept. 15,' Richard Yu, chief executive of Huawei's consumer business, said last month. 'Because there is no Chinese chip manufacturing industry to support, Huawei is faced with the problem of no chips.'MicrochipsFor all of China's efforts to become a global leader in high-technology, the factory of the world is yet not able to manufacture top-level contenders in one crucial area - the microchip, the nervous system that runs just about every electronic device.An important mark of a microchip's level of sophistication is how many transistors can be placed on its surface. The smaller the size, measured in nanometers, the more advanced the microchip.China's best manufacturing process is believed to be able to make 14-nanometer microchips, which are several generations behind Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). Samsung reached this standard in 2014. TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, is already making 5-nanometer chips.While some of the most advanced semiconductor manufacturers are based outside the U.S., the industry is heavily dependent upon U.S. suppliers to provide everything from design software to manufacturing equipment.Washington first placed Huawei on a trade blacklist in May 2019, citing national security concerns. However, this ban did not include most foreign-produced chips. In May, the U.S. extended the ban to cut off Huawei from its non-American suppliers, which affects China's own semiconductor companies whose market is in China.Early last month, China's leading chipmaker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), indicated it will abide by the U.S. rules and stop selling chips to Huawei. Like all of the semiconductor foundries, SMIC relies on U.S.-based companies to obtain key production equipment."The dominance of U.S.-origin technology in upstream sectors of the global semiconductor supply chain means that Chinese ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) firms across the board are exposed to U.S. export controls, regardless of what happens to SMIC or Huawei as individual companies," John Lee, a senior analyst at the Mercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS), told VOA.China's failed attemptsBeijing has a long history of angst about the country's dependence on foreign semiconductors. Its strategic planning related to this key industry dates back to the 1950s, when the State Council convened a group of scientists to develop an 'Outline for Science and Technology Development, 1956-1967,' which identified semiconductor technology as a 'key priority.'In recent decades, from the "531 Development Plan" launched in 1986 to the multibillion-dollar National Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund that was explicitly established for the chip sector in 2014, the country has poured considerable state resources into its semiconductor aspirations.A report released in July 2019 by U.S. International Trade Commission said the fund, along with provincial and municipal Integrated Circuit-related funds, are well on their way to reaching the goal of $150 billion.James Andrew Lewis, senior vice president and director of the Technology Policy Program at CSIS, told CNBC last week that China might outspend the U.S. '1,000 to 1" when it comes to investing in semiconductors.In 2016, China's President Xi Jinping noted, 'The fact that core technology is controlled by others is our greatest hidden danger.'Xi emphasized the point again last Friday when chairing a symposium of scientists on the development of science and technology during the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) period.'Some key core technologies are subject to others,' he said.Last week, in response to the new U.S. restrictions on Huawei, China announced a sweeping new set of government policies to expand its domestic semiconductor industry by providing extensive support for the next generation of semiconductors in the 14th Five-Year Plan.In hopes that key technologies from the foreign firms will get transferred to Chinese companies, Beijing has also encouraged U.S. chipmakers to form joint ventures with domestic firms. According to MERICS, the think tank based in Germany, China's quest for foreign technology at times even targets entire industries. 'Almost all of the large semiconductor enterprises in the United States have received investment offers from Chinese state actors,' a research report by MERICS said.On the other hand, Douglas Fuller, a professor at City University of Hong Kong who studies the technology industry, said China should not be viewed as a failure."There are only four firms ahead of SMIC in foundry services - two from Taiwan (TSMC and UMC), Korea's Samsung, and U.S./UAE's GloFo," Fuller told VOA in an email.As for mass manufacturing, there are only two places with the leading technology -- TSMC in Taiwan and Samsung in Korea, he said."Intel is even playing catch-up. Thus, other than Taiwan and Korea, the whole rest of the world is behind the cutting edge of manufacturing tech in this industry, including the U.S., Japan, Israel and all of Europe," said Fuller.Will Huawei survive?It remains unclear where Huawei will be able to buy its chips. Taiwanese chipmaker MediaTek said last month it had applied to the U.S. government for permission to continue supplying Huawei after new U.S. rules take effect. In the meantime, Huawei has reportedly stockpiled up to two years' worth of silicon to keep its business running."In the short term, it is difficult to see any effective options available to Chinese firms targeted by U.S. export controls on semiconductors," said Lee, whose research focuses on the rise of Chinese digital technology.As for the future, analysts say the U.S. will unlikely be able to stop China from making basic semiconductors. Given enough time, the country's vast consumer market for electronics and decades of investment will eventually make it a chip producer."In the medium to long term, China will probably be able to substitute U.S. technology and develop a complete domestic semiconductor supply chain (though whether it can catch up to foreign firms at the technological cutting edge is another issue)." Lee said in an email.James Lewis, director of the Technology Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), wrote in May that Huawei has been harmed by the U.S. effort, "but the Chinese government will not allow it to collapse - Huawei is too important."Load-Date: September 17, 2020End of Document

Chinese virologist publishes study concluding COVID-19 was conceived in Wuhan labCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 15, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 422 wordsBodyDr. Li-Meng Yan, a virologist who worked at the Hong Kong School of Public Health, has made public an article explaining how SARS-CoV-2, also known as COVID-19, could be "conveniently created" in a laboratory in just six months."Tests show that SARS-CoV-2 should be a laboratory product created by using ZC45 bat coronaviruses and/or ZXC21 as the main template or structure," reads the report published on the Zenodo portal. "Based on these tests we also propose a synthetic route for SARS-CoV-2, demonstrating that laboratory creation of this coronavirus is convenient and can be achieved in approximately six months," he adds.The document focuses on the unusual characteristics of the coronavirus genome that has caused the pandemic and suggest sophisticated laboratory modification rather than natural evolution. According to Yan, "SARS-CoV-2 shows biological characteristics that are incompatible with a natural zoonotic virus."The publication of this study comes after the virologist's interview on the British talk show Loose Women on Friday in which she insisted that the coronavirus "comes from the lab in Wuhan, which is controlled by the Chinese government." He explained, the official version that COVID-19 originated in a market is nothing more than "a smokescreen".The virologist, who claims to have conducted some of the first investigations into COVID-19 last year, has previously accused Beijing of lying and trying to cover up her work on this issue. In April, Yan fled Hong Kong fearing for his security to the United States to raise awareness of the pandemic. The virologist alleged that her former supervisors at the Hong Kong School of Public Health, a World Health Organization reference laboratory, silenced her when she sounded the alarm about the transmission of the virus among people in December last year.He also stated that before leaving China, his studies on the virus were removed from government databases. The laboratory has denied that Yan "has conducted some research on human-to-human transmission" of coronavirus and stressed that his claims "have no scientific basis."Yuan Zhiming, director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, has previously denied allegations that COVID-19 accidentally spread from its premises. For their part, a group of California virologists published an article months ago describing the genetic sequence of the virus that they say proves that "SARS-CoV-2 is neither a lab building nor a purpose-manipulated virus."commentsforum0WhatsApp  Facebook  Twitter  Linkedin       Load-Date: September 16, 2020End of Document

Hong Kong police arrest 60 for protesting on China holidayAssociated Press InternationalOctober 1, 2020 Thursday 10:04 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 370 wordsByline: ZEN SOO, Associated PressDateline: HONG KONG BodyHONG KONG (AP) — Hong Kong police arrested at least 60 people on suspicion of unauthorized assembly on China’s National Day holiday Thursday after crowds gathered on the streets of a popular shopping district chanting pro-democracy slogans.Those arrested included two district councilors, police said in a statement posted on Facebook. They said the people were arrested after they ignored repeated warnings asking them to disperse.Online calls urged people to join protests, and crowds turned up at Hong Kong's Causeway Bay shopping district, some people chanting “Disband the police” and “Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of our time," a popular pro-democracy slogan that has been banned by the Hong Kong government for alleged secessionist sentiments.A heavy police presence outnumbered the protesters at the scene.National Day, which celebrates the founding of the People's Republic of China, has become a day of protest in Hong Kong by those who oppose Beijing's increasing control over the semi-autonomous city. Large-scale protests are forbidden because of social distancing restrictions due to the coronavirus.In the afternoon, police cordoned off some areas in the district and searched people on the streets. On several occasions, they unfurled warning banners that urged protesters to disperse, saying they were participating in an illegal assembly.Protests against the Hong Kong and mainland Chinese governments swelled last year, and Beijing clamped down on expressions of anti-government sentiment in the city with a new national security law that took effect June 30.The law outlaws subversive, secessionist, and terrorist activity, as well as collusion with foreign powers to interfere in the city's internal affairs. The U.S. and Britain accuse China of infringing on the city’s freedoms, and the U.S. has imposed sanctions on government officials in Hong Kong and China over the law.At a National Day reception, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said “stability has been restored to society while national security has been safeguarded” under the new law.Lam also accused some foreign governments of holding “double standards” and leveling unjustified accusations against the authorities who implement the new law.Load-Date: October 1, 2020End of Document

INDEPENDENCE ACTIVISTS REARRESTED IN HONG KONG UNDER NATIONAL SECURITY LAWStates News ServiceOctober 27, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1412 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Hong Kong police on Tuesday rearrested pro-independence activist Tony Chung, who faces criminal charges for his views under China's draconian national security law, outside the U.S. Consulate as he tried to seek political asylum, fellow activists said."Former Studentlocalism convener Tony Chung Hon-lam has been missing since 8.00 a.m.," a statement on the Facebook page of Chung's now-disbanded Studentlocalism group said.The group later updated the post to say Chung, 19, had been among three people who were arrested, and that he had hired a lawyer.Chung had been due to report to police on Tuesday as part of his bail conditions linked to his arrest under the National Security Law for Hong Kong, which criminalizes as "secession" any form of support for independence for the city.According to the South China Morning Post, Chung's arrest came after he was denied permission to enter the U.S. Consulate.A few hours later, when news of Chung's arrest had become public, four other activists also tried to get inside the U.S. Consulate, the paper reported."The Post understands that the four, after they were seen running up Garden Road and talking to security guards at the entrance before they were allowed into the compound, were later rejected," it said, adding that it was unable to confirm the report with U.S. officials.A U.S. Consulate spokesperson declined to comment when contacted by RFA on Tuesday."We do not have anything to provide at this time," the spokesperson said.Others also arrestedFellow former Studentlocalism members William Chan and Yanni Ho were also arrested on Tuesday as they reported to police as part of their bail conditions, the Hong Kong Free Press website reported.The Apple Daily newspaper quoted U.K.-based support group Friends of Hong Kong as saying that Chung was taken away by at least four police officers from the Pacific Coffee outlet in St. John's Building close to the U.S. Consulate at around 8:15 a.m."The group was planning a rescue operation for Chung, who feared that he would be denied bail and wanted protection from the consulate," the report said. "He has been followed multiple times since he was bailed out."The group said they aren't sure of Chung's current whereabouts, but unconfirmed reports said he is being held in Central police station, the paper said.Hong Kong current affairs commentator Sang Pu said the activists were now effectively "defectors" seeking asylum on foreign soil."The situation in Hong Kong is deteriorating rapidly, and it shows that many people in Hong Kong want to escape," Sang told RFA, drawing a parallel with the daring escape of blind Chinese lawyer Chen Guangcheng from house arrest in the eastern province of Shandong.After evading recapture, Chen eventually took refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, before moving to the U.S. to live with his family following behind-the-scenes negotiations.Sang said such tactics would require safe passage from the consulate to the airport, however, something that is by no means certain amid the current national security crackdown in Hong Kong.U.K. asylum-seeker Lau Hung, a student at the Open University of Hong Kong, said many who took part in, and were arrested during, last year's protest movement, have had their passports confiscated pending trial."Now that we have seen the passage of the draconian national security law, which the Hong Kong government has used to politically persecute protesters, I think the international community needs to sanction more Hong Kong and Chinese government officials," Lau told RFA."I think governments also need to consider more types of sanctions, including trade sanctions, which would be more extensive and have a bigger impact," he said. "This would let the Hong Kong and Chinese governments know that suppressing freedom of speech and human rights comes at a price."U.K.-based rights group Hong Kong Watch condemned the rearrest of Chung, Chan, and Ho in a statement on its website.Thought crimes, harsh sentences"The National Security Law is an appalling assault on Hong Kong's fundamental freedoms and the rule of law which introduces vague thought crimes and excessive sentencing into Hong Kong's legislation," the group said."[Tuesday's] arrests are the latest example of Beijing acting in violation of international law and their human rights commitments.The group called for a special U.N. envoy for Hong Kong to monitor the human rights situation in the city."Governments should consider applying sanctions against those responsible for the rapid deterioration of human rights in the city," Hong Kong Watch said.Chung was among four young people arrested by Hong Kong police on July 26 on suspicion of "secession" under the national security law, which took effect on July 1.The arrestees aged from 16 to 21 were taken into custody in raids in the New Territories districts of Yuen Long, Shatin, and Tuen Mun on suspicion of "organizing and inciting secessionist activities."Police said they were suspected of posting announcements online calling on people to fight to establish a "Hong Kong nation," of declaring that they would use all necessary means to achieve this end, and of calling for pro-independence groups to unite.Studentlocalism disbanded ahead of the law's implementation, but as the posts were made after the new law took effect, they fell under articles in the law banning "incitement" to secessionist activities, police said at the time.Footage of Chung's arrest shared online showed a plainclothes national security officer identifying himself, before leading Chung to a vehicle with his hands behind his back.Broken promisesUnder the terms of the 1997 handover agreement, Hong Kong was promised the maintenance of its traditional freedoms of speech and association, as well as universal suffrage.But Beijing's ruling out of fully democratic elections in 2014, its insistence on the prosecution and disqualification of key opposition figures, and its subsequent imposition of the National Security Law following months of popular protests over diminishing freedoms have collapsed the distinction between the city and the rest of mainland China, rights groups and overseas governments say.The vaguely worded new security law threatens anyone criticizing the Chinese or Hong Kong authorities anywhere in the world.The law prompted many nations including Britain, Canada, Australia, Germany, Finland, France, and New Zealand to end their extradition arrangements with Hong Kong. They were followed last week by Ireland and the Netherlands.Currently, the Czech Republic and Portugal are the only EU member states to maintain extradition agreements with Hong Kong.The European Union said at the end of July that it would adopt a series of coordinated and consistent measures to deal with Hong Kong's national security law, including possible sanctions on Hong Kong, although no new developments have been reported since from Brussels.Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney announced an end to extradition to Hong Kong on Oct. 13, saying it was in line with action taken by other EU member states.The Netherlands' ministry of foreign affairs followed suit on Oct. 15, calling for joint EU actions when dealing with China.The U.S., which revoked Hong Kong's special trading privileges after the law took effect, has indicated it will do the same.Law 'devastating' to rights protectionsChina's feared state security police have now set up a headquarters in the city to implement the law, while the government has warned that slogans linked to last year's protest movement, including "Free Hong Kong, Revolution Now!", will fall within the law's remit.The New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) said the law will be "devastating" to human rights protections in the city.It has created specialized secret security agencies, denied fair trial rights, provided sweeping new powers to police, increased restraints on civil society and the media, and weakened judicial oversight, the group said in a recent report on its website.The law will also affect the right to education and freedom of information, opinion, and expression in schools, as political statements and discussions are banned from the city's classrooms, and as books by pro-democracy figures are removed from its public libraries.Reported by Lu Xi, Lau Siu-fung and Cai Ling for RFA's Mandarin and Cantonese Services.

Detention of CGTN anchor shows that in Xi Jinping's China, not even the propagandists are safeCNN WireSeptember 1, 2020 Tuesday 3:48 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1066 wordsDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  In Cheng Lei's last WeChat post before she disappeared, the Chinese state TV host posed in a bright green dress on a Shake Shack-branded rickshaw outside the newly opened Beijing branch of the American restaurant chain. That was on August 12. Cheng, an Australian citizen, hasn't been seen since. On Monday, Canberra said that it had received a "formal notification" of her detention, two days after her last-known social media post. It is unclear what exactly prompted Cheng's detention. She was a veteran business anchor for state broadcaster CGTN, which has since scrubbed all reference of her from its website and social media. CGTN is the international arm of CCTV, one of the most important propaganda outlets in China, carrying all major government and Communist Party events and announcements. Unlike the more strident or nationalist tone taken in some print media backed by the Chinese state, CCTV, and especially the English-language CGTN, has traditionally been more restrained. In her spare time, Cheng was active in the Australian community in Beijing, taking part in events at the Australian Chamber of Commerce and acting as an "alumni ambassador" for the country's embassy. Speaking to Sydney radio station 2GB Tuesday, Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne could not say why Cheng has been detained since August 14, but described the idea that Cheng could be used by China as a pawn in the deteriorating relationship between the two countries as "speculative at best."The relationship between Australia and China has frayed in recent months after Canberra called for an investigation into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, and the countries have engaged in tit-for-tat trade restrictions. That has led some in the Australian media to speculate that Cheng's detention could be political in nature, comparing it to the seizure in December 2018 of Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, after their government detained Chinese business executive Meng Wanzhou on behalf of the US. Kovrig and Spavor were finally charged with spying in June 2020, over a year after they were first detained. They have been denied access to their families, lawyers and consular officials for months at a time. CGTN did not respond to a request to comment. Asked for comment at a press briefing on Tuesday, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Hua Chunying said: "I have no specific information for you. China is a country under the rule of law, and we will act in accordance with the law."While details on the case are still scant, there are apparent indications that Cheng is being held for reasons not related to standard criminal charges. According to the ABC, the Australian broadcaster that first reported her disappearance, Cheng is being held under what is known as "residential surveillance at a designated location (RSDL)," a system by which people can be detained without charge for up to six months. This matches comments made by Payne on Tuesday, who said that Cheng was being detained without charge and could be held "for months." A source with knowledge of the situation said Cheng was being held at a detention facility.RSDL, which was added to China's criminal procedural law in 2012, essentially legalized the practice of so-called "black jails," detention centers where dissidents and activists were often held for months on end without charge in a bid to solicit specific information, or to gain political leverage. Former detainees who went through RSDL have spoken of being denied access to their families and lawyers, threatened with torture and strong-armed into signing false confessions. Since RSDL was first legalized, it has been used widely against dissidents, government officials, and foreign nationals. It's just one of several means of detention the Chinese authorities have to go after those who challenge them politically. Communist Party members have for years faced the threat of extralegal detention and potential torture in a dedicated system known as Shuanggui set up for going after allegedly corrupt cadres. Officials often disappear into the system for months at a time, emerging white haired and haggard to confess to a series of offenses ahead of a criminal trial. Since 2018, that system has been formalized and extended far beyond the membership of the Party itself as the National Supervisory Commission, under the principle of "expanding the punishment of the few to manage the many." Purportedly an anti-corruption body, the NSC exists outside the judicial system and has been criticized for curtailing the already limited rights available to those accused of crimes in China.Commanded to arm their minds with Xi Jinping Thought and consider the Party their family, Cheng wouldn't be the first Chinese state media employee to fall afoul of the authorities and end up in some arm of the sprawling detention apparatus. In 2014, Rui Chenggang, one of the best known faces on CCTV, was detained on corruption charges. Rui's ultimate fate still remains unclear, with some reports suggesting he was sentenced to six years in prison. Outside the state media system, many journalists have been prosecuted for their work, and China remains the largest jailer of reporters in the world. Those already limited press freedoms have shrunk even more in recent months, with the expulsion of multiple foreign reporters and additional restrictions on Chinese journalists in how they cover the coronavirus pandemic. While Cheng's own reporting for CGTN focused on fairly bland business news, she did occasionally write public posts on Facebook about more sensitive topics, including some which were mildly critical of China's response to the coronavirus and censorship of online criticism. Before joining the network, she was a journalist for CNBC.Her disappearance, and the many questions around it, demonstrates that even those within the propaganda apparatus can step over the invisible red lines that govern life in Xi Jinping's China, and have their lives upended. Mei Fong, a former Wall Street Journal reporter in Beijing, wrote on Twitter that with regard to Cheng's detention, "the question probably every foreign journalist reporting in China is asking: if Beijing can detain a journalist reporting for 'safe' CGTN, how safe am I?" TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Trump says he won't extend the sale of TikTok's U.S. operationsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 10, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 532 wordsBodyDonald Trump said tonight that he will not extend the September 15 deadline for China's ByteDance to sell the Business of Chinese short-lived video app TikTok in the United States. Either we take tiktok down in this country for security reasons, or it's going to have to be sold, the U.S. president said, quoted by Bloomberg, when he spoke to reporters before getting on board the presidential plane for a campaign trip to Michigan.            Read Also TikTok Owner is evaluating options to avoid selling in the U.S.                 It is recalled that on August 3, Trump declared that the Chinese video-sharing app would cease to work in the United States if it was not sold to a U.S. company by September 15.             Read Also United States admit banning Chinese apps beyond TikTok                In recent times, US policymakers have been expressing fears about the app, with many of them saying it could pose national security risks due to data that may pass on to China and propaganda that may come to the contrary.  According to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, it is concerned that Chinese technology with a Presence in the U.S. will provide data to the Beijing authorities.            Read Also Negotiations for sale of TikTok's U.S. business get complicated                 Two days ago, The Wall Street Journal reported that the owner of Chinese short-lived video app TikTok was evaluating options that did not include the full sale of its U.S. operations, but Trump is irreducible.             Read Also Microsoft and Walmart compete with Oracle and make offer by TikTok                The talks on this possibility have been going on for months but have taken on a greater urgency since the Chinese government took steps that make a sale more difficult, sources close to the process told the WSJ. Earlier this month, the WSJ said, quoted by Lusa, that negotiations for the sale of TikTok's operations in the United States had been complicated by the question of whether the application's core algorithms could be included in the deal. These algorithms decide which videos users see without first requiring them to follow other users or specify their preferences.According to the U.S. newspaper, the algorithms were integrated into the business until August 28 when the Chinese government introduced restrictions on the export of artificial intelligence technology, such as the one that powers TikTok.The Chinese decision followed Trump's efforts to force the sale of TikTok in the U.S., where the app has 100 million users. These export restrictions mean that ByteDance will need to obtain a license to export any restricted technology to a foreign company. The question is whether its algorithms need the approval of the Chinese government to be transferred and, if so, whether Beijing will authorize the transfer, Lusa stressed.Among those interested in buying TikTok's U.S. operations is the Microsoft-Walmart duo.Microsoft's intention to buy TikTok in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand had been known for weeks, and then joined forces with Walmart. But the duo are not alone in the race: Oracle and Twitter have already been referred to as potential buyers.Load-Date: September 11, 2020End of Document

Here's what we know about TikTok's US sales dealCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 17, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 637 wordsBodyWith just a few days for President Donald Trump's ban on TikTok to take effect in the United States, the race is underway for Chinese video sharing app owner ByteDance to get his plan approved to avoid closure.Technology giant Oracle has emerged as the partner chosen by the Beijing-based company for an agreement, beating Microsoft. But instead of a direct sale as Trump ordered, the agreement on the table gives Oracle only a minority stake in a company that will continue to be controlled by ByteDance.However, Oracle's offer by TikTok does not address the concerns of Trump administration officials that the video sharing app poses a risk to US national security, according to people familiar with the issue.Trump has the authority to endorse an agreement, but continued concerns from national security officials could influence his decision. The agreement remains on the table, and discussions continue between administration officials and companies, people said, who asked not to be identified. Addressing these outstanding issues could pave the way for US approval.Much remains to be decided before the September 20 deadline. Here's a rundown of the process.What we knowWho comes in and who comes outOracle confirmed in a brief statement Monday that it is part of ByteDance's proposal to the US Treasury Department. The statement was light in detail, but referred to Oracle as the company's "reliable technology provider." Microsoft, the former alleged favorite, said his offer had been rejected.How the deal is observedThe transaction is considered a corporate restructuring. People familiar with the plan have said Oracle would make an investment in TikTok, along with ByteDance's existing shareholders, including General Atlantic, Sequoia Capital and Coatue Capital. Oracle would store user data in the US. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has referred to the new entity that would come out of this agreement as "TikTok Global," and said the company would be based in the US and create 20,000 jobs. Oracle would try to use this promise as a way to get approval.What Trump thinks... Now  The president said the deal is "very close," and that Oracle founder Larry Ellison has been "really a fantastic guy."Trump won't get his paymentThe President has insisted that any agreement should include a substantial payment for his country, but the current guidelines do not include it.What we don't knowThe exact terms While Oracle and some shareholders are likely to invest, it is unclear which part of the new TikTok entity they would own. Walmart's role is unknown: the retail giant had partnered with Microsoft as part of its proposal, but has since said it remains in talks with ByteDance.Nationalsecurity r evisionNational security experts have noted that the agreement does not satisfy the concerns expressed by the Trump administration in executive orders. However, even if officials recommend that Trump block the deal, the president has the final say.The time it will endAn agreement was initially required for September 15, but TikTok's US operating ban that Trump signed last month in an attempt to force a sale requires the company to act before September 20. A separate decision of the Foreign Investment Committee requires a sale in mid-November.What about the algorithms?ByteDance has decided that it will not sell or transfer the algorithm, according to the South China Morning Post, but the US-based company's technology team would be free to develop a new algorithm.What China thinksThe Chinese government will also have to approve ByteDance's plans under the new restrictions Beijing imposed on the export of AI technologies. ByteDance has said it will "strictly comply" with the new regulations.What's next?Both the US national security panel and the Department of Commerce should look at the agreement.Load-Date: September 18, 2020End of Document

Is TikTok a Threat to National Security?The Outlook: Monmouth UniversitySeptember 30, 2020 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICS; Pg. 1Length: 958 wordsBodyPoliticsIs TikTok a Threat to National Security?• " onclick="window.open(this.href,'win2','status=no,toolbar=no,scrollbars=yes,titlebar=no,menubar=no,resizable=yes,width=640,height=480,directories=no,location=no'); return false;" rel="nofollow"> Print• EmailDetailsCategory: Volume 93 (Fall 2020 - Spring 2021)Published: 30 September 2020Written by GEORGEANNE NIGRO | ASSOCIATE POLITICS EDITORPresident Donald Trump has been trying to make a deal to either ban the extremely popular app TikTok from the United States or remove the app from the control of the Chinese Government, since July.Donna Dolphin, an Associate Professor of Communication, explained that the official justification of the Trump Administration for blocking or controlling the TikTok app is that it is owned and operated by the Chinese government, which is hostile to the United States."Because of the way the app functions, it is easily possible for the operator to access additional personal data. In other words, it is possible for the TikTok app to be used as an instrument for espionage," said Dolphin.Using TikTok on a personal devise is not a threat to national security, but accessing the app on a devise that also stores secure or classified communication might pose a threat. "The solution seems pretty simple, don't use TikTok on a device that is also used for secure communication," Dolphin said.Agreeably, Randall S. Abate, Professor of Political Science and Sociology, explained that there are genuine privacy and security concerns at stake in Trump's effort to ban TikTok. "These concerns aren't 'traditional' national security concerns but focus rather on data security and data privacy."Like other social media platforms, TikTok collects data on its users, so "the national security issue here is premised on a fear that the Chinese government may be able to access this data and potentially leverage it to engage in espionage or spread damaging misinformation," Abate said.However, Dolphin cited a potential ulterior motive for the Trump Administration's desired TikTok ban. When Trump held his first, in-person rally, after the pandemic limited gatherings, attendance was sparse although the expectation was the event had sold out. The rumor is that young people used TikTok to start a movement to reserve all the tickets so the event would not succeed, Dolphin explained, although she is unsure of the rumor's validity."The theory related to this rumor is that young people effectively demonstrated their political power and did so in a way that used the power of being digital natives and part of a youth movement. In this vein of thought, the Administration is attempting to shut down the line of communication to undermine the power of politically aware young people," Dolphin concluded.Abate said that Trump was motivated to ban the app simply because of national security and privacy concerned. "[Trump's] Executive Order last month on this matter sought to ban TikTok based on his concern that the app 'potentially allows China to track the locations of federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage'," said Abate.He further explained that Trump's authority for this response is grounded in the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which grants the president authority to ban transactions between U.S. and foreign entities. This legal authority also provides the president with significant discretion to determine and declare "national emergencies."Robert Scott, Specialist Professor of Communication, explained that since people are more reliant on technologies and its services for a wide range of applications, so "Big Tech" is rapidly gaining power, bringing scrutiny on tech giants like Apple, Facebook, Google, and Twitter, globally, leading to antitrust issues and privacy and security concerns about user data.Social media platforms and telecommunications companies in particular, have played a major role in this equation, bolstering concerns about espionage, the expansion of misinformation, political sabotage, and hate speech, Scott clarified. There are numerous outside nations and organizations that are closely monitored by U.S. security agencies, including the Kremlin-backed Internet Research Agency in Russia and Chinese tech powerhouses such as ByteDance, Tencent Holdings, and Huawei."The Trump administration's concerns regarding these Chinese companies are said to primarily involve national security but are also related to ongoing strained trade relations between the two nations. There are concerns that mobile hardware from Huawei, and social apps such as ByteDance's TikTok and Tencent's WeChat could be used by the Chinese government to track U.S. citizens and government officials," said Scott.He concluded that they could also potentially be used by agencies seeking to manipulate political elections through disinformation campaigns and hackers looking to collect personal user data, proprietary corporate secrets, and classified government or military information.Kristen Kane, a Senior Criminal Justice and Homeland Security student, agrees with the ban on TikTok. "I agree with [Scott's] view to ban TikTok as it creates an international risk to the country's national security. However, I am someone who loves the app and enjoys using TikTok," she said."I feel there are other ways to minimize these vulnerabilities, without banning the app. One of these ways is having an ally or nationally owned company partner in TikTok ownership, which has happened," said Kane.The ban on TikTok could promote safety as it will disallow ByteDance access into American users' personal information, Kane acknowledged.IMAGE TAKEN from CGTNI• Prev• NextLoad-Date: October 1, 2020End of Document

ESPER SAYS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WILL CHANGE THE BATTLEFIELDUS Fed NewsSeptember 10, 2020 Thursday 5:11 PM  ESTCopyright 2020 HT Media Ltd. All Rights ReservedLength: 1059 wordsBodyWASHINGTON, DC, Sept. 10 -- The U.S. Department of Defense's Pacific Command issued the following press release:One aspect of the return of great power competition is the race to develop artificial intelligence, Defense Secretary Dr. Mark T. Esper said at the virtual Joint Artificial Intelligence Center symposium.Artificial intelligence has the potential to change the battlefield, and the country that's first to field it will have enormous advantages over competitors, he told participants today."History informs us that those who are first to harness once-in-a-generation technologies often have a decisive advantage on the battlefield for years to come," the secretary said. "I experienced this firsthand during Operation Desert Storm, when the United States' military's smart bombs, stealth aircraft and satellite-enabled GPS helped decimate Iraqi forces and their Soviet equipment."Artificial intelligence has the potential to be even more far-reaching than those technologies. "Unlike advanced munitions or next-generation platforms, artificial intelligence is in a league of its own, with the potential to transform nearly every aspect of the battlefield, from the back office to the front lines," he said. "That is why we cannot afford to cede the high ground to revisionist powers intent on bending, breaking or reshaping international rules and norms in their favor - to the collective detriment of others."Esper noted that Russian President Vladimir Putin said the nation that leads in AI will be the "ruler of the world," and Russia has increased investments in the technology. "His intent is to employ any possible advantage to expand Russia's influence and chip away at the sovereignty of others," Esper said.The Russians used a sophisticated and well-coordinated combination of unmanned aerial vehicles, cyberattacks, and artillery barrages to inflict severe damage on Ukrainian forces when they invaded that country. "Since then, Moscow has announced the development of AI-enabled autonomous systems across ground vehicles, aircraft, nuclear submarines and command and control," he said. "We expect them to deploy these capabilities in future combat zones."The Chinese Communist Party has a goal of being the AI world leader in 10 years. The People's Liberation Army sees AI as a leap-frog technology that will allow the largest military on Earth to field low-cost, long-range autonomous vehicles and systems to counter America's conventional power projection. "At this moment, Chinese weapons manufacturers are selling autonomous drones they claim can conduct lethal, targeted strikes," the secretary said. "Meanwhile, the Chinese government is advancing the development of next-generation stealth UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicle], which they are preparing to export internationally.""Beijing is constructing a 21st-century surveillance state designed to wield unprecedented control over its own people," Esper said. "With hundreds of millions of cameras strategically located across the country and billions of data points generated by the Chinese Internet of Things, the CCP will soon be able to identify almost anyone entering a public space, and censor dissent in real time."The Chinese system can be used to invade private lives, leaving no text message, internet search, purchase or personal activity free from Beijing's ever tightening grip, the secretary said. "As we speak, the PRC is deploying - and honing - its AI surveillance apparatus to support the targeted repression of its Muslim Uighur population," he said. "Likewise, pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong are being identified, seized, imprisoned or worse by the CCP's digital police state - unencumbered by privacy laws or ethical governing principles. As China scales this technology, we fully expect it to sell these capabilities abroad, enabling other autocratic governments to move toward a new era of digital authoritarianism."The U.S. is pioneering a vision for the emerging technology that protects the U.S. Constitution and the rights of all Americans. U.S. officials would like to see allies and partners adopt the standards of individual liberty, democracy, human rights and respect for the rule of law.The Chinese Communist Party has a goal of being the AI world leader in 10 years.

TELECONFERENCE - KEITH KRACH, UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE AND BONNIE GLICK, DEPUTY ADMIN. OF THE U.S. AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (USAID)US Fed NewsOctober 30, 2020 Friday 12:57 PM  ESTCopyright 2020 HT Media Ltd. All Rights ReservedLength: 4895 wordsBodyWASHINGTON, Oct. 30 -- The U.S. Department of State's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons issued the following press release:Asia Pacific Media HubModerator: Good day, everyone, from the U.S. Department of State's Asia-Pacific Media Hub in Manila. I am Zia Syed, the Hub Director, and I would like to welcome our participants dialing in for this briefing.Today we are very pleased to be joined from Washington, D.C. - Keith Krach, Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment, and Bonnie Glick, Deputy Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID. We'll begin today's call with opening remarks from Under Secretary Krach and Deputy Administrator Glick. We will try to get to as many questions as we can during the time that we have, which is approximately 35 minutes.Finally, as a reminder, today's call is on the record. And with that, I will turn it over first to Under Secretary Krach.Under Secretary Krach: Thanks so much, and it's great to be here with you all today to talk about my favorite subject, and that's the digital economy. Because now more than ever, almost every aspect of our economies are impacted by technology, and the pandemic has only accelerated the transition to digital commerce and digital everything.While technologies like 5G are creating tremendous growth opportunities, they also increase the risk posed by untrusted countries and companies, especially those beholden to authoritarian governments like the Chinese Communist Party. I think the year 2020 will go down in history as the year that the CCP was exposed for what it truly is. It's not what the world hoped for. Consider its rap sheet for the year: the concealment of the pandemic; the co-option of Hong Kong and eviscerating its freedoms; the human rights abuses in Xinjiang; the skirmishes at the Indian border; and then of course the activity around Taiwan.I just got back from a couple of trips through 16 countries, and one thing I can tell you is the citizens don't like it. And I think this has given the political will to government leaders and CEOs everywhere to stand up to the China bully and its tactics of intimidation and retaliation. Here in Washington, this is the most unifying bipartisan issue of our time -- Democrats and Republicans alike -- for a long time.And the world is also waking up to the dangers of entrusting our critical 5G networks to untrusted, high-risk vendors. But the good news is, the tide has turned against the CCP with the announcement of the Clean Network just a few months ago. And the Clean Network is a comprehensive approach to addressing the long-term threats to data privacy, security, human rights, and trusted collaboration posed by the Chinese Communist Party. It's rooted in internationally accepted digital trust standards, and it represents the execution of a multi-year, enduring strategy built on a growing coalition of over 49 Clean Countries, 170 clean telcos, and leading companies around the world like Oracle, HP, Reliance Jio, NEC, Fujitsu, Rakuten, Cisco, SoftBank, VMware, and many others. I think the key to the Clean Network's rapid success is that it provides strength in numbers and power in unity and solidarity to stand up to the CCP's bullying tactics of intimidation and retaliation.I think we've all experienced bullies sometime in our life. And if there's anything I've learned, when you confront bullies, they back down. And they really back down when you have your friends by your side, and 49 Clean Countries and 170 clean telcos -- plus a ton of industry-leading companies -- are a lot of friends.In the Indo-Pacific region, Australia, Japan, Vietnam, Taiwan - they're all members of the Clean Network. And all of the top telcos in Singapore, India, and also in Korea - KT and SK are clean telcos and all members of the Clean Network. And just last week, the Clean Network was endorsed at the annual Three Seas summit. Now 11 out of the 12 Three Seas countries are members of the Clean Network. And already, 31 of the 37 OECD countries are members. In Europe, 27 of the 30 NATO countries are members of the Clean Network, and 25 of the 27 European Union nations are members of the Clean Network. And just in a few short months, two-thirds of the world's GDP is represented on the Clean Network.And the Clean Network is about more than just 5G. It covers everything from electrical grids to autonomous vehicles, cloud computing, apps on your phone, clean underwater cables, clean app stores, and clean internet of things, and more. It includes lines of efforts also, such as clean supply chains, clean investments, clean financing, clean labor practices, which are focused on standing up to those human rights abuses in China. And I think all of us - governments, business, civil society, and I think especially the press - can continue to turn that tide against authoritarianism in the favor of freedom and security. There's no sustainable prosperity without liberty. We appreciate your help in spreading that word.Now let me turn to my good friend and partner, Deputy Administrator Bonnie Glick from USAID. And she has a few words to share. Bonnie, take it away.Deputy Administrator Glick: Thank you, Keith, so much. And thank you all for letting me speak to you a little bit about what USAID, the U.S. Agency for International Development, is doing jointly with the private sector in the Indo-Pacific region.At USAID, we prioritize working with the private sector to pursue market-based and enterprise-driven solutions to today's development challenges. And we do this also because, by joining with the private sector, we're also looking toward the development challenges and solutions of the future. Because private enterprise and free markets offer countries a powerful tool to help achieve self-reliance and prosperity.Since last year's Indo-Pacific Business Forum (IPBF), which was in Bangkok, USAID has dedicated $250 million to expand partnerships with governments, civil society, and the private sector in countries across the Indo-Pacific region in support of economic growth activities including energy, infrastructure, digital connectivity, and trade. These partnerships work to advance the U.S. Government's vision for a prosperous, free, and open Indo-Pacific region.One example of this type of partnership is the new, five-year, $36 million program in Vietnam to advance Vietnam's energy security further. This investment will build on our past success working with policymakers, regulators, and businesses to accelerate Vietnam's transition to clean energy. Vietnam is massively increasing its solar energy production. In 2017, solar power was less than 2 percent of Vietnam's total power generation. But by the end of 2019, solar exceeded 10 percent of the country's total power generation. That's just in two years.In the remarks that I gave in the panel where Keith and I last spoke together on the digital economy at the opening of the Indo-Pacific Business Forum, I highlighted how USAID is a global leader in promoting the adoption by emerging economies of open, inclusive, and secure digital ecosystems such as those that are championed by the growing coalition of like-minded countries, companies, and telcos that the Under Secretary referenced as part of the Clean Network.I also highlighted some of USAID's work in this area, including the leading role that we played in delivering reliable, secure digital connectivity for Palau under the Trilateral Partnership for Infrastructure Development between the United States, Australia, and Japan.It's impossible not to recognize at this year's Indo-Pacific Business Forum how COVID-19 has affected all of us in government and in business. In the Indo-Pacific, the garment industry has suffered immensely. I announced a new memorandum of understanding with a consortium of U.S. retail, apparel, and footwear companies and industry associations to help supply chain workers -- most of whom are women -- in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, and Cambodia. We're aiming to foster a more resilient sector, enhance energy worker rights and welfare, and empower women workers.I'd also like to remind everyone of the Blue Dot Network, announced at last year's second Indo-Pacific Business Forum in Bangkok. The Blue Dot Network brings together governments, the private sector, and civil society engaged in infrastructure development. The Blue Dot Network will serve as a globally recognized symbol of market-driven, transparent, and financially sustainable development projects.So, you've heard a little bit now about the development work that we've been involved in over the past year in the Indo-Pacific region, and I look forward to your questions. Thank you so much.Moderator: Thank you very much. We will now begin the question and answer portion of today's call.We will go ahead and start the questions with Dong Hyun Kim from the Voice of America Korean Service, who I believe is calling in from Washington, D.C.Question: Yes, this is Dong Hyun Kim from Voice of America Korean Service in D.C. I have a question to the Under Secretary. You mentioned South Korea. Actually, the South Korean Government, there is one vendor that still is sticking on Huawei. And the South Korean Government actually explained that this is a private matter, that the government cannot intervene. What is your take on that? And there's also a prospect that U.S. is considering a possible option of secondary boycott to nations or private companies that does not cooperate on this initiative. How do you see a response to that speculation? Thank you.Under Secretary Krach: The way we would look at it is that we respect the country of [South] Korea, and we respect their decisions. At the end of the day, I think it's all about trust. And the good news is that this is playing out, and more and more countries and companies are asking the Question: Who do we trust with our precious personal information? Who do we trust with our customers' most sensitive data and our most valuable intellectual property? And the answer is more and more coming back: it's certainly not a company like Huawei, who's the backbone of the Chinese Communist Party's surveillance state. And certainly not a country that has a National Intelligence Act that says any Chinese company, state-owned or otherwise, or any Chinese citizen is required to hand over any information, proprietary technology, intellectual property, or data upon request to the Chinese Communist Party or the People's Librarian Army -- or you're going to suffer the consequences, which are pretty severe.And this is a big issue for the U.S. private sector as well as a lot of the other private sectors in different countries, particularly the innovation sector. Because when you look at these companies like Oracle and HP and so forth, that are on that Clean Network, what they're saying is that in order to expand our operations - to enter a country, we can't put our intellectual property at risk. We can't put our proprietary technology at risk.So, I think there's consequences with regard to a private sector's investment in that. And I think also -- let alone Huawei's running out of its most sophisticated chips for their smartphones, and they're running out of chips for 5G due to export controls, and I think that's had a dramatic effect on their business.And the other thing, too, is I think countries have seen retaliation from China, and companies have too. When the UK made that famous decision to reconsider letting Huawei in the 5G networks, and immediately Beijing threatened the HSBC British bank and then the Chinese ambassador to the UK threatened the $100 billion Chinese investment in that railway in northern England. And that's when Secretary Pompeo shouted out: We stand with the UK. We stand with our friends. We stand with our allies against the China bully. And Korea's seen that retaliation before, and we stand with them.As a matter of fact, the Swedish post and telecom authority, based on assessments by the Swedish military and security service, said that in Sweden, the four wireless carriers for their 5G networks cannot use Huawei or ZTE in wireless - in their telco infrastructure. And if they have any of that, they have to rip it out; they have to rip Huawei and ZTE out.And then today, the foreign minister of China told Sweden: If you don't reverse your course, we're going to have a negative impact on bilateral trade and the operation of Swedish companies in China. So once again, we stand with them because at the end of the day, democracies around the world are the vanguards for this epic battle of freedom versus authoritarianism. Thank you for the question.Moderator: Thank you very much. Next if we could go to Wenshin Chang from United Daily News Group calling in from Washington, D.C.Question: Yes, thank you. This is Wenshin Chang of United Daily News Group. I have a couple of questions to the Under Secretary about the U.S.-Taiwan economic and commercial dialogue which is led by you. Well, it happened this year. Would you provide more details, for example, about the talking points or the timing about a next dialogue? Thank you.Under Secretary Krach: Yes, well, I went to Taiwan a little over four weeks ago for President Lee's funeral. As you know, I was the highest-ranking State Department official since 1979. So, my purpose was to honor President Lee. But we also had some great discussions about economic collaboration in areas like digital, energy, infrastructure, semiconductors, supply lines, and all of that, and met with a number of their CEOs. I had dinner with the president as well as Morris Chang, the chairman of TSMC. So, it was really talking about how do we tighten these bonds of collaboration. And so, we're working together in a number of areas.And I think that Taiwan is, to the United States and to many other countries, just a great friend, a great ally. They're also a role model in the region as well as around the world for a great democracy, as well as capitalism. I mean, these guys are outstanding. After I was the vice president of General Motors, I built companies in Silicon Valley for 30 years, and Taiwan was always [great] to do business with. Thank you so much for that question.Moderator: Thank you very much. I'm going to pass you a question that we received in advance. We received a question for Ludi Escolano from Greenfields Magazine here in the Philippines, and his question was if you could speak a little bit about any IPBF discussions that were held or any agreements reached with regards to the overall digital economy. If you could please respond to that question. Thank you.Under Secretary Krach: Yes. By the way, there are a lot of discussions going on, a lot of discussions on the margins. One of the great ones that I had was a CEO roundtable with a number of companies talking about how the U.S. can further invest in the Indo-Pacific area, and what are the tools that we can bring to the region. And so we talked a lot about the Development Finance Corporation, how we increased that from 30 billion to 60 billion and also be able to take equity, and it's for all kinds of infrastructure, including IT infrastructure. And the United States doesn't have to be the nexus of the project. In other words, you could have a Vietnamese or Philippine [citizen] be the project manager and the prime contractor on it. And then I'm going to let Bonnie talk a little about USAID, because it's a very powerful force in the region.We also talked about the Export-Import Bank and how we've rejuvenated that, and the capabilities there. We also talked a lot about how the U.S., and actually a lot of European countries are no longer investing in production capacity or manufacturing in China. As a matter of fact, a lot of those companies are pulling their supply chains out. And that represents a great opportunity for all the countries in the region. And here again, it comes back to you want to make sure that there's trusted infrastructure there, so it's important that these countries and telcos are members of the Clean Network.So, Bonnie, I know you participated in a lot of that, and talk about that, and then also about USAID and some of the things you're doing along those lines.Deputy Administrator Glick: Sure, and Keith, thanks. As all of you know, when the U.S. Government comes to the table, we come as a whole-of-government approach to whatever the issue happens to be. One of the reasons that Keith and I get along so well is that we carry each other's water along the way to advance the interests of the Clean Network, and to - which is in - fundamentally advancing [inaudible] U.S. interests.One of the things that I participated in during the Indo-Pacific Business Forum along with the Under Secretary was this panel discussion with senior executives from Google and AT&T and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the U.S. Trade and Development Agency. And in this conversation, across the board, we were talking about what the significance is of investing in the digital economies of Indo-Pacific countries. And the fundamental bottom line in all of it is the level of investment that is open and ready for -- just to meet current needs, which is over $2 trillion by 2030. That's to meet what is projected to be the regular needs -- not to expand beyond that. So, imagine that growing exponentially, which is probably what is likely to happen.So, when you're talking about in the next 10 years -- $2.3 trillion of investment -- you're not talking about this being something that the U.S. Government alone is going to invest in. USAID jointly, with our other agency partners like the State Department, the Commerce Department, Export-Import Bank, the Development Finance Corporation -- we will play a role in this. But what we like to highlight is the critical role that's going to be played by the private sector. And in developing countries in the region, the type of development that we're talking about for digital economies is going to be enterprise-driven and market-based growth, where the private sector will play a primary role.Where AID and where foreign assistance comes in and where the Development Finance Corporation comes in is to provide loan guarantees, first-loss capabilities, as well as other investment incentives to leverage in, and crowd in, 10x, 20x times the amount of funding that we're providing to come in from the private sector and from private investors.So, the key for all of you to be aware is we're open for business, we bring business with us, and the concept of an open, free, and reliable digital economy in the Indo-Pacific is critical for the world's economic advancement. The key to this being free and open, secure, and reliable. And the more countries, companies, and telecommunications companies that join the Clean Network, the better the momentum is to push for these internationally recognized, trusted standards.Moderator: Thank you very much. We have probably another 10 minutes or so. I'll ask one more question that we received in advance. Perhaps I'll also direct it towards the Deputy Administrator. We received a question from Monira Munni from The Financial Express in Bangladesh, and Monira was asking: "Will you kindly elaborate on the MOU signed between USAID and U.S. retail, garment, and footwear companies, regarding how the workers are to be supported in Bangladesh?" If you could provide us some details on the situation.And also, let me just mention this as well, we received another question on a related matter from Bangladesh saying, "How did the IPBF discuss matters of Chinese involvement and interference in Bangladesh and other countries?" Okay, please go ahead.Deputy Administrator Glick: Sure thing. I'll address first the MOU announcement. I announced a new memorandum of understanding that was with a consortium of U.S. retail, apparel, and footwear companies and industry associations with an eye toward helping supply chain workers, most of whom are women, in Bangladesh, in Sri Lanka, Vietnam, and Cambodia. These are countries that rely heavily for their growth in income on the garment industry, and this is a sector that was particularly hard-hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.So COVID-19 has had a devastating impact on global supply chains. It has disrupted trade and investment. It has put frontline workers at risk and eliminated the jobs of millions of other workers, especially women, and it has done so with unprecedented speed and scale. The apparel, footwear and fashion accessories sector in Asia has been among the most affected industries challenged by supply-and-demand constraints that arose from stay-at-home orders, temporary business closures, production stoppages, backlogs in shipment, cargo delays, and other things.The MOU that we signed establishes an intent to work together over the coming year on efforts that will help alleviate hardships faced by the predominantly women workers in the companies' supply chains in these four countries. And these efforts, in collaboration with local partners, are aimed to help to foster a more resilient sector and workforce. It will enhance factory worker rights and welfare, and it will better empower women workers.So, what's important for everyone to understand and know is who the participating companies and industry associations are that we are partnering with through this MOU. They are Carter's Incorporated, Gap Incorporated, Global Brands Group, Levi Strauss & Co, Nike, Tapestry, Target, VF Corporation (that's V like victory, F like francisco Corporation), Walmart, American Apparel and Footwear Association, the National Retail Federation, the Retail Industry Leaders Association, and the U.S. Fashion Industry Association.I may ask you to repeat the question on China vis-a-vis Bangladesh and the Indo-Pacific Business - and the IPBF. Can you repeat that question?Moderator: Sure. It was actually a fairly general one which was coming in from Mohammad Imrul Hasan from Rtv in Bangladesh, and it was just about how the IPBF discussed questions of Chinese involvement and interference in Bangladesh, but also we can say in the region.Deputy Administrator Glick: It's a good question. I wasn't in a lot of the conversations specific to Bangladesh alone, so I'm afraid I don't have a sense of how the PRC was discussed in those venues. I can tell you that from the U.S. Government perspective, one of the things that we're looking at to help Bangladesh with, is how Bangladesh can diversify its private sector to move some of it away from the ready-made garment industry into other, high-value areas to include the digital economy. And again, in order to be a competitive player in the Clean Network, Bangladesh has taken some important steps, I understand, towards the Clean Path, and coming in line with Clean Network requirements.And so, this is the way that Bangladesh, jointly with the United States and with its friends in the region, is able to address the Chinese presence in the Indo-Pacific region.Moderator: Thank you. We probably have time for just one more question. So, if we could turn it over to Nhu Nguyen from OEC, dialing in from Vietnam. Nhu, if you're there, if you could please go ahead.Question: Yes. I'm Nhu Nguyen from OEC [inaudible]. Mr. Under Secretary, in the conference of [inaudible]? Could you provide more data on [inaudible] Vietnam [inaudible] the next [inaudible].Moderator: I'm sorry, I'm actually having a lot of difficulty understanding the question. If you could please perhaps slow down and simplify the question just a little bit.Question: Yes. Could you please provide more data on the plan [inaudible] in the context of recent moratorium [inaudible].Moderator: Okay. I'm sorry. Unless - Under Secretary or Deputy Administrator, unless you could hear that, I'm afraid I cannot hear that question and I'm afraid we'll probably just move on.Under Secretary Krach: Here neither.Deputy Administrator Glick: I can probably address it. I think it had to do with Vietnam and our investment and our assistance --Moderator: Excellent. Please go ahead.Deputy Administrator Glick: If this is helpful, I'll just give a little bit on the assistance that the United States is providing through USAID in the energy sector for Vietnam. I talked about a new five-year, $36 million program in Vietnam to further advance the country's energy security. Our new program will build on our past success working closely with the Government of Vietnam to scale up clean energy and accelerate clean energy development. So, this has contributed to a very large increase in solar energy production in just two years in Vietnam, from less than 2 percent of the country's total power generation in 2017, to over 10 percent in 2019. We worked with Vietnamese investors to build a grid-connect - seven renewable energy projects in 2019, utilizing U.S. technologies and expertise.So, an example is in May 2019, the Ha Do Group, one of USAID's partners, completed construction of its first solar-power farm in Vietnam utilizing services and advanced solar technology from SunPower, a U.S. leader in solar energy. In addition, USAID worked with the Government of Vietnam to develop a direct power purchase agreement pilot program which will allow businesses to purchase clean power directly from solar and wind generators. This $250 million in assistance is also supporting - includes a $20 million partnership with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory to develop and deploy tools, state-of-the-art approaches, and technical assistance to scale up advanced energy systems in the region. This includes an effort with the Japan Meteorological Agency to upgrade an online platform that provides solar resource data for Southeast Asia used by stakeholders, including investors and decision-makers.So, I hope that helps answer the question on solar and renewable power in Vietnam.Moderator: Thank you very much. We're going to be wrapping up the call here. I was going to pass it back to Under Secretary Krach for any final remarks.Under Secretary Krach: First of all, I want to thank Bonnie for joining me on the call. You can see why she's just such a magnificent partner for me and the rest of the United States Government. This issue of Chinese retaliation keeps coming up. I had a great bilateral. We had a senior economic dialogue with the country of Bangladesh, really taking things to the next level -- it was so very positive, as well as so many of the other nations, ASEAN nations. And the One Belt, One Road - right in the Indo-Pacific, it's kind of the heart of it. And one of the finance ministers of one of the countries, and I won't say which one, but he called it the "One Belt, One-way Toll Road to Beijing." He said there's nothing win-win about it, and this intimidation and retribution has been on display for a long time.And as a matter of fact, I just want to tell you guys something that in my trip, my last trip when I was in the Middle East, that that intimidation was on full display. At every stop, the Chinese officials were so threatened by my message about the Clean Network that they resorted to attempts to censor and bully the local journalists in several countries actually. The Chinese embassy even tried to stop the press from reporting my remarks by sending them letters. And the question that I ask is: If the Chinese Communist Party can't handle press conferences about 5G, how do they expect to be trusted with actual 5G?And that's what the 5G security comes down to, it's trust. And it's certainly the most powerful word in every language. It's the basis of every relationship, business, personal, or otherwise. You buy from people you trust; you partner with people you trust. And the U.S. and the Indo-Pacific nations trust each other. And among many other byproducts of that trust is sharing sensitive information with - to ensure security and stability of both the country and the wider region, and that's why it's so critical that Indo-Pacific infrastructure only relies on trusted vendors.And I believe the Clean Network fits really well with the ASEAN vision of a secure, forward-looking Indo-Pacific. And global economic security depends on it. National security depends on it. Economic prosperity depends on it. And actually, so does the freedom of the press. So, I really appreciate what you guys are doing and your noble profession. So, I give you my deepest thanks and may God bless you all, and have a great day. Thank you very much.Moderator: Thank you. That concludes today's call. I want to thank Ambassador Keith Krach, Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment, and Bonnie Glick, Deputy Administrator of USAID. And I also would like to thank all of you for participating in this briefing.Please stay on the line for information regarding access to an audio recording of the call. Also, please be aware that a transcript of the call will be posted to our social media platforms and sent out to all of you within a day. If you have any questions about today's call, you may contact the Asia Pacific Media Hub at AsiaPacMedia@state.gov Thank you very much.

Donald Trump's TikTok crusade takes its cues from China's 'Great Firewall'Stillman Advance: Stillman CollegeSeptember 21, 2020 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: WORLD NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 602 wordsByline: Steven ClarkeBodyThe Trump administration has cited national-security concerns, postulating that Chinese government agents could demand access to data from WeChat on US users. A district court judge in San Francisco has temporarily stayed the nationwide ban, following a lawsuit of WeChat users arguing that the ban undermined the free speech rights of American citizens.In a Sunday ruling, a US judge in California put the brakes on Donald Trump's executive order from August calling for a WeChat ban (h/t CNBC).The Commerce Department simultaneously created a window for the potential deal by delaying the ban on TikTok's app by a week, until the end of September 27th.Less than 72 hours ago, President Donald Trump and his administration delivered the green light to have the China-based social media giant banned from the United States, however, last-minute legal action has kept the platform alive a bit longer.In a statement, TikTok said: "We are pleased that the proposal by TikTok, Oracle, and Walmart will resolve the security concerns of the United States administration and settle questions around TikTok's future in the US".Per Axios, the temporary injunction also means WeChat will remain on both Apple's and Google's app stores. for now.The announcement of the postponement of the ban came after President Trump said he gave his "blessing" to a multiparty deal under which TikTok will become majority-owned by a group of US companies and investors: Oracle and Walmart, which together will take a 20% stake, along with American investment firms Susquehanna International Group, General Atlantic, Sequoia Capital and Coatue Management.The proposed deal will see Oracle and Walmart partner with TikTok - now owned by the Chinese firm ByteDance - to create a new company that will likely be based in Texas.Epic Games sue Apple after Fortnite's removal from the App StoreThose playing on Apple Mac computers will not be affected with the ban as that version does not use the iOS App Store. Fortnite is removed from App Store and Play store amid launching its own in-app payment system.Oracle said in a news release Saturday that it would take a 12.5 percent stake in the new entity and would become TikTok's "secure cloud technology provider".Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., on the race for the White House, TikTok's deal with Oracle and Walmart and the Russian Federation probe.Commerce will have a chance to respond to this development, and whether it chooses to edit its order, pursue other avenues through the courts, or just rescind the order entirely, we will see in the coming days.Trump approved the deal for the new entity that will be based in the United States.Oracle CEO Safra Catz said in a statement that his company "will quickly deploy, rapidly scale, and operate TikTok systems in the Oracle Cloud"."I think we have to be very careful in looking at that provision, because any opportunity whatsoever for China to continue to collect personal data on Americans, then we can't be supportive of that deal so that's the core and the crux of it that we'll be looking at"."There are serious First Amendment problems with the WeChat ban, which targets the Chinese American community and trampled on their First Amendment guaranteed freedoms to speak, to worship, to read and react to the press, and to organize and associate for numerous purposes", a lawyer for the plaintiffs, Michael Bien, said in reaction to the court order.The decision comes after the Commerce Department said PresidentDonald Trump's executive orders will efficiently block United States users from accessing both applications starting 20 September.Load-Date: September 21, 2020End of Document

TikTok owner is evaluating options to avoid selling in the U.S.CE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 9, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 431 wordsBodyChina's ByteDance, which owns TikTok, is discussing with the U.S. government possible understandings that would allow the popular application of short-lived videos to avoid a full sale of its U.S. operations, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources familiar with the process.The talks on this possibility have been going on for months but have taken on a greater urgency since the Chinese government took steps that make a sale more difficult, the same sources told the WSJ.It is recalled that on August 3, Donald Trump declared that the Chinese video-sharing app would cease to work in the United States if it was not sold to a Us company by September 15. In recent times, US policymakers have been expressing fears about the app, with many of them saying it could pose national security risks due to data that could be passed on to China and propaganda that may come the other way. The other unspeakable reason for concern is the Chinese entry into a fiefdom dominated exclusively by American technology. According to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, it is concerned that Chinese technology with a Presence in the U.S. will provide data to the Beijing authorities. Earlier this month, the WSJ said, quoted by Lusa, that negotiations for the sale of TikTok's operations in the United States had been complicated by the question of whether the application's core algorithms could be included in the deal.These algorithms decide which videos users see without first requiring them to follow other users or specify their preferences.According to the U.S. newspaper, the algorithms were integrated into the business until August 28 – when the Chinese government introduced restrictions on the export of artificial intelligence technology, such as the one that powers TikTok.The Chinese decision followed Trump's efforts to force the sale of TikTok in the U.S., where the app has 100 million users. These export restrictions mean that ByteDance will need to obtain a license to export any restricted technology to a foreign company. The question is whether its algorithms need the approval of the Chinese government to be transferred and, if so, whether Beijing will authorize the transfer, Lusa stressed.Among those interested in buying TikTok's U.S. operations is the Microsoft-Walmart duo.Microsoft's intention to buy TikTok in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand had been known for weeks, and then joined forces with Walmart. But the duo are not alone in the race: Oracle and Twitter have already been referred to as potential buyers.(news updated at 9:13 p.m.)Load-Date: September 10, 2020End of Document

US intelligence agencies have 'not sufficiently adapted' to counter China, congressional report warnsCNN WireSeptember 30, 2020 Wednesday 7:24 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1107 wordsDateline: (CNN) Body (CNN) --  The US intelligence community must urgently refocus its efforts and resources towards addressing the threat posed by China, a glaring need that has only become more apparent due to Beijing's actions during the coronavirus pandemic, according to the summary of a highly classified report released by the House Intelligence Committee Wednesday.The partially redacted 37-page report, which marks the culmination of a two-year review conducted by committee staff, states that the intelligence community has "not sufficiently adapted to a changing geopolitical and technological environment increasingly shaped by a rising China.""Absent a significant realignment of resources, the US government and intelligence community will fail to achieve the outcomes required to enable continued US competition with China on the global stage for decades to come, and to protect the US health and security," the unclassified summary reads. In a statement Wednesday, Rep.

"Beijing's complicity in stopping scientific inquiries into the origin of the virus, and its disdain for accountability, require a strong US response."More broadly, the committee assessed that China's intelligence services will continue to pose a formidable challenge to the US going forward and will require "equal parts ingenuity, humility, and vigilance to address."TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

US intelligence agencies have 'not sufficiently adapted' to counter China, congressional report warnsCNN.comSeptember 30, 2020 Wednesday 3:24 PM ESTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICSLength: 1090 wordsByline: By Zachary Cohen, CNNBodyThe US intelligence community must urgently refocus its efforts and resources towards addressing the threat posed by China, a glaring need that has only become more apparent due to Beijing's actions during the coronavirus pandemic, according to the summary of a highly classified report released by the House Intelligence Committee Wednesday.The partially redacted 37-page report, which marks the culmination of a two-year review conducted by committee staff, states that the intelligence community has "not sufficiently adapted to a changing geopolitical and technological environment increasingly shaped by a rising China.""Absent a significant realignment of resources, the US government and intelligence community will fail to achieve the outcomes required to enable continued US competition with China on the global stage for decades to come, and to protect the US health and security," the unclassified summary reads.In a statement Wednesday, Rep.

'Mulan' Fails To Break Barriers Amidst Clouds of ControversyWashington Square News: New York UniversitySeptember 21, 2020 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 1284 wordsBody"Mulan," recently released on Disney+, is the company's newest live-action remake in 2020. Attracting worldwide controversy with the crew's political stance as well as poor ratings, the movie remains a disappointing watch. (Staff Illustration by Chelsea Li)Several of the top eight reviews on "Mulan's" Letterboxd are related to money, rather than the film itself, but the $30 Disney+ demands on top of its pricey subscription isn't the only reason that this remake of "Mulan" has been condemned by so many. "Mulan" was originally set for release on March 27, of this year, but with the onset of the pandemic and cineplexes everywhere closing their doors on March 17, Disney was forced to change its release strategy. Following a graceful stroll in limbo that gnawed at both the audience and the studio's patience, Disney finally decided to release this over $200 million budget project on its streaming platform, which is usually reserved for new films with low- to mid-tier budgets.The intention behind releasing "Mulan" on Disney+ was that it would increase subscriptions to the streaming service and recoup revenue that would have been lost with a limited run in theaters. That being said, it will take 6.6 million purchases for "Mulan" to break even. That might explain why "Mulan" is now appearing on the homepage of every Apple TV and every billboard around the world, seeing as Disney is desperately trying to get a return on its investment.The film's political stance has made the situation worse for the film's global market. After Liu Yifei, the film's main star, posted a photo in support of the Hong Kong police on Weibo, activists began organizing a campaign to boycott the film upon release. The fact that Yifei's comments are attached to "Mulan" as an internationally registered property distinguishes it from similar comments made by other celebrities in mainland China. At this point, posting "I support the Hong Kong Police" has become a sort of unwritten law for public figures based in Mainland China, but Liu's comments have been hurled into the global spotlight because of the film's international fame.AdvertisementSocial media users also noticed that "Mulan's" filmmakers thanked Chinese government entities in Xinjiang that were suspected of being involved in the current human rights problem in the region. The problem entails the presence of a mass detention camp that was thrust into the global news spotlight following a series of riots that happened in Xinjiang from early 2009 through 2014. The controversy lies in the different interpretations people have of the nature of the camps themselves. Although the Chinese government stated they provided compulsory education, several scholars hypothesized they were intended as imprisonment.The creation of the camps can be traced back to China's Laogai Policy, which sought reform through labor. The policy was abolished at the end of 2013, four years after the July 2009 Ürümqi riots, during which many participants perished in a series of riots. With reports on the internet providing limited and vague information about what the goal of the re-education center is, it's difficult to pin down exactly what's happening in Xinjiang. The fact that only certain people are granted access to the center casts the Chinese government's comments in a dubious light as the sole informational authority on the subject."Mulan" debuted in theaters in China on Sept. 11. With a release that consisted of low pre-sale orders and an onslaught of negative ratings in Douban - China's biggest movie review website - "Mulan" did not fare all that well at the box office. Noting that the princess holds a tremendous fan base in China due to the epic poem's place in Chinese culture and the animated film's successful run in theaters back in 1998, Disney was banking on the release of "Mulan" in China buffing its box-office numbers. Disney even sought out a superstar cast of Jet Li, Donny Yen and Liu Yifei to boost its chances with the Chinese audience. Instead, "Mulan" only generated $23.2 million during its opening weekend.Currently, "Mulan" holds a 4.9/10 on Douban, making it the lowest-rated live-action film Disney has ever made. "Mulan's" reliability on action set-pieces over character development points to the algorithmic design behind Disney's current productions, as each and every one of its films adopts the same schema as its popular Marvel flicks. Disney's penchant for superhero-stories shines in "Mulan," as it suffocates the elements of folklore with the trappings of a superhero story.In this version of "Mulan," the titular character naturally holds a unique "chi" that sets her aside from the rest of the soldiers, bestowing her a certain deification that belittles the rigor and devotion she's typically portrayed to engage in upon joining the military. Additionally, the use of a character shield to make Mulan impervious to any attacks on her character makes her all the less relatable as a role model. Throughout the entire film, Mulan is never wounded or put in a difficult situation, a decision that renders the character entirely alien to audiences.The original "Mulan" from 1998 acted as a beacon of encouragement for young girls to act bravely and independently by accentuating Mulan's courageous demeanor. While the film makes attempts to deliver a feminist message, said attempts only end up belittling every female character in the film that isn't Mulan. "Mulan's" decision to compare Mulan against other female characters like her mother or her sister seem to make the argument that there's only one ideal way of expressing womanhood as opposed to celebrating the many ways in which women in China have always had a great effect on the culture by virtue of their multi-hyphenate existences. In a scene that forces Mulan to untie her bun in order to show off her beautiful wavy hair and present herself as traditionally female in order to access the full power of her "chi," the subversion of Mulan's story is lost to a notion of women only being able to command power so long as they fit the aesthetic mold of traditional womanhood.In "The Lord of the Rings," a similar moment plays out when Eowyn kills the Witch-king of Angmar. But, the difference is, Eowyn never lies about her identity and she doesn't have to resort to super powers in order to achieve this feat. Where Eowyn shows off the battle-proficiency that she's built over the course of the trilogy and demonstrates how she holds the same command over the battlefield as the rest of the entirely male Fellowship of the Ring, Mulan is forced to resort to magic that strips her of the human quality of evolution-through-training young viewers typically look to in their Disney role models.With a faltering story, message, production and distribution, Disney's "Mulan" has proven to be quite the mess. That said, the "BoycottMulan" hashtag that surged in response to the situation has accrued a certain topicality that seems to favor the studio, as people from around the world have grown intrigued by the film's overall controversy. But even putting the controversy surrounding the film aside, "Mulan" remains a disappointing watch. If Disney doesn't change its model for adapting animated classics into live-action features, which can only be described as "old wine in new bottles," the future of Disney's cinema shall continue to look dry and formulaic. Maybe it'll survive this time, but carelessly gambling with such powerful narratives and socio-political factors can't be healthy for business in the long term.A version of this article appeared in the Monday, Sept. 21, 2020, e-print edition.

U.S. accused five Chinese citizens of a "global hacking campaign"CE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 16, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 152 wordsBodyThe U.S. Department of Justice accused five Chinese citizens of hacking more than 100American and other companies and institutions, including social media and video game companies, as well as universities and telecommunications providers.Through a statement, they target the five defendants are still fugitives,but prosecutors say two Malay businessmen accused of conspiring with the alleged hackers to profit from attacks on video game companies were arrested in that country this week and face extradition.The accusations announced Wednesday are part of a broader effort by President Donald Trump's administration to denounce China's cybercrime.

Tired of being at home: China awaits tourism uptick in Golden WeekCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 28, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 642 wordsBodyBy Sophie Yu and Brenda GohPEKON/SHANGHI, 28 Sep (Reuters) - China expects a significant uptick in in-country travel during the upcoming golden week vacation following the harsh months of coronavirus restrictions, with tickets for some flights sold out and increased hotel bookings on travel platforms.The demand accumulated during the months of confinement fuels optimism that the Chinese tourism industry has reached a turning point, hoping that the eight days of vacation beginning on or after October 1 will overload the timid recovery observed in recent months, even if some concern for the virus persists.The world's second-largest economy has largely recovered to normal, but there are still persistent pockets of weakness like that of the tourism sector, Capital Economics said on a recent note.The resurgence of China's tourism industry offers a striking contrast to the situation in some other parts of Asia, as well as in the United States and Europe, where the new coronavirus continues to circulate and meetings are restricted.The holidays in which the foundation of modern China is celebrated are traditionally one of the times with the most tourist activity, and not only on a domestic level. Last year, 782 million trips were made, with more than 7 million people traveling abroad, according to Chinese government data."The demand for tourism that was suppressed for nine months is likely to be unleashed in these eight days," said online travel platform Trip.com in a statement, estimating that 600 million trips could be made.China has largely brought its coronavirus outbreaks under control, which emerged in Wuhan city late last year, after which many restrictions on domestic travel have been lifted.However, few people are expected to venture abroad due to the quarantine rules in force around the world and the scarcity of flights abroad. On Monday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that people should avoid international travel unless it is "truly necessary" because of the COVID-19 pandemic.But between 1 October and 14 September, more domestic flight bookings were made than in the previous period, with an increase in August, and the economic seats of popular routes such as Beijing to the southwestern city of Lijiang have been exhausted, according to travel service provider Qunar.com.Hotel and flight bookings made during the week of September 8-15 exceeded those made during the same period last year, said Fliggy, an online travel platform in Alibaba, with hotel reservations for Golden Week increasing by more than 50%.DESIRE TO FLYSpending on hotels during the holidays is expected to recover to last year's level, or even to see slight growth, according to Meituan Dianping's research department, whose on-demand service applications range from groceries to hotels."People want to fly somewhere, there's a cumulative demand as they're sick of staying home," said Mei Xin, Huatai Securities' retail analyst.But still, some caution is maintained when it comes to coronavirus.People often have to show health tracking QR codes, which have played a key role in containing the virus, and some hotels are asking their guests to get tested for coronavirus before they arrive.Some families are asked to stay in their homes.In cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, schools have asked parents and students not to leaveunless strictly necessary.Pan Lei, a 45-year-old Beijing television producer, claimed to have to cancel a family trip to the Huang Mountains tourist area after receiving a warning from his children's schools."I lost the money I paid in advance," he said.But he said it's understandable that a second wave of coronavirus is being feared this winter."Schools want to minimize risks."(Information by Sophie Yu and Brenda Goh; edited by Robert Birsel; translated by Dario Fernandez in the writing of Gdansk)Load-Date: September 29, 2020End of Document

Source: Oracle wins TikTok over Microsoft in Trump-urged bidAssociated Press Financial WireSeptember 14, 2020 Monday 3:02 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; DOMESTIC NEWSLength: 937 wordsByline: MATT O'BRIEN and TALI ARBEL, AP Technology WritersBodyThe owner of TikTok has chosen Oracle over Microsoft as the American tech partner that could help keep the popular video-sharing app running in the U.S., according to a source familiar with the deal who was not authorized to speak publicly about it.Microsoft announced Sunday that its bid to acquire TikTok's U.S. operations was rejected, removing the tech giant from the running a week before President Donald Trump promises to follow through with a plan to ban the Chinese-owned app in the U.S. over spying concerns.TikTok and the White House declined to comment Sunday. Oracle didn’t return a request for comment but has previously declined comment.Walmart, which had planned to partner with Microsoft on the acquisition, said Sunday it “continues to have an interest in a TikTok investment” and is talking about it with ByteDance and other parties.The Trump administration has threatened to ban TikTok by Sept. 20 and ordered ByteDance to sell its U.S. business, claiming national-security risks due to its Chinese ownership. The government worries about user data being funneled to Chinese authorities. TikTok denies it is a national-security risk and is suing to stop the administration from the threatened ban.It's not clear if the proposed deal will only cover TikTok's U.S. business, and, if so, how it will be split from the rest of TikTok's social media platform, which is popular worldwide. ByteDance also owns a similar video app, Douyin, for the Chinese market.Any deal must still be reviewed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, a U.S. government group chaired by the Treasury Secretary that studies mergers for national-security reasons. The president can approve or deny a transaction recommended by the panel, though Trump has already voiced support for Oracle as a “great company” that could handle the acquisition.Microsoft said in a Sunday statement that ByteDance “let us know today they would not be selling TikTok’s US operations to Microsoft.”Microsoft added it was “confident our proposal would have been good for TikTok’s users, while protecting national security interests.” The company said it “would have made significant changes to ensure the service met the highest standards for security, privacy, online safety, and combating disinformation.”TikTok, which says it has 100 million U.S. users and about 700 million globally, is known for its fun, goofy videos of dancing, lip-syncing, pranks and jokes. It’s recently become home to more political content such as the comedian Sarah Cooper, who drew a large audience by lip-syncing Trump’s own often-disjointed statements from public appearances.But the app has also raised concerns because of its Chinese ownership. The White House has cracked down on a range of Chinese businesses, including telecom equipment makers Huawei and ZTE and messaging app WeChat, over worries that they would enable Chinese authorities to get U.S. user data. Republican and Democratic lawmakers have raised concerns about censorship and children’s privacy.TikTok denies that it has shared user data with the Chinese government or that it would do so if asked. The company says it has not censored videos at the request of Chinese authorities and insists it is not a national-security threat.TikTok has sued to stop the ban, but not the sale order. The negotiations have been complicated by several factors, including Trump’s repeated demands that the U.S. government should get a “cut” of any deal, a stipulation and role for the president that experts say is unprecedented.In addition, the Chinese government in late August unveiled new regulations that restrict exports of technology, likely including the artificial intelligence system TikTok uses to choose which videos to spool up to its users. That means ByteDance would have to obtain a license from China to export such technology to a foreign company.The deal had come together rapidly after the administration ramped up its threats against TikTok this summer, despite TikTok’s efforts to put distance between its app and its Chinese ownership. It installed former Disney executive Kevin Mayer as its American CEO, but he resigned in August after just a few months on the job, saying the “political environment has sharply changed.”Both Microsoft and Oracle are known more for their business software offerings than for those intended for consumers.Oracle primarily makes database software. It competes with tech giants such as Microsoft and Amazon that provide cloud services as well as business-software specialists like Salesforce.Some analysts see Oracle’s interest in a consumer business as misguided. Oracle should focus on enterprise-market acquisitions and not invest in a consumer app like TikTok that doesn’t fit with the rest of its business, said Jefferies analyst Brent Thill, who compares the idea to Delta Airlines buying a motorcycle company. “It doesn’t make any sense,” he said.Thill suggested that TikTok competitors like Facebook and Snapchat should be “cheering on Oracle” as a buyer, because Oracle wouldn’t “add a lot of value to the app.”Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison is unusual among tech executives for his public support of President Donald Trump, hosting a fundraiser for him in February at his Rancho Mirage, California, estate. The company also hired a former top aide to Vice President Mike Pence; its CEO, Safra Catz, also served on Trump’s transition team.The president said on Aug. 18 that Oracle was “a great company” that “could handle” buying TikTok. He declined to state his preference between Oracle and Microsoft as buyers.Load-Date: September 13, 2020End of Document

TikTok gets overtime and will be able to continue operating in the US temporarilyCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 28, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 799 wordsBodyUpdate with reaction from Chinese diplomacy ///Washington, 28 Set 2020 (AFP) - TikTok achieved a last-minute extension on Sunday, when a U.S. federal judge suspended the ban imposed by Donald Trump's administration on downloads of the popular video app, hours before the move came into effect. District Judge Carl Nichols issued a temporary court order to suspend the veto at the request of TikTok, which the White House describes as a threat to national security, claiming that its Chinese spy matrix in favor of the Beijing government. The judge's opinion was not communicated, so it is unknown why he decided to make that decision. The Trump administration sought to ban further downloads of the app from midnight (04h00 GMT on Monday), and that current U.S. users have access only until November 12. The judge rejected TikTok's request to suspend the November 12 ban. The decision represents a temporary victory for TikTok, which has 100 million users in the United States. But the court has yet to consider the legal arguments about whether the social network should remain available to Americans. The platform claimed that a blockage of downloads, even temporary, would cause it irreparable damage by preventing its growth and damaging its commercial reputation. At an unusual telephone hearing, Judge Nichols on Sunday heard lawyers from TikTok, owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, arguing about freedom of expression and national security. For attorney John Hall, a ban would be "punitive" and close a public forum used by tens of millions of Americans. In a paper filed before the hearing, TikTok's lawyers said the ban was "arbitrary and capricious" and would "undermine data security" by blocking updates and fixes to the app used by some 100 million Americans. The company also said the ban was unnecessary because negotiations were already underway to restructure TikTok's ownership to address national security issues raised by the government. Government lawyers argued that the president has the right to take national security measures, and said the ban was necessary because of TikTok's ties to the Chinese government through ByteDance.A government report called ByteDance a "spokesman" for the Chinese Communist Party, arguing that he was "committed to promoting the party's agenda and messages." The president determined that the (China's) ability to control this data posed an unacceptable threat to U.S. national security and foreign policy," the government argued in its presentation. A spokesman for Chinese diplomacy, Wang Wenbin, on Monday called on Washington to provide a "fair" and "non-discriminatory" business environment in the United States and criticized "intimidation" against its companies. In this way, TikTok has become the new symbol of the battle between the United States and China for dominance of the state-of-the-art technology sector.          - Implications for the Internet - A report submitted by Netchoice, a business group that includes Google, Facebook and Twitter, said a ban on TikTok could have important implications for the global internet. "The government's actions are of unprecedented scope," the group said. A ban would "create a dangerous precedent" for the open internet, the report said. "The prohibition of any use of TikTok code by U.S. developers for any purpose is effectively a prohibition on building digital free speech." The group added that a ban onTikTok could be used by China or other countries "as justification for prohibiting or restricting the activities of U.S. internet companies, including U.S.-based social media platforms." In early August, Trump signed a decree to force ByteDance to sell the platform to a U.S. company, arguing - without evidence - an alleged threat to "national security." According to the representative, TikTok spies for Beijing through the collection of user data. Trump also alleged threats to national security to ban china's popular WeChat app, a decision that was suspended in a separate court case in California(west). As the total ban order against TikTok arrives until November 12, the parent company ByteDance has time to conclude an application ownership transfer agreement. The latest project, announced last weekend, involves the creation of a new company, TikTok Global, involving two American emporiums: Oracle as a technology partner and Walmart as a business partner. It is not known whether this agreement would be approved by Beijing, where some consider the United States to seek unjustified appropriation of Chinese technology. TikTok's coveted algorithm allows users to display content that is most likely to interest them, leading them to spend as much time as possible on the platform.juj-rl/bgs/yo/gma -------------------------------------------------------------Load-Date: September 29, 2020End of Document

Sen. Cruz on TikTok: Any Deal That Fails to Address All National Security Concerns Should Be Outright RejectedTargeted News ServiceSeptember 18, 2020 Friday 7:11 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1132 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodySen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, issued the following news release on Sept. 16:In response to reports that Oracle and the Chinese-owned ByteDance have reached an agreement, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Judiciary Committees, today sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin raising concerns that the deal could leave the American people exposed to undo influence by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and undermine U.S. national security interests.In the letter, Sen. Cruz warned against the proposed Oracle-ByteDance deal, saying it failed to meet the intent of the president's executive orders:"As opposed to a sale that could, with the right conditions, remove the CCP root and branch from TikTok, this planned partnership raises serious national security concerns. Indeed, reports indicate that other companies interested in purchasing ByteDance felt they were unable to address national security concerns under the conditions imposed by the Chinese government. It is hard to see how such a proposal can satisfy the spirit of the executive orders, and harder still to see how such an arrangement serves American interests.He continued, warning that the agreement is yet another effort by the Chinese Communist Party to shape what Americans see, hear, and ultimately think, and to undermine U.S. national security:"In recent years, Americans have begun to understand that China is working relentlessly to systematically undermine American national security, including through social media companies like TikTok that function as platforms for propaganda and censorship, as well as for gathering information on Americans. The CCP undoubtedly sees the enormous power American social media companies wield in manipulating our politics and elections. It has already shown its own willingness to block dissenting views and censor all media that threatens to reveal to the world the harms of its authoritarian rule and its systematic human rights atrocities."The only explanation for its position, then, is that it seeks to exercise some of the same power, and same influence, more directly here in the United States, with the goal being to control what Americans see, hear, and ultimately think. That is why any deal that fails to address all national security concerns, including data security and the ability for the CCP to engage in the destructive and manipulative practices of large American tech companies should be outright rejected."I urge the Administration to take all deliberate action necessary to protect Americans and American interests in this matter, to carefully consider the proposed transaction, and to insist on an outright sale if that is what is necessary to protect American national security."Reports: https://www.wsj.com/articles/national-security-panel-to-meet-on-oracle-tiktok-deal-tuesday-11600187547* * *September 16, 2020To: Hon. Steven T. Mnuchin, Chair, Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, U.S. Department of the Treasury, 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, D.C. 20220Dear: Secretary Mnuchin:The Chinese Communist Party and its expansionist actions represent a threat the United States, its interests, and its allies. This Administration has correctly recognized this threat and has taken substantial counter-measures in response to protect our national security. I urge you to do the same when reviewing the newly submitted plan of a transaction between the Chinese company ByteDance and Oracle.To protect national security, President Trump recently issued two executive orders against ByteDance. The first order banned transactions with ByteDance after 45 days. The second, issued a week later, provided ByteDance 90 days to divest all interests and rights in American assets. These orders meticulously explained how TikTok-a social media platform owned and controlled by ByteDance-is a national security threat. Not only does TikTok's "data collection threaten[] to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans' personal and proprietary information," but TikTok "censors content that the Chinese Communist Party deems politically sensitive, such as content concerning protests in Hong Kong and China's treatment of Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities."These orders correctly left ByteDance no choice but to sell TikTok to an American company to remove the influence and power of the CCP. Unfortunately, recent maneuvering by the CCP seems to have reset negotiations and circumvent the intent of the executive orders. Seeking to protect its asserted intellectual property rights-rights that the CCP routinely violates and exploits-the CCP has prohibited any American company from acquiring any of the underlying code powering TikTok itself.The consequence is a planned "partnership" between Oracle and ByteDance. As opposed to a sale that could, with the right conditions, remove the CCP root and branch from TikTok, this planned partnership raises serious national security concerns. Indeed, reports indicate that other companies interested in purchasing ByteDance felt they were unable to address national security concerns under the conditions imposed by the Chinese government. It is hard to see how such a proposal can satisfy the spirit of the executive orders, and harder still to see how such an arrangement serves American interests.In recent years, Americans have begun to understand that China is working relentlessly to systematically undermine American national security, including through social media companies like TikTok that function as platforms for propaganda and censorship, as well as for gathering information on Americans. The CCP undoubtedly sees the enormous power American social media companies wield in manipulating our politics and elections. It has already shown its own willingness to block dissenting views and censor all media that threatens to reveal to the world the harms of its authoritarian rule and its systematic human rights atrocities. The only explanation for its position, then, is that it seeks to exercise some of the same power, and same influence, more directly here in the United States, with the goal being to control what Americans see, hear, and ultimately think. That is why any deal that fails to address all national security concerns, including data security and the ability for the CCP to engage in the destructive and manipulative practices of large American tech companies should be outright rejected.I urge the Administration to take all deliberate action necessary to protect Americans and American interests in this matter, to carefully consider the proposed transaction, and to insist on an outright sale if that is what is necessary to protect American national security.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7237896 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: September 18, 2020End of Document

Tech War Tensions Between U.S., China Elevate Over TikTok, WeChat BansInvestor's Business DailySeptember 18, 2020Copyright 2020 Investor's Business Daily, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: TECHNOLOGYLength: 790 wordsByline: BRIAN DEAGONBodyhttps://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Stock-tiktok-05-shutt.jpgPresident Trump's decision on Friday to bar downloads of TikTok and WeChat could create problems for Facebook, Alphabet and a host of other tech companies because it amplifies already high trade-war tensions between the U.S. and China that could reverberate across the technology landscape, analysts said Friday.The actions taken could heighten tensions over the import and export of technology. Facebook, Google and other internet companies might face obstacles over what has been an open border when it comes to global internet expansion.It's also a potential problem for China internet giants like Alibaba and Tencent Holdings as they try to expand into the West."This is a game of high-stakes poker," Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a note to clients. "And this move put sharp teeth into threats by the Trump administration around the TikTok and WeChat bans."The Trump administration announced early Friday it would bar downloads of TikTok and WeChat, two widely popular Chinese-owned apps, from U.S. stores beginning Sunday. The bans were based on national security concerns.A Pivotal Period Of Tech War TensionsThe announcement comes as Oracle is attempting to work out a deal with TikTok-owner ByteDance. The efforts include a partnership or possible acquisition of TikTok. Those discussions came about after the Trump administration previously announced it would shut down U.S. TikTok operations. Trump officials called for tighter security measures.Oracle beat out a competing proposal from Microsoft to keep TikTok alive. Oracle stock dipped 0.7% to close at 59.75 on the stock market today."The broader worry is that if a deal is not reached over the next 48 hours with approval by the Chinese government around source code access and majority ownership, this shutdown move could be a Fort Sumter moment in the U.S./China cold tech war tensions with retaliation on the horizon," Ives said.The Commerce Department said any moves to distribute or maintain WeChat or TikTok on an app store will be prohibited."At the President's direction, we have taken significant action to combat China's malicious collection of American citizens' personal data, while promoting our national values, democratic rules-based norms, and aggressive enforcement of U.S. laws and regulations," Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said.The restrictions also would ban the transferring of funds or payments through WeChat within the U.S. as of Sunday. Further, it will prevent any company from offering internet hosting, content delivery networks, internet transit or peering services to WeChat.Tencent Holdings owns WeChat, a widely used messaging and payment app. Tencent stock edged up 0.5% Friday to close at 67.02.Possible Lift On TikTok Ban?The Commerce Department said that Trump set a deadline of Nov. 12 to resolve TikTok's national security concerns. If they were done by the deadline, the prohibitions could be lifted.TikTok has more than 100 million users in the U.S. and 700 million globally.Vanessa Pappas, interim head of TikTok, said in a Twitter post the restrictions risk becoming a detriment to the social media industry overall."We invite Facebook and Instagram to publicly join our challenge and support our litigation," she wrote. "This is a moment to put aside our competition and focus on core principles like freedom of expression and due process of law."An Unjust Executive OrderTikTok also issued a statement, expressing disappointment with the Commerce Department's decision."We will continue to challenge the unjust executive order," TikTok said. "It was enacted without due process and threatens to deprive the American people and small businesses across the U.S. of a significant platform for both a voice and livelihoods."The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation also issued a statement opposing the bans. The organization is a nonpartisan research and educational institute focusing on the intersection of technology and public policy."The Trump Administration has provided no evidence that a ban on WeChat and TikTok is necessary to address a national security threat," it said. "Instead, the actions announced today put consumers at risk by cutting them off from software updates, including necessary security updates."Please follow Brian Deagon on Twitter at @IBD_BDeagon for more on tech stocks, analysis and financial markets.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE: Make Investing Simpler And Profit From LeaderboardProfit From Short-Term In A Swing Trading EnvironmentInvesting in Stocks 101: The Beginning Investor's Guide To Making More MoneyCatch The Next Big Winning Stock With MarketSmithUnlock Premium Stock Lists, Investing Tools And AnalysisLoad-Date: September 20, 2020End of Document

Intel Gets Government Nod to Sell Products to HuaweiTheStreet.comSeptember 22, 2020 Tuesday 6:54 AM EDTCopyright 2020 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 318 wordsByline: M. Corey GoldmanHighlight: Intel receives fresh licenses from the U.S. government to continue supplying some of its chips and other components to Huawei Technologies.BodyU.S. chipmaking giant Intel  has been granted a new set of licenses from the U.S. government to continue supplying some of its chips and other manufactured components to China's Huawei Technologies.An Intel spokesperson told Reuters that the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company has been given the nod to continue selling products to Huawei, which has been blacklisted from doing business with American companies amid ongoing tensions between the U.S. and Chinese governments.U.S. officials have for more than a year argued it was necessary to place restrictions on Huawei because they see the company's equipment embedded in U.S. telecom networks as posing significant national-security risks. Huawei has insisted from the get-go that it is not a threat.However, amid heightened political tensions, the Commerce Department in mid-August imposed new, more stringent curbs, including requiring U.S. chipmakers like Intel and rival Qualcomm  that sell Huawei any products made anywhere with U.S. technology to have a government-issued license to do so. The Commerce Department last month also added another 38 Huawei affiliates - including Huawei Cloud Computing Technology and Huawei Cloud Beijing - in 21 countries to its so-called entity list, which effectively bars foreign companies from exporting U.S. technology to the entities without a license.In this round, Semiconductor Manufacturing International and South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix also applied for licenses but SK's request was declined, Reuters said, citing a person familiar with the matter who also said non-U.S. semiconductor makers will likely have a tougher time getting approvals, forcing them to cut supply deals elsewhere.The Federal Communications Commission has estimated that it will cost $1.8 billion to remove equipment from Huawei and China's ZTE from U.S. networks.Shares of Intel were up 0.66% at $50.05 in premarket trading on Tuesday.Load-Date: September 22, 2020End of Document

Trump wavers on TikTok deal as companies push conflicting messagesPolitico.comSeptember 21, 2020 Monday 4:07 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 836 wordsHighlight: Trump's statements suggest the deal could still fall apart as parties argue over what the delicately brokered terms really mean.BodyPresident Donald Trump said Monday that he would not support a TikTok deal unless Walmart and Oracle own a controlling stake in the popular video-sharing app - appearing to reject the terms of an agreement he said over the weekend had his approval.Trump's statements suggest a deal that on Saturday seemed to only need final security approvals could still fall apart as parties argue over what the delicately brokered terms really mean. The agreement must satisfy both Washington and Beijing and the companies are spinning conflicting messages about the pact that appear designed to win over their home governments.Oracle and ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese parent company, put out contradictory statements Monday about whether the proposed ownership structure for the new TikTok Global - which includes a combination of U.S. and Chinese investors - means ByteDance will have an ownership stake.Trump, for his part, said the deal means Walmart and Oracle are purchasing TikTok outright - in line with his original demand that a U.S. company buy TikTok to satisfy concerns that U.S. user data could be shared with the Chinese government."They are going to buy it. They're going to have total control over it. They're going to own the controlling interest," he told reporters. "And if we find that they don't have total control, then we're not going to approve the deal."But Oracle and Walmart are not buying TikTok and they will not own a controlling interest, according to the deal as negotiated. The companies said over the weekend that they will become minority investors in TikTok Global, owning a combined 20 percent of the new entity. Oracle will own 12.5 percent to Walmart's 7.5 percent.Trump also told reporters that ByteDance would have no role in the company, though people familiar with the deal's terms say its investors are still involved. And ByteDance has said it would retain ownership of TikTok's prized algorithms and other proprietary technology. "They will have nothing to do with it, and if they do, we just won't make the deal," Trump said.But the existing investors in ByteDance, which include American, Chinese and international owners, will hold shares of TikTok Global - including ByteDance's founder, Zhang Yiming. Once Oracle and Walmart enter the deal, American investors will own a majority stake and control the board of directors, according to a person familiar with the terms. The person spoke anonymously because discussions are ongoing. Trump's pronouncements come as the companies themselves are putting out opposing claims about the deal.Oracle said Monday that ByteDance will have no ownership of the new TikTok Global. Meanwhile, ByteDance put out a statement in Chinese saying the deal structure means it will retain 80 percent ownership - though, according to a person familiar with the deal, only a portion of that will belong to Chinese investors.Those statements fall roughly in line with divergent priorities expressed by Washington and China.With just weeks until the election, Trump has framed his stance on TikTok as part of a broader crackdown on Chinese technology companies that the government asserts pose a national security threat.China, meanwhile, doesn't want to be seen as letting the U.S. snatch one of its technology crown jewels without putting up a fight. The government of Xi Jinping has accused the Trump administration of targeting TikTok for political and economic reasons under the guise of national security. "This isn't something that can be solved with the political wave of a magic wand," Paul Triolo, a longtime government analyst who now heads the Eurasia Group's geo-technology practice, said last week. "The details are going to have to make sense to both sides."That dynamic has already caused confusion. Trump claimed on the campaign stump Saturday that the deal would create a $5 billion education fund - an announcement that reportedly surprised ByteDance and that the company later refuted. Oracle and Walmart swooped in within hours to amend the record: the newly formed TikTok Global would generate $5 billion in new tax revenue and the companies would launch an online education initiative."It's entirely possible that this messaging gets the whole thing killed," said the person familiar with the deal. ByteDance also said Monday it will retain control over its prized algorithms and other technology that power the TikTok app - a concern Beijing took so seriously that it amended export controls to halt a full-blown sale of TikTok and its technology without the government's expressed permission. A request for further comment from ByteDance was not immediately returned. Oracle will, however, be able to review TikTok code for any security concerns and will host all U.S. data in its cloud computing facilities. The companies have said that, plus additional government oversight and third-party security audits, should settle concerns about U.S. data being inappropriately funneled to China. Caitlin Oprysko contributed to this report. Load-Date: September 22, 2020End of Document

Global Sensor Landscape in Robotics and ADAS Vehicles Market (2020 to 2025) - Growth, Trends, and ForecastsGlobeNewswireSeptember 7, 2020 Monday 2:43 AM PTCopyright 2020 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: RESEARCH ANALYSIS AND REPORTSLength: 1649 wordsBodyDublin, Sept.  07, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Sensor Landscape in Robotics and ADAS Vehicles - Growth, Trends, and Forecasts(2020 - 2025)" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.   The sensor landscape in robotic and ADAS vehicles is expected to reach a CAGR of 28.7% during the forecast period (2020 - 2025). An increasing adoption rate of ADAS and AD will be responsible for an overall expected growth rate of 8 percent in automotive sensors. The global market for advanced driver assistance systems, known in the industry as ADAS, is expected to reach more than $67 billion by 2025, growing more than 10 percent each year. • Also, the increasing research and development activities to roll out fully autonomous cars require sensing technologies that are of great importance to enable 360-degree safety around the vehicle. Companies such as Google and Uber are already working on fully automated robotic cars.• The Radar Sensor market has never been so dynamic, this market period of rapid technological innovation. New opportunities for radar are still emerging with, for instance, vital-sign driver monitoring systems, chassis-to-ground monitoring, and hands-free trunk opening. The industry is now envisioning radar imaging as a possibility. There's no doubt this technology will be critical in autonomous and robotic cars, ad aviation. For instance, in 2019, Velodyne launched Alphapuck at the Symposium event in Orlando. It is a lidar sensor specifically made for autonomous driving and advanced vehicle safety at highway speeds. It delivers a combination of long-range high resolution and wide field of view.• Government mandates to install technology such as collision avoiding automatic brake systems are driving the market. Similarly, the emphasis of government to lower vehicle emissions will need cars and other commercial vehicles to be more fuel-efficient, resulting in the growth of pressure sensors. The Chinese government, for example, will introduce the new "6A" emission standard by 2020 to further lower vehicle emissions.• With the recent outbreak of COVID 19, the Automotive sensor is witnessing a decline in growth due to major automotive manufacturing plants that have entirely stopped their production in response to lockdown being enforced by many countries across the world. Moreover, the self-driving vehicle has taken a hit, and the arrival of autonomous driving tech will be slowed, probably one to two years, because of the recent drastic downturn in auto sales and production due to COVID-19. For instance, Ford delayed its autonomous vehicle production until 2022 to rethink its strategy after the COVID-19 impact.Key Market TrendsRadar Sensor is Expected to Drive the Market Growth • The automotive industry, which is presently undergoing a technology transition focusing on increasing safety, comfort, and entertainment, provides ample opportunities for the application of radar sensors. Emerging sensor-rich applications, such as drones, autonomous vehicles, and ADAS applications, are further accelerating the need for radar sensors.• In November 2020, GroundProbe has extended its comprehensive Slope Stability Radar (SSR) product offering with the release of the SSR-Agilis. The SSR-Agilis is a 3D Real Aperture Radar that provides unique measurements that are less susceptible to contamination, crucial for safety-critical monitoring in high traffic work areas.• With the advent of autonomous/self-driving cars, increasing the adoption of radar sensors can be witnessed. Over the forecast period, innovations are expected to drive the demand for radar sensors in the automotive industry.• For instance, In March 2019, the European Commission announced a revision of the General Safety Regulations to make autonomous safety technologies a mandatory requirement for vehicles manufactured in Europe, in a bid to bring down accident levels in the region. Stringent regulations are pushing the automotive vendors to implement the latest radar sensor-based systems. This is creating an opportunity for the market.• However, radar sensors have high initial costs with diversified functionality, and the cost varies based on the type, range, and technology being deployed for different sensors. Ultimately, the exact price of any radar sensor is unique. The cost for the radar sensor is dependent on a variety of factors, such as the type of sensor used, the range to which the sensor is adapted, and the applications supported by the sensor, which will be bundled into the total cost.North America is Expected to Hold Major Share • The North America region is one of the pioneers in adopting ADAS-enabled vehicles and self-driven transportation solutions. According to the Deutsche Bank, the US ADAS unit production volume is expected to reach 18.45 million by 2021.• Owing to the better performance, prominent companies, like Google, Uber, and Toyota, are using LiDAR. At the same time, the relatively lower cost has persuaded Tesla to use radar sensors as the primary sensors in its self-driving cars. The companies are continuously trying to incorporate multiple alternative sensing technologies in a vehicle to enhance the effectiveness of the system.• Prominent automakers (over 13 major auto manufacturers), and vendors offering radar sensors (Bosch, Lockheed Martin, among others) in the region are expected to emerge as a source for innovation and is estimated to hold a significant position in the market. According to the American Automotive Policy Council, over the past five years, the exports from the automotive sector were valued at USD 692 billion, and the automotive industry alone contributes to 3% of the region's GDP, which effectively contributes to the growth of the market studied.• However, due to the trade war among the USA and China, the US government is planning to increase tariffs up to 25% on vehicles and car parts imported from China. China is the second biggest exporter of components to the United States, after Mexico. The United States is one of the largest auto markets in the world, and such tariffs will likely affect the automotive sector. As per the World Trade Organization, the conflict between these countries will directly affect 3% of the global trade and 8% of the automotive industry. Such situations are expected to have an impact on the sensor landscape in robotic and ADAS vehicles in the region.Competitive LandscapeThe market for sensor landscape in robotic and ADAS vehicle is fragmented with the presence of many major players like Infineon Technologies AG, Continental AG, Texas Instrument Incorporated, etc. The market is transforming at a rapid pace, and in the coming year, many new technologies will come to challenge the existing one. However, technology companies and car manufacturers are expanding their market presence and increase their R&D efforts to provide the best safety features to the driver. • In January 2020, Continental AG announced the construction of a new plant in the city of New Braunfels in the U.S state of Texas. The new building will help it expand its capacity for the production of radar sensors for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). The company plans to invest about 100 million in the plant over the next three years.• In October 2019, Infineon Technologies AG added a new member to its automotive microcontroller family AURIX. TC3A may address new automotive 77 GHz radar applications, such as high-end corner radar systems for advanced driver assistance systems and automated driving.Reasons to Purchase this report: • The market estimate (ME) sheet in Excel format• 3 months of analyst supportKey Topics Covered:   1 INTRODUCTION1.1 Study Assumptions and Market Definition1.2 Scope of the Study2 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY4 MARKET DYNAMICS4.1 Market Overview4.2 Industry Value Chain Analysis4.3 Industry Attractiveness - Porter's Five Forces Analysis4.3.1 Bargaining Power of Suppliers4.3.2 Bargaining Power of Consumers4.3.3 Threat of New Entrants4.3.4 Threat of Substitutes4.3.5 Intensity of Competitive Rivalry4.4 Market Drivers4.4.1 Rising awareness on worker safety & stringent regulations4.4.2 Steady increase in industrial sector in key emerging countries in Asia-Pacific, coupled with expansion projects 4.5 Market Challenges4.5.1 Recent outbreak of COVID-19 and marginal decline in spending in key verticals expected to pose a concern to manufacturers4.6 Light Passenger Car and Robotic Vehicle Sales Statistics by Level of Autonomy ?4.7 Key Industry Standards & Regulations4.8 Technological Roadmap for Automotive Sensors (Radar, Camera & LiDAR)4.9 Assessment of Impact of Covid-19 on the Industry5 MARKET SEGMENTATION5.1 Type5.1.1 LiDAR (Robotic Vehicles Vs.

China's online marketplace continues to expand, and China now leads the world in cinemas with almost 70,000 movie screens at the end of 2019, most of which support 3D and many of which offer enhanced formats such as IMAX and China Giant Screen. China is now the seventh largest music market, and the fourth largest music streaming market in the world by revenue. Yet China's market for legitimate content continues to be hampered by piracy, discriminatory and restrictive market access policies, and long-standing unfulfilled international obligations.The ongoing Copyright Law amendment process is vital because a positive outcome would lay the foundation for a successful future for the creative industries in China. IIPA commends the important steps China has taken in the most recent draft amendments of the Copyright Act, including regarding public performance and broadcasting rights for producers of sound recordings.IIPA also welcomes the commitments China made on copyright enforcement under the Phase One agreement and the Guidelines on Strengthening the Protection of Intellectual Property Rights, and encourages China to continue to improve its copyright enforcement framework, including by fully implementing these commitments. In addition, China should take adequate and effective measures to tackle its growing piracy problems, and remove barriers that prevent U.S. creative industries from fully accessing the Chinese market.Unfortunately, in many respects, China has been moving in the opposite direction, introducing a number of new measures intended to restrict its growing market for creative works from foreign competition and maintaining tight national control over content and distribution.China's implementation of its WTO obligations, including the outcomes of the 2009 WTO dispute settlement decisions, remain inadequate, incomplete or delayed. These comments spell out some of these problems, with particular focus on the following:(1) Increased market access barriers to the distribution of creative content, including online, and ongoing production and investment restrictions;(2) Continued gaps and deficiencies in China's legal regime, including both copyright law and enforcement measures;(3) Need for enhanced enforcement to address the existing and evolving online piracy threats, including a continued focus on online journal piracy, emerging forms of piracy such as apps that facilitate infringement, the proliferation of Piracy Devices and circumvention devices, unauthorized camcording, and infringing content on unlicensed streaming platforms;(4) Continued piracy of printed books and other hard goods, and the need to take measures to prevent the production and distribution, including export, of such pirated products; and(5) Need for an immediate and full implementation of the U.S.-China Film Agreement.IIPA believes that progress on these issues is crucial to a successful U.S. trade and economic policy with China. As far back as the 2012 round of the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue (S&ED), the Chinese government recognized the importance of increasing sales of legitimate IP-intensive products and services in line with China's status as a globally significant marketplace. It follows from this recognition that real progress on copyright protection and enforcement, as well as on market access for copyright-dependent goods and services, must be measured based on whether there have been significant increases in sales and licensing of those copyright-intensive products.For IIPA members, this has yet to be fully realized. IIPA appreciates the inclusion of IP licensing in the Phase One purchasing commitments, and encourages the Chinese government to move expeditiously to meet its Phase One obligations to expand trade. We urge that progress in China continue to be measured based on results related to legitimate industry sales and licensing in the country.We appreciate the efforts already undertaken by the U.S. government to develop appropriate sales metrics measuring progress on key commitments, and ensuring they translate into tangible results for U.S. industries and U.S. economic and job growth.Previous IIPA comments and testimony have well documented the challenges faced by the motion picture and television, music, publishing, and entertainment software industries, and the 2020 IIPA Special 301 country report on China (submitted as an appendix to this submission) provides details on these challenges as they stood in February 2020.The following discussion highlights both potential WTO compliance issues in China, and how addressing the five key areas of change noted above can secure positive commercial gains for the creative industries going forward, which remains the ultimate goal of IIPA members' efforts in China.View full comment at: https://downloads.regulations.gov/USTR-2020-0033-0008/attachment_1.pdfRespectfully submitted,Kevin M.

Either we take down TikTok in this country for security reasons, or it's going to have to be sold, the U.S. president said. It is recalled that on August 3, Trump declared that the Chinese video-sharing app would cease to work in the United States if it was not sold to a U.S. company by September 15.            Read Also United States admit banning Chinese apps beyond TikTok                 In recent times, US policymakers have been expressing fears about the app, with many of them saying it could pose national security risks due to data that may pass on to China and propaganda that may come to the contrary.              Read Also Negotiations for sale of TikTok's U.S. business get complicated                According to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, it is concerned that Chinese technology with a Presence in the U.S. will provide data to the Beijing authorities. Earlier this month, The Wall Street Journal reported, quoted by Lusa, that negotiations for the sale of TikTok's operations in the United States had been complicated by the question of whether the application's core algorithms could be included in the deal. These algorithms decide which videos users see without first requiring them to follow other users or specify their preferences.            Read Also Beijing has a say in the sale of Tik Tok According to the American newspaper, the algorithms were integrated into the business until August 28 when the Chinese government introduced restrictions on the export of artificial intelligence technology, such as the one that feeds TikTok.The Chinese decision followed Trump's efforts to force the sale of TikTok in the U.S., where the app has 100 million users. These export restrictions mean that ByteDance will need to obtain a license to export any restricted technology to a foreign company. The question is whether its algorithms need the approval of the Chinese government to be transferred and, if so, whether Beijing will authorize the transfer, Lusa stressed. Now, according to the South China Morning Post, it has been learned that the basic algorithm is even out.            Read Also Microsoft and Walmart compete with Oracle and make offer by TikTok Among those interested in the purchase of TikTok operations in the U.S. is the duo Microsoft-Walmart.

RNC FILES COMPLAINT WITH FEC OVER TWITTER'S ILLEGAL BIDEN CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONStates News ServiceOctober 16, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 2032 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the Republican National Committee:Today, the Republican National Committee filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging that the censorship of the New York Post reporting by Twitter amounts to an illegal corporate in-kind political contribution to the Biden campaign.The complaint alleges Twitter is using its corporate resources to provide active support for Joe Biden's election. The RNC is requesting that the Commission conduct an immediate investigation into Twitter's illegal in-kind contributions to the Biden campaign, and if Twitter is found to have violated the law to impose the maximum penalty allowed under the law.Twitter's decision to censor news articles that harm Joe Biden's candidacy is so transparently biased it would make even the governments of China or North Korea blush. Fortunately, in this country, we have tools at our disposal to fight back against this type of censorship. The RNC is calling on the Federal Elections Commission to investigate whether Twitter's actions amount to an illegal corporate in-kind contribution to the Biden presidential campaign. Twitter's flagrant bias and direct support for one presidential candidacy over the other should result in the proper financial ramifications under our campaign finance laws. RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDanielA copy of the full complaint is below.October 16, 2020Lisa J. StevensonActing General CounselOffice of General CounselFederal Election Commission1050 First Street, NEWashington, D.C. 20463Re:Complaint Against Twitter, Inc. Regarding In-Kind Corporate Contributions to Biden for PresidentDear Ms. Stevenson:This letter constitutes a formal complaint filed under 52 U.S.C. 30109(a)(1) of the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) on behalf of the Republican National Committee (RNC). Based upon information and belief, as set forth below and in the attached materials, the RNC believes that Twitter, Inc. (Respondent) has violated FECA and the Commission's Regulations by making corporate in-kind contributions to Biden for President (Biden), the principal campaign committee for former Vice President Joe Biden.I.BackgroundAs of this filing, Respondent is engaged in arguably the most brazen and unprecedented act of media suppression in this country's history, and it is doing so for the clear purpose of supporting the Biden campaign.On October 14, 2020, the New York Post published the first of several articles[1] revealing emails discovered on Hunter Biden's computer which appear to portray corruption by Joe Biden and his son. In particular, the emails appear to show that Hunter Biden traded on then-Vice President Biden's position in office to extract enormous fees from companies tied to the Chinese government and in Ukraine. In at least one instance, the emails indicate an equity stake for the big guy, a possible reference to Joe Biden himself. These emails suggest that Joe Biden repeatedly has lied in denying any knowledge of, or involvement with, Hunter Biden's activities.In response, Respondent has taken unprecedented actions to suppress the articles from being shared on its platform. According to public reports, Respondent has blocked users from sending tweets that include links to the articles. Respondent also suspended, or locked, the accounts of users who shared the articles or details about the articles, including the Trump campaign (@TeamTrump), White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany (@kayleighmcenany), Republicans on the U.S. House Judiciary Committee (@JudiciaryGOP), and Jake Sherman of Politico (@JakeSherman).[2] Respondent took these actions before independent fact checkers had even weighed in on the accuracy of the story.Democrat media consultants can only dream of such abilities. Through its ad hoc, partisan suppression of media critical of Biden, Respondent is making illegal, corporate in-kind contributions as it provides unheard-of media services for Joe Biden's campaign.II.AnalysisFederal campaign finance law strictly prohibits corporations from making contributions to federal candidates. 52 U.S.C. 30118(a); 11 C.F.R 114.2(b). The term contribution is defined in relevant part to mean anything of value made by any person for the purpose of influencing an election, and includes in-kind contributions such as services. 11 C.F.R. 100.52(a) and 100.52(d)(1).[3]a.Respondent's Active Media Support Constitutes a Thing of Value.Respondent's suppression of the New York Post articles provides a thing of value to the Biden campaign. Respondent is acting as Biden's media operative, taking proactive steps to shield Biden from negative news coverage by blocking its distribution and muzzling those who try. If Respondent charged for this service, Biden no doubt would gladly pay a significant price.b.Respondent's Active Media Support is For the Purpose of Influencing an Election.Respondent's actions have not occurred in a vacuum, but rather are in keeping with the company's open support for Joe Biden and hostility towards President Trump and other conservatives. Respondent's feud with President Trump is well known, as are its frequent efforts to censor the President's tweets and the shadow banning of prominent Republicans, including RNC's Chair, Ronna McDaniel, and several Republican Members of Congress.[4] Respondent's CEO, Jack Dorsey, and other senior executives are prolific donors to the Democrat party and other left-wing causes, with 98.7% of the company's total political contributions going to Democrats.[5] In addition, there appears to be a revolving door between the Biden campaign and the company, with Respondent's Public Policy Director recently leaving to join the Biden transition team and Senator Kamala Harris's former Press Secretary now serving as Respondent's Senior Communications Manager.[6]Respondent's ham-handed attempts to justify its active media support as a result of nonpartisan corporate policy only illustrates the corporation's true partisan motives. Resondent has offered multiple explanations for its censoring of news reports that are damaging to the Biden campaign. Initially, Respondent claimed that sharing the articles was potentially harmful or that it violated rules against distributing hacked material.[7] After these explanations were apparently deemed indefensible, Respondent then claimed the articles violated its policies on displaying private information.[8] For instance, when @TeamTrump's account was locked, the on-screen explanation given was that the account had violated rules against posting private information, and the platform warned that You may not publish or post other people's private information without their express authorization and permission.Respondent's shifting explanations make clear that these public explanations are simply a pretense for its blatantly partisan election activity. The company's private information assertion is especially preposterous in light of its recent response to the New York Times' reporting on President Trump's income tax returns,[9] which were obtained in violation of federal law.[10] To the best of our knowledge, Respondent took no action whatsoever to prevent the sharing of President Trump's personal information or numerous instances of outright lies and misinformation regarding President Trump and other Republicans.III.Prayer for ReliefRespondent is a partisan actor, run by partisan Democrats, which appears to be using its corporate resources to provide active support for Joe Biden's campaign in violation of federal law. The RNC therefore respectfully requests that the Commission:1.Conduct an immediate investigation into Respondent's illegal in-kind contributions to the Biden campaign;2.Find reason to believe that Respondent has violated 52 U.S.C. 30118(a); 11 C.F.R 114.2(b); and3.Impose the maximum penalty allowed under the law.Respectfully submitted,Republican National Committee, byJustin RiemerChief CounselRepublican National Committee, byMatthew RaymerSenior Legal Advisor[1] Emma-Jo Morris and Gabrielle Fonrouge, Smoking-gun Email Reveals How Hunter Biden Introduced Ukrainian Businessman to VP Dad, New York Post, Oct. 14, 2020, https://nypost.com/2020/10/14/email-reveals-how-hunter-biden-introduced-ukrainian-biz-man-to-dad/; Emma-Jo Morris and Gabrielle Fonrouge, Hunter Biden Emails Show Leveraging Connections with his Father to Boost Burisma Pay, New York Post, Oct. 14, 2020, https://nypost.com/2020/10/14/hunter-biden-emails-show-leveraging-connections-with-dad-to-boost-burisma-pay/; Emma-Jo Morris and Gabrielle Fonrouge, Emails Reveal How Hunter Biden Tried to Cash in Big on Behalf of Family with Chinese Firm, New York Post, Oct. 15, 2020, https://nypost.com/2020/10/15/emails-reveal-how-hunter-biden-tried-to-cash-in-big-with-chinese-firm/.[2] See Jordan Davidson, Twitter Suspends Trump Campaign Account For Posting Video On Bombshell Hunter Biden Story, The Federalist, Oct. 15, 2020, https://thefederalist.com/2020/10/15/twitter-suspends-trump-campaign-account-for-posting-video-on-bombshell-hunter-biden-story/; Jordan Davidson, Twitter Bans White House Press Secretary For Sharing Hunter and Joe Biden Corruption Article, The Federalist, Oct. 15, 2020, https://thefederalist.com/2020/10/15/twitter-bans-white-house-press-secretary-for-sharing-hunter-and-joe-biden-corruption-article/; Evita Duffy, Twitter Blocks Link to House Republicans' Press Release On Hunter Biden Story, The Federalist, Oct. 15, 2020, https://thefederalist.com/2020/10/15/twitter-blocks-link-to-house-republicans-press-release-on-hunter-biden-story/; Joseph A.

Twitter's active support for the Biden campaign does not fall within this exception, however. Rather than covering or carrying a news story, Twitter is actively suppressing it. These actions are contrary both to the regulation's plain language and its purpose, which is to shield bona fide journalism from campaign finance requirements.[4] Alex Thompson, Twitter Appears to Have Fixed Shadow Ban of Prominent Republicans Like the RNC Chair and Trump Jr.'s Spokesman, Vice News, July 25, 2018, https://www.vice.com/en/article/43paqq/twitter-is-shadow-banning-prominent-republicans-like-the-rnc-chair-and-trump-jrs-spokesman.[5] https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/totals?id=D000067113; Paul Sperry, Twitter Is Run By Democratic Donors and Activists, NY Post, Aug. 4, 2018, https://nypost.com/2018/08/04/how-twitter-is-fueling-the-democratic-agenda/.[6] Sam Dorman, Twitter's Public Policy Director Leaves to Join Biden's Transition Team: Report, Fox News, Sept. 17, 2020, https://www.foxnews.com/politics/twitters-carlos-monje-biden-transition-team.[7] See Robert McMillan and Jeff Horwitz, Facebook, Twitter Limit Sharing of New York Post Articles That Biden Disputes, Wall Street Journal, Oct. 15, 2020, https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-twitter-limit-sharing-of-new-york-post-articles-that-biden-disputes-11602736535?mod=tech_lead_pos4; Jordan Davidson, Twitter Blocks Users From Linking To The New York Post's Bombshell Hunter Biden Report, The Federalist, Oct. 14, 2020, https://thefederalist.com/2020/10/14/twitter-blocks-users-from-linking-to-the-new-york-posts-bombshell-hunter-biden-report/.[8] See Robert McMillan and Jeff Horwitz, Facebook, Twitter Limit Sharing of New York Post Articles That Biden Disputes, Wall Street Journal, Oct. 15, 2020, https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-twitter-limit-sharing-of-new-york-post-articles-that-biden-disputes-11602736535?mod=tech_lead_pos4.[9] Russ Buettner, Susanne Craig, and Mike McIntire, Long-concealed Records Show Trump's Chronic Losses and Years of Tax Avoidance, Sep. 27, 2020, https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/27/us/donald-trump-taxes.html.[10] See 26 U.S.C. 6103 (confidentiality of tax returns).Load-Date: October 16, 2020End of Document

But Facebook is taking it one step further by stopping all new election ads the week prior to Election Day .Rather, indoor gatherings of people of all ages were driving the epidemic, he said.The WHO is continuing talks with China about its possible involvement in the COVAX financing scheme created to guarantee fast and equitable access globally to COVID-19 vaccines, a week after the deadline for committing passed."We're in discussions with China about the role they may play as we go forward", said Bruce Aylward, WHO senior adviser and head of the ACT-Accelerator programme to back vaccines, treatments and diagnostics against COVID-19. Some 34 countries are still deciding.DOST Secretary Fortunato dela Peña, in his weekly report, said preparations discussed by the teams include the creation of a timeline of activities for COVID-19 vaccine trials campaign, data sharing arrangements, and laboratory procedure (s) for sample collection, processing, and cryopreservation, which was sent by the WHO-Philippines.The document will be available for public comment until October 8, she said.The high levels detected in volunteers who took part in the earliest clinical trials suggest that the shots are effective and can provide immunity against the virus for an extended period of time, though final-stage testing results still need to be evaluated, Zeng Guang, chief scientist of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a briefing in Beijing on Friday.Load-Date: September 28, 2020End of Document

This is done through extensive intelligence gathering and theft of technology, research and development. This is what we must consider when building the 5G network of the future.”Sweden is the latest country to prohibit Huawei from deploying equipment, and follows all member countries of The Five Eyes - Canada, New Zealand, United States, Britain, and Australia - in swearing off the technology. The Five Eyes represent the world's most powerful intelligence community.In July, Britain announced it would unplug from Huawei, despite the decision meaning 5G rollout would be delayed by three years. (RELATED: Britain Bans A Chinese Tech Giant From Building Out 5G Technology)President Donald Trump has battled with Huawei throughout 2020, imposing an export control in May that cuts the company off from semiconductors necessary to build out technology. Experts believe 5G will help lay the groundwork for the so-called Internet of Things, a form of technology tying virtually all appliances to the internet. Sweden's decision to ban @Huawei and ZTE from their 5G telecoms networks is welcomed news and a model for our other EU partners. These unsafe vendors are proxies for the Chinese Communist Government.https://t.co/lOTF7ghSje - Sen. Marsha Blackburn (@MarshaBlackburn) October 20, 2020Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai announced in June the agency's decision to designate Huawei and ZTE as national security threats, citing the company's alleged close ties with the Chinese Communist Party and China's military apparatus. Big news: Sweden has “banned on security grounds the use of telecom equipment from China's #Huawei and ZTE in its #5G network ahead of a spectrum auction scheduled for next month.” There is global momentum toward a risk-based framework for 5G security. ????????https://t.co/aEaM9W1zhs - Ajit Pai (@AjitPaiFCC) October 20, 2020Huawei denied it was a security risk, saying that it “has never caused even the slightest shred of threat to Swedish cyber security and never will,” according to the AP. “Excluding Huawei will not make Swedish 5G networks any more secure. Rather, competition and innovation will be severely hindered.”The ban will mean more opportunities for Huawei's biggest rival, the Swedish company Ericsson, the Financial Times reported.“We cannot compromise with Sweden's security,” Friberg said.Graphic A surveillance camera is seen next to a sign of Huawei outside a shopping mall in Beijing, China January 29, 2019.

She was 87. Only the second woman to serve on the U.S.'s highest court, she served 27 years as a staunch defender of liberalism and suffered from various forms of cancer five times before she succumbed to metastatic pancreatic cancer. Her stature ascended to pop-culture icon when she was nicknamed "the notorious RBG." President Donald Trump has committed to nominating and confirming a replacement before the November election. He has repeatedly stated that his nominee will be a woman. It is widely speculated that Amy Coney Barrett, judge on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, will be Trump's choice. During her 2017 confirmation hearings, Barrett, who describes herself as an "Orthodox Catholic," was questioned whether her faith disqualified her for judicial service, prompting Democrat Senator Diane Feinstein of California to say "The Dogma lives loudly within you, and that is a concern." Trump has said that his nomination to fill the vacancy will come in the upcoming week.US set to ban Chinese appsU.S. President Donald Trump is set to ban software applications tied to large Chinese companies, most notably video sharing platform TikTok, on Sept. 20. The ban comes after months of speculation surrounding the data mining practices of certain companies. Under China's "State Capitalism" system, any company over a certain employment threshold must relinquish control of the company to the Chinese Government. The U.S. sees this as a threat to national security, as the Chinese Government has access to user data. ByteDance, the company that owns TikTok, claims that user data is stored in Singapore, and that the Chinese Government does not have access to it, a claim widely questioned by security experts. In a series of 11th Hour moves, a judge blocked the ban of WeChat, a messaging app, over concerns about freedom of speech, and ByteDance reportedly reached a deal with U.S. tech firm Oracle and retail behemoth Walmart to take control of U.S. operations of the app's over 700 million registered users.Family of Breonna Taylor settles for $12 MillionThe family of Breonna Taylor has settled with the city of Louisville for $12 million. Taylor, who was killed in a police drug raid gone wrong, was an emergency medical technician in the city. She was sleeping in her home on the night of Mar. 13 when Louisville SWAT teams executed a no-knock warrant on the wrong house, and opened fire on the bedroom. Her boyfriend, a licensed gun owner, fired a warning shot, believing the raid to be a home invasion. Taylor was shot five times and died soon after. The events of that night spurred large riots across the country and a nationwide movement to ban no-knock warrants. Also involved in the settlement is a series of police reforms, such as a reform of the way that warrants are approved, and housing credits to officers who move into low-income neighborhoods.International News:Singapore debuts COVID-19 tracing tokensIn an attempt to combat COVID-19, Singapore has distributed GPS tokens that transmit locational data to a central server. If the owner of a token tests positive for COVID-19, every person who has been within a certain distance for a certain amount of time will receive a notification and order to self-quarantine. This bolsters the efforts of the Singapore government, who also released an app several months ago for the same purpose, to combat the virus, that up to this point has infected nearly 60,000 people in the small island city state. These efforts are not without controversy, however. There are privacy concerns over where and how the data will be stored, as well as questions about who exactly can access private information.Inspiration for 'Hotel Rwanda' charged with terrorismPaul Rusesabagina, inspiration for the 2004 drama "Hotel Rwanda," has been arrested by Rwandan authorities over suspicion of terrorist activity. Rusesabagina is the leader of the Rwanda Movement for Democratic Change, a group in opposition to the current government that is believed to have an armed wing that is recognized as a terror group. Rusesabagina has been in exile since an attempt on his life in 1996. Since then, he has been living in the United States. In 2010, he returned to international prominence when he feuded with Rwandan President Paul Kigame over the latter's accusations that Rusesabagina was involved with terror groups. Rusesabagina is known for his actions during the Rwandan Genocide of 1994, in which he hid thousands of the persecuted Tutsi minority at the hotel he was managing in the capital, Kigali.UN charges Venezuela with crimes against humanityThe UN Human Rights Council has accused the current Venezuelan government of "egregious violations amounting to crimes against humanity." The Socialist government of President Nicolas Maduro and his predecessor, the late Hugo Chavez, which has been in power since 1999, has been implicated in dozens of cases of extrajudicial killings, torture and disappearances for the duration of their control of the South American country. The presidency has been in dispute since the contested 2018 elections, in which electoral irregularities caused Juan Guaido, then president of the National Assembly, to declare the results illegitimate and claim the office by right of constitutional succession. Venezuela has been in a state of economic collapse and hyperinflation since June 2010, when then-president Chavez declared a state of emergency over increasing shortages. The 2018 election only added to the crisis, with much of the western world acknowledging Guaido as the legitimate leader. Nightly protests and riots became commonplace, as was violent police intervention.Related Posts• News Briefs: National briefs• News Briefs: National newsLoad-Date: September 21, 2020End of Document

Trump Gives TikTok Deal 'His Blessing,' Promises It Will Involve $5B to Education ProgramNewsweek.comSeptember 19, 2020 Saturday 5:42 PM ESTCopyright © 2020 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 571 wordsByline: Matt KeeleyHighlight: President Donald Trump told reporters before leaving for Saturday's North Carolina rally that the deal will "have nothing to do with China" and will be "totally secure."BodyAs the Sunday deadline nears, President Donald Trump told reporters Saturday he has approved the deal for Chinese company Bytedance to sell the social media platform TikTok.Speaking to reporters before departing the White House for his Fayetteville, North Carolina rally Saturday evening, Trump said he had "given the deal my blessing." Though Trump has approved the deal, the Chinese government must now also agree.The deal would spin TikTok off into a new company, TikTok Global, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said this week. Trump said Saturday that should the deal go through as planned, TikTok Global will be based in Texas. He also said that the company would make a $5 billion contribution to an education program, but he did not clarify which or how the money would be distributed.Trump also said that the new TikTok Global company "will have nothing to do with China," adding that it will be "totally secure, that's part of the deal."Oracle Corp. announced that, as part of the deal, it would become a minority investor in the new company, and TikTok will run on the Oracle Generation 2 Cloud architecture to ensure that "U.S. TikTok user data is private an secure," according to a statement."We are a hundred percent confident in our ability to deliver a highly secure environment to TikTok and ensure data privacy to TikTok's American users, and users throughout the world. This greatly improved security and guaranteed privacy will enable the continued rapid growth of the TikTok user community to benefit all stakeholders," Oracle CEO Safra Catz said.TikTok is currently owned by the Chinese company Bytedance Ltd. Last month, Trump issued an executive order ordering that ByteDance either sell off TikTok in 90 days and destroy data gathered on U.S. users, or the app would be banned. Earlier executive orders banned the owners of TikTok and the instant messaging app WeChat from doing any business with American companies or users.WeChat is owned by the massive Chinese company Tencent, which also owns a number of video game developers like Epic Games. Trump clarified his executive order only applied to transactions involving WeChat, and that other Tencent companies and products would not be affected.Trump said in an August 6 letter to Congress that he was taking action because "data collection threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans' personal and proprietary information." He added that China could use the data to track locations of federal employees and could "build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage."The same day, the Senate unanimously voted to ban federal employees from using TikTok on government-issued phones and tablets due to fears that the Chinese government could use the app for spying. At the time, TikTok said these worries were unfounded and had planned to open a transparency center in Los Angeles to make its policies on privacy and security more clear, according to Reuters.The U.S. is not the only country to threaten to ban TikTok. The app has also been banned in India, where the two countries are in conflict over where the China-India border lies. Indonesia temporarily banned TikTok in 2018 over "inappropriate content." Japan and Pakistan have also considered banning the app; Pakistan's proposed ban would also be about content concerns.Updated 7:27 PM ET, with additional information.Link to ImageGraphic tiktokChesnot/GettyPresident Donald Trump announced Saturday that he approved the deal that would let Oracle Corp. purchase the social media platform TikTok.Load-Date: September 19, 2020End of Document

CONGRESSMAN ANDY BARR PREPARES FOR CHINA TASK FORCE REPORT TO BE ISSUED ON OCTOBER 1States News ServiceSeptember 4, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 450 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, D.C. BodyThe following information was released by the office of Kentucky Rep. Andy Barr:Congressman Andy Barr (KY-06) and his Republican colleagues on the U.S. House of Representatives China Task Force (CTF) are preparing to issue their final report on October 1. Barr serves as the Co-Chair of the CTF Subgroup on Competitiveness and the Subgroup on Economics and Energy. The CTF was established in May by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (CA-23), to hold the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) accountable for its lies about person-to-person transmission that led the COVID-19 virus to become a worldwide pandemic.The CCP is the greatest national security challenge the United States has faced in a generation, said Congressman Barr. The CTF will provide Americans with a full-scale report on the military, economic, political and technological threats the CCP poses to our republic. The CTF also offers a roadmap of strategic proposals Congress should enact to counter the CCPs most dangerous initiatives and limit their influence on the international stage.Additionally, confronting the CCP must be a bipartisan effort, Barr continued. America won the Cold War because both political parties joined together against Communism and fought to preserve our freedoms, civil liberties and capitalist economic system. Democrats need to reengage in a bipartisan commitment to counter this present Communist threat.Democrats originally agreed to participate in the CTF, but pulled out abruptly before the launch without explanation, according to Josh Rogin of The Washington Post.As part of his work on CTF, Congressman Barr proposed H.R. 7988, the NIST Cyber-Security Act. This proposal protects COVID-19 research being conducted at universities in the United States from CCP cyber-attacks. Barrs legislation instructs the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to produce standards for reducing and preventing cyber-attacks against American universities researching COVID-19. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) indicted two hackers with ties to the CCP for attempting to steal COVID-19 research in July.Lastly, Congressman Barr is also leading H.R. 7924, the Transparency in Chinese Government Investment Act (TCGIA) of 2020. The TCGIA requires public disclosure from any company listed on the U.S. stock exchange receiving CCP financial support. Companies must also disclose any company director or officer currently or formerly part of the CCP. Finally, companies must expose any ties to CCP strategic initiatives, such as Made in China 2025, that endangers American national security. Barr will be proposing additional legislation in the coming weeks to address the CCP threat.Load-Date: September 4, 2020End of Document

TikTok ban: Here's the latest on the app's fateCNN WireSeptember 25, 2020 Friday 11:55 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1070 wordsDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  A US ban on TikTok could start on Sunday. Maybe.There have been so many twists and turns in the saga of the app that each development can feel as fleeting as its 15-second videos. On Thursday, a US judge ordered the Trump administration to either postpone its ban on TikTok or respond by Friday afternoon to a request from the app's parent company, ByteDance, to temporarily block the ban.Beijing also still needs to weigh in on a deal that would see Oracle and Walmart invest in a new US-based entity, TikTok Global. And US President Donald Trump said Monday that American companies need to control the service, otherwise "we're not going to approve the deal." So the saga is far from over. But the outcome could set the tone for the future of US-China relations and create a precedent for businesses trying to navigate rising tensions between the world's two largest economies.Who will own TikTok? Trump has for weeks threatened to ban TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, on national security grounds unless an American company takes control of its US operations. TikTok has roughly 100 million users in the United States, and Trump claims the app gives Beijing access to the personal data of Americans.TikTok has denied those allegations. The company has said its data centers are located entirely outside of China and that none of that data is subject to Chinese law.Last weekend, Trump gave his blessing to a deal that would give Oracle and Walmart a combined 20% stake in TikTok Global, which would be headquartered in the United States and operate the app. Four of the company's five board members would be Americans, Oracle and Walmart said in a joint statement.ByteDance said in a statement that TikTok Global's board also "includes the founder of ByteDance ... as well as the CEO of Walmart."But there is still a lot of confusion over TikTok's proposed ownership structure should the deal go forward.While the initial announcement implied that ByteDance would continue to own the remaining 80% of TikTok, Oracle executive vice president Ken Glueck said on Monday that ByteDance will not own any part of the viral video app."Americans will be the majority and ByteDance will have no ownership in TikTok Global," said Glueck.In a separate statement Monday, ByteDance claimed that TikTok would be "a 100% owned subsidiary of Bytedance." But a person familiar with the deal said that was inaccurate.According to the person familiar with the deal, TikTok Global will be partially owned by ByteDance's international and Chinese investors, but ByteDance itself will hold zero percent of the new company. Oracle and Walmart's investment will take US ownership of TikTok Global to just over half, with ByteDance's investors holding the rest.Who needs to sign off on the deal? Trump has positioned himself as the kingmaker of any TikTok deal, making clear that he must agree to the terms before anything is made official.If that seems unusual, it's because it is. While governments often vet pending deals to protect consumers from monopoly power, and often weigh national security when a merger is announced, Trump's deep involvement is a stark departure from how deals are typically finalized --- as is his move to compel a sale in the first place."In the end, Trump is the X-factor," Dipayan Ghosh, the co-director of the Digital Platforms and Democracy Project at the Harvard Kennedy School, told CNN Business late last week. "Whatever he wishes will happen, no matter the merits of the related set of policies underlying the proposal."But the deal also needs the green light from Beijing. Last month, Chinese regulators introduced new rules that govern the sale of certain kinds of technology to foreign buyers --- a change that experts pointed out would likely require ByteDance to obtain government permission before selling TikTok to a foreign company.ByteDance has said that Oracle would be able to review the app's source code, but that the deal does not involve the transfer of its algorithms and technologies. Even so, the Chinese company said Thursday that it has applied to the Chinese government for a license to export its technology, according to a statement posted on an official Chinese social media account run by ByteDance. Officials from China's Ministry of Commerce confirmed to CNN Business that they had received the firm's license application. A source familiar with the negotiations told CNN Business earlier this week that ByteDance wasn't concerned about regulatory approval.But the deal has also received aggressive pushback from Chinese state media. State-run outlets are a powerful tool in the country's propaganda machine, and the various outlets and their editorials are often viewed as barometers of sentiment among senior officials. "US' highway robbery of TikTok completely violates market principles and the spirit of the rule of law. It is a distorted hegemonic behavior under the forced intervention of the US government," wrote the editorial board of the Global Times, a hawkish state-run tabloid. Friday's editorial was one of a few the publication released this week in opposition to the deal."What the United States has done to TikTok is almost the same as a gangster forcing an unreasonable and unfair business deal on a legitimate company," the newspaper China Daily wrote in an editorial published Wednesday, which called the deal a "dirty and underhanded trick."I use TikTok. What does it mean for me?As the situation continues to evolve, TikTok's tens of millions of US users worry they could lose access to one of their favorite products.Under the terms of the threatened ban, people who already had TikTok on their phones could still post short videos of dances, fun recipes and comedy routines per usual, but no new downloads of the app would be allowed. US users also wouldn't be able to receive security patches or other updates, which could cause outages or glitches in the future.Though a ban has been averted for now, fears about restrictions have already sent TikTok downloads soaring. They rose 12% to 247,000 in the United States last Friday, compared to the day before, according to preliminary estimates from Sensor Tower, a research firm. --- Laura He, Selina Wang, Brian Fung, Charles Riley and Julia Horowitz contributed to this report. TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Judge temporarily halts Trump's TikTok download banPolitico.comSeptember 28, 2020 Monday 2:36 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 514 wordsHighlight: President Donald Trump ordered the TikTok ban in August, citing fears U.S. users' personal information could fall into the hands of Chinese government officials.BodyA federal judge halted the Trump administration's executive order to ban downloads of Chinese-owned video-sharing platform TikTok from U.S. mobile-app stores on Sunday, hours before it was set to take effect. The decision: Washington, D.C., District Judge Carl Nichols granted TikTok's request for a temporary injunction against the ban, set to take effect at 11:59 p.m. Sunday. It's the latest development in an ongoing legal battle between TikTok and the Trump administration over the president's efforts to restrict the app's U.S. operations. President Donald Trump ordered the TikTok ban in August, citing fears U.S. users' personal information could fall into the hands of Chinese government officials. TikTok - owned-by Chinese tech giant ByteDance - sued the administration over the move, arguing the government violated its rights and that Trump's actions "clearly reflect a political decision to campaign on an anti-China platform."During a hearing to review TikTok's bid to halt the ban earlier Sunday, Nichols said it appeared that the Trump administration's order was "largely a unilateral decision with very little opportunity for plaintiffs to be heard."Nichols did not grant relief at this time on a broader set of restrictions set to take effect on November 12. The responses: "The Government will comply with the injunction and has taken immediate steps to do so, but intends to vigorously defend the E.O. and the Secretary's implementation efforts from legal challenges," the Commerce Department said in a statement.TikTok said in a statement that it is "pleased" with the decision to halt the ban, adding, "We will continue defending our rights for the benefit of our community and employees." The backdrop: The court ruling comes as the Trump administration separately conducts a national security review of a deal that would give U.S. companies Walmart and Oracle a stake in the popular app. Trump appeared to approve the proposal between ByteDance and the other companies last weekend, but on Monday said he would not support it unless Walmart and Oracle gained a controlling stake in the company. The deal the companies put forth would give Walmart and Oracle minority stakes in the new TikTok global. TikTok has maintained throughout that it would not provide any U.S. user data to the Chinese government. The company has said its proposed deal with U.S. companies should satisfy the Trump administration's national security concerns about the app. TikTok said in its statement Sunday that the company "will also maintain our ongoing dialogue with the government to turn our proposal, which the President gave his preliminary approval to last weekend, into an agreement."What's next: A separate document in which Nichols lays out the reasoning behind the decision remains under seal. The two parties are set to review its contents Monday to determine if it can be unsealed. They then will meet by Wednesday at the latest to propose a schedule for next steps in the case, which will weigh whether Trump's executive orders on TikTok violated the company's rights.Load-Date: September 28, 2020End of Document

Stocks Under Pressure as US Moves Closer to Shutdown of China-Based Apps WeChat, TikTokMT Newswires Live Briefs PROSeptember 18, 2020 Friday 12:28 PM ESTCopyright 2020 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 422 wordsBody Stocks declined Friday as Wall Street began wrapping up a likely mixed week for equity benchmarks with worries about deteriorating relations between the US and China over social media apps. Investors also appeared cautious as the day marked a session of so-called quadruple witching, or the expiration of futures and options on stock indexes and single stocks for the quarter. Sept. 30 will be the end of the third calendar quarter.On the Standard & Poor's 500 index, eight of 11 industry sectors lost ground. The information technology group suffered the most, losing 0.8% after the Trump administration said it would prohibit transactions relating to mobile apps WeChat and TikTok as of Sunday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was about split between winners and losers among its 30 stocks. Apple (AAPL), which supports WeChat through its app store, fell 2%. The tech-centric Nasdaq was down by most among the big-three benchmarks.Equities were weighed down by the US government's move against the China-based apps. The Trump administration has said the apps pose national security threats, a position disputed by WeChat and TikTok. Tencent Music (TME), which is owned by the parent company of WeChat, fell 2.5%. The Invesco China Technology ETF (CQQQ) slipped 0.1%. Shares of Oracle (ORCL) were off 0.4%, with questions surrounding the viability of the software giant's potential deal with ByteDance for the US operations of TikTok.A deal is still likely to be reached, said Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives in a note Friday. "The broader worry is that if a deal is not reached over the next 48 hours with approval by the Chinese government around source code access and majority ownership, this shutdown move could be a Fort Sumter moment in the US/China cold tech war tensions with retaliation on the horizon," said Ives.For the week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was on course to rise by about 0.6%. The S&P 500 was edging down 0.1% and the Nasdaq headed toward a 0.5% loss.Among corporate movers, United States Steel (X) gained 9% following its projection of a narrower-than-expected adjusted loss of about $1.45 per share for the third quarter. Also up, Blink Charging (BLNK) climbed 5% as the maker of charging equipment for electric vehicles said it has acquired Los Angeles-based BlueLA Carsharing.Beyond Meat (BYND) dropped nearly 6% following a JP Morgan downgrade to underweight from neutral of the alternative meat maker.In afternoon trading, the Dow fell 0.2%, the S&P 500 lost 0.6% and the Nasdaq Composite gave up 0.9%.Load-Date: September 18, 2020End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 27 of 430China proposes global data protection standards  Page 30 of 430China moves forward with digital currency plans  Page 32 of 430Successful TikTok platform becomes focus of US-China war  Page 34 of 430US bans WeChat, TikTok from app stores citing security risk  Page 36 of 430US bans WeChat, TikTok from app stores, threatens shutdowns  Page 39 of 430US bans WeChat, TikTok from app stores, threatens shutdowns  Page 41 of 430US judge sets up fresh roadblock in Pres Trump bid to ban China's TikTok  Page 43 of 430US weighs on restricting use of Chinese payment platforms Alipay and WeChat Pay  Page 45 of 430US bans Chinese TikTok and WeChat apps from Sunday  Page 48 of 430Trump Backs Proposed Deal to Keep TikTok Operating In U.S.  Page 66 of 430Briefing.com: Hourly In Play (R) - 09:00 ET  Page 86 of 430Briefing.com: Hourly In Play (R) - 10:00 ET  Page 107 of 430Briefing.com: Hourly In Play (R) - 11:00 ET  Page 130 of 430Briefing.com: Hourly In Play (R) - 12:00 ET  Page 154 of 430Briefing.com: Hourly In Play (R) - 13:00 ET  Page 180 of 430Briefing.com: Hourly In Play (R) - 15:00 ET  Page  of Facebook removes fake Chinese accounts posting about U.S. elections  Page 183 of 430China Loosens Visa Restrictions for Foreigners Amid Coronavirus Pandemic  Page 185 of 430Pelosi: Congress to consider two bills targeting Chinese forced labor  Page 188 of 430Trump backs proposed deal to keep TikTok operating in US  Page 191 of 430Trump backs proposed deal to keep TikTok operating in US  Page 193 of 430US MULLS CURBS ON CHINA'S WECHAT PAY, ALIPAY PLATFORMS: REPORT  Page 206 of 430Supreme Court Battle: Dems, Biden Threaten to Stop President Trump Nominee; Biden: I should be the One to fill Ginsburg's Seat; President Trump Weighs Top Conte....  Page 208 of 430UN: ON 75TH ANNIVERSARY, RECOMMIT TO HUMAN RIGHTS  Page 210 of 430The demise of WeChat  Page 224 of 430Facebook, Twitter slow the spread of New York Post story on Hunter Biden; Number of new daily coronavirus cases in Europe surpasses the United States; Wells Far....  Page 228 of 430First Huawei and now TikTok: what interests are behind the spy speech?  Page 230 of 430RUBIO, MERKLEY INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO STRENGTHEN U.S.-TAIWAN RELATIONS  Page 233 of 430IU student Dilyar Muradil shares experience growing up as an Uyghur  Page 236 of 430Q&A: What does a deal between TikTok and Oracle mean?  Page 239 of 430Q&A: What does a deal between TikTok and Oracle mean?  Page 241 of 430UN General Assembly: U.S.-China crossing and strong complaint of Bolsonaro at opening  Page 255 of 430Kayleigh McEnany is Interviewed about the Supreme Court, TikTok, and Stimulus; Jobs in America; Interview with Rep.
