FBI Director Issues Remarks at Corporate Directors Global Board Leaders SummitTargeted News ServiceOctober 1, 2018 Monday 6:40 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2730 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe U.S. Department of Justice's Federal Bureau of Investigation issued the following remarks by Director Christopher Wray at the National Association of Corporate Directors Global Board Leaders Summit, "The FBI and Corporate Directors: Working Together to Keep Companies Safe from Cyber Crime":"Thanks, Peter. It's great to be here with you."One of our priorities at the FBI is building relationships at the corporate level. This is our inaugural meeting with such a large group of board members. And it's incredibly important to me. Because we need your help to confront the threats we face."I was in the private sector for 12 years before coming back to law enforcement. And there are a few things I miss about life in the private sector--mostly living outside of the Beltway, way outside of the Beltway--and being able to drive my own car. That's one of the things you don't think about before taking a job like this--the driving."Another thing I sometimes miss is the focused nature--relatively speaking--of practicing law. At my old law firm, I ran an international practice group and served on our firm's policy committee. And I sometimes thought I had a lot on my plate then. My scope of responsibility is just a bit more broad these days. And needless to say, my hair is a lot more gray, as my kids like to remind me on a regular basis."But I was thinking about it, and the same is true for all of you. Not the gray hair part--the responsibility part. You've got to understand almost every aspect of the companies you serve--strategy, succession, performance; vulnerabilities; and the needs of management, employees, customers, and shareholders. And you've got to be able to see the big picture--what's coming down the road. That can be a lot of responsibility."And your burdens aren't getting any lighter in this brave new world. A world where terrorism moves at the speed of social media. A world where hackers for hire and nation-state adversaries are using cyber as a weapon--to steal our innovation, our data, our secrets, and our technology. A world where geopolitics, global markets, and crime have converged."I want to give you a sense of how the FBI is thinking about these threats--in particular, cybersecurity and espionage. And some sense, from our perspective, of what we can do together to fight them. And then I'll take a few questions."Let's start with the cyber threat."The cyber threat has evolved dramatically since I left DOJ's leadership in 2005, partly reflecting how much the digital world has itself evolved over that time. Back then, "tweeting" was something only birds did. I've noticed it's a bit more popular now. Today, we live much of our lives online, and everything that's important to us, and to your companies, lives on the Internet--on our devices, our systems, our networks, and in the cloud--which means this threat is now coming at us from all sides."We're worried about a wider range of threat actors, from multi-national cyber syndicates and insider threats to hacktivists. And we're concerned about a wider gamut of methods, from botnets to ransomware, from spearfishing to business email compromise and APTs--advanced persistent threats. We're seeing these diverse threats in every company, at every level."The days of wondering if you're going to be the next victim are gone. Now it's a matter of how often you'll get hit, and how bad it'll be. And we're not talking just about defense contractors or critical infrastructure. Every company is a target. Every single bit of information, every system, and every network is a target. Every link in the chain is a potential vulnerability."We're talking about the vendors you work with. Your contractors--and their sub-contractors, over whom you may have little or no supervision, or even knowledge. Your supply chains--especially technology supply chains, because the hardware components and software code often comes from foreign sources, including developers in Russia and China. And even your own employees--what we call the "insider threat." We're seeing more incidents of employees taking proprietary information when they're about to be on the job market. And we're seeing business competitors--and foreign governments--seeking to place spies into rival companies to gain access to information."The danger isn't limited to data exfiltration or manipulation or ransomware attacks. Access alone can cause a real problem. And most companies don't see that as an issue. But think about it for a moment. Who has access to your proprietary information? Who has information about your day-to-day operations and decision-making? Your long-term plans? Who holds the keys to the kingdom? Should they? Once someone has access to your data, your ideas, and your innovation, it's practically impossible to pull it back. Even worse, you may never even know you've got a problem."And the more we expand our global footprint, the more we do business in other countries, the more risk we assume on the cyber front. Even local companies often draw from global supply chains, a global talent pool, and global internet and communications systems."I want to focus for a moment on the increase in nation-state sponsored computer intrusions. It's no surprise to anyone in this room that China, in particular, seeks our information, our technology, and our military secrets. They seek to gain any advantage on the global stage, through whatever data they can pilfer. They're using an expanding set of non-traditional methods--both lawful and unlawful--like cyber intrusions, foreign investment, corporate acquisitions, and supply chain threats."As just one example, last November, the DOJ unsealed indictments against three Chinese nationals for computer hacking, theft of trade secrets, conspiracy, and identity theft against employees and computers of three corporate victims over a six-year period. These three individuals worked for a China-based Internet security firm. They used their access to the computer systems of these three corporations to exfiltrate sensitive internal documents and trade secrets to help Chinese companies improperly gain a competitive advantage."The Chinese government isn't pulling any punches. They're strategic in their approach--they actually have a formal plan, set out in five-year increments, to achieve dominance in critical areas."Another example: In April of this year, we charged nine individuals and companies with conspiracy to commit economic espionage and theft of trade secrets from a U.S. company for the benefit of several Chinese state-owned enterprises."That U.S. company manufactures syntactic foam--a strong, lightweight material with commercial and military uses, including in U.S. Navy submarines and vessels. Syntactic foam was specifically identified in China's 12th five-year plan as a technology China wanted to acquire. The scheme--funded by millions of dollars from China--involved setting up a front company and recruiting employees of the victim company with access to trade secrets."We're getting more serious about the China threat. And we're asking you to get more serious about that threat, too. Because it's only going to get worse. No country poses a broader, more severe intelligence collection threat than China. Actors working to benefit China--including state-owned and ostensibly private companies--are the most active perpetrators of economic espionage against us."We have economic espionage investigations that almost invariably lead back to China in all 56 field of our field offices, spanning almost every industry or sector. And China is by no means the only aggressor. Russia, for instance, is still a serious threat. But Russia, in many respects, is struggling to stay relevant after the fall of the Soviet Union--they're fighting today's fight. They remain one of our most tenacious adversaries. But China is fighting tomorrow's fight, and they want what we have so they can get the upper hand on us."A Harvard psychology professor has argued that humans are good at reacting to immediate threats, but we're not so great at reacting to gradual threats. We can recognize acute problems with local, short-term consequences--a child with the flu, a broken air conditioner, a crisis at work. But we don't respond as effectively to chronic problems, even those entailing global, long-term consequences."That's one reason why counterintelligence threats are often underestimated. It's much easier for the FBI to respond to a bank robbery than to understand and combat a gradual process like technology theft or malign foreign influence. Even though these are the generational threats that will shape our nation's future, and determine what we'll look like in 20 years, in 50 years."Our folks in the FBI are working their tails off every day to find and stop the criminals and nation-state adversaries targeting your companies. To address the threat from nation-state actors, we're using a broad set of tools and allies. Sometimes we use our traditional law enforcement authorities to arrest a malicious actor. But we might also work with the State Department to have a subject's visa revoked. We might work with the departments of Commerce or Treasury to sanction a foreign company for misconduct. Or we might work directly with a U.S. company to help identify and remove an insider threat."On the cyber front, we've got Cyber Task Forces in each of our 56 field offices across the country--with partners from over 180 different local, state, and federal agencies. We have more than 20 cyber investigators in key locations around the world. Our Cyber Action Team maintains an elite rapid response capability we can deploy around the country. And we operate a 24/7 steady-state watch capability called CyWatch."But we can't do it on our own. We've got to work together, particularly with those of you in the private sector. We're sharing indicators of compromise, tactics cyber criminals are using, and strategic threat information whenever we can. I'm sure you can appreciate there are times when we can't share as much as we'd like to, but we're trying to get better and smarter about that."The vast majority of our critical infrastructure is in the hands of the private sector, of course. You own it, you run it--you're on the front lines. You know the risks, you know the weak spots, and you're more likely to see emerging threats coming down the road. That's why it's so important for us to keep these lines of communication open."I want to turn to the role of the board of directors for a moment. As board members, you're expected to take the enterprise-level view. You're expected to have that 360-degree perspective of the whole organization. And unlike the CEO or executive management, you're not typically involved in the day-to-day operation of the company. As leaders, we know that the day-to-day grind is tough. There's too much to do, and too little time to do it. So all the stakeholders of a company, from the shareholders to executive management, are relying on you to see the big picture."They're relying on you to have a mature understanding of the risks and vulnerabilities at hand. What questions should you be asking yourselves? What decisions should you be making right now? Management might be focused on near-term objectives, but you've got to play the long game--balancing short-term profitability with long-term risk. A decision to enter into a joint venture or contract with a particular vendor or cloud computing company may look good today--it may make a lot of money today. But that decision might not look so great five years down the road, if you're in the middle of a slow bleed of data. Or, worse, if you're suffering a major hemorrhage of intellectual property."As members of the board, you can, and should, help keep the companies you serve focused on what information is most important to protect. You've got to work with executive management to establish and communicate a clear information security plan. You've got to be confident in your organization's plan to restrict access to protected information, and its ability to monitor who's accessing that data. You've got to ensure that the responsible executives have established an enterprise-wide cyber risk management framework. You've got to know that your organization has business continuity plans in place now, before the crisis strikes. And if you do suffer a breach, it's important to take the long-term view."Getting the FBI involved early allows us--and our federal partners--to mitigate any ongoing damage to your networks and your data. It helps us connect the intrusion on your systems to any larger threat streams, and give you the information you need to understand what happened. It helps mitigate any risk to your reputation from a delayed notification. And it helps us notify other potential victims."I know there's sometimes a reluctance out there to turn to the feds when you've been hacked. But we're not going to rush in wearing raid jackets and shut down your operations. In our eyes, you are--and you should be treated as--a victim. But time is of the essence in these cases."So, please, when you see indications of unauthorized access or malware on your systems, when an attack results in a significant loss of data or control of systems, when there's a potential impact to national security, economic security, or public health and safety, or when an intrusion affects critical infrastructure, reach out to us. Call your local field office. In every field office, we have a private sector coordinator dedicated to engaging with your companies. We want to work with you, we want to help you. But we can't do anything to help if you don't turn to us."One of our cyber executives uses a great analogy to describe the cyber threat. He talks about working on a case with the port authority as an agent in South Texas. And there was an accident on the water one night, when a tugboat pushing a number of barges smashed into a pylon on a bridge. The agent asked a few questions: "How fast was the tugboat going? And how long does it take to stop?" And the port authority guy said, "Oh, about 5-7 knots. And it takes about 200 yards to stop.""The agent could see the lights on the tug only illuminated the ship up to the bow, which was a big problem. Because the boat captain couldn't see the bridge up ahead. So that accident actually happened about two minutes before the collision--the moment the tug lost its ability to maneuver around the danger. He couldn't stop, and he couldn't steer fast enough to avoid the collision. The same is true for all of us."The bad guys--hackers for hire, nation-state adversaries, and organized criminals--they're taking advantage of mistakes and vulnerabilities. They're sitting on our systems, lurking. And if they're not there yet, they're making every effort to get there. Many of the intrusions we're seeing now actually happened some time ago--sometimes even years."For companies to wait until there's an impact before re-positioning, before tightening up systems, is a mistake. Because by then, it'll be too late. The accident will be unavoidable. And when it happens, we're all just reacting after-the-fact to a bad situation. And that's not the best case scenario for anyone."We want to be ahead of the threat; we want to prevent you from being victimized in the first place. To do that, we've got to have a full understanding of what you're seeing. We want to know what keeps you up at night. What could damage your operations, your information, your networks, your people, your reputation? How are you addressing those risks? We've got to get to know each other, and the challenges we're facing."We've got to build these relationships now. If a crisis does strike, it's much easier to work together when we already have that baseline relationship--that initial sense of trust and understanding. To coin the old saying: "The best time to patch the roof is when the sun is shining.""We'll keep doing what we can on our end to build these relationships--at the national level, with conferences like this, and at the local level, through our field offices. And we'd ask you to reach out to us, to talk to us about what you're seeing, and to let us know how we can help. I hope we can keep this forward momentum going."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6481119 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: October 15, 2018End of Document

Three-Person Teams Tasked With Monitoring Religious Venues in WenzhouTargeted News ServiceOctober 17, 2018 Wednesday 8:21 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 725 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyInternational Christian Concern issued the following news release:In its latest attempt to ensure that religion is under the government's control, Wenzhou city, also known as "China's Jerusalem," has set up a three-person team mechanism to monitor religious venues with the goal of checking on security, collecting information, providing guidance and education, and keeping an eye on their activities.In a series of undated photos recently published online by the Chinese Christian Fellowship of Righteousness, several Powerpoint slides which appear to be training materials for local officials lay out details of the composition, objectives, and implementation of this new measure.The three-person teams will be comprised of select leaders of local offices. Each team will be assigned to specific religious venues and is responsible for monitoring them.The teams will check on each religious venue based on five "Ones." Each location must have the following: one patriotic flag, one theme [to align faith with government's agenda], one educational workshop, one bulletin with propaganda materials, and one set of management rules.They are also responsible for registering the venues with the Ethnic and Religious Affairs Intelligence Control System, a software installed last year by Wenzhou city's Ethnic and Religious Affairs Bureau with the goal of strengthening the administration of these affairs and improving the management of fire, building, and activity safety at religious venues.In addition, every month, they must conduct at least two safety inspections, provide two educational guides, submit one report to the authority, and preemptively deal with any situations on-site that could lead to problems later.The slides also provide several pointers for the team members to identify and report violations among religious venues: 1) Do religious activities take place at the religious venue? 2) Are religious activities being administered by foreigner(s) or is there any foreigner present? 3) Are there any minors who are participating in the religious activities? 4) Are the religious activities pre-approved according to the law? 5) Are the religious activities of regular occurrence?"Religious freedom in China has really reached to the worst level that has not been seen since the beginning of the Cultural Revolution by Chairman Mao [Zedong] in the 1960s."Although there is no explicit mention of which religious venues the government is targeting, given the high percentage of Christians in Wenzhou, it is safe to assume that churches will be greatly impacted by this new measure.Wenzhou was targeted in an aggressive cross removal campaign in 2014, where it saw thousands of crosses toppled and churches demolished. Government-sanctioned churches and house churches alike could not escape this fate. Dozens of Christians were detained and imprisoned and, though most of them have been released, a few still remain behind bars for defending their crosses.A few days ago, on October 11, a Catholic church in Lingkun saw its cross toppled after the last cross in Wenzhou was removed four years ago. The perimeter wall in front of the building was also demolished. Some are concerned that another crackdown may be looming as numerous cases of cross removals and forced church closures are spreading across China, including in Henan, Beijing, Guangzhou, and Chengdu.Additionally, the Chinese government has crafted a five-year plan to make Christianity align with socialism, in which there will be a new interpretation of the Bible. The plan enacted by state-sanctioned organizations Three-Self Patriotic Movement (TSPM) and China Christian Council (CCC) has a goal to "Sinicize" Christianity.Rev. Bob Fu, president of the watchdog organization China Aid, testified before Congress on September 28, warning that "religious freedom in China has really reached to the worst level that has not been seen since the beginning of the Cultural Revolution by Chairman Mao [Zedong] in the 1960s."Beijing is getting more creative with the ways they persecute the Church in China. We must pray that Chinese Christians are equipped with godly wisdom to deal with the challenging and evolving oppression surrounding them daily.Contact: Olivia Miller, communications coordinator, press@persecution.orgCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6484749 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: October 18, 2018End of Document

The Divide Between Silicon Valley and Washington Is a National-Security ThreatAtlantic OnlineDecember 13, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 2622 wordsByline: Amy Zegart and Kevin ChildsBodyA silent divide is weakening America's national security, and it has nothing to do with President Donald Trump or party polarization. It's the growing gulf between the tech community in Silicon Valley and the policy-making community in Washington.Beyond all the acrimonious headlines, Democrats and Republicans share a growing alarm over the return of great-power conflict. China and Russia are challenging American interests, alliances, and values-through territorial aggression; strong-arm tactics and unfair practices in global trade; cyber theft and information warfare; and massive military buildups in new weapons systems such as Russia's "Satan 2" nuclear long-range missile, China's autonomous weapons, and            satellite-killing capabilities to destroy our communications and imagery systems in space. Since Trump took office, huge bipartisan majorities in Congress have passed tough sanctions against Russia, sweeping reforms to            scrutinize and block Chinese investments in sensitive American technology industries, and record defense-budget increases. You know something's big when senators like the liberal Ron Wyden and the conservative John Cornyn start agreeing.In Washington, alarm bells are ringing. Here in Silicon Valley, not so much. "Ask people to finish the sentence, 'China is a ____ of the United States,'" said the former National Economic Council chairman Keith Hennessey. "Policy makers from both parties are likely to answer with 'competitor,' 'strategic rival,' or even 'adversary,' while Silicon Valley leaders will probably tell you China is a 'supplier,' 'investor,' and especially 'potential market.'"[Ash Carter: America needs to align technology with a public purpose]In the past year, Google executives, citing ethical concerns, have canceled an artificial-intelligence project with the Pentagon and refused to even bid on the Defense Department's Project JEDI, a desperately needed $10 billion IT-improvement program. While stiff-arming Washington, Google has been embracing Beijing, helping the Chinese government develop a more effective censored search engine despite outcries from human-rights groups, American politicians, and, more recently,            its own employees. Since the 2016 presidential election, Facebook executives have been apologizing to Congress in public while waging a campaign to            deny, delay, and deflect regulation and stifle critics in private.Former Secretary of Defense            Ash Carter, Google's Eric Schmidt, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, LinkedIn's Reid Hoffman, Code for America's Jen Pahlka, and others have been working hard to bridge the divide, bringing technology innovation to Washington and a sense of national service to the tech industry. But their efforts are nowhere near enough. The rift is real, deep, and a long time coming, because it's really three divides converging into one.There is a yawning civil-military relations gap between the protectors and the protected. When World War II ended, veterans could be found in seven out of 10 homes on a typical neighborhood street. Today it's two. Less than half a percent of the U.S. population serves on active duty. A senior executive from a major Silicon Valley firm recently told us that none of the company's engineers had ever seen anyone from the military.It should come as no surprise that when people live and work in separate universes, they tend to develop separate views. The civil-military gap helps explain why many in tech companies harbor deep ethical concerns about helping warfighters kill people and win wars, while many in the defense community harbor deep ethical concerns about what they view as the erosion of patriotism and national service in the tech industry. Each side is left wondering, How can anyone possibly think that way? Asked last week what he would tell engineers at companies like Google and Amazon, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford said, "Hey, we're the good guys ... It's inexplicable to me that we wouldn't have a cooperative relationship with the private sector."There's a training gap between leaders in Washington, who are mostly lawyers struggling to understand recent technological advances, and leaders in Silicon Valley, who are mostly engineers struggling to understand the age-old dynamics of international power politics. Congress has 222 lawyers but just eight engineers. On the Senate Armed Services Committee, it's even more stark. Of its 25 members, 17 are lawyers and just one is an engineer. (He's actually the only engineer in the entire Senate.) In the past, policy makers didn't have to work that hard to understand the essence of breakthrough technologies like the telegraph, the automobile, and nuclear fission. Sure, technology moved faster than policy, but the lag was more manageable. Digital technologies are different, spreading quickly and widely on the internet, with societal effects that are hard to imagine and nearly impossible to contain. Understanding these technologies is far more challenging, and understanding them fast is essential to countering Russia and China.At the same time, today's brightest young engineers barely remember 9/11, view the Cold War as ancient history rather than lived experience, and can get computer-science degrees at elite institutions without ever taking a course about cybersecurity or thinking about what is in the national interest. For technologists, technology holds the promise of a brighter future, not the peril of dark possibilities. Their overriding challenge is getting a breakthrough to work, not imagining how it could be used by bad actors in nefarious ways.[           Read: Is America any safer since 9/11?]The congressional hearings with the Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on April 10 and 11 brought the two perspectives-and the chasm between them-into full view. For the tech community, it was a jaw-dropping moment that revealed just how little members of Congress know about the products and companies that are transforming global politics, commerce, and civil society. Senator Orrin Hatch appeared surprised to learn that Facebook earned the majority of its revenue through ad sales. "How do you sustain a business model in which users don't pay for your service?" Hatch asked quizzically. "Senator, we run ads," replied Zuckerberg, his aides grinning behind him. Senator Lindsey Graham asked whether Twitter was the same thing as Facebook. Even Senator Brian Schatz, considered one of Congress's tech aficionados, didn't seem to know the difference between social media, email, and encrypted text messaging. As Ash Carter wrote, "All I can say is that I wish members [of Congress] had been as poorly prepared to question me on war and peace in the scores of testimonies I gave as they were when asking Facebook about the public duties of tech companies."For the policy-making community, the hearings were a jaw-dropping moment showing just how much naïveté and profits were driving Facebook's decisions, and just how little Zuckerberg and his team ever considered the possibility that all sorts of bad actors could use their platform in all sorts of very bad ways. In his opening statement, Zuckerberg admitted, "Facebook is an idealistic and optimistic company. For most of our existence, we focused on all of the good that connecting people can do." Zuckerberg added, "But it's clear now that we didn't do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm."The third divide is generational. In Washington, power runs vertically and rests in the hands of gray eminences. In Silicon Valley, power runs horizontally and rests in the hands of wunderkinds and their friends. Steve Jobs was 21 years old when he started Apple with his buddy Steve Wozniak. Bill Gates quit college his junior year to start Microsoft. Zuckerberg launched Facebook in his sophomore dorm room. Larry Page and Sergey Brin were old men, starting Google at the age of 25. In the policy world, 30 years of experience usually makes you powerful. In the technical world, 30 years of experience usually makes you obsolete. Policy makers who think college engineering students should be grateful for the opportunity to shadow them and photocopy during college summers have it all wrong. Interns on Capitol Hill answer phones. Interns at SpaceX launch rockets into orbit. For gray eminences silently lamenting in their Washington corner offices, "Who needs these whiny young Millennials?" the answer is: America does.It's hard to overstate just how foreign the worlds of Washington and Silicon Valley have become to each other. At the exact moment that great-power conflict is making a comeback and harnessing technology is the key to victory, Silicon Valley and Washington are experiencing a "policy makers are from Mars, tech leaders are from Venus" moment, with both sides unable to trust or understand each other. Even the dress codes are vexing and perplexing. In the tech industry, adults dress like college kids. Inside the Beltway, college kids dress like adults.Closing this divide is a national-security imperative. And it requires thinking differently, generating inspiration rather than just regulation, and targeting the leaders of tomorrow, not just the leaders of today.For starters, the Pentagon needs a messaging overhaul. Stop telling engineering students at top universities, "If you want to make money, go into industry, but if you want a mission bigger than yourself, work for me." When Admiral Mike Rogers, who led the U.S. Cyber Command and the National Security Agency, gave this standard recruiting pitch to Stanford undergraduates a few years ago, it fell flat. It still does. We recently held a focus group of Stanford computer-science majors. When we tested the message on them, heads started shaking in a Wow, you just don't get it kind of way. "One of the main reasons people pick companies is they want to do social good," said  Anna Mitchell, a senior. "People would laugh if the government said the only way to be impactful is to work in government."[           Read: How do Americans weigh privacy vs. national security?]For these students and their peers, the desire for impact is real and deep. They believe that they can achieve large-scale change faster and better outside the government than within it. "A message suggesting a dichotomy of working in companies versus helping your country alienates a good portion of people on the fence," Michael Karr, a Stanford junior, told us. "If you're working on autonomous vehicles, you could be saving lives by making cars safer." So what message does work? Giving them opportunities for impact at scale that don't take a lifetime of moving up the ladder. Deploying the best young engineers against the toughest challenges, early. Telling them what Kevin tells potential recruits: If you do cyber operations for anyone else, you'll get arrested. If you do them for me in the Air Force, you'll get a medal.The Pentagon also needs to create ambassadors, not lifers. More than getting technical experts into government for their entire careers, we need to get more national-security-minded engineers into tech companies. Winning hearts and minds in the tech world starts early, with new college graduates who are more open to new experiences that can last a lifetime. Imagine a Technology Fellows Program like the White House Fellows program, only younger. It would select the 50 most talented American engineering students graduating from college for a prestigious, one-year, high-impact stint in government service, working directly for senior leaders like the Air Force chief of staff, the secretary of defense, or the commander of U.S. forces in the Middle East.Tech fellows would work on the most important projects and participate in special programs for their cohort to bond and form a lifelong network. "People really care about their cohort," said Andrew Milich, a Stanford senior specializing in artificial intelligence. Tech fellows could defer company jobs or take a leave of absence, knowing that all the other fellows would be the best in the world who would also be heading back to industry. The goal isn't for them to stay in government. The goal is for their government experience to stay with them. As one of our students told us, "Everyone has a friend at Google." Imagine the ripple effects if these friend networks across the tech industry included tech-fellow alumni.Doing it right won't be easy. The Tech Fellows Program would have to be high on prestige and low on bureaucracy. Fellows would need flexibility to select projects that align with their values, not just their expertise. As the sophomore Gleb Shevchuk told us, "There has to be a transparent discussion of ethics. The program has to come off as a program that understands the concerns of people who dislike certain things the government is doing." Google engineers may object to helping the Pentagon improve its targeting algorithms, but they might jump at the chance to defend U.S. satellites from attacks in space.[           Read: Silicon valley falls to Earth]In addition, the program would have to reduce logistical pain points dramatically. Tech companies compete aggressively on quality-of-life dimensions for their workforce-locating in cities where top talent wants to live, providing free housing and transportation, and offering exciting programs outside of the job. The Tech Fellows Program would need to do the same. The National Security Agency has cutting-edge technological programs that would be a natural fit for tech fellows, but that's a hard sell. The hot cities for attracting top engineers include Austin, Seattle, San Francisco, New York, and Denver-but not Fort Meade.In the longer term, the Pentagon needs a radically new civilian talent model. Programs like the Air Force's Kessel Run and the Defense Digital Service are breaking new ground to bring technology and tech talent into the Pentagon, but these programs are green shoots surrounded by red tape. Will Roper, the assistant secretary of the Air Force for acquisition, technology, and logistics, and someone who is no stranger to innovating inside the Defense Department, would like to see a much more fluid pathway in and out of industry and government. "I would invest to make the term revolving door superlative instead of pejorative," he told a Georgetown class. "The people that we want are going to be people in industry that will want to come in and help us, and be able to go back out and come back in and help us, [so] that we're continually refreshing the ideas, the creative thought ... and right now we make it damn difficult to get in and out of government."These challenges are substantial, but small steps could have big impact over time. Congress could start by holding hearings with the goal of writing the best proposals into the National Defense Authorization Act this year. And if Congress doesn't take action, then the Pentagon should, creating a Rapid Capabilities Office dedicated to developing new civilian talent programs, just like it has for developing new technologies.In 1957, the launch of Sputnik spawned a fear that an underfunded education system had allowed the U.S. to lose its technological advantage to the Soviets. A year after the launch, Congress passed the National Defense Education Act, increasing funding for science, mathematics, and foreign-language education at all levels and allowing for substantially more low-cost student loans. Within a decade, the number of college students in the U.S. had more than doubled, supercharging U.S. breakthroughs in the space race. What our national leaders realized in 1957 is still true today: What people know and how they think are just as important to the nation's defense as the weapon systems we deploy.Load-Date: December 14, 2018End of Document

Donald Trump threatens more tariffs prior to the G20CE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 28, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 480 wordsBody This Saturday will be held what is probably the most relevant meeting of the G20 meeting to be held in Argentina: the meeting between the presidents of China, Xi Jinping, and the United States, Donald Trump.  The focus of the meeting will be to reach some kind of agreement that ends the trade war between both countries, since the US president began to impose tariffs on Chinese imports to, in his opinion, favor local production, a measure that It was later replicated by the Chinese government.  Donald Trump himself, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, said on Monday that, if there is no agreement in the meeting with his counterpart in China, he is ready to increase tariffs, from US $ 200 billion to around US $ 267 thousand. millions in Chinese products.  He even said that new tariffs could be applied to Apple's iPhone, and laptops imported from China. Americans could tolerate "without any difficulty" a 10% tariff, he added.  "The only agreement would be for China to open competition with the United States," the president said, according to the newspaper. "As for the other countries, that depends on them," he said.  In September, the Trump government deepened its trade war against China by imposing a 10% tariff on US $ 200,000 million in Chinese goods and said the rate would rise to 25% on January 1.  "First of all it's a negotiation tactic," said Tao Dong, vice president of Credit Suisse Private Banking for China in Hong Kong. "Pressing hard on the other side seems to be a constant pattern of the Trump government," he said.  Yesterday afternoon, Trump's chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said there are key issues that are still pending between the two countries, such as the US accusations against China for violating intellectual property and forcing technology transfers.  Kudlow pointed out that Trump "has indicated a certain optimism. We have an opportunity to extend that optimism if we achieve rapprochement, "said the advisor.  Effects  The market reacted to the downside, during the first hours of transactions, mainly by declines in the technology sector and with Apple's stock falling around 2%.  During hours of the afternoon, the S & P500 recovered what was lost and ended with a marginal profit, while Apple limited its losses.  Among the news that brought relief to the market during the day, was a statement by the vice president of the Fed, Richard Clarida, who remarked the word "gradual" for future rate hikes by the monetary authority. He also stated that currently the US ruling rate is much closer to its neutral level.  On another issue, Trump, in addition, yesterday threatened to leave GM without subsidies -including those for electric cars-, after the decision of the automaker to close factories in three US states.  The Donald Trump entry threatens more tariffs before the G20 was first published in La Tercera. Load-Date: November 28, 2018End of Document

Global IoT in Manufacturing Market 2018-2024 with Cisco Systems, IBM, PTC and General Electric DominatingPR NewswireNovember 23, 2018 Friday 8:30 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1747 wordsDateline: DUBLIN, Nov. 23, 2018 BodyPR NewswireThe"Global IoT in Manufacturing Market- Market Share and Industry Forecast to 2024"report has been added toResearchAndMarkets.com'soffering.Global IoT in manufacturing market is expected to grow with an impressive CAGR of 29.4% during the forecast period 2017-2024IoT is transforming the way organizations operate and manage their business. IoT in manufacturing enables collection of data from different things about production, quality, operations, quality and consumption, and use it to streamline and refine the business process. Industrial IoT has emerged as an important tool with corresponding implications for data analytics in manufacturing.One of the key trends in the market is the rising adoption of IoT in manufacturing and industrial sector considering its benefits such as its capacity to receive, gather and send information, embed connectivity and intelligence into devices and set up processes and applications in order to analyse data and automate manufacturing processes.As per the company sources, on May 2017, Mitsubishi and KUKA AG agreed for a partnership with SAP to get IoT applications. This partnership would help both the companies to access IoT applications such as connectivity management, remote device and predictive maintenance which also shows the rising adoption of IoT in manufacturing and industrial sector.Furthermore, IoT in manufacturing market is experiencing a boom owing to the convergence of IT (Information Technology) and OT (Operational Technology) and rising adoption of the cloud environment which is anticipated to boost the global IoT in manufacturing market across the globe. Some of the notable strategic initiatives adopted by key market players are merger & acquisition and partnership.For instance, in 2016, IBM signed a multi-year strategic partnership agreement with Schaeffler (Germany), an automotive industry company, to promote the digital transformation of customer solutions and its all operations by tapping IBM's Watson IoT technologies. Furthermore, improving manufacturing sector in emerging economies, such as India, China, etc., is anticipated to provide huge growth prospects for global IoT in manufacturing market.Convergence of IT and OT: Major Growth PromoterThe convergence of IT and OT is likely to rise the growth of the IoT in manufacturing market across the globe. Government of Europe has introduced an initiative named Industry 4.0 initiative in 2011 that emphasizes on the use of automated machines and use of IoT efficiently to predict failures and autonomously trigger maintenance processes.The Industry 4.0 initiative is adopted throughout Europe. With the help of Industry 4.0 initiative, the integration of OT and IT is possible to monitor processes, events and devices. OT's transformation through IT integration brings with it the required consideration of security. For instance, Chinese government focus on the development of standards along with the converging establishment of an IoT standards association in the country.As per the Chinese government, the government has selected 202 cities in the year 2014 to pilot the city projects. The urban and metro cities of China which includes mainly Beijing, Guangzhou, Hangzhou and Shanghai have established extensive database and sensor networks integrating IOT to collect, store and analyse the information and data related to transportation, public safety, electricity and public safety.Similarly, a program named Things Connected is an innovation support program set up by the Digital Catapult in United Kingdom with an aim to help UK's small & medium enterprises and business to bring low power WAN based solutions faster to market.Remote accessibility for many operational technology systems is now possible with the help of the IT integration considering the risks of connectivity were also not considered before. With the advent of Industry 4.0 initiative, the gap between IT and OT is reduced, and manufacturers have started realizing the benefits of bringing IT and OT together in the connected factory as it enables to speed up production, reduces the cost of monitoring asset and also minimizes energy and time consumption in any manufacturing process.Further, emphasize is also on self-organized logistics that have the ability to respond to unexpected changes such as mishandling of load, etc. in production. Hence, rising adoption of industry 4.0 initiative has given a huge boost to the convergence of IT and OT which positively influence the growth of the IoT in manufacturing market during forecast period 2017-2024.North America: The most lucrative regionThe North America dominates global IoT in manufacturing market owing to the deployment of advanced IoT technolgies such as Industry 4.0 initiative, augmented reality and virtual reality.Additionally, increasing digitization in manufacturing by large organizations and growing number of SMEs have also positively influenced the growth of the North America IoT in manufacturing market.Similarly, region holds the leading postion in market owing to the well-established economies, encourging them to promote R&D activities to adopt IoT in manufacturing sector.Furthermore, the dominance of key market players in this region such as Cisco Systems (U.S.), IBM (U.S.), PTC (U.S.) and General Electric (U.S.) is also influencing the growth of its IoT in manufacturing market.Key Topics Covered:1.

Human Rights Groups Urge Google CEO to Discontinue Project DragonflyTargeted News ServiceDecember 11, 2018 Tuesday 8:01 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 386 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK BodyPEN America issued the following news release:Dozens of human rights groups including PEN America released an open letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai today, asking him to discontinue "Project Dragonfly" and to refrain from launching a censored search browser in China.Project Dragonfly is the code-name for Google's product-in-development, a search engine for use within China that censors users' search terms and search results in compliance with Chinese censorship dictates. While Google has publicly stated that Dragonfly is not close to launch, media reports instead indicate that the project has already reached an advanced state. In September, hundreds of Google employees signed an open letter calling upon the company to scrap the project.Google's censored search engine would also reportedly gather significant user data and--given Chinese "cybersecurity" rules--allow the government broad access to this information. PEN America previously noted in its March 2018 report, Forbidden Feeds, that "China's extensive criminalization of online free speech means that internet companies would almost inevitably enable human rights violations if they comply with government requests to hand over private user information.""If Dragonfly is launched in China, it will represent Google's elevation of profits over human rights," said Summer Lopez, Senior Director of Free Expression Programs at PEN America. "But more painfully, it will make Google complicit in the Chinese government's efforts to censor, surveil, and even punish its citizens for their online speech. Google is already well-aware of how Dragonfly threatens human rights and free expression. It is incumbent on them to do the right thing and to scrap the project."PEN America released its own open letter to Sundar Pichai in early September, detailing its concerns over Project Dragonfly. Prior to that, PEN America's Forbidden Feeds report concluded that foreign technology companies should "refrain from doing business in the Chinese market" unless they obtain an agreement that the company is not obligated to enforce Chinese censorship laws or other regulations that violate customers' rights to privacy or related rights.Contact: Anoosh Gasparian, external relations manager, agasparian@pen.orgCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6547976 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: December 12, 2018End of Document

All right, ladies, we'll see you in a few minutes. And good morning, everyone. The time has arrived. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, November 6th, Election Day.Your top stories right now before just 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast on what promises to be a busy day.It is Election Day in America. Polls opening in at least seven states this hour, 6:00 a.m. President Trump and Former President Obama making their final cases to voters about what's at stake in this midterm.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If the radical Democrats take power, they will take a wrecking ball to our economy and to the future of our country.A vote for Republicans is a vote to continue our extraordinary prosperity.BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We are digging ourselves out of a big economic crisis that has been prompted by some of the same policies that we're now seeing in this congress pursuit.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: We are looking at key races to watch this morning with the balance of power in congress up for grabs.Facebook fighting misinformation, the social media giant taking down more than 100 accounts trying to suede voter opinions, that's just yesterday.Investors are watching midterms and the markets as well. Take a look at futures heading into the vote, Dow Industrials expected to be down 70 points, that's a quarter of a percent. The S&P 500 now showing a decline of nine and the NASDAQ right now down 35 points, that's one-half of one percent.This after a mixed session yesterday in Wall Street, the Dow Industrials finished up 191 points at the close, three-quarters of one percent. The S&P 500 picked up 15, and the NASDAQ yesterday at the close down 28 points, a third of a percent.This morning in Europe, declines across the street. The FT-100 and the CAC Quarante down about one-half of one percent. The DAX Index in Germany down a third of a percent. Right now, that's 45 points lower.In Asia overnight, markets were mostly higher with the exception of China. Best performer there was the Nikkei in Japan. Japan bouncing overnight, up better than one percent.Well, a split decision for Amazon. The technology giant reportedly picking two locations for its second headquarters in New York City and Virginia, actually in Queens and Virginia.Why the company is making the move, coming up this morning.And then Kanye West is loving it. The rapper tweeting that McDonald's is his favorite restaurant, but now this, Burger King is fighting back and the response from Burger King is going viral.All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning, and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the Wall Street Journal's Global Economics Editor, Jon Hilsenrath, and Former Senior Advisor to President George W. Bush, Fox News Contributor, Karl Rove with us this morning. Good to see you.KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good to be here. Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining the conversation.ROVE: Oh my God. I can't believe -- I'm so excited. I get to be here as opposed to someplace else, being with them.BARTIROMO: So are we, we are excited that you're here in person and that the day has arrived, Midterm Elections.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Well, we cover business and the economy all day long every day and that's really what this is -- this election should be about given the economic record of President Trump and where we are as a nation in terms of wage growth, incredibly low -- 50-year low unemployment.But will it resonate? That's what's so great --BARTIROMO: Is that what it's about, Karl?ROVE: Well, it -- it's always about the economy, but in this election, it's about what you talk about, and we've talked about a lot of things other than -- other than the economy for a long time.Some of the things we couldn't avoid, Kavanaugh probably helped the Republicans, hurt the Democrats.But I think Dagen's right, that we -- the economic record, if it had been talked about consistently and personalized, and if it was the sort of springboard for talking about what needs to come next as well as contrasting with the Democrats, Republicans might be in a better place and (INAUDIBLE)JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: But the President didn't make it about the economy, he's talked about a lot of other things.BARTIROMO: That's right.HILSENRATH: About immigration --ROVE: Yes.HILSENRATH: -- and Democrats, and Kavanaugh, and all this. In fact, on the campaign trail the other day, he said it's a little boring talking about the economy, so.ROVE: Yes.BARTIROMO: He say -- because do it for five minutes, and then he's got to talk about something else.ROVE: Yes, well, he --BARTIROMO: It's hard not to talk about the caravan when you see this caravan coming at you --ROVE: Yes.BARTIROMO: -- with 4,000 people plus on it.ROVE: I think Jon's right, though, he's got the biggest megaphone and the guy with the biggest megaphone tends to set the tone.BARTIROMO: Which is why Republicans were frustrated a number times this last of couple months, because they we wanted more talk about the economy.Coming up this morning, we are talking with AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, we're going to get his take on the vote.Former Mississippi Governor, Haley Barbour, and Former Pennsylvania Government, Ed Rendell, are here.Home Depot Cofounder, Ken Langone, is joining us for the business outlook, and Former McDonald's CEO, Ed Rensi, as well.Don't miss a moment of it. We got a big three hours coming up, and of course our top story this hour, it is, the day has finally arrived. Polls are opening up just moments from now, 6:00 a.m. Many polls open, as people get ready to cast their ballots in today's pivotal elections.Both Former President Obama and President Trump on the campaign trail yesterday, laying out what's at stake right now for voters.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: The character of this country is on the ballot. Who we are is on the ballot.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Uh-hmm.OBAMA: What kind of -- what kind of politics we expect is on the ballot, how we conduct ourselves in public life is on the ballot, how we treat other people is on the ballot.TRUMP: We have to get out tomorrow and we have to elect a Republican congress, we have to do it.We've got to stop crying Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi from erasing everything that we've gained. Our economy is setting records on a daily basis.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Let me get your reaction to Both President Obama and President Trump. Karl, will Nancy Pelosi, should they take the house, erase what this President has put in place?ROVE: Well, two things hard to do if the Republicans keep the senate, but second of all, I may be an outlier on this, I think there's a real question of whether or not she's speaker.There are 52 Democratic challengers who have said I will not support her. Now many of them are in deep red districts and won't win, but a number of them are in battleground districts. There are 11 city members if the Democratic caucus, all of whom were coming back, people like Linda Sanchez and Tim Ryan who've said I won't support her for speaker.To be elected speaker, you have to have 218 votes.BARTIROMO: Yes.ROVE: So if the Democrats take the house, and the number of people who said I can't support her is larger than the difference between what they got and 218 that she could have a real problem on her hands.How many people are going to say my first vote that I cast in the New Congress was in direct contravention of what I told you I would do, I said I wouldn't support her --MCDOWELL: Right.ROVE: -- and the first vote I cast was the supporter.BARTIROMO: Congressman Tim Ryan joined me on Sunday and he wouldn't answer the question on whether or not he is going to run for speaker, because I think he wants to run for president, frankly --ROVE: Uh-hmm.BARTIROMO: -- in 2020. But what I'm really looking for is just hypothetically speaking, if Nancy Pelosi is the speaker, let's say she does gain that position --ROVE: Uh-hmm.BARTIROMO: -- will she be able to reverse what President Trump has put in place in terms of the economic policy?ROVE: Well, she can stop further progress, she can certainly investigate and oversight and create problems, but she cannot reverse it without the concurrence of the senate. That's --HILSENRATH: Well --MCDOWELL: Even if the Republicans win the senate, President Trump is going to get a veto stamp made the size of this desk.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: And he's going the make a giant theater production out of everything that just lands on his desk that gets vetoed, because that's where we are, so it might be gridlock, but, Karl --ROVE: Yes.HILSENRATH: There's two -- there's two things that stand in the way of the Trump agenda, so -- and it's mostly on taxes, right? That was the big signature legislative achievement of the President.One is some of these tax cuts the way the Republicans wrote it expire on their own in a few years, so, you know, when it comes to extending those things, it's going to be very hard to do.BARTIROMO: Right.HILSENRATH: That's one. And the other --BARTIROMO: And that's what he's trying to do, as well as cut taxes and additional 10 percent.HILSENRATH: So I mean -- so the chances of making that permanent, I think, go out the window.BARTIROMO: Yes, good point.HILSENRATH: But there'll -- they'll be difficult to do anyway.The other is the debt ceiling, so we, you know, we could see role reversal where Republicans really pressed President Obama on the debt ceiling to put in place spending cuts, and now if Democrats take over the house, they could press President Trump on the debt ceiling to get, you know, whatever their agenda is.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's true.MCDOWELL: Those individual tax cuts wouldn't expire if one single Democrat would have gotten onboard --BARTIROMO: Right.MCDOWELL: -- with the -- with the tax reform.HILSENRATH: Well --MCDOWELL: And we --BARTIROMO: Not one of them voted for it.MCDOWELL: Well, if they -- if they -- because then they started jawboning about, oh, my God, it was a handout to corporations, and look, the individual tax cuts go away -- go away in, what, 2025.ROVE: Well --MCDOWELL: But -- so shame on them, Karl.ROVE: Well, we've --HILSENRATH: Some of them -- some of them -- some of them expire in 2019.ROVE: Yes.HILSENRATH: Some of the smaller provisions.MCDOWELL: Right.HILSENRATH: But, you're right, most of them don't expire until after the next Presidential Election.BARTIROMO: But just to go out and spew this lie that all of the tax benefit went to the top one percent is just a lie and it's also the assumption that these cuts are not in place until 2025. The thing is --ROVE: Yes, look, we've seen this once before, we -- the Bush tax cuts of 2001 were a giveaway to the rich and we -- and we're going to get rid of them, and when it came time for the expiration --BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.ROVE: -- they kept all of the personal cuts, except for the top rate.HILSENRATH: Right.BARTIROMO: What races are you looking at today that are most important, that'll give you an idea? Because we could go for a late night tonight --ROVE: Yes.BARTIROMO: -- given California and the West Coast closing.ROVE: Yes. Yes.BARTIROMO: So what races are you going to be looking --ROVE: Well -- and -- the -- all of the races, because there's going to be so many important races tonight, but I'm looking for early indications from Indiana and Kentucky. Those two states report early, they're split in half, they report during two time zones, but the Indiana Senate race will give us a clue.And the Kentucky Sixth Congressional race, second-most Democratic district in the state, held by Republican, is going to give us a little bit of a clue.I'm going to be watching the Arizona Senate race all night when it begins to report because I think that's the difference between Republicans having 51, 52, 53, going to have a big ending.BARTIROMO: That's an important one. All right. Let's talk markets for a second. Go ahead, Dagen.MCDOWELL: No, I was going to say why is Arizona so close, Karl?BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.ROVE: Because Arizona's a purple state and because the Democrats nominated a woman who has spent the last six years saying -- not mean, but saying, "I'm a pro-business moderate Democrat."Now she's a former green party member and she said some really goofy things before she decided to put on this act, but it's -- and the Republicans had a bitter primary and the party is divided.BARTIROMO: So why is Florida so close? I mean you, you know, you could go --ROVE: Because it's the purple state. Go back to 2000 and elections there tend to be close. Rick Scott has been a very effective Governor --BARTIROMO: Yes,ROVE: -- and gets elected the first time by one percent, gets reelected by two percent.BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.ROVE: So, it's a --MCDOWELL: Well, look at Virginia. I mean -- Virginia has been purple, but you look at the Fifth District, the Seventh District, and the Tenth District.HILSENRATH: And the Second, all of which -- four out of the ten districts are --MCDOWELL: And Virginia.BARTIROMO: Well, her strategy is a smart one and that's what Claire McCaskill tried to do toward the end of this --ROVE: Yes.BARTIROMO: -- by calling her colleagues crazy, the crazy Democracy's.HILSENRATH: Yes.ROVE: I'm not -- no, I'm not one of those crazy left-wingers.BARTIROMO: Exactly. Jon, what's --ROVE: Except in between the six years in between elections, but otherwise, I'm OK.BARTIROMO: Markets. And how do markets react? As -- so let's say Democrats take control of the house, I'm not going say the senate yet because that's --HILSENRATH: Yes.BARTIROMO: -- really not expected.HILSENRATH: Right.BARTIROMO: But Democrats taking the house, Republicans taking the senate, how do markets like that --HILSENRATH: Well, the -- I mean the market had a very bad month in October, but it stabilized and was mixed to up yesterday, you know. The consensus conventional view right now is that Democrats take the house.So, you have to think that if the Democrats take the house, it needs the consensus.BARTIROMO: (INAUDIBLE)HILSENRATH: And the market's -- the market's doing all right.BARTIROMO: What if the Dems take the senate? I mean that's -- I -- and I know that you're not expecting that, but what if the Dems take the senate?HILSENRATH: Well, you know, then you're talking about real confrontation with the President for the next few years. We could see a bit of a selloff.HILSENRATH: Can't get judges, can't get nominees, joint investigatory power of the house and senate.One thing we haven't talked about that we ought to talk about this morning is trade because we have a big trade vote coming on the USMCA.BARTIROMO: MCA, yes.MCDOWELL: Uh-hmm.ROVE: Which, every time I hear that, I think of the village people. But anyway, well, the question is, could that be a controversy in the New Year or controversy in the lame duck?HILSENRATH: Well, that was --MCDOWELL: There was handout to the unions.HILSENRATH: -- written -- Robert Lighthizer said that was written with Democrats in mind. There are a lot of union-friendly provisions, a lot of --ROVE: Yes.HILSENRATH: -- labor-friendly provisions in that -- in that idea and, you know, the President wants to get Democrats on board with that one.BARTIROMO: Why was it such a handout?MCDOWELL: It's a handout for -- it helps workers in these other countries that helps the unions (INAUDIBLE) workers in places like Mexico, and then also the steel and aluminum tariffs, the steel tariffs, the steel workers union's been crying for those for years and years and years, and guess who handed then to them?BARTIROMO: Yes, that's true.ROVE: Yes.MCDOWELL: President Trump.BARTIROMO: We're going to speak with Richard Trumka, AFL-CIO coming up, and we'll continue this conversation obviously. Stay with Fox Business. We've got special election coverage tonight.It kicks off at 7:00 p.m. Eastern with Lou Dobbs tonight. We will know -- how many races will we know by that point at 7:00 p.m. tonight?ROVE: Oh, not a lot. We've got two states that have come in --BARTIROMO: But at least two.ROVE: What --BARTIROMO: You're going to know -- you're going to know some of those early ones like in Kentucky.ROVE: Well, we're going to know from early results, but we probably -- outside of -- outside of Kentucky may be the Congressional race in the Sixth and some of the safe seats that are in the eastern --HILSENRATH: When are we going to know --BARTIROMO: And then 8:00 p.m., Neil Cavuto breaks down the results as well. I will join Neil as well tonight at 8:00 p.m., tomorrow morning, MORNINGS WITH MARIA starts an hour earlier at 5:00 a.m. Eastern, so join us for our special coverage tomorrow as we will know tomorrow the definitive numbers, I assume.Jon, what were you saying?HILSENRATH: Well, I was -- I was going to ask what -- when we're going to know tonight, at what hour will we know who has the house?ROVE: We could -- well, it depends on how big the races are.BARTIROMO: (INAUDIBLE) Kentucky.ROVE: But it's probably 10:00 or 11:00, but we may not know the outcome for several days because there are seven contested seats in California --HILSENRATH: Right.ROVE: -- and it's mail-in ballots and they literally are allowed to count those until December 7th. Now they're probably trying to get them wrapped up this week, but they got a long time --HILSENRATH: That's where I want to talk --BARTIROMO: Wow.HILSENRATH: -- about the gas tax referendum which plays a lot into those seven seats.ROVE: Yes.BARTIROMO: All right. Let's talk about that coming up.We'll take a short break. When we come back, more of our special election coverage.Coming up, Facebook's fake news mission as well, how the social media giant is fighting back against misinformation campaigns so close to the Midterm Elections.And splitting the work, why Amazon says their second headquarters will be better off in two cities instead of one, all that coming up right after this short break, stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, Facebook blocking accounts on the eve of the Midterm Elections. Cheryl Casone with the details now. Cheryl, good morning.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Maria, good morning. Facebook taking down more than 100 accounts that were working together to possibly spread false information. Thirty accounts were on Facebook, 85 accounts were on Instagram.Nearly all the Facebook pages appear to be in Russian or French. Now this news comes after Facebook admitted that Russian-state actors used social media to interfere with the 2016 Presidential Election.Well, the Wall Street Journal has reported that Amazon is planning to split its second headquarters between two cities, this has gotten real twisty, everybody.Amazon reportedly in advance talks with Dallas Crystal City in Northern Virginia and Long Island City in New York, though, but hasn't decided which two cities it's going to choose of those three. Amazon's going to send 25,000 employees to each location.The company believes splitting the headquarters will help it recruit the best tech talent, let's just think about the two cities where that's possible.But anyway, take a look at shares of Amazon right now, down less than a percent in premarket trading as you can see on your screen.All right. The Chinese Government vowing to continue its trade with Iran despite new U.S. sanctions on Tehran, saying it opposes unilateral sanctions. This move targets Iran's vital, of course, oil industry.In an interview with Maria, National Security Advisor John Bolton weighed in.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: There was a report on Friday that China is looking to buy oil from the United States, as opposed to Iran, and this is going to be the beginning of a new trade deal that the President's going to talk with President Xi about when he sees him at the G20, truth?JOHN BOLTON, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR: I think there's a lot of possibility. I think the American production of oil and gas and the potential for export is enormous, it's a strategic alternative for the Europeans, from buying Russian oil and gas.Could be a strategic alternative in the Far East as well. You already see Chinese banks that are stopping clear Iranian financial transactions because they'd rather do business in the United States.The same is true for many other Chinese businesses, the reach of American economic power is enormous and that's what the President's using here.(END VIDEOTAPE)CASONE: Well, Iranian President Rouhani saying, "We will probably break the sanctions." Oil, lower this morning, Maria, about a quarter percent. There we go. Done deal.BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl. Thank you so much.CASONE: Uh-hmm.BARTIROMO: Coming up, spotlight on The Sunshine State, Florida, one of the main battleground states to watch for governor and the senate race.We will bring you there live. When we come right back, we're going to Florida.And then Uber and Lyft have an Election Day deal for you. They're offering discounts to get you to a polling place. That and a lot more when we come right back. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. On this Election Day, we are headed to The Sunshine State where voters are choosing a governor and a senator, Griff Jenkins is, right now, in Lakeland, Florida. Griff, good morning to you. What can you tell us?GRIFF JENKINS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: Hey. Good morning, Maria. We are in Lakeland, Florida at the Brunch Box, it is the best breakfast you can get in this I-4 Corridor.And we have the most number of swing voters here where the governor's race, the senate race, the most closely watched in the country, we're talking to folks, Al and Janice Angle. Al is a retired officer with the Sheriff's Department in Miami-Dade. Al, have you voted already?AL, FLORIDA VOTER: Yes, we have.JENKINS: And when you voted, what drove your vote? What -- what's the issues that mattered most to you?AL: Change. We'd like a little bit of change, see if we can make something a little bit better, something that's not working now, we'll try to get it to where it's going to work a little bit better.JENKINS: And do you want to tell us, you know, you've got this governor's race, and a senate race, some of the most closely watched in the country, how did you vote if you --if you want to share with us?AL: Well, I voted Republican and --JENKINS: You did.AL: And I voted for -- I usually vote for who I think is going to do the better job.JENKINS: All right, Janice, I got to bring you in here. What drove your vote, what mattered most to you?JANICE: As he said, change. And also, I feel like if I voted, I have a right to say something about the voting. If I don't vote, to keep the mouth shut on who I voted for, so go out and vote today.JENKINS: Go out and vote today. And, you know, Maria, what's really fascinating is they've already set a record here in Florida, more than five million people already voted early voting, and, of course, the polls opening just moments from now here in Florida.Back to you.BARTIROMO: Al right, Griff. Thanks very much. Incredibly tight race there. Griff Jenkins in Florida this morning.Joining us right now is The Daily Caller News Foundation Editor-in-Chief, Christopher Bedford.Chris, good to see you this morning.CHRISTOPHER BEDFORD, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE DAILY CALLER NEWS FOUNDATION: Good morning.BARTIROMO: Florida, obviously one of the elections you're watching closely. What are -- what are you watching to give you the best information as we go through the day and the polls close?It's incredible how close it is.BEDFORD: Well, in our newsroom, we're going to be following basically every single major news source there is. We fortunately got our cable fixed in time so we have every single television on, as well as the Associated Press and Reuters.But some of the interesting things that are going on in Florida is you've got the most anti-Castro state in the country and is poised to elect a socialist governor.This is surprising, to say the least, and he's leading right now, although internal polls that I've been able to take a look at show the race significantly closer.And same thing in the -- in the U.S. Senate, you've had - you've had a Democratic campaign that's been very aggressive, constant accusations of racism, and a Republican campaign that's been a little less aggressive.The big accusation is taking play tickets they shouldn't have taken.BARTIROMO: Right.BEDFORD: Now the internal polls I've seen have shown the Republican up by one, although the Republican polls that I -- the more public polls I've seen I've shown him trailing.And the GOP is in a lot of trouble here because of the storm that came through the panhandle, which is their stronghold in Florida and they've done everything they can to set up polling stations and to help people get their vote up.But if you are worried about where your roof is or where your kids are going to school, then you're just not as worried about voting today.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's incredible that the storm is swaying voters as much as it is. This was a red state at one point, Karl. When did Florida go purple and how is it that Floridians want to elect somebody who wants to raise taxes?I mean Gillum wants to raise income tax.ROVE: Yes.BARTIROMO: It's for corporations.ROVE: It's been a purple state for a long time, it's just that the Republicans have had some pretty good -- between Scott and Jeb Bush, some pretty good candidates which is why the last time the Democrats elected a governor was 1994.MCDOWELL: Why isn't the economy in Florida resonating more with -- for Rick Scott? Again, the unemployment rate there, below the national average. It hit a one trillion-dollar state -- domestic state economy under his term as the governor. Why isn't that helping him?Or maybe he'd be -- maybe it would be worse for him if the economy wasn't as good.ROVE: Yes. Look, I take it it's been helping him and if he wins, it'll be a big reason why.Incidentally, I think Chris hit an interesting point.BARTIROMO: Go ahead.ROVE: The hurricane came ashore in Bay County, and I've been watching it because that is a big Republican county. Interestingly enough, statewide the early and absentee vote was about just over three quarters of what it was in 2016.But in Bay County, they -- until this weekend, they were lagging behind, but now 82 percent -- their early vote is equal to 83 percent of what it was in 2016.So, they're running ahead of the state and of the -- and statewide, the Republicans were about 80 percent of what they voted in 2016 in Bay County.They're now at 83.3.BARTIROMO: So you're saying Bay County may stay red?ROVE: Bay County -- Bay County is going to stay red.BARTIROMO: Yes.ROVE: And turn out strong, but it wasn't until this weekend. This weekend, all of the people who were dispossessed of their homes came home from their cousin's house in Macon, or the hotel in Dustin and showed up at one of the five early voting locations that they opened up to the county and poured through the doors.BARTIROMO: This is a really important point. Chris, weigh in on this and we did see President Trump tweeting his support for Rick Scott, by the way. He said this. "Remember, Florida, I have been President of the United States for almost two years. During that time, Senator Bill Nelson did not call me once.Rick Scott called me constantly, requesting dollars plus for Florida and did a great job on hurricanes, vote Scott."What's your thought, Chris, on what you're hearing from Karl this morning in terms of that Bay constituency?BEDFORD: The Republicans have been working overtime to try and make sure they can get as many votes out there.The RNC has set up polling locations wherever they possibly could. They've had -- and there's -- as a huge on the ground operation out there to try and get people to the polls, but it's just -- it's -- I worry that voting is a little low on people's pyramid of needs right now.BARTIROMO: Yes.BEDFORD: If you've lost everything in the last few weeks, it's just -- it's something that's easily forgotten when you've got so many other concerns.Maybe they'll get around, and maybe they'll be motivated anyways.President Trump's the kind of guy who might be able to make a difference in that.BARTIROMO: Oh, Karl's saying that he's looking at it in real-time and they are motivated now. But you make a great point.If you can't, you can't have other priorities. Go ahead, Jon.HILSENRATH: I was -- I want to -- I want to hear -- ask Karl and Chris, what does the Florida race tell us about the 2020 Election? It's such an important state in so many presidential elections, if it goes for a Democrat in the governor -- for the governor's race, does that tell us anything about how 2020 is going to play out?ROVE: Well, it does give an indication because, look, again, in the early voting, Republicans are -- their share of the vote is actually up 1.8 percent over what it was in 2016.Democrats are up eight-tenths of a percent. So, Trump wins a state by 1.2 and in the early vote, there's a one-point swing towards the Republicans.So, if they lose --BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.ROVE: -- what it says is the independents who are smaller -- slightly smaller share of the electorate this time around are nonetheless moving against us.MCDOWELL: Well, and it'll give them something to run on, maybe the Republicans that Medicare for all, means which Andrew Gillum does back means Medicare for nobody.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: Because the plans that are in place in Washington so far, it rips up Medicare and it does maybe private insurance.ROVE: Well, and also --MCDOWELL: Why didn't they run on that in Florida?BARTIROMO: Well, that's the thing, and how is it possible that he's still leading, Gillum, with these policies, raising taxes, and Medicare for all.MCDOWELL: Especially with the senior population in Florida.BARTIROMO: Especially with the senior population.ROVE: Yes.BARTIROMO: Another race you're following, Chris, is the Virginia Seventh Congressional District. Incumbent Dave Brat against Democrat, Abigail Spanberger. Tell us about this one, what you're expecting here.And this is also going to give us a good --ROVE: Uh-hmm.BARTIROMO: -- insight into the Republicans for the -- for the Congress. Good ahead, Chris.BEDFORD: I think this race is really interesting because it's really emblematic of what's going on with the rest of the country. You know, the people have been motivated for and against President Trump.David Brat ran an insurgent campaign that took down Eric Cantor, who -- they called him the giant killer for a while, and he did that by getting to know every single Republican and conservative activist in his district, in trying to get them out to support them.Now, he says every time he goes to a rally, he's meeting new people, people he'd never met before because they've been motivated by President Trump, and they are new kind of voter.BARTIROMO: Yes.BEDFORD: But at the same time, without any massive group of immigration into his county. There's been a huge surgence in hard-left and liberal policies and voters who didn't care before. They've also been motivated with President Trump.So his election strategy is, if I can get the conservative Republican base to come out and the new Trump voters, then I can beat this new blue tide, but if not, then he's going to go down, and it's very close.BARTIROMO: And you made the point yesterday, you and Steve Forbes, that some of these liberal voters that have gone to Florida, they came from high-taxed states, to get to low-taxed state, in Florida, and then they vote their liberal policies.MCDOWELL: So, is Florida going to turn into Connecticut? Connecticut used to have no income tax, Florida still has no income tax, but they see that as a vast pot of untapped money for the government, and those elected officials to spend. And Connecticut's economy has contracted more than nine percent in the last few years..BARTIROMO: We're going to talk about Connecticut, by the way, because Bob Hugin has really turned things around there too, so we'll --ROVE: New Jersey, yes.BARTIROMO: I'm sorry, New Jersey and Connecticut. Let's talk about both - - those two, coming up. Chris Bedford, thank you so much sir. We will see you soon.BEDFORD: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Chris Bedford, Daily Caller. Coming up, searching for the end of DACA, President Trump turning to the Supreme Court for help ending the Obama-era program, more on that coming up. And then, not having it his way, Burger King is slamming rapper, Kanye West, for saying that his favorite food is McDonald's, back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, November 6th, the day has arrived, Election Day in America. The polls are open in nine states right now, at this hour, for the midterm election voting, both parties stressing the importance of getting out that vote.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We really feel like we got a good shot at keeping our majority because our record is so good and the contrast is so strong.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What this nation needs right now, what this world needs from us right now, is a wave of compassion, a wave of character, a wave decency, love, community, caring, a wave of righteousness, a wave of justice.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: We are looking at key states and issues throughout the morning, this morning, we've got it all coming up. Then, hitching a ride, how Uber and Lyft are helping voters get to the polls for free this morning.Investors are watching the midterms in markets, as well. Futures indicating a lower opening for the broader averages, at this hour, Dow Industrials set to open down about 40 points, the NASDAQ is down 22. It was a mixed day, yesterday, on Wall Street, meanwhile.The NASDAQ was lower by 28 points, but the Dow Industrials picked up 191 points, that was three quarters of one percent higher, at the close, for the Dow, yesterday.In Europe this morning, take a look at the indices, which are down across the board, similar story here, as we're seeing on Wall Street, this morning. The FT 100 down two-thirds of a percent, the CAC Quarante and the DAX Index each down about a quarter of a percent, a piece, right now.Asian markets overnight, mostly higher, with the exception of China, the Japanese market, the best performer, Nikkei Average up better than one percent.The legal battle over immigration, details, this morning, on the Trump administration's newest move to put an end to the DACA, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, that program, and then this, Kanye flamed Burger King's searing response to the rapper's claim that McDonald's is his favorite fast food restaurant.All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning, but first, our top story this half an hour, the midterms and the Trump economy. President Trump making his final push for votes, hitting three states yesterday, touting his record on jobs.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We've got to stop crying Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi from erasing everything that we've gained. Our economy is setting records on a daily basis. We need to keep this job's boom going. We need to keep our country going the way it is. There has never been a better time for the American worker.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is Ed Rensi, he's Former McDonald's USA CEO, Former Famous Dave's CEO and FAT Brands Chairman. Good to see you, Ed, thanks very much for joining us. So, from a business standpoint, you're a business guy, what do you want to see, in terms of seeing this good economic backdrop continue, based on the midterms?EDWARD RENSI, FORMER CEO, MCDONALD'S USA: Well, I'm excited. Trump has done everything that I expected him to do, this economy is on fire and jobs are being created. I'm seeing people go back to work that haven't worked in 10 years because they couldn't find a job.I think it's exciting, I hope that we keep this up. But I live in Florida, and I hope this guy doesn't raise income tax down here, because it's the only reason I came down here is to get away from taxes.BARTIROMO: Well, that's what I was going to say, I mean, what happens in Florida, I mean, did you get an influx of people from liberal states, that's what we've been talking about, you're there, we're watching the governor's race and how tightly contested it is. Ron DeSantis joined me on "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES" this weekend, and here's what he said about his policy versus Andrew Gillum's.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RON DESANTIS (R), GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE, FLORIDA: I think the reason why we've been able to mobilize Republicans so much is precisely because of the contrast you talked about. People understand what has made Florida successful. We have had limited government, we have had a pro-business climate and a low-tax environment, that allows us to drive investment from higher-tax states.Andrew Gillum wants a 40 percent tax increase. That will kill jobs, cause businesses to leave, it'll stop the historic flow of investment coming into Florida, it would be a big mistake, and I think Republican voters, in particular, realize that. That's why they are coming out in droves.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: And by the way, we invited Andrew Gillum on the show but he did not respond. But you said Floridians get it, do they? Then why is the race so tight?RENSI: Well, you know, they may be coming from liberal states, I came from Chicago, down here, but that doesn't make me a liberal. People are disgusted with the socialism that's been creeping into our society for a very long time.We need jobs, we need commerce because they're free enterprises and it's a great liberator of mankind. That's why everybody is trying to come to the United States and not going to other countries.MCDOWELL: Karl, answer that, though, why would somebody move to Florida, because of the very conservative policies, limited government, and then vote for bigger government, vote for higher taxes? In an economy that has done exceptionally well, that's really rebounded from the 2008 --ROVE: Well, people move to Florida both because of the tax situation, lower taxes, but they also move there because of weather in southeast Florida is a lot better than it is in New York and New Jersey.And so, you have people who move there to retire, who came from modest backgrounds, where Democrats when they're -- when they're in New York, and Democrats when they live in Connecticut, and Democrats when they live in Massachusetts and New Jersey, and they are still Democrats when they show up in southeast Florida.HILSENRATH: Ed, can you talk about what has changed on the job market front since the President was elected, what would you say have been the big drivers that have kept the job market going and how has that changed from the Obama presidency?RENSI: Well, I had dinner last night with a young lady, that's head of Human Resource for a company here in Florida, they just hired 150 people. They supply windows in housing market and housing market is going up. People are buying new houses. Everything about the economy has given people confidence, people have confidence now that the investments they make are going to pay off.I see it in McDonald's where they are remodeling restaurants like crazy. I think that there's a confidence level. The tax refund, the tax change that Trump did, I think is really important because people want to keep more of their own money.And I think that resonates very quickly on the household budget, you know, college is going up, food is going up, everything's going up, and if you can keep some of your own money, that's helpful.BARTIROMO: Yes.RENSI: I think it's all of the above.BARTIROMO: You mentioned McDonald's. How about this Kanye West story? He is backing your old company, McDonald's. He tweeted Sunday. McDonald's is my favorite restaurant. And McDonald's rival, Burger King, is answering back. Burger King U.K.'s account tweets this, explains a lot.Wow. Ed, that response is going viral this morning, your reaction?RENSI: Well, I don't much care what anybody in Great Britain has to say about McDonald's or Burger King. Kanye West is a very bright man. He's very socially aware. He knows what's going on in the community. And by the way, McDonald's hit $90 billion in sales, and if you add Wendy's and Burger King together, they don't get close to that, so my stock is looking pretty good, I'm pretty happy.BARTIROMO: All right, final prediction before you go, Ed, who wins governorship of Florida, you think?RENSI: I think DeSantis is going to win.BARTIROMO: You do? Ed, good to see you, we'll be watching --RENSI: I do.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Ed Rensi, joining us there, in Florida. Stay tuned to Fox Business all-day today and tomorrow. Election coverage begins tonight at 7:00 p.m. Eastern with Lou Dobbs and at 8:00 p.m. Neil Cavuto, brings us the results. I will join Neil, as well.And then tomorrow, MORNINGS WITH MARIA, we are starting an hour earlier than usual, 5:00 a.m. Eastern, so we can bring you all of the latest late- day poll closings on Wednesday morning.First, though, coming up, facing a judge, the man suspected of sending pipe bombs to prominent Democrats, set to appear in a New York courtroom, today. We'll have the latest. Plus, hitching a ride, Uber and Lyft offering free and discounted fares if you want to go vote to a polling place, all that, next.BARTIROMO: Uber and Lyft make it easier for voters to get to the polls today. Cheryl Casone with the details on that angle, Cheryl.CASONE: Yes, no excuses here, Maria. Uber or Lyft are offering free or discounted rides to polling places. Uber is going to take $10.00 off a single ride. Lyft is taking 50 percent off, up to $5.00, off of the rides. Lyft is also offering free rides to people that live in underserved communities who pays major transportation issues. So, you've got options, folks.Well, a court hearing in the pipe bomb case. The man accused of sending pipe bombs to prominent Democrats, including President Obama, is set to make his first court appearance in New York. Prosecutors plan to ask for Caesar Sayoc to be held without bail. He was arrested last month in South Florida. Sayoc faces about 50 years in prison if convicted on five federal charges.Well, the Trump administration is trying to fast-track its effort to end the Obama-era DACA program. The administration is asking the Supreme Court to bypass three federal appeals court and allow President Trump to terminate the program. DACA gives some illegal immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children, knows as the DREAMERS, the opportunity to stay in the country and receive a work permit. So far, the second, ninth and D.C. circuits have blocked the government from completely dismantling DACA. (INAUDIBLE) to go to the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, both President Trump and former President Obama using immigration in their final pitch for candidates on the campaign trail.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: Our president doesn't get to decide on his own who's an American citizen and who's not.TRUMP: Democrats are inviting caravan after caravan of illegal aliens to pour into our country, overwhelming your schools, your hospitals and your communities.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Well, President Trump has taken a harsh line on the caravan leading up to election day -- several caravans we should say. And we're keeping an eye on Apple stock this morning, slightly lower in the premarket, a little more than a quarter percent. Shares suffered their steepest two-day loss since January 2013 on Friday and then yesterday. That stock dropped more than nine percent, following last week's disappointing sales outlook. They were talking about the holidays. The stock tumbling, as it's new MacBook Air, iPad Pro and Mac Mini are all hitting store shelves today, all at pretty expensive price points, folks. Those new products were just unveiled at an Apple event, of course, Maria, which was in Brooklyn last week. And those are your headlines.BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thank you so much. Coming up, it is midterm election day today. We are taking a look back at some of the most contentious races in recent history, how they stack up against 2018, that's next back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. It is election day in America. Republican control of the house is on the line and a fiercely divided political climate is at stake, how does this election compare to other historical midterms? Joining us right now is the Presidential Historian Doug Wead. Doug, good to see you. Thanks so much for being here this morning.DOUG WEAD, PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: I want to kick it off with going back to 2002. In the first post 9/11 midterm, President George W. Bush was able to actually gain seats, tell us about that.WEAD: Yes. Well, it takes 9/11 or the great depression to break the trend, and he did it. Karl, was on that watch. By the way, hello, Dagen and Jon, good to see you, guys. So, yes, history says that it's buyer's remorse -- the party that won the previous election is going to get hurt in the midterm.BARTIROMO: So, did that, Karl have to do with 9/11 tell us what you see?ROVE: Well, Doug is right, the basis was 9/11, but then Bush made a gutsy call, which was -- I'm going to take my political capital and expend it. Remember, we have a -- the Senate was Democrat. We've had the defection of Jim (INAUDIBLE) from Vermont. So, we had a Democrat Senate led by Tom Daschle, 51-49, and Bush said I'm going to expend my political credit and help elect a Republican Senate, which will make it easier for me to govern. And he did so with the positive and optimistic vision about the future of the country and, you know, he didn't go in and trash the Democrat candidate, he went in and advocated, took his political capital and help people like Lamar Alexander in Tennessee and elsewhere take Democratic seats away.BARTIROMO: And then, the 2006 midterms, Nancy Pelosi end up as speaker of the house. Doug, here she is following the Democrat's big win back in '06.WEAD: Yes, that's right.BARTIROMO: Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: The American people voted to restore integrity and honesty in Washington, D.C., and the Democrats intend to lead the most honest, most open and most ethical congress in history.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Did they do that and could history repeat itself?WEAD: Well, history -- history doesn't repeat itself as Mark Twain famously said, but certainly rhymes, so it could come close. But George W. Bush was one of the most popular presidents in American history in 2004, and one of the most unpopular in 2006, so history can turn on a dime. History has not yet met Donald Trump, so we'll see.BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly, anything can change this time around because it's a character we haven't seen before. So, how about 1994, saw the Republican revolution against President Clinton. The Republicans took both houses, President Clinton accepted his share of responsibility for the Democrats' heavy losses and then actually moved to the middle, how did that election empower Republicans?WEAD: Yes, that was Newt Gingrich's famous contract with America. And once again, a buyer's remorse -- they had 92 in a three-way race with Clinton, and Ross Perot, and George H.W. Bush. Clinton had won. Two years later, the American people weren't happy with it, and they went with Newt Gingrich's vision for America -- fascinating.BARTIROMO: Any takeaways about this midterm?WEAD: Well, this coming midterm, it's unpredictable to me, I'm watching the vote in Florida with governor and the Beto O'Rourke, because I'm thinking of the long view and socialism. It seems like the last people on Earth that still believe in socialism are American young people. Sad to me, so I'm kind of watching what those numbers pull. Not that I think Cruz will get upset, but I want to see how many numbers Beto pulls.BARTIROMO: Yes, we want it. So, that's Florida and Texas you're watching. That's another real tight one Texas with Beto O'Rourke and Ted Cruz. Doug, good to see you. Thanks so much.WEAD: Good to see you.BARTIROMO: Doug Wead joining us there. Still ahead, full coverage of the 2018 midterm elections right here. Voters not only deciding on the House and Senate, but ballot measures on sanctuary law, legalized marijuana. We will tell you all about that next hour on MORNINGS WITH MARIA right here. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo.Load-Date: November 6, 2018End of Document

Global $17+ Billion Spintronics Market by Type of Device, Application and Region - Forecast to 2023GlobeNewswireDecember 18, 2018 Tuesday 2:45 AM PTCopyright 2018 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: RESEARCH ANALYSIS AND REPORTSLength: 1099 wordsBodyDublin, Dec.  18, 2018  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The     "Global Spintronics Market - By Type of Devices (Metal-based Devices, Semiconductor-based Devices), By Application (Electric Vehicles, Industrial Motors, Data Storage, MRAM, Magnetic Sensing) and Region - Growth, Trends and Forecast (2018 - 2023)"   report has been added to     ResearchAndMarkets.com's  offering.         The global spintronics market was valued at USD 1.677 billion in 2017, and is expected to reach a value of USD 17.676 billion by 2023, at a CAGR of 47.04% over the forecast period (2018-2023).The global spintronics market is in the emerging phase. Compared to conventional electronics, spintronics takes advantage of spin properties instead of, or in addition to, charge degrees of freedom.In recent years, spintronics have been extensively deployed in the data storage devices, due to their faster data transmission capabilities and increased storage capacity, compared to conventional storage devices. MRAM deployed with spintronics provides faster data reading and writing speeds. Furthermore, it consumes significantly low power compared to DRAM storage. These factors are expected to increase the demand for spintronics in the MRAM application segment.In addition, demand of spintronics in portable devices has increased in past few years, due to its low power consumption tendency. Giant magneto resistance-based devices (GMRs) is expected to have the highest market share in the coming years, due to technological developments in the segment and increasing adoption of GMR effect in the hard disk drives.Growing Need for Higher Data Transfer Speed and Increased Storage CapacityThe amount of data in the past decade has increased manifolds in the past decade. Moreover, data has become essential for all end-user industries, due to incorporation of data-driven decisions. These factors have increased the significant need for solutions, which increases the data processing power.Spintronics fulfills the needs of consumers, by enabling faster data transfer speeds and larger storage for data. MRAM is expected to replace flash memory devices, such as SD cards and compactflash.Furthermore, companies in the MRAM business segment are on rise after the advent of spintronics. One such company, Everspin in 2017, launched a perpendicular spin-torque MRAM. It eliminates the need for batteries and supercapacitors in case of unexpected power failures.Increased Adoption of Electric Vehicles Drives the Spintronics MarketThe increasing demand for lightweight construction and reduced battery operation space, weight, and power consumption in electric vehicles have driven the adoption of sensors.  Automobile transportation has been witnessing a paradigm shift to higher fuel efficiency and cleaner running fuel/electric hybrids and plug-in electric vehicles.Government initiatives have been instrumental in encouraging the utilization of these vehicles. For instance, the US federal government enacted policies and legislations, such as The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which have promoted the penetration of EVs in the US market.Major economies in Europe and America have also supported the advanced technology vehicle adoption through improvements to tax credits, investments in R&D, and competitive programs to encourage communities to invest in infrastructure supporting these vehicles.The growing demand for ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) and automated driving technologies in driving, turning, and braking has pushed manufacturers to adopt technologies that offer high-accuracy in motor control, through enhanced sensor capabilities providing high accuracy and safety.China on Its Way to Accelerated Growth in the Spintronics Market, Witnessing a CAGR of 48.92%China's spintronics market's growth is backed by government initiatives, like 13th Five-Year Plan, Internet, and Made in China 2025. The trend can directly be witnessed in the ongoing R&D initiatives within the country.Starting in 2013, China began experimenting on Spintronics, and maintains a steady growth. The country had around 4,085 citations and patents in 2016.  The current storage solutions in demand in China are DRAM & SRAM, and if supported by technology, MRAM is expected to commercialize by 2022.High R&D capability in the region is likely to decrease the price of storage products in coming years. The Chinese government is encouraging foreign automakers to enter into 50/50 joint ventures, with Chinese companies, to make and sell cars and trucks in the Chinese market.In 2016, total vehicle sales in China reached over 28 million, up 13.7% from the previous year. 359,000 electric vehicles were sold in China compared to 159,000 in the United States.

Britain voices grave concerns over HuaweiStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeDecember 30, 2018 SundayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: MARKETS; Pg. 1Length: 486 wordsByline: Jean GarciaBodyReuters reported on Thursday, citing sources, thatthe White House is mulling an executive order as early as January that would bar usa companies from using telecommunications equipment made by Huawei and ZTE Corp., in the latest hit to China's two largest telecom equipment makers.Rural U.S. operators that are among the companies' biggest customers worry that they may also have to remove Chinese-made equipment without compensation.Huawei Technologies said it expects to record a 21 percent increase in revenue in 2019 despite the challenges in the global market that the Chinese tech giant has faced.The executive order would invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which gives the president the authority to regulate commerce in response to a national emergency.Last month, New Zealand barred China's Huawei on national-security grounds from supplying equipment for next-generation mobile networks and in August, Australia banned Huawei from supplying 5G equipment, citing a security threat to its infrastructure. "We've got to look at what partners such as Australia and the U.S. are doing to ensure that they have the maximum security of that 5G network and we've got to recognise the fact, as has been recently exposed, that the Chinese state does sometimes act in a malign way".Arron Hough: Missing British cruise worker search suspendedHarmony of the Seas , which has 18 decks, can accommodate 6,780 guests and 2,300 crew members, according to the cruise line . Royal Caribbean and the coast guard were unable to confirm how far the ship had travelled during that time.Huawei and ZTE already face big problems in the US market, as government agencies have been barred from buying their products under a new defense bill that came into law earlier in the year.A White House official said the U.S was "working across government and with our allies and like-minded partners to mitigate risk in the deployment of 5G and other communications infrastructure".Meanwhile the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hua Chunying responded to the report by saying she would not want to comment on the order directly as it has not yet been officially confirmed; however, she noted a day before yesterday that countries should produce facts to justify their security concerns. "This in reality is undoubtedly shutting oneself off, rather than being the door to openness, progress and fairness". That's because Huawei and ZTE's network switches and similar products tend to be less expensive than those sold by competitors.In the United States market, Huawei and ZTE are already facing too many difficulties. Bennett said it would cost $800 million to $1 billion for all RWA members to replace their ZTE and Huawei equipment. But Western governments are sounding the alarm over Huawei's core telecommunications business, due to concerns its equipment contains flaws that enable spying by the Chinese government.Load-Date: December 30, 2018End of Document

Jim Cramer: Apple Is a Perfect Metaphor for This MarketRealMoneyDecember 10, 2018 Monday 7:01 PM EDTCopyright 2018 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1215 wordsByline: Jim CramerHighlight: Apple makes the finest consumer products in history but its stock has gotten hammered in recent months.BodyTo be confident is to be foolish. That's how I feel every day now with the whippy market keeping the average investor's head on a swivel of a justifiable lack of conviction.Today's just another day when you look foolish at every turn. Here's a classic example. This morning my CNBC colleague David Faber broke the story that Qualcomm  had won a preliminary injunction in an obscure court in a small provincial court in China. The news caused the stock to plummet from $168 to $164. Then, on Scott Wapner's Halftime Show, the panelist, Josh Brown, Jon Najarian, Joe Terranova and I all said, unanimously, that Apple's  stock had hit an interesting level to buy.The stock turned on a dime and then rallied four bucks.I have scoured the wires: nothing else happened other than we said we liked it!You know what that is? A sign that traders will take their queue from anything.I by no means am denigrating our product. I am saying that the market is way too mercurial because the underlying issues are so fluid. Let's just stick with Apple for a second because it is the perfect metaphor for this market.First, at its apex Apple's capitalization hit one trillion dollars. It went below $800 billion today. The stock peaked on October 3 at $233. That happens to be the same day that Fed Chief Jerome Powell went off the reservation and began to talk about how we may need many more rate hikes to cool the economy, maybe even more than the economy can bear. Talk about an ill-advised series of statements.In retrospect and not coincidently, because his statements were such confidence bruisers it looks like that day may be the top of the entire business cycle.It gets worse. The next day Vice President Mike Pence gave a speech at the Hudson Institute that talked about containing China's power by starving it of the money it needs to keep expanding. It was a fiery, wide-ranging speech about how China's a worldwide scofflaw when it comes to far more than trade. If you didn't know better you would think he was speaking of the old Soviet Union a couple of years after World War 11.If the Powell's anti-inflation comments were the left uppercut, Pence was the right hook. The stock's really not had many up days since then even as it reported a pretty darned spectacular quarter on November 1.Why?Because Apple announced that it was no longer going to breakout sales of iPhones when it reported. Now some analysts -- in retrospect the smartest ones -- surmised that it was time to take profits in Apple because of this change. I have no idea if Apple knew what was about to happen or not, but we began to hear reports of pushbacks and cancellations from many of the companies that make cellphone components for Apple.What's the problem? We don't know. Some theorize the phones got too expensive. Others say there is a slowing in China. Still others say that the Chinese government wants a slowing in China, hence the court ruling that knocked down Apple today.No matter what, you can see how conviction can melt given the plethora of news about the fed and the economy, the trade relationship between the U.S. and China and the lack of a statement from Apple about how it is doing with cellphone sales coupled with a fear that perhaps Apple will actually pre-announce that previous guidance is too bullish.I do not know what will happen. I know this: Apple makes the finest consumer products in history, devices that represent great value that are all part of a fabulous ecosystem that includes, Macs, watches, payments and the App stores. These have all combined to produce a services revenue stream for 1.3 billion users that will only grow and grow and grow in importance even if sales stall at what will still be a highly elevated level.At these prices the stock sells well below the average equity in the S&P 500 as analyst after analyst who raised their price targets as the stock went up now slash them as it goes down. It's pretty hard to have conviction about this stock, though, when the selling is so pronounced and the analyst community has turned so negative on the company.Where else is conviction being tested? How about the upcoming Fed meeting on December 18 and 19.Here, like Apple, if you have conviction about the outcome of that session I think you may be faked out as this market loves to fake people out.Consider all of the permutations here. Two months ago Jay Powell committed the Fed to four lockstep rate hikes because the economy was so strong. Since then housing has fallen off a cliff as mortgage rates hit 5%. Auto sales slowed. Electricity use came down. Commercial real estate cooled and loan losses at regional banks began to climb. In a self-fulfilling prophecy the stock market shed trillions of dollars in wealth. Even last week's non-farm employment report was a clear miss causing people to wonder whether even the most important reason to hike, full employment concerns that could breed wage inflation, might be off the table. At the same time raw costs have become to come down because oil cratered and even OPEC with a call for a supply cut, hasn't been able to staunch the decline. Oil going down has a two-fold impact on the economy: it cools the hottest job market, Texas, and it allows individuals to have more money as oil is a real tax on the system.It's an optimal time for the Fed to say, you know what? We don't have to raise rates. Let's wait to see what happens. We will talk to you at our January meeting. Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.However, the Fed can't really do that without real negative consequences. I believe there will be plenty of observers who reach a conclusion that there must be something very wrong in the economy for the Fed to go from full bore rate hikers to no rate hikes. Given the horrendous action in the bank stocks, I think a consensus would quickly revolve around some mysterious credit losses that will scare people out of stocks.Darned if they do, given the slowing economy, darned if they don't, because they had led us to believe that things were stronger than we understood them to be.Oh there are so many other issues that test our conviction every day and overwhelm us. Does a day go by now without a revelation from some prosecution that President Trump was involved with something nefarious involving payments, the Russians, whatever? Does a day go by where we can figure out our trade relations with China? When you consider that the president was all smiles with Chinese President Xi Jinping at pretty much the same time that Canadian authorities, at the behest of our government, arrested the CFO of one of the largest companies in China for what amounted to extremely serious charges of violating our trading ban with Iran.We have no idea how this will end up. If the stock market keeps going down will President Trump release her and make nice to the Chinese? Or is President Trump going to stick to the Pence gameplan and continue to attack the Chinese for unfair trade and military practices.Almost every issue has two sides except those with three or four. In that environment is there any wonder that the market's unreliable and treacherous? Moreover, if you don't think it is, you have ice water in your veins. Bully for you, but the last time I looked it was better to have blood in them.Load-Date: December 11, 2018End of Document

Sany Construction Industry: Enabling the Buildings of the Future with Intelligent ManufacturingPR NewswireDecember 3, 2018 Monday 4:55 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2228 wordsDateline: CHANGSHA, China, Dec. 3, 2018 BodyPR NewswireCHANGSHA, China, Dec. 3, 2018 /PRNwswire/ -- Sany Construction Industry ("the Company"), Sany Group's residential construction subsidiary and a world leader in the manufacture of engineering machinery and equipment, concluded its presentation at the 2018 China (Changsha) Prefabricated Building and Construction Technology Expo (PBCTE or "the Expo"), where the company demonstrated its concept of providing green and smart industrialized buildings worldwide.The construction sector has been part of existence since the dawn of civilization. Despite several millennia of development, there has never been a fundamental change in its operational mode. Onsite construction, which requires a large number of laborers, is still the main blueprint for the sector. With this in mind, the intelligent construction sector may be the manufacturing industry's biggest opportunity.The construction industry helps to create comfortable homes for people to live in. Sany Group, a world leader in the manufacture of engineering machinery and equipment, has created many "firsts" in the construction industry. From the Three Gorges Dam to the Bird's Nest National Stadium in China and from the Americas to Africa, Sany Group engages in business everywhere. When it comes to talking about which companies have the wherewithal to undertake the task of transforming traditional construction practices, Sany Group can be counted among them.Before Sany drew the attention of visitors at PBCTE, it had showcased its SPCS technology at the 2018 Shanghai International City and Architecture Expo, demonstrating the company's efforts to lead the construction industry in the move towards intelligent manufacturing.From SPCS technology, which can match cast-in-place concrete structures in terms of performance, to digital projects that can be undertaken by a diverse workforce of robots, Sany is making efforts to empower the construction sector with a combination of a cast-in-place equivalents, digital factories and intelligent construction in tandem with an industry cloud platform, leading the way in the build-out of a prefabricated building and construction sector that is fully equipped to face the future.Prefabricated buildings have been a hot trendAlthough many manufacturing sectors have, through digitalization, made the transition from industrial 3.0 to industrial 4.0, the construction industry has not yet realized that revolution.Prefabricated buildings are buildings that can be manufactured in large quantities, just as is done with production lines in dozens of other industries and is the precursor to the revolution. Buildings can be completed by transporting the prefabricated building blocks to the site and then assembling them. This form of construction emerged at the beginning of the 20th century and took off in the 1960s. The UK, France and Russia were the first to jump into something resembling a large scale system, followed by the practice gradually spreading worldwide.The importance of the role that prefabricated buildings can play has been increasingly recognized in China. The Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development released the Outline of Modern Development of Building and Construction Industry ("the Outline") in 2015. According to the Outline, the Chinese government plans to increase the proportion of prefabricated buildings among all newly-built structures to over 20% by 2020 and to over 50% by 2025. Another document, the Guidance for Boosting the Development of Prefabricated Buildings, issued by the State Council on February 22, 2016, indicated that China aims to increase the share of prefabricated buildings that will make up all new construction to 30% within 10 years. In addition, the Action Plan for Prefabricated Buildings ("the Plan") in the 13th Five-Year Plan Period points out that the overall share of prefabricated buildings in the mix is expected to exceed 15% within the country by 2020, with the proportion to surpass 20% in selected key regions monitored by the Plan.Sany Group President Tang Xiuguo said, "With the support of favorable government policies, prefabricated buildings will become the mainstay of the next-generation building and construction industry. Unlike traditional cast-in-place reinforced concrete and masonry buildings, a prefabricated building consists of building blocks, including beams, panels, foundations and exterior walls, which are manufactured at plants and then transported to the site for installation after a maintenance and inspection process. A disruptive construction method, prefabricated buildings leverage standard building blocks and industrialized construction methods to re-create the traditional brick- and tile-based techniques handed down over thousands of years since the time of the Qin and Han dynasties."Addressing the pain points hobbling the industry through the power of technologyChina's Prefabricated Building Sector Strategic Planning and Corporate Strategy Consultation Report released by the Shenzhen-based Qianzhan Industry Research Institute, a leading Chinese industry consultancy, foresees the Chinese prefabricated building market reaching a value of 698.2 billion yuan (US$101 billion) by 2020 and 1.4389 trillion yuan (US$207 billion) by 2025.Despite the optimism in terms of the prospects for the market, the prefabricated building industry has been beset by several pain points for a long time. As one example, almost all concrete building standards are set based on cast-in-place concrete technology, while all the design software, which is approved by drawing inspectors and authorities, has been developed based on the same cast-in-place technology. As a result, the sector has some major challenges that need to be addressed, including ensuring a consistency of performance between prefabricated reinforced concrete structures and its cast-in-place counterparts, equal or enhanced bearing capacity, durability and ductility of the connectors or joints between prefabricated blocks or between prefabricated and cast-in-place blocks. Both in-country and global markets now lack a set of uniform standards and protocols based on proven practices. Cast-in-place equivalent technology effectively connects precast building blocks, primarily exterior walls, with cast-in-place blocks, supported by reliably connected rebars with the aim of creating a fabricated structure, which meets building structure safety standards and matches the cast-in-place structure. Several organizations, including Sany Group, have devoted themselves to addressing the challenges surrounding the technology.On October 10, 2018, the specifications for Sany Construction Industry's SPCS technology were released at the Tenth National Prefabricated Building Exchange Conference organized by China's Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, following review and unanimous approval by a group of expert judges. This marked the official roll-out of the assembled monolithic concrete structure system, setting in motion the next stage of industrialization of the Chinese construction sector."Based on the goal of achieving intelligent manufacturing-enabled industrialization, Sany Construction Industry developed an assembled monolithic composite structure system that meets the requirements of most buildings and proposed an approach to designing an SPCS structure system that can truly be comparable with cast-in-place concrete structures in terms of performance," Mr. Tang said. The Company's technicians developed proprietary production processes for composite concrete structure walls, columns, beams and slabs leading to the manufacturing of various types of equipment for superimposed shear wall production, laminated column integral forming, welding steel cage forming, steel sleeve extrusion and the automated production of prefabricated blocks. The firm also researched and developed a series of construction methods, including a technology for the quick installation of composite concrete structures as well as an installation and construction technology for a welded, reinforced cage capable of supporting and housing composite concrete structures, creating a model for superimposed construction of the structure. To date, applications for 93 patents relating to the technology system have been accepted by regulators. After undergoing and passing several force tests by various compliance authorities, the system has been recognized as the next-generation prefabricated structure system that can truly be comparable with cast-in-place concrete structures.Creating a new ecosystem of prefabricated buildingsSany seeks to drive the transformation of the traditional construction sector and provide green and smart industrialized buildings worldwide by taking full advantage of the company's core advantages in the equipment manufacturing sector and by integrating digital, information and internet technologies. Driven by this vision, Sany Group has positioned itself to lead the transformation that is taking place across the traditional construction market.Sany has put its stake into the ground. "Sany's core competitiveness lies in three key technologies and one platform through which the company empowers the construction sector and builds a complete solution for the prefabricated building market," said Sany Group Chief Architect Chen Guang. The three key technologies are SPCS technology, digital factories and smart construction, while the platform is Sany's big data-based visualized construction industry cloud platform.The ability to design and implement the technologies is based on Sany's extensive experience and deep expertise in monolithic composite structures, space flexibility and technology in advanced materials, while SPCS technology enables seamless combination of cast-in-place concrete and high-precision prefabricated components. Digital factories are made up of a diverse array of construction robots as well as sophisticated and smart prefabricated construction (PC) equipment. Sany Group developed a lineup of dedicated robots capable of replacing workers that engaged in what can best be termed as "back-breaking work," significantly reducing human costs and the risk of construction site accidents. Sany also manufactures a comprehensive range of production, transportation and installation equipment covering the entire industrialized construction process, including an automated PC production line, a dedicated PC mixing station, and a range of PC logistics and lifting equipment.Smart construction refers to Sany's perfected and smart field construction procedures and strong industrial team consisting of technicians with automation and computer knowledge. The workforce on each team is small in number, with each member well-versed in their area of specialization, making these teams the indispensable force for the development of green and smart buildings.The construction industry cloud platform is the result of Sany's efforts in promoting the in-depth integration of the enterprise with the information needed and the digitalization of that information for a fully-industrialized approach to the development and roll out of projects. Based on the Internet of Things and big data, the platform provides users with a digital management and monitoring interface from design to assembly and on through the whole production and construction process that integrates information and smart technologies throughout, enabling project owners and construction teams to have full control of the end-to-end process via the cloud.Sany's dream is to play a key role at the leading edge of the impending revolution of the prefabricated building sector, just as Siemens and General Motors did in their time, exporting standardized solutions to other manufacturers and enabling all players across the building and construction spectrum. Sany believes that investment in PC along with a few demonstrable successes is the best model for creating what is foreseen to be a profitable new industry.Based on existing land reserves, Sany looks forward to working with more partners to build a series of demonstration and benchmarking projects in the prefabricated building space throughout the country, further promoting Sany's hard technology strengths. The company also hopes to build several localized training platforms in various regions in a move to encourage more individuals in the construction sector to look at the development of prefabricated building as an exciting career path with good prospects. To sum up, Sany's mission is to share its advanced concepts in a move to transform the construction sector with prefabricated technologies, and to encourage the construction of sustainable and green buildings.The trends of the times have opened up many opportunities in the prefabricated building space, but also for innovative enterprises such as Sany. Sany is confident in its ability to fill the role of transforming the sector with intelligent manufacturing and open a new era of construction through a reasonable and well-thought-out application of its technology, knowledge and expertise. View original content to download multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sany-construction-industry-enabling-the-buildings-of-the-future-with-intelligent-manufacturing-300758817.htmlSOURCE Sany Construction IndustryCONTACT: Li Jun, +86-138-1185-3697, lij4038@sany.com.cnLoad-Date: December 4, 2018End of Document

Lawmakers clash over claims of Google's anti-GOP biasPolitico.comDecember 11, 2018 Tuesday 3:15 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 1208 wordsByline: agold@politico.com,  (Ashley Gold)BodyGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai on Tuesday became the latest tech executive to face the ire of congressional Republicans on Capitol Hill in an escalating fight over allegations of online bias - claims the company and Democratic lawmakers flatly dispute. Those claims proved to be the central thread in a marathon House Judiciary hearing with Pichai, which also saw critiques and questions from both sides of the aisle on issues ranging from Google's flirtations with launching a search product in China to antitrust concerns to digital privacy. In an unusual move, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy kicked off the hearing - despite not sitting on the committee - by cautioning the tech mogul against letting political bias color its services. The lawmaker, who's been a leading voice among the prominent Republicans accusing top tech firms in Silicon Valley of censoring conservative speech, said he hoped Pichai could reassure the committee that "any political bias within Google's workforce does not creep into its search products." "We need to know that Google is on the side of the free world, and that it will provide its services free of anti-competitive behavior, political bias and censorship," McCarthy said. But Rep. Jerry Nadler, House Judiciary ranking member and presumptive chair of the panel when Democrats take the House in the next Congress, dismissed out of hand what he called "entirely fictitious allegations of anti-conservative bias." "We should not let the delusions of the far right distract us from the real issues that should be the focus of Tuesday's hearing," Nadler said in opening remarks. "No credible evidence supports this right-wing conspiracy." In recent weeks, conservatives have pointed to reports of Google staffers internally expressing support for liberal policies and leaders to accuse the company of bias. But Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren, whose district lies within Silicon Valley, said the leanings of tech staffers "has nothing to do with the algorithms and really automated process that is the search engine." There is no "little man behind the curtain" steering search results, she contended in her questioning of Pichai. Pichai repeatedly pushed back on the conservative critiques, committing in his opening to leading the company "without political bias." Later, in response to questioning from Rep. Lamar Smith over Google News minimally featuring conservative media outlets, Pichai said, "We find that we have a wide variety of sources, including sources from the left and right." Conservatives including President Donald Trump have ramped up accusations that Google and other internet companies are biased against them and their views, stoking the passions of their Republican base even as the incoming Democratic House majority remains highly skeptical of the allegations. McCarthy, RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and Trump's 2020 campaign chairman Brad Parscale are among the GOP officials who've complained about a host of perceived Silicon Valley slights against conservatives. They range from Facebook's alleged stripping of ad revenue from the pro-Trump video-blogging duo Diamond and Silk to a Google search result that briefly paired the California GOP with "Nazism." Despite the heated words over bias claims, lawmakers did find common ground during the hearing in voicing concern over Google's reported development of a censored search engine it could operate in China. Critics say the effort, dubbed "Project Dragonfly," would further the Chinese government's efforts to block the free flow of information to its citizens. McCarthy on Tuesday called the reports "troubling," and Nadler said he was disturbed by the prospect of Google developing a product that would blacklist certain words at the Chinese government's behest. While Pichai said the company currently has "no plans to launch" a search product in China, he declined to rule out doing so in the future during an exchange with Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline, the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee.  Pichai framed the company's pursuit as "a limited effort internally," indicating they are not currently in discussions over it with Chinese authorities. But he acknowledged the company at one point had over 100 staffers working on the project. Lawmakers broached a number of other hot-button topics, including political advertising on the platform, Google CEO Sundar Pichai Android phone location tracking, concerns over white supremacist content on Google subsidiary YouTube and disinformation that Russia seeks to spread online. Panel members also seized on the company's Monday reveal that a coding bug exposed the data of more than 50 million users of the Google+ social network to third-party app developers. "While Google has so far found no evidence that developers were abusing these bugs, or that any user profile data was misused, incidents like this still raise legitimate questions about what types of data exposures a company is obligated to publicly disclose," Nadler said.  Google already acknowledged in October that a separate bug exposed the information of up to 500,000 Google+ users to hundreds of third-party groups, prompting the company to announce it would shutter the social networking site in August. Now, due to the latest bug discovery, the company said it plans to wind down the product by April.  The revelations comes as top tech companies face mounting pressure in Washington to protect consumer data amid a series of high-profile breaches. The incidents have prompted lawmakers to call for Congress to enact national data privacy legislation, an issue that appears poised to gain steam in the next Congress. Privacy concerns were at the center of a number of moments during Tuesday's hearing in which lawmakers appeared to struggle with their grasp of the complex issues facing Google. During one contentious exchange, Republican Rep. Ted Poe held up his iPhone and pressed Pichai to say whether Google was currently tracking his movements.  "Does Google know, through this phone, that I am moving over there?" Poe said, gesturing toward the other side of the hearing room. Pichai declined to answer, saying he could not know definitively without getting more information. Google does not make iPhones. Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, whose district covers parts of Silicon Valley, called the questioning "embarrassing" on Twitter. "Can a 5th grader from Poe's district please give Poe a tutorial on what an app is?" he tweeted.  During another exchange, Rep. Steve Cohen said, "I use your apparatus often, or your search engine," in reference to Google. Tech literacy surfaced as an issue on Capitol Hill after Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified earlier this year, a hearing during which several lawmakers seemed befuddled by how the social network functions.  Prior to the hearing, Infowars leader Alex Jones, a far-right conspiracy theorist who's accused the nation's leading tech companies of anti-conservative bias, stood outside the hearing room to rail against Google for "censorship." Jones, flanked by longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone, took a seat just a few rows back from Pichai as the hearing got under way. Article originally published on POLITICO MagazineLoad-Date: December 13, 2018End of Document

The global tin market valued at 350.74 kilo metric ton In 2017, is expected to witness a [ ] The post Tin Market Analysis and Growth Forecast by Applications, Sales, Size, Types and Competitors by 2023 appeared first on Journalist Book.The Tin Market report evaluates the important characteristics of the Tin market based on present industry scenarios, market demands and business strategies. The Market report separates the Tin industry based on the Types, Applications, Key Players & Regions.The global tin market valued at 350.74 kilo metric ton In 2017, is expected to witness a CAGR of 2.22% during the forecast period, 2018 to 2023. In 2018, in terms of volume, Asia-Pacific is poised to dominate the global market, and is expected to witness the highest CAGR during the forecast period. The continuously growing demand from China in various end-user industries, primarily electronics, is boosting the demand for tin in the Asia-Pacific Region at a healthy pace.Increasing Demand from Electronics IndustryThe major end-user application of tin in the electronics industry is as a solder. Tin is often used in various purities and alloys, generally with lead and indium. Soldering is one of the potential end-user applications in the electronics industry. About 50% to 70% of the overall tin produced is used in the electronics & electrical industry in various products, such as mobiles, tablets, computers, and other consumer electronic devices. Additionally, according to JEITA, semiconductor manufacturing was estimated to have registered the fastest growth of 21% in 2016, while in 2018, it is forecasted to rise by 7%. Such positive growth in the electronics manufacturing industry is expected to drive the market for tin through the forecast period.Tin Plating to be the Fastest-growing ApplicationTin plating is an electrolytic process. It is done primarily for the purpose of providing a level of protection or corrosion resistance to a wide range of products. Tin is generally applied over a preliminary coating of copper. Due to its characteristics, such as lightweight, white metal, durable, malleable, good tensile strength, resistance to corrosion, non-toxic, high solderability, ductile, etc., tin is used as plating in metals and alloys, by either dipping or electroplating. China is one of the largest consumers and producers of tin and tin plating. Therefore, it will augment the usage of tin in the application of tin plating. China to be the Dominating MarketChina was the largest producer and consumer of tin In 2017. The automotive industry, being one of the major contributors in the tin market, has grown rapidly in the past five years. However, the Chinese automotive industry remains fragmented. This scenario is likely to have a positive impact on the tin demand from the Chinese automotive sector. In addition, Chinese central government officials fear the unchecked expansion of Chinas auto industry, encouraged by local authorities, could harm the wider economy and that excess capacity must be stopped. Hence, the central government continues to push for mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the automotive industry, which will support the emergence of a few leading national companies. The other major end-user industries for tin include electrical & electronics, heavy engineering, packaging, etc. Chinaâ  s information & communication technology (ICT) sector has grown at a rapid pace in the past decade, owing to the support of the Chinese government and favorable digitization plans and policies. Ask for Sample Copy of Report @ https://www.industryresearch.biz/enquiry/request-sample/13101848Tin market report provides the comprehensive analysis of the market, based on leading players of present, past of Tin Industry and resourceful data that will act as a supportive guide for leading players.Major Key Players of Tin Market Report: ArcelorMittal, Avalon Rare Metals Inc., DowDuPont, Gejiu Zili Mining and Smelting Co.

UMeWorld Provides Corporate Update and Reaffirms UMFun Growth TrendGlobeNewswireDecember 20, 2018 Thursday 5:00 AM PTCopyright 2018 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: PRESS RELEASESLength: 837 wordsBodyHONG KONG, CHINA, Dec.  20, 2018  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NEWMEDIAWIRE -- UMeWorld Limited (OTC:UMEWF) is pleased to provide the following corporate update:UMFunThroughout the past 6 months, the government has issued a series of new regulations governing the after-school education market, which have created some uncertainty for both online and offline education companies. The regulations have strengthened regulatory supervision, heightened compliance standards and standardized operations. We believe that the government's ultimate objective is to pursue a policy of balanced development of education in the K-12 system, to strengthen the equality of education and promote a harmonious teaching platform in China. We fully support these new government policies and believe that our UMFun product, designed to level the playing field for education, will benefit under these new initiatives in the longer term.As previously announced, UMFun paid subscribers exceeded 300,000 in June, 2018. This number has since risen to over 500,000 in the past 30 days. While we are pleased with UMFun's performance under current circumstances, the regulatory environment has resulted in teachers being more cautious recommending ancillary educational products to parents. At the same time, the new regulations have compelled a large number of online and offline education companies to cease operations. These regulatory developments have raised the entry barriers to new participants and will result in a stronger and more sustainable market environment in the long term.Corporate DevelopmentIn May, 2018, the Company received a letter of intent from an Investment Bank based in U.S. for a proposed up-listing of the Company to Nasdaq. We have temporarily halted the discussion process due to general market uncertainty and the recent changes in Chinese government regulations, as stated above. The Company has decided to revisit this opportunity and plans to complete the uplisting in 2019.       About UMeWorldWe are an educational technology company and a visionary player in the online educational landscape in China.

I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Thursday, October 25th. Your top stories at 8:00 a.m. Eastern. Breaking news out of New York City, the police department here transporting a suspicious package found in a new -- in New York City at a restaurant in Tribeca owned by actor Robert De Niro. It appears to be similar to the explosive packages sent to prominent Democrats and CNN.This would be the eighth such package. Markets eyeing a rebound. Futures are pointing to a 143 point gain on the Dow futures. Futures were up more earlier in the session. But this is after a sharp selloff on Wall Street yesterday. The Dow and S&P 500 now in the red for the year. The NASDAQ in correction territory down more than 10 percent from its recent high. Checking the action in Europe, we have gains to report in France and Germany. But in Asia overnight, markets were mostly lower there.The Nikkei in Japan at its lowest level in six months and the KOSPI in South Korea now in a bear market down 20 percent from its recent high. Technology earnings setting the tone on Wall Street, Twitter, Tesla, and Microsoft all rising on better than expected earnings. Twitter being the biggest gainer there up more than 14 percent. Again, it's extracting more revenue from this existing user base and then Tesla up more than 10 percent reporting a surprise profit for the quarter.Its biggest quarterly profit ever. After the close today, all eyes will be on Amazon and Google's parent, Alphabet. All that and so much more coming up this morning. The Federalist Commentary Writer, Emily Jashinsky, Rosecliff CEO Managing Partner, Mike Murphy, and the Brewer Group CEO, former NFL star, Jack Brewer. Great to spend the morning with you. But we want to get to what you're here for, Maria Bartiromo, she sat down for an exclusive interview with Oracle Co-Founder Larry Ellison.In part two, the tech giant touches on his philanthropic efforts, China's intellectual property theft, and the state of politics in America.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: You mentioned Democrats and Republicans. Let me ask you about that because you are a big donor. You were a donor during the 2016 election. You supported Marco Rubio. How is President Trump doing?LARRY ELLISON, CO-FOUNDER, ORACLE CORPORATION: Well, I think the economy is doing great. So, again, I was Bill Clinton's second largest contributor when he ran for office. You know, I -- I'm neither a Democrat nor a Republican. I tend to be in the middle which means very lonely. There's almost, you know, the country has become very polarized. But --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: -- came push on that. I feel like we're all hanging out in the middle. But very few of us have this monolithic views that you're just all Republican everything in your life are all Democrat everything in your life.ELLISON: I know -- I know there are people that are very passionate on the left and there are people very, you know, very passionate on the right. I tend to be in the dispassionate middle, you know, the kind of boring dispassionate middle. And I've, you know, very close friends with Tony Blair and, you know, yes, Bill Clinton. That was called the third way back then. That was, you know, that was a -- Bill Clinton was a centrist. You know, Tony Blair is a centrist.Marco Rubio is a centrist. Mitt Romney is a centrist. That -- those are my politics. In terms of assessing the Trump administration, I think -- I think there's a style and then there's substance and I'm not going to comment about style. But I'm very happy that the United States economy is doing well. I'm very happy we're at record low unemployment rates. There are a lot of good things that have happened. People want to assign some of the credit to Barack Obama.Some -- Donald Trump and that's their -- everyone has their own opinion. I just -- I just think it's wonderful to see the U.S. economy growing again over four percent. I think our big competitor is China and that if we let China's economy pass us up, if we let China develop, you know, produce more engineers than we do, if we let China's technology companies beat our technology companies, it won't be long that our military is behind technologically also.Our economy is behind technologically. We have a serious competition going on with China. I'm on Team USA. I would like us to be successful. I'd like us to develop and protect our technologies. I think we have to do that. I think we have to invest in our economy and grow our economy, so we can compete with the first serious -- the first serious threat if you will or first serious competitor we've had since the 1930s.BARTIROMO: I couldn't agree more. And China won't admit that they've been stealing our I.P. for decades. So first, we're going to get them to admit it in order for them to change their behavior. And I'm -- and it's good that this administration has pushed back on China.ELLISON: Yes. No. I think the I.P. -- the appropriation of our I.P. is a -- is a huge advantage for them. I mean they could spend -- they got all of our I.P. -- our I.P. and all of their own I.P. and there are some very talented engineers in China. They're producing a lot of them. So we've got to do a better job of protecting our I.P.BARTIROMO: Yesterday when I was speaking with Mark, I asked her about the DOD contract. Oracle is obviously competing for business with the Pentagon. Amazon wants it too. But Google walks away from the business with the DOD, and, yet, they are all in on going into China and having their search engine censored. Your reaction.ELLISON: Well, I think, you know, it's actually kind of shocking. Here, Jeff Bezos and I absolutely agree. I think U.S. tech companies who say we will not -- we will not support the U.S. military, you know, we will not -- we will not work on any technology that helps our military. But, yet, goes into China and facilitates the Chinese government surveilling their people is pretty shocking. I think it's very important that the U.S. technology companies support our country, our government.We are a democracy. If we don't like our leaders, we can throw them out. If you don't like the leaders in China, you can fill in the blank, you know.BARTIROMO: You're dealing with a dictator for life.ELLISON: Yes. Xi is the most important leader in China since Mau. He's now been elevated, you know, to that level. And I don't see how a company like Google can say, OK, we're going to aggressively pursue business in China and stay away from -- stay away from doing anything with our U.S. military. I think it's a terrible miscalculation. I mean our democracy and the democratic systems are in competition now with communist/socialists systems.And we like to see our democratic capitalist system emerge victorious in this competition versus communist socialists systems.BARTIROMO: Of course, I could not agree more by the way. Meanwhile, these companies have gotten so big and so powerful. I'm talking social media companies, Google, Amazon, Facebook, and so now they're in the crosshairs of the U.S. government not only because of the power and their size, but also because of this talk and speculation and in some cases evidence that they are censoring conservative conversation. Your thoughts.ELLISON: Well, I think the people who run Facebook and the people who run Google are a lot of very young engineers. I mean I think Silicon Valley is in California. California is a, you know, is a politically progressive place and I think to some degree these companies are responding in a way their employees, you know, the employees prefer them to respond. The employees want to work, you know, want Google to do progressive things.Facebook wants, you know, Facebook to do progressive things. The progressive things -- Apple employees want to do progressive things, majority of things. When Apple refused to unlock the phone of terrorist who committed mass murder --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: San Bernardino.ELLISON: In San Bernardino and said those people are entitled to privacy. And Apple will decide, you know, if the phone is going to be lock or unlock. Apple, not the courts, not our courts. But Apple would make that decision is just bizarre. I mean it shows the political distortions that can exist in some of these companies. I think -- we live under democracy. If I don't like our government, I can vote for somebody else, you know, we have a choice.You know, we can pick a very progressive government. We have very progressive government under Barack Obama and Barack Obama, you know, is President of United States. I'm still in Team USA. You know, that's my team. Our captain is progressive. Great. The -- I think it's very important that our democratic capitalist system win the battle, win this competition with China. We don't want to -- we don't want to find ourselves in second place.BARTIROMO: So you're comfortable with the foreign policy out of this administration as well? I know you are -- you've been a big supporter of Israel? Were you happy with the president's decision to move the embassy?ELLISON: I was. And I know -- I know -- and I understand that that's a very controversial decision. The interesting thing was ever -- almost every candidate including Barack Obama, you know, and Bill Clinton promised to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. They just didn't do it. In this case, the promise was kept. But anyway, regardless of which president moved it, I'm very glad to see that our embassy is now in the Capital of Israel.BARTIROMO: With your great success, you've also become a great philanthroper. Talk to us about what drives your giving, you've done much for education, for cancer research. I love what you're doing on wellness. What drives these decisions or these things that are just important to you or you -- like for example, wellness?ELLISON: Well, health and making -- really, I have a foundation, a charitable foundation where one of the slogans is cures, not care. In other words, we spend a huge amount of money caring for people who are ill rather than preventing the illnesses supporting wellness. The money is much better spent. People are much happier not in the hospital, healthy, at home, with their -- with their families and that we should have programs that support wellness as opposed to -- I mean, hey, we have to care for people who are sick.There will be a lot fewer people sick if we focus on wellness. There will be a fewer people sick if we focus on drug discovery and find cures for some of these terrible diseases.BARTIROMO: And a moment ago you said if I had t to do it again, I would choose biotech.ELLISON: I would -- I used choose biotech because --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Tell me about that.ELLISON: Well, I think this is where you're going to see the most dramatic changes and dramatic new technologies being developed will be in biotech. You will see most of the common diseases including lots and lots of cancers are becoming much more manageable than they ever were. You know, cancer is not a disease, it's a family of diseases, family of diseases of the DNA. And we're getting better and better at managing these things and even curing them, and I think you'll see lots and lots of diseases disappear over the next 25 years.Aging will be managed much better than it's been managed. That people -- maybe that, you know, people say about you -- what you -- you think of people live forever. I have no idea. But as they get older, they'll be much healthier and they'll enjoy their lives for a longer period of time, so while they're around, while we're around, we'll have much long, you know, longer periods of health in our -- in our later years than we have right now. And all of this is very important.I also focus on the very young, on education. If we're going to bring improvements to the economy in Africa, we just have to do two things. We have to do a better job of feeding the kids, so they're not hungry and they got to do a better job of educating the kids. So the combination of nutrition and education in places like rural India and rural Africa is -- those are the two primary focuses of my philanthropic foundation.(END VIDEOTAPE)MCDOWELL: More of Maria's exclusive interview with Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison coming up. And hear what he says about self-driving cars and Elon Musk. Coming up, a search for a sender intensifies. Fox now confirming another suspicious package has been found this morning in Delaware addressed to former Vice President Joe Biden. That will bring the total to nine packages. This after another, the eighth package was addressed to Robert De Niro found in New York City in Tribeca, Lower Manhattan.The latest developments ahead. Plus, Twitter shares soaring beating earnings expectations 13 percent gain. More next.MCDOWELL: Tech earnings front and center this morning. Twitter results wowing investors. Gerri Willis has all the details at the New York Stock Exchange. Good morning, Gerri.GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Hey, good morning, Dagen. That's right. Twitter up 13 percent premarket and avoid on those results, 21 cents a share versus 14 expected, a blowout revenue higher up, 29 percent nearly 30 percent to 758 million. One important thing people have not notice this morning. First consecutive quarterly drop and users reported as they purge these fake accounts. Those accounts down nine million to three hundred and twenty-six million monthly active users.And Amazon coming after the bell today. You see its estimates, a 500 percent gain year-over-year. That would be $3.14 a share for this quarter versus 52. Revenue expected to come in at $57.1 billion. What are investors watching? Amazon web services, cloud computing profits because now they rival the detailing division of terms of profits and when we hear anything about that wage hike, $15 wage hike. Google also coming after the bell today, the estimate $10.42 a share versus $9.57 a year ago, revenue of $30 billion.We'll be watching what Google pays to acquire their customers. Tesla last night a blowout, the first profit in seven quarters, $2.97 a share. That stock on fire. Free cash flow was higher. That's important for investors. Microsoft also coming in last night beating on the top and bottom line watching as their cloud computing, that business up 76 percent. Of course, they can't continue growing at this rate simply because of its size. But a positive report hybrid computing was higher.And also, the gain business with Fortnite, so that was a positive for Microsoft as well. All tech, all the time, Dagen. Back to you.MCDOWELL: Gerri, thank you so much for that. What is the most important thing that investors should pay attention to, Mike Murphy, today?MIKE MURPHY, CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF VENTURES: Outside of Fortnite? It's growth for the large tech. So you saw it from Microsoft as we talked earlier. That was a good report. But Amazon and Google have to be able to support the story that they're still growth that you should still pay up for these big growth names. If that changes, it's a negative for the overall market because I think you won't see a rotation out of big tech into other areas at the market.I think you'll see money cut more money coming out of market. But I think of that growth story is still intact. It's back to risk on people put money back to work in the market.MCDOWELL: Because you've seen in the last several days and these sell-offs the industrials really getting whacked because, again, they are vulnerable to that -- those pricing pressure and the ability to pass whether it's from tariffs or just ginned overall inflation.MURPHY: Absolutely. I mean the last 30 days we went from an all-time high to what we have now roughly 10 percent correction in the overall markets, so everything has been getting hit. I mean and nothing has really been spared here. So the question now is to say standard pullback in the market or is it the start of something more? I'm still in the camp that it's a standard pullback and a buying opportunity.MCDOWELL: And for people worry about rising longer term interest rates they stabilize a little bit. So maybe there's a little bit of a bright spot there. Coming up, two more suspicious packages, Fox now confirming a package had been sent to Delaware found in Delaware addressed to former Vice President Joe Biden. And another package addressed to Robert De Niro found in New York City early this morning. That's the eighth and ninth packages. We have the developments ahead.Plus, the real cost of tariffs, a number of us executives who say they plan to pass along the cost of tariffs to consumers. That's ahead. Stay with us.MCDOWELL: A nationwide manhunt underway, Fox News confirming that another suspicious package has been found this morning in Delaware addressed to former Vice President Joe Biden. This directly follows an eight suspicious package found at the location of a restaurant owned by actor Robert De Niro in New York City. Edward Lawrence is live at the White House with the very latest. Good morning, Edward.EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Dagen. And a spokesman at the Tribeca Film Center confirms that that package in New York City was addressed to Robert De Niro and also similar to the other packages that the FBI is looking for. They also mentioned that facility Joe Biden confirmed to Fox News that a similar package was addressed to Joe Biden. This again makes the ninth package with the first one coming on Monday to Democratic supporter George Soros.The FBI, it's important to know here is very concerned there may be more of these packages working their way through the mail system. They released this photograph of what the packages look for. Those packages have a return address of Debbie Wasserman Schultz that is misspelled. Now, the agency saying be on the lookout for these. Now, if all of these packages have not exploded. The president tweeting out today now blaming the media saying a big part of the anger we see today in our society is caused by purposely false and inaccurate reporting of the mainstream media that I refer to as fake news.It has gotten so bad and hateful that beyond -- it's beyond description. At his campaign rally, President Donald Trump said that acts or threats of political violence have no place in democracy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: No nation can succeed that tolerates violence or the threat of violence as a method of political intimidation, coercion, or control. We all know that. Such conduct must be fiercely opposed and firmly prosecuted.(END VIDEO CLIP)LAWRENCE: And the president also adding that if folks are angry, they should take that anger out at the ballot box and go vote. The midterm elections just 12 days away, Dagen.MCDOWELL: Edward, thank you so much for that report. Edward Lawrence from the White House for us. Coming up, how tariffs hit consumers, it's a question. Find out the number of executives who say that they do plan to pass along these higher costs to consumers, to the customer. The details ahead. Plus, more of Maria's exclusive interview with Larry Ellison. He weighs on self-driving cars and Elon Musk. That's ahead.MCDOWELL: Welcome back, I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Thursday, October 25th, your top stories at 8:30 a.m. Eastern. We have breaking news on a ninth suspicious package that has been found at a postal facility in Delaware. This one addressed to former Vice President Joe Biden. This is the second package found today, ninth in all. This is after police in New York City transported a suspicious package earlier this morning found at a restaurant or near a restaurant owned by actor Robert De Niro in New York City. Both packages similar to those sent to prominent Democrats in the last two days.Futures are showing this in stock market action, 156-point gain on the Dow Futures. We're waiting on breaking economic news right now. It looks like September durable goods have come in up 0.8 of one percent. That was versus expectations of one percent decline in September durable goods. These are orders for long-lasting items, but again, a little bit of a better news on the durable good front. In Europe, we take a look at the market action there. We have gains across the board to tell you about. In Asia overnight, it was mostly lower.Let's move on to big names reporting earnings this morning here in the States: Twitter, Stanley Black & Decker, Southwest, and Comcast, among those that we've heard from this morning. You can take a look at how those stocks are faring in premarket trading. Twitter, it was a blowout for investors to the upside, almost 13-point percentage gain on Twitter in premarket trading, so some good news there. Extracting more revenue from its existing user base. And then, Maria's Fox Business Exclusive, Oracle's Larry Ellison sat down with Maria Bartiromo for a one-on-one. We hear from the cofounder of Oracle even more as he weighs in on self-driving cars, and computing in the cloud.Let's turn now to the impact of tariffs on American business. A new survey by EY finds that 86 percent of American executives affected by tariffs plan on pursuing M&A activity in response to trade restrictions. 72 percent say they're going to pass along any increases to their own customers. Here now to break this all down in a Fox Business Exclusive is EY Americas Vice Chair of Transaction Advisory Services, Bill Casey. Bill, what was the big standout for this survey, and how many -- how many CEOs did you survey?BILL CASEY, VICE CHAIR OF TRASACTION ADVISORY SERVICES, EY AMERICAS: We surveyed about 500 CEOs in the U.S. And with the stand -- but clearly, what sticks out from the report, is that this is going to play out over a couple of years. In the short-term, companies are reacting to this either by tweaking their procurement strategy or looking at M&A as a way to offset some of the impacts of the trade restrictions.MCDOWELL: When you say tweaking procurement strategy, that means sourcing goods from countries not hit by these tariffs? Is that what you --CASEY: Potentially, because the first decision is you have to get a perspective on how long you think these tariffs will be impacted? And over 50 percent of the respondents think that these tariffs will be in play for at least two years. So, decision one is do you think it's long-term or not long-term? Then it's can you design the product that you're sourcing from a lower cost country out of your good, and if not, then you have to look at other strategies.MURPHY: So, have -- in this poll that you guys did, the tariffs obviously serve as a tax to these companies, but do any of the CEOs talk about the positive side of it where they're seeing a stronger economy here in the U.S. where just the demand or the pricing pressure they now have to the upside can outweigh the tariffs, possibly?CASEY: Yes, and it depends on your perspective. From a consumer standpoint, the price of these goods, at some point, it's going to have to go up. If you can't push it down the supply chain, the ultimately area push it to the consumer. On the other side, you know, obviously, this is going to stimulate investment in the U.S. and would create jobs. And the U.S. continues to be a very attractive place for investment outside the U.S. So, we see a lot of M&A inbound activity as a result of this.JACK BREWER, CEO, THE BREWER GROUP: What about vertical integration? Obviously, a lot of these businesses sure are, you know, that's the ultimate goal, and you see a lot of the businesses now that are more successful, all those that have able to do that. Is that something that you found in your report?CASEY: Yes, absolutely. So, the question then is, if you can't bring in - - import the goods, you're going to invest in M&A or invest in the businesses here in the U.S. to vertically integrate that. On the inverse of that is if you're exporting goods, it may be cheaper to vertically integrate outside the U.S.MCDOWELL: Is it safe to say that the overall economic impact and the impact on the end customer or consumer will still be very small? Because again, if you look -- I was looking at the caterpillar numbers when they came out was trying to estimate what the cost of the tariffs would be. In terms of their overall business, they -- it was close to $100 million for the year. And that's a big number if you look at it in a vacuum, but in terms of overall billions and billions of profits that Caterpillar makes every year, it's quite small.CASEY: Yes. The -- clearly, on the tier 1 suppliers in the supply chain, I think the impact is what you're saying is not that significant. I think whether this plays out again -- this will play out over a couple of years. When you go into the supply chain for the tier 2, the tier 3 suppliers, they're probably larger impacts, but it's hard -- it's really hard to tell and I think part of this always really comes down to is this going to be -- are these tariffs going to be longer-term or is this going to be shorter- term? I think, you know, that needs to be played up.MCDOWELL: Did they talk -- did the executives talk about the politics of it all? Because when it -- because in the survey it says, our respondents believe tariffs will last until at least 2020. Well, that's the election year. So, again, it's -- well, President Trump is going to be in office until at least through 2020, if not another four more years. Are they looking at it through the lens of politics?CASEY: Yes. It's difficult to say through the -- through the survey. But, you know, one of the other factors considered here is most of these agreements with suppliers are two to three years.MCDOWELL: OK.CASEY: So, you know, a lot of this stuff is locked into place already. So, you know, it certainly weighs into this. So, you know, we'll see how this works out.EMILY JASHINSKY, COMMENTARY WRITER, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: Can you talk about the age differences that you noticed in the survey here? The differences between -- I mean, generations, Baby Boomers versus Gen-Xers, you know, people growing up when -- and the quote here, free-trade was, quote, an assumed policy. Talk about what the poll found on that.CASEY: Yes. When you go back and you look at the last -- the impacts of the financial crisis, the free-trade was to solve all these problems. And that whether governments imposed tariffs or governments pushed for nationalism, that free-trade would override all of those controls, and I think it's a different economy now. And for the folks that are above 50, they have a longer-term view on this that the impacts will not be as strict so forth. The generation in the 20s and 30s, they haven't lived through the global financial crisis, you know, they have -- they have a different view, I think. They're viewing that the impact get more severe.MCDOWELL: I love how Ford's CFO in the -- you know, after the earnings, told reporters of tariff-related costs and unexpected erosion results in Europe and China prompted the economy to retreat from its 2020 margin report, but I love how Ford says that, when Ford and General Motors, and Chrysler have benefited since the mid-60s from a tariff that the United States has in placed on light truck imports. This is called a chicken tax, a 25-percent tariff. It's related to a fight that we got into with Europe or France over poultry. And so, that's been emplaced forever. So, these automakers have benefited. So, there is -- there is upside depending on where that tariff hits.CASEY: Yes. And when you look at supply chains, and for the large multinational companies, these are very, very connected and very complex supply chains. So, the capital ultimately flow to where the path of least resistance. So, you know, hence, there's a lot of M&A activity to do workarounds with respect to this. So, this is why we're seeing so much activity. And as we mentioned in the survey, 86 percent of the companies that are impacted by these tariffs are going to either buy something or sell something. But I'd say the good news from the U.S. is that most of these acquisitions are going to occur in the U.S.BREWER: That's phenomenal. It is.MCDOWELL: Right. That's phenomenal, indeed. Bill, thank you for being here.CASEY: Thank you.MCDOWELL: Great to see you. Bill Casey of EY. Coming up, two more suspicious packages found this morning, one addressed to former Vice President Joe Biden, the other to actor Robert De Niro. Stuart Varney weighs in. And more of Maria's exclusive interview with Larry Ellison, the Oracle co-founder talked self-driving cars and Elon Musk. That's ahead.MCDOWELL: A total of nine suspicious packages have been sent to prominent Democrats over the last two days, unleashing a nationwide manhunt for who is responsible. Joining me now, the host of "VARNEY & COMPANY," Stuart Varney. Good morning, Stuart, what do you say?STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Look, Dagen, I really didn't like the response to these incidents. My first thought was, look, it has come to this? There are bombs being planted right before an election? I think you crossed a line at that point. When Donald Trump came out very quickly and appealed for unity, peace, and harmony, and he did it in a somber and restrained tone, I thought he pitched it just right, that's exactly what should be said at this time. Come on, let's get back together again, end this toxic politics, which makes it impossible for us to talk to each other.But then, right after that, Nancy Pelosi and Senator Schumer came out and said blame Trump, that he has condoned violence, therefore, we just -- we don't like what he has got to say. I thought that was highly inappropriate and exactly the wrong thing at that time. Surely, this is an opportunity for us to say, it has come to this? Let's back off a little bit here on both sides. Come on, back off, let's get back together again.MCDOWELL: Well, the narrative is, Stuart, that no one ever did anything bad or evil before President Trump was elected to the -- to the highest office in the land, and everything that goes wrong in this country is -- he's to blame for. Let's try laying the -- let's try laying the blame on the person who sent these explosive devices, shall we?VARNEY: Absolutely. Yes. And let's not forget that Trump derangement syndrome is real and appears to be motivating many people on the left. They just can't let it go. Everything has to be a negative for Trump. He is to blame for everything. I think that's just flat-out wrong. If that's an election strategy, I really hope it backfires quite frankly, I really do.MCDOWELL: Stuart, we will see you in about 15 minutes almost.VARNEY: Sure thing. Thanks, Dagen.MCDOWELL: "VARNEY & COMPANY" starts every day at 9:00 a.m. Eastern. Coming up, more of Maria's exclusive interview with Larry Ellison after the break.MCDOWELL: The wave of the future, here's what Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison told Maria Bartiromo in her exclusive interview about how technology is transforming industries from transportation to healthcare.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: Are you expecting to live past 100?(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: I mean, do you think about that?ELLISON: I have -- I don't think about it. I think -- I usually think about, you know, the next several weeks. That's what as far -- I've really pretty much live in the present. So, no, I don't think a lot about the past, what I've accomplished, or you know, and I don't think a lot about, you know, what I'm working -- all I think about this current project and getting it right.BARTIROMO: And A.I. is enabling healthcare in a big way. Look ahead and tell us what you see -- I know you don't look ahead a lot, you're living in the present -- but in terms of A.I. and how the world will change, can you share with us a couple of things that you believe will happen that maybe others don't see yet.ELLISON: OK. So, I look at current technologies and see how that could change the world in the future. So, I'm constant -- so in that sense, I'm always looking ahead. So, I want to be clear, I don't -- I live in the moment, I work on problems you could work on today, as opposed to wishing for a new technology that doesn't exist.BARTIROMO: I understand.ELLISON: But the second a new technology shows up like machine learning and we get proficient of using machine learning, it means we can radically change the way we diagnose diseases, that we can have blood tests for all sorts of cancer that you're not going to have to do, you know, biopsies for certain kinds of cancers. You're going to even be able to find a rare cell in the blood that will tell you whether, you know, tell you for sure whether you have prostate cancer, tell you for sure whether you have pancreatic cancer or a liver cancer that the computers are much better at finding an anomalous cell in the bloodstream than any human beings are. So, we can do -- we can do amazing things in terms of diagnostics and earlier therapies for helping people by using machine learning-based diagnostic tools.BARTIROMO: So, how does the world look different to you in the next 10 years as a result of these new things: A.I., machine learning, robotics?ELLISON: Well, we'll certainly have robot cars. I know one thing, as long as I make -- taking political stance, I'll get myself in a lot of trouble, building this train in California is a very -- is very strange, we're kind of bringing 1960s train technology, Japanese train technology to California and, you know, in 2030, 2040. You're going to have autonomous cars, autonomous vans that will take you from your home in San Francisco and drop you off to wherever you want to go at the time you want to be there in Los Angeles for, I don't know, 25 bucks, 50 bucks, something like that.The problem with trains, Elon Musk said it very well, trains leave when you don't want to leave from a place you don't want to leave from and take you to a place you don't want to go to, at a time you don't want to get there. And then you have to get into a car and then go wherever you're going. It is a crazy system. It is, I guess, the people who love it say, well, this is going to get people out of their cars. It's not true. People are going to be in electric cars that autonomously take them from San Francisco to L.A. at a tiny fraction of the cost. Leave when they want to leave, arrive when they want to arrive, leave from where they want to leave from, arrive when they want to get there. This technology will make that train one of the great embarrassments in the history of governments of California.BARTIROMO: Have you told Elon Musk this?ELLISON: I haven't told Elon Musk. He's -- I'm quoting Elon Musk. He thinks the train is ludicrous. I've had this conversation with Governor Brown, I've had this conversation with President Clinton, but I think the train is a -- is a powerful symbol, not a car, just get out of the cars. Let's not get out of the cars, make the cars electric, you don't have to get out of cars. Understand you don't want gas cars, get rid of the gas cars. But don't get out of the cars by thinking people are going to go into a train that goes from San Francisco to Sacramento, down to Central Valley -- the cost of building the train is astronomical. The environmental damage of building the train is astronomical. You're so much better just by using environmentally-friendly electric vans, autonomously driven to take you from San Francisco to L.A. That's what you want to do, that's the way to do it. It's not through 1960s Japanese bullet train technology.BARTIROMO: So, you see a revolution happening in driving in the car.ELLISON: In transportation.BARTIROMO: Transportation.ELLISON: Transportation throughout California. You're going to -- you're going to get in these autonomous vehicles and you can sleep, read.BARTIROMO: As well as in biotech and healthcare.ELLISON: Yes. Yes.BARTIROMO: Any other revolutions you want to talk about?ELLISON: Well, I think computing -- I think computing, cloud computing is going to change -- all these data centers that people have been building are going to -- are going to gradually wither away and we're going to have a small number of these huge cloud networks. And because every other network looks like that, they're -- you know, people don't generate their own electricity, people don't have wells for their own water. OK, in a few cases, they do, but in the most case, we use the network to buy electricity, the network to buy water. We're going to use the network to buy computing and business applications and information. This is going to be on handful of clouds, and most (INAUDIBLE) is going to be in an Oracle database.BARTIROMO: Larry, you're amazing. Thank you so much.ELLISON: Thanks, Maria.(END VIDEOTAPE)MCDOWELL: He pulls no punches, that's why that was a must-see interview. I know that we have more of it coming up tomorrow, but it sounded like, Mike Murphy, that he was -- Larry Ellison was like pitching Tesla. That he was -- he's certainly a fan of what Elon Musk is doing. He didn't say it in that -- in that way, but --MURPHY: Absolutely. The autonomous thing, I think, is a real deal. People will be spending more time in the back of cars, and buying products in the back of cars, as we've discussed with cargo, and it's going to change the way the commute takes place in the country.BREWER: Yes. I love it. I think we need, you know, from the government and down, we need to start listening to this man because obviously he has it. I just think it's unbelievable to think about them being -- Oracle being the ones who are over the cloud for Amazon and all these other companies, you know, they all flow through him. You know, he is the Godfather. Bless him.MCDOWELL: Yes. He was taking -- he was taking shots. Coming up, what -- final thoughts from our panel. Stay with us.MCDOWELL: Yes, George Harrison. Let's get some final thoughts from our all-star panel. Hey, Jack.BREWER: Too much political divide. Let's stop allowing our emotions to control our reason. Folks, it's not Trump's fault that the caravan is moving, it's the country that they're coming from. It's not Trump's fault that the bombs are being sent, it's the person who actually sent the bomb. Wake up!MCDOWELL: I can't top that. Mike Murphy?MURPHY: That's well-said. And for the markets, I think it's very important not to try to trade headlines when you have this type of volatility out there. People watching at home should stick to their long- term plan. And for me, I'm watching growth. I want to see big tech continue to show growth. And if we get that from Amazon and Google, I think this market has -- is at or near bottom and it's a great entry point.MCDOWELL: And you look at what Tesla is doing in premarket trading after reporting that surprise profit. I don't think it was a surprise, when Elon Musk moved up that announcement. I think that that was maybe the expectation.MURPHY: Yes. They've been through a lot and the stocks having great performance.MCDOWELL: Oh, yes, it is. Emily, final thought?JASHINSKY: I'll be honest with you, guys, I am still thinking about David Schwimmer, and I'm curious whether that was him. I'm not convinced because the (INAUDIBLE) released his video a day later, frankly, so we don't know if he -- if that was him. It looks just like him.MCDOWELL: Well, I like the fact that your brain after three hours is focused on David Schwimmer and you're focused on the lightness in the news cycle and in the news day, given what's going on with these explosive devices that are being shipped.JASHINSKY: In all sincerity, praying that there's more discovered today because we've already had two more. So --MCDOWELL: Well-said. Emily, thank you so much. Mike Murphy and Jack Brewer, right now that does it for us. "VARNEY & COMPANY" Stuart, take it away.VARNEY: All right. Thanks very much indeed. Good morning, Dagen, and good morning, everyone.Load-Date: October 25, 2018End of Document

LONDON MARKET EARLY CALL: Lower Call On Global Growth WorriesLive Briefs PRO Global MarketsDecember 21, 2018 Friday 2:02 AM ESTCopyright 2018 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 756 wordsBody Stock prices in London are seen opening lower once again on Friday amid general global market jitters, having closed at its worst level in over two years on Thursday.IG futures indicate the FTSE 100 index is to open 16.8 points lower at 6,694.10. The blue chip index closed down 54.01 points, or 0.8%, at 6,711.93 on Thursday, its lowest closing point in 28 months. "China is cooling and the eurozone is slowing down, and the some of the economic indicators from the US have been a bit soft recently, but yet the Fed hiked rates and suggested two more interest rate hikes were lined up for 2019," said CMC Markets UK's David Madden."The speculation the US economy could be headed for a recession has ticked up, and that weighed on global sentiment."It was another painful session on Wall Street last night as the Dow Jones dropped nearly 2%, and the S&P 500 lost over 1.5%. Fear about a US government shutdown is playing into the mix too," he continued.In the US on Thursday, Wall Street ended firmly in the red, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing down 2.0% and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both 1.6% lower.The Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed 1.1% lower on Friday. In China, the Shanghai Composite is down 1.1%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is down 0.2%.China on Friday denied US and British accusations that it has conducted cybertheft on a massive scale, saying they are a "deliberate defamation" pulled "out of thin air"."The Chinese government has never participated in or supported anyone in any way in stealing trade secrets," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said.Hua said the US accusations that a Chinese hacking operation dating back to 2006 targeted dozens of businesses and government agencies are "very bad in nature". She said China has lodged a formal protest with the US over the claims.In US political news, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis said Thursday he would step down from his position overseeing the world's most powerful military, saying President Donald Trump deserves a defence chief "better aligned" with his views.The departure of the retired four-star Marine general comes just a day after Trump announced a widely criticized decision to withdraw American forces from Syria and amid reports he is pulling about 7,000 troops from Afghanistan.Mattis had been seen as a moderating voice on Trump's tweet-oriented foreign policy and he was highly praised by the president when he first took the position, but the relationship was widely reported to have deteriorated in recent months.In a resignation letter, Mattis said he was stepping down at the end of February because Trump had "the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned" with his.The US House of Representatives late Thursday passed a temporary spending bill that included over USD5 billion in funding for a border wall with Mexico, ahead of a looming deadline to approve funding for government agencies.The passage of the bill will force a vote in the Senate on Friday, but it is unlikely to garner enough support from Democrats who have stood firmly against President Donald Trump's demand to fund the wall.Earlier on Thursday Trump told lawmakers he would not sign a short-term spending bill that passed the Senate on Wednesday and would have ensured government funding though February 8 because it did not include money for the wall.If no bill is passed and signed by Trump by midnight Friday, funding for some federal agencies will run out.The pound was marginally higher at USD1.2667 early Friday compared to USD1.2645 at the close Thursday, after the Bank of England left the key interest rate unchanged, as expected.There is nothing scheduled in the UK corporate calendar on Friday.Brent oil was down quoted at USD54.79 a barrel early Friday, down from USD55.85 at the close Thursday."After a complete meltdown overnight, oil prices will likely climb a wobbly ladder into the weekend close as profit-taking, and risk reduction continues to set in as price action is suggesting the bears have taken their last kick at 'oil can'," said Oanda's Stephen Innes. The euro was higher at USD1.1453 Friday morning, against USD1.1421.In the local economic calendar Friday there are public sector finances and the balance of payments at 0930 GMT, as well as the Bank of England's quarterly bulletin at midday.Elsewhere, the economic calendar has EU flash consumer confidence at 1500 GMT, US third estimate GDP at 1330 GMT, and the University of Michigan's consumer survey at 1500 GMT.  Load-Date: December 22, 2018End of Document

Memo from Beijing: "Singles Day", the digital economy and NayibCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 15, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 901 wordsBody Isabel de Sola  idesola@grupodesola.com  The story I want to tell about my experiences in China first passes through Taiwan and the government of Tony Saca, then through the Alibaba headquarters in Hangzhou, and ends in an electric car, which deposited me at the Beijing airport in the morning.  The first time I came here was in 2004, to Taipei, during an exchange of young diplomats organized by the Government of Taiwan. We, the esteemed allies, received us as kings for two weeks programmed at the top with courses and visits, whose main objective was to convince us of the vision of that island as a viable sovereign state, morally superior to its oppressor (and interestingly its main economic partner ), popular China.  By chance, at that time, the first official visit of the newly elected President Tony Saca arrived. The Taiwanese threw the pagoda out the window: the official visit of El Salvador received the highest honors of President Chen Shui-Bian, with banquets, speeches, cultural shows. As a diplomat of my country, I managed to interview the new cabinet about its plans to generate economic growth and greater social investment. The relationship with Taiwan promised a lot for both purposes.  Today, Tony Saca is in jail. We learned that some Taiwanese checks had a lot to do with their choice, and everything to do with the cynical persecution of the late Francisco Flores. Meanwhile, President Chen also ended up in jail for corruption to the order of nearly $ 800 million, according to his accusers. This irony does not happen to me.  The second time I visited the region, it was popular in China in 2012. We have met production plants for cars, food, and white products. The companies greeted us with green tea and bombarded us with presentations on their social responsibility and sustainability policies. But a simple walk through Beijing's toxic haze clearly showed the visitor the serious gaps between the Chinese manufacturing model and welfare.  I returned this week to popular China to meet several companies championing the digital economy. Among them, I visited Alibaba, whose headquarters is in the "secondary" city of Hangzhou, of 8 million people. Alibaba integrates an online sales platform (Taobao), with associated logistics businesses, online payments (Alipay), and also a financial for microproducers (Ant Financial). They were working 24/7 with the ant frenzy under attack, in preparation for the big sale of "Singles Day," which took place on November 11. In a single day, they sold more than $ 30 billion.  The introduction of online trading platforms has revolutionized this economy. While the Chinese government carried the infrastructure, the technology platforms connected the small producers with the infinite urban or digital markets. They explained to me that data on the preferences of their consumers are essential for producers to adapt their strategies. The data, they assured me, is not oil or gold: it is the "blood" of this new economy.  It works like this: a walnut microproducer in the rural town of Bainiu (population 1,500 people) creates its virtual store in Taobao and finds no less than 80 million potential buyers in the food sector. So that it can sell better, Alibaba shares with the producer its analysis on the behavior of the nut consumer. The average producer of Taobao increases his income by 3 times, regardless of his economic level or education.  With 200 million small producers registered only to Taobao (as there are other platforms), this is the inclusive digital economy. And it is not by accident, but by design. It is not the perfect economy. And that's right: you have to give freedoms and human rights to work in theChina (by the way, when they landed they recorded my fingerprints and my face forever in their databases). But Alibaba's trajectory gives us a glimpse of how the digital economy could be fairer.  On the way to the airport under a clear sky, the driver of the electric car Didi (Uber of China) asked me where I was from. I told him that originally I am from El Salvador. He smiled greatly and with the little English he handled, he expressed his gratitude that El Salvador opened diplomatic relations with China.  Waiting for the takeoff, I read Nayib Bukele's tweets about the "interference" of popular China in the political affairs of our country. Perhaps popular China wants to influence our choice, in the same way that Taiwan wanted to do at the time, but believe me, Nayib, that 150 million in rice is a distraction.  There is much more we must understand about how China will influence us in the future. China is already the world's leading data power and is plotting the path towards artificial intelligence. It is a country that is positioned as a new donor to international development. It is a market of 800 million e-consumers, if we want to take advantage of it.  Considering all the above, the fear of some Salvadoran sectors of China seems to be misplaced - I would be more concerned if I did not notice El Salvador, to which it is fixed! In an instant China will have set the course for the future and the rest of the world will feel its impact. We could influence it, with a skillful diplomacy based on a serious evaluation of the opportunities, and the costs, that our relationship with popular China would imply.  Copyright Grupo de Diarios America - GDA / La Prensa Gráfica / El Salvador Load-Date: November 15, 2018End of Document

Markets Rise After Kudlow Says U.S. and China Have Restarted TalksJim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUSNovember 27, 2018 Tuesday 3:04 PM EDTCopyright 2018 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 548 wordsByline: Jim Cramer and the AAP TeamHighlight: U.S. financial markets react favorably to comments by White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow.BodyThe U.S. major averages are trading slightly in positive territory on Tuesday at the time this was written, reversing what had previously been a largely negative session. Just a few moments ago, Director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow held a press conference and told reporters how the Trump administration and the Chinese government have restarted talks ahead of this weekend's meeting at the G20 summit. As a reminder, the upcoming G20 summit meeting is one of two events we are closely monitoring this week, with the other being Wednesday's speech by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. For our views on the possible upside and downside scenarios from the two events, please see our previous Alert  .Looking at a few stocks in our portfolio, Apple  has been trading notably weaker today on the tariff news because this round is expected to impact their iPhones and laptop computers. No longer does it appear that Apple will be exempt from tariffs, a view that was previously thought when a group of its products including Apple Watch and Airpods were spared back in September.This news should provide the sell-side with additional fodder to hit the stock, with the inevitable outcome being a downgrade to their rating. But as we have said before, we need to see a downgrade happen to wash out the last remaining weak hands. We believe the foundation of a bottom will put in when the stock finally shrugs off negative news. Until then, though overblown as they may be, we fully expect concerns about iPhone demand, and now tariffs, to control the stock's narrative. To that point, remember that we have been of view that Apple must be evaluated as a company that relies far less on hardware sales as a means of growth because the greater importance rests on monetizing the installed base through Services revenue. And with shares trading at just under 13x next 12 month's earnings despite a clean balance sheet, strong buyback, and still high performing Services base, we continue to view shares as "own, don't trade."Additionally, as reports continue to come out about weak iPhone XR sales, we encourage members to read the article written by TheStreet's Eric Jhonsa on Monday (see  ) that explains why the resumption of iPhone X production as well as offered iPhone XR subsidies to carriers in Japan is part of what he calls an "aggressive" response to the newest edition's tepid launch. The market is acting like Apple is sitting back and doing nothing to combat what could be soft iPhone sales, but this article demonstrates how that is not the case.Then as a reminder, Salesforce.com  will report its fiscal third quarter 2019 earnings after the bell tonight. As of the time this was written, current expectations are for $0.50 in adjusted earnings per share and $3.365 billion in sales. Also at the time this was written, shares were trading slightly higher on the day.Even though shares have been roughed up over the past two months to the point that expectations are far lower than before, we would be patient and wait for the company to report before buying shares. On the conference call, we'll look for more clarity into billings growth, how Mulesoft is performing, and management's overall views on how their customer's ongoing digital transformations are driving sales.Load-Date: November 28, 2018End of Document

MEMBERS OF APT 10 GROUP TARGETED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATIONStates News ServiceDecember 20, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 659 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the FBI:FBI Director Christopher Wray speaks at a December 20, 2018 press conference at the Department of Justice announcing charges against Zhu Hua and Zhang Shilong, both Chinese nationals and members of the APT 10 hacking group, as Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein looks on.Two Chinese men have been charged in a massive, years-long hacking campaign that stole personal and proprietary information from companies around the world, the FBI and the Justice Department announced at a press conference today in Washington, D.C.The men, Zhu Hua and Zhang Shilong, are part of a group known as Advanced Persistent Threat 10, or APT 10, a hacking group associated with the Chinese government. A New York grand jury indicted the pair for conspiracy to commit computer intrusion, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and aggravated identity theft. The indictment was unsealed today.According to the indictment, from around 2006 to 2018, APT 10 conducted extensive hacking campaigns, stealing information from more than 45 victim organizations, including American companies. Hundreds of gigabytes of sensitive data were secretly taken from companies in a diverse range of industries, such as health care, biotechnology, finance, manufacturing, and oil and gas.FBI Director Christopher Wray described the list of companies, not named in the indictment, as a who's who of the global economy. Even government agencies like NASA and the Department of Energy were among the victims. The hack is part of China's ongoing efforts to steal intellectual property from other countries.Healthy competition is good for the global economycriminal conduct is not. Rampant theft is not. Cheating is not, Wray said at the press conference.APT 10 used spear phishing techniques to introduce malware onto targeted computers. The hackers sent emails that appeared to be from legitimate addresses but contained attachments that installed a program to secretly record all keystrokes on the machine, including user names and passwords. The group also targeted managed service providers (MSPs), companies that remotely manage their clients' servers and networks. MSP hacks allowed APT 10 members to indirectly gain access to confidential data of numerous companies who were the clients of the MSPs.China's state-sponsored actors are the most active perpetrators of state-sponsored espionage against us.FBI Director Christopher WrayWhen hackers gain access to MSPs, they can steal sensitive business information that gives competitors an unfair advantage, said Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein during today's announcement.APT 10 also accessed the personal information of more than 100,000 U.S. Navy personnel.In remarks announcing the indictments, Wray noted that FBI and Department of Defense investigators worked together to analyze hundreds of malware samples. Investigators found links between victims and APT 10. The FBI's Cyber Action Team, in collaboration with the Department of Homeland Security, also provided technical assistance and investigated the incidents.Although the two indicted hackers are believed to be in China, they can be arrested if they travel.This indictment is the latest in a series of charges against international hackers who target the United States and its allies. In October, seven Russian government operatives were charged with hacking into international anti-doping agencies. Last month, two Iranians were charged with using ransomware to infiltrate critical networks in the United States and Canada.The cyber espionage threat from China is the most pervasive, Wray stressed.China's goal, simply put, is to replace the U.S. as the world's leading superpower, and they're using illegal methods to get there. They're using an expanding set of non-traditional and illegal methods, Wray said. China's state-sponsored actors are the most active perpetrators of state-sponsored espionage against us.Load-Date: December 20, 2018End of Document

Tencent Music IPO; Trade confusion; Market rally evaporatesCNN WireDecember 4, 2018 Tuesday 10:00 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 516 wordsByline: By Ivana Kottasová, CNN BusinessDateline: LONDON (CNN Business) BodyLONDON (CNN Business) --  1. Tencent Music IPO: Tencent Music said in a regulatory filing that it's seeking as much as $1.2 billion from investors in its New York listing.That's far less than the $2 billion the company was reportedly planning to raise earlier this year. The firm did not specify when it expects to debut on the New York Stock Exchange.It would still be the third largest Chinese IPO in the United States since the beginning of 2018, according to data provider Dealogic. Streaming video platform iQiyi (IQ) raised $2.3 billion and social shopping app Pinduoduo (PDD) raised $1.6 billion.The business, which dominates music streaming in China, is owned by Chinese internet giant Tencent (TCEHY). Shares in Tencent were trading 1.1% higher in Hong Kong.2. Trade truce confusion: Investors are trying to figure out exactly what the United States and China agreed on trade during the G20 Summit in Argentina.The language used in the Trump administration's announcement of the trade detente was very different to that in Chinese government statements, especially on Beijing's promises to buy more US goods and the possibility of removing existing tariffs. There's also confusion over whether China has agreed to reduce tariffs on cars it imports from the United States. "Such inconsistent messages will leave markets guessing and struggling to reach a conclusion, thus leading to volatile price action in financial assets," said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM.3. Global market overview: US stock futures were lower.European markets opened in negative territory, while stocks in Asia ended mixed. Japan's Nikkei shed 2.25% and Korea's Kospi dropped 0.8%, while stocks in China posted modest gains. US oil futures gained 2.4% ahead of a crucial meeting between Saudi Arabia-led OPEC and Russia later this week. Investors are expecting the oil producing countries to agree cooperating on production cuts.The British pound gained 0.7% against the dollar after the legal adviser to Europe's top court said the UK government has the power to unilaterally halt the Brexit process.The Dow climbed 1.1% on Monday, boosted by signs of a trade truce between the United States and China. The S&P 500 gained 1.1% and the Nasdaq added 1.5%.China-focused stocks were the biggest beneficiaries of the rally. Apple (APPL), Boeing (BA), Caterpillar (CAT), Deere (DE) and Nvidia (NVDA) all closed sharply higher. US markets will be closed Wednesday for national day of mourning in honor of former President George H.W. Bush.4. Companies: Bank of Montreal (BMO) and Dollar General (DG) will release earnings before the open. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) will follow after the close.5. Coming this week: Tuesday --- Bank of Montreal (BMO), Dollar General (DG) and Restoration Hardware (RH) earnings Wednesday --- US financial markets closed Thursday --- OPEC meeting; Kroger (KR), Ulta (ULTA) and Broadcom (AVGO) earnings; Trial for government's appeal of AT&T-Time Warner deal begins Friday --- Jobs numbersTM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Taiwan President resigns as head of party after losses in local electionsCNN.comNovember 24, 2018 Saturday 3:02 AM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: ASIALength: 928 wordsByline: By Steven Jiang, Joshua Berlinger and Hira Humayun, CNNBodyTaiwan President Tsai Ing-wen announced her resignation Saturday as head of the Democratic Progressive Party after the party suffered a "crushing defeat" in local government elections, a vote with significant implications for the island's relationship with mainland China.The local elections, as well as a failed referendum on whether the island's Olympic athletes would compete under the name "Taiwan," were both seen as bellwether contests for public support on independence.Voters Saturday expressed dissatisfaction with Tsai's harder-line approach to relations with the Beijing government and continued sluggish economic performance.Analysts say that most support the status quo, reaping economic benefits from mainland China without being governed by it.Tsai's Democratic Progressive Party has traditionally leaned in favor of formal independence from China, compared to Taiwan's other main political party, the Kuomintang, as the Nationalists are known locally.Cross-strait relations have cooled under Tsai's leadership and the Chinese government under President Xi Jinping has become more tenacious in asserting its claim over the island, which Beijing considers a breakaway province that must be reunited with the mainland.Taiwan's Central News Agency reported Tsai apologized to supporters for the ruling party's "disappointing performance" in a speech at its headquarters, and she took full responsibility for the party's losses.Although she resigned as the party head, Tsai -- the first woman to be elected President of Taiwan -- will serve out the remainder of her term. But the Saturday vote could hamper her chances at winning another term during the next presidential election, scheduled for January 2020.Tsai said while her administration is moving in the right direction, the election results were proof that the Taiwanese people are setting a higher standard for their government.The traditionally pro-independence DPP is expected to undergo a "major reshuffle" soon, Tsai said, to prepare for the challenges ahead.Premier Lai Ching-te echoed Tsai in a Facebook post, saying the election results indicated the public's dissatisfaction with the government's performance.Lai had offered to resign earlier Saturday and take ownership of the party's defeat, but Tsai asked him to stay on as premier to ensure the continuity of the government's policies and initiatives.Tsai was elected President in a landslide victory in January 2016 after a political career mostly as an outsider. She joined the Democratic Progressive Party in 2004 and was its chairwoman by 2008. She lost her first bid for the presidency in 2012 and resigned as the party head before taking the mantle back up in 2014.Tsai is a lawyer by training and studied at National Taiwan University before continuing her studies by earning a master of law degree from Cornell University and then a doctorate from the London School of Economics.Ma Xiaoguang, a spokesman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, said on Sunday: "The results reflect Taiwan people's strong wishes to continue enjoying benefits of peaceful cross-strait relations and to keep improving the economy and their livelihood."We will continue to firmly oppose 'Taiwan independence' forces and their activities and unite the people of Taiwan to take a path of peaceful development in cross-strait relations."Regarding the decision striking down the Olympic name change, Ma said "the result shows the lack of public support for the gambit of using the interest of Taiwan athletes as a wager."Taiwan currently competes using a special Olympic flag and anthem and participates under the name "Chinese Taipei," as decided under a 1979 resolution by the International Olympic Committee.According to Taiwan's Central News Agency, a US State Department spokesperson said in an email to the news agency, "The United States congratulates the people of Taiwan for once again demonstrating the strength of their vibrant democratic system through a successful round of elections."The spokesperson said the United States looks forward to working with both old and new counterparts "to continue our fruitful cooperation on a wide range of issues of mutual concern," CNA said.Despite the lack of formal diplomatic ties, Taiwan remains an important American ally in the region, and the Trump administration has sought closer ties between Washington and Taipei.America's alliance with Taiwan has long been lambasted by officials in Beijing.Decisions on same-sex marriageAlso in Saturday referendums, voters in Taiwan opposed changing the current civil law to accommodate same-sex marriage, dealing a heavy blow to the island's LGBT community and its allies.The three referendum questions initiated by groups that opposed marriage equality passed, while those put forth by same-sex marriage advocates did not.For instance, the majority vote was yes on a question that asked, "Do you agree that Civil Code regulations should restrict marriage to being between a man and a woman?"The votes came after Taiwan's high court passed a resolution in May 2017 ruling it was unconstitutional to ban same-sex marriage.Taiwan lawmakers had a two-year deadline to enshrine marriage equality into law, but a deadlock gave opponents an opportunity to put the issue to the public in the form of referendum questions.A majority of the island's voters, however, did say "yes" to a referendum question -- also put forth by opponents of marriage equality -- that asked if the legislature should enact a new law to protect the rights and interests of same-sex couples.Load-Date: November 26, 2018End of Document

Facebook s head of public policy is supporting the Kavanaugh nomination, and some employees are lividiCrowdNewswire (English)October 5, 2018 Friday 11:40 AM GMTCopyright 2018 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 3017 wordsBody                   On September 27th, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh appeared before Congress to answer allegations that he had committed sexual assault. There to support him was one of his best friends, Joel Kaplan, who also happens to be Facebook s global head of policy. I made passing note of Kaplan s attendance here when it happened, and asked readers     Continue reading Facebook s head of public policy is supporting the Kavanaugh nomination, and some employees are lividOn September 27th, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh appeared before Congress to answer allegations that he had committed sexual assault. There to support him was one of his best friends, Joel Kaplan, who also happens to be Facebook s global head of policy.I made passing note of Kaplan s attendance here when it happened, and asked readers   particularly those in Facebook s orbit   what they made of it. Well, now we know. Here s Mike Isaac in the New York Times:Mr. Kaplan s surprise appearance prompted anger and shock among many Facebook employees, some of whom said they took his action as a tacit show of support for Judge Kavanaugh   as if it were an endorsement from Facebook itself.The unrest quickly spilled over onto Facebook s internal message boards, where hundreds of workers have since posted about their concerns, according to current and former employees. To quell the hubbub, Facebook s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, last Friday explained in a widely attended staff meeting that Mr. Kaplan was a close friend of Judge Kavanaugh s and had broken no company rules, these people said.A similar set of documents appears to have been leaked to the Wall Street Journal s Deepa Seetharaman, who reaches similar conclusions in her own story.For Facebook, the controversy over Kaplan represents a new point of division at a company that is still grappling with the Instagram founders  unexpected departure and the largest data breach in its history. Only when it comes to the Kaplan controversy, it s not clear to me what the company s next move should be.The C suite seems to have been annoyed by Kaplan s attendance, but was initially dismissive of employees  concerns. (How concerned are employees? My favorite detail in Isaac s story is that they went into Kaplan s calendar and learned that he had not in fact taken the 27th as a personal day, as Kaplan initially stated. The calendar was later updated to reflect that it was, indeed, a personal day.)In ordinary times, it would not even seem worthy of commentary that a Facebook employee would take time off to go support a good friend s nomination for a government role. But these are no ordinary times, and this was no ordinary hearing. And among some Facebook employees, who have rallied around Kavanaugh s proliferating number of accusers, Kaplan s endorsement of his friend became a workplace issue.As Isaac notes, Kaplan was hired precisely because of his deep ties to the conservative world. Facebook faces a variety of federal investigations and regulatory threats, and it needs allies in both parties to navigate those waters   particularly these days. Until now, Kaplan s conservatism has been seen an asset to the company.It still is   somewhere on Facebook s communications team right now, I imagine there s some mild excitement about a news cycle centered on its executives standing up to their more liberal employees in the defense of a conservative colleague. But it can be a liability, too, particularly if a lot of those employees take this opportunity to leave the company to work at an organization that doesn t have a strategic imperative to make nice with the Trump Administration.Andrew Bosworth, a 13-year Facebook veteran and Zuckerberg confidante, initially appeared to encourage employees to follow their principles out the door. Here s Isaac again: If you need to change teams, companies or careers to make sure your day-to-day life matches your passions, we will be sad to see you go, but we will understand,  Mr. Bosworth wrote.  We will support you with any path you choose. But it is your responsibility to choose a path, not that of the company you work for. But after an employee backlash, Boz walked back his remarks.  I spoke at a time when I should be listening and that was a big mistake,  he reportedly wrote in an internal post. Another meeting is scheduled for Friday for top executives to listen to employees  concerns. The trouble for Facebook is that it s not clear, beyond listening, what Facebook can really do.DemocracyThe Big Hack: How China Used a Tiny Chip to Infiltrate U.S. CompaniesEveryone is talking about this story from Jordan Robertson and Michael Riley, which alleges that Chinese spies compromised America s technology supply chain by inserting tiny chips in servers that reached almost 30 US companies, including Apple and Amazon. Both Apple and Amazon denied this story in the strongest possible terms, going into depth about how why they believe the Bloomberg story to be false. It s an extraordinary set of events   I hope we learn more. (Facebook appears to have been affected by the hack in a minor way.)Pence Calls on Google to Drop Mobile Search Project in ChinaThe vice president has called on Google to abandon its China ambitions   a significant escalation of the US government s pressure on Alphabet, Michael C. Bender and Dustin Volz report:In a speech that outlined the White House s long list of frustrations and grievances with Beijing, Vice President Mike Pence called on companies to reconsider business practices in the world s second-largest economy that involve turning over intellectual property or  abetting Beijing s oppression.  For example, Google should immediately end development of the Dragonfly app that will strengthen Communist Party censorship and compromise the privacy of Chinese customers,  Mr. Pence said in his speech at the Hudson Institute, a conservative, Washington-based think tank focused on security and economic issues.Most Twitter Accounts Linked To 2016 Disinformation Are Still Active, Report FindNearly 90 percent of accounts that spread disinformation during the presidential election continue to operate and spread or amplify false stories, according to a new study from the Knight Foundation:Knight Foundation researchers examined millions of tweets and concluded that more than80 percent of the accounts associated with the 2016 disinformation campaign are still posting   even after Twitter announced back in July that it had instituted a purge of fake accounts. The persistence of so many easily identified abusive accounts is difficult to square with any effective crackdown,  write authors Matthew Hindman of George Washington University and Vlad Barash of the social media analysis company Graphika.I asked Twitter to respond and this is what I got: Firstly, this study was built using our public API and therefore does not take into account any of the actions we take to remove automated or spammy content and accounts from being viewed by people on Twitter. We do this proactively and at scale, every single day. Secondly, as a uniquely open service, Twitter is a vital source of real-time antidote to day-to-day falsehoods. We are proud of this use case and work diligently to ensure we are showing people context and a diverse range of perspectives as they engage in civic debate and conversations on our service. Senators Call for Federal Investigation of Children s AppsTwo Democrats have asked the Federal Trade Commission to examine whether thousands of apps are violating a children s online privacy law. Jennifer Valentino-DeVries and Natasha Singer report:Senators Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday saying they were concerned that thousands of apps may  improperly track children and collect their personal information. The senators asked the agency to examine whether the apps, and the advertising companies they work with, were violating a federal law to protect children s privacy online. The law requires sites and apps aimed at children under 13 to obtain verifiable permission from a parent before collecting personal details from a child like an email address, a precise location, a phone number or persistent digital ID codes that are used for behavioral advertising.How China s biggest social network fights fake newsWeChat posts the top rumors every month... so it can debunk them. This would be a more heartening development if WeChat were not also a surveillance and propaganda tool of the Chinese government!Europe is drawing fresh battle lines around the ethics of big dataThe European Union s data protection supervisor, Giovanni Buttarelli, tells TechCrunchthat tech giants are flouting new privacy regulations and he s not going to take it anymore: I did not appreciate the tsunami of legalistic notices landing on the account of millions of users, written in an obscure language, and many of them were entirely useless, and in a borderline even with spamming, to ask for unnecessary agreements with a new privacy policy,  he tells us.  Which, in a few cases, appear to be in full breach of the GDPR   not only in terms of spirit. He also professes himself  not surprised  about Facebook slatest security debacle   describing the massive new data breach the company revealed on Friday as  business as usual  for the tech giant. And indeed for  all the tech giants    none of whom he believes are making adequate investments in security.ElsewhereSnap CEO Sets Goal of Profitability in 2019, Outlines New Strategic Goals for EmployeesEvan Spiegel wants Snap to turn a profit in 2019, according to a 6,500-word memo that Alex Heath got his hands on. (Big day for my rivals getting their hands on documents to make me jealous! I have a Signal too, folks!) I m going to chew on this one overnight, but for now here s a fun, Snap-flattering detail from Spiegel:Researchers at the University of Michigan found that Snapchat was second only to face-to-face communication when it comes to generating positive feelings:Snapchat interactions are associated with more positive emotions that Facebook and other social technologies, the researchers say.Social media analytics platform Hootsuite explores sale: sourcesHootsuite, which makes a widely used platform for managing social media, is exploring a sale that could value it at more than $750 million, Liana B. Baker and Carl O Donnell report.Unilad: Facebook viral publisher goes into administrationOne of the biggest publishers of viral content on Facebook is apparently close to being bankrupt:Its understanding of the sort of video content Facebook audiences want to watch enabled it to become the fourth-biggest publisher on the social network in August, according to data from the analytics company NewsWhip. Facebook recently said it would prioritise higher-quality news in users  feeds.Many viral publishers have struggled to translate their enormous reach into a profitable business model, owing to the high cost of making bespoke native ads. Sources in the advertising industry suggested many agencies had cut back their dealings with Unilad before Thursday.Instagram COO Marne Levine: App Is Safe After Founders  Facebook ExitFormer Instagram COO and new Facebook head of Global Partnerships and Business Development Marne Levine spoke briefly about her old bosses  exit from the company last week during a conference this week. She acknowledged that it was  unexpected :She added that, while the moment was unexpected, it was  only natural  that the founders,  whose vision... had fundamentally changed the way we connect and share,  would be thinking about what s next after spending six years steering Instagram at Facebook. She pointed out that when the social media giant acquired Instagram, the photo-sharing platform had just 13 employees and  no business.  Today, it has more than a billion users and  a thriving and growing business  with more than two million active advertisers and more than 1,000 employees worldwide.  It s is in a very different place,  she said.When Tech Knows You Better Than You Know YourselfHistorian Yuval Noah Harari and Time Well Spent cofounder Tristan Harris discussed the future of artificial intelligence with Wired s editor in chief, Nicholas Thompson. There s surely lots to chew on here, but this is just an incredible story about how thought leaders are meeting these days:YNH: Funnily enough, on an expedition to Antarctica, we were invited by the Chilean government to the Congress of the Future to talk about the future of humankind and one part of the Congress was an expedition to the Chilean base in Antarctica to see global warming with our own eyes. It was still very cold and there were so many interesting people on this expeditionTH: A lot of philosophers and Nobel laureates. And I think we particularly connected with Michael Sandel, who is a really amazing philosopher of moral philosophy.The Teens Who Post the Same Thing Every Day on InstagramEarlier this week Alyssa Bereznak tweeted a comical set of Instagram accounts that post the same picture every day. It turns out Taylor Lorenz was already at work on a version of this story, which she published today. It s delightful:And while these accounts post the same photo every day, their captions and Stories change. Some teenagers who run single-pic accounts use their page as a sort of diary or anonymous blog, posting about what s happening in life and at school, or how they re feeling.  I had to pack the whole day and today I was on an airplane for like 8 hours,  the owner of an account that posts the same photo of a watermelon every day wrote.  Ya girl graduated grade 8,  the owner of @same_picture_of_kun said.  Catch me being late to my first day of summer school,  they added on another pic.Miranda, a 14-year-old who runs @same.picture.of.kumquat with two friends from her high school, said they started the account as a de-stressor and outlet.  It s personal-life captions for not such a personal picture,  she said.  It takes the pressure off of having to post a pic of your face or something. We don t have to edit any pics; the followers know what they re getting. We can just post a quirky caption about our life at the moment and they relate. LaunchesInstagram s Nametag make it easier to follow people you meet IRLWWW.THEVERGE.COM   ShareInstagram is introducing a version of Snapcodes, letting you follow people by taking a picture of their unique  nametag.  More interesting to me is the test described here in which college students will be invited to fill out a more complete Instagram profile, including their school, which will then be added to a directory that anyone else in that school can browse. Facebook is Benjamin Buttoning itself all the way back to the beginning.View image on TwitterJane Manchun Wong@wongmjane  Instagram, as a  Facebook Product , is testing Facebook Location History in their app.It allows tracking the history of precise locations from your device, now through instagram app toopreviously: https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1046978715610206209 ...Jane Manchun Wong@wongmjane Facebook is testing Map view in Nearby Friends11:36 PM   Oct 4, 2018• 24• 23 people are talking about thisTwitter Ads info and privacy  Instagram is also adding location history, in what seems part of an eventual effort to build a Snap Map-style feature into Instagram. (Josh Constine speculates that it s  about serving local ads.)Yahoo returns to messaging with IRC-inspired Yahoo TogetherAlso Yahoo made a new messaging app for some reason? I got nothing.TakesFinance, the media and a catastrophic breakdown in trust ($)John Authers has a long, reflective post about how social media contributed to an erosion of trust in journalism, and how dangerous that will prove to be during the next financial crisis. Sad and sobering:All the most obvious policy responses come with dangers. Regulating social media from its current sick and ugly state would have advantages but would also be the thin end of a very long wedge. Greater transparency and political oversight for central banks might rebuild confidence but at the risk of politicising institutions we desperately need to maintain independence from politicians. And an overhaul of the prosecutorial system for white-collar crime, to avert the scandalous way so many miscreants escaped a reckoning a decade ago, might work wonders for bolstering public trust   but not if it led to scapegoating or show trials.On one thing, I remain gloomily clear. Without trust in financial institutions themselves, or those who work in them, or the media who cover them, the next crisis could be far more deadly than the last. Just ask JP Morgan.And finally  New FiDi Pasta Shop Literally Names Itself After InstagramLast June I wrote a long feature about how the popularity of Instagram was transforming bars and restaurants into more colorful, kitschy, gimmicky versions of themselves. Today that trend has now reached its logical conclusion, with a New York City pasta restaurant naming itself Pastagram and making its entire value proposition that you can take photographs of its food:But food isn t entirely the point here. The Pastagram is really playing up the social media angle, promising  photogenic  details in all of its dishes as well as bright, teal decor in the space.  Every single detail is thought of as to be the most photogenic as possible, catering to a customer base that  today more than ever   seems to give aesthetics as much importance as food quality,  its press release declaresI don t know; there s something about valuing the  gram above all at a restaurant that feels a bit ... tasteless.Talk to meSend me tips, comments, questions, and those internal Facebook posts you re sharing with Mike and Deepa: casey@theverge.comSee Campaign:https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/5/17939054/facebook-employee-protest-joel-kaplan-brett-kavanaughContact Information:Casey NewtonTags:,            Wire,            Artificial Intelligence Newswire,            United States,            EnglishLoad-Date: October 5, 2018End of Document

Ctrip and Trip.com Make Four Commitments at Illegal Wildlife Trade London Conference 2018GlobeNewswireOctober 16, 2018 Tuesday 8:07 PM PTCopyright 2018 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENTLength: 890 wordsBodySHANGHAI, China, Oct.  16, 2018  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As the largest online travel agent in Asia and the second largest in the world, Ctrip along with Trip.com, an independent OTA brand offering comprehensive travel services to millions of members worldwide, attended the Illegal Wildlife Trade London Conference 2018 at the UK government's invitation and spoke in panel discussions on the relationship between tourism and the illegal wildlife trade. At the Conference, Ctrip and Trip.com pledged that it would use its mobile applications, websites, offline stores and other resources to increase public awareness of issues relating to the illegal wildlife trade.Jane Sun, CEO of Ctrip Group, signed the WTTC Declaration of Illegal Wildlife Trade in April 2018On the afternoon of October 11, a representative from Ctrip Group spoke at the panel "Tourism's role in dealing the Issue of Illegal Wildlife Trade" alongside Gloria Guevara, CEO of World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC); Jim Sano, Vice President of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF); and a representative of the Nepal government. Addressing the major role that tourism, both the demand and supply sides, is playing in fighting illegal wildlife trade, Ctrip and Trip.com made four commitments:1.  Ctrip and Trip.com will use their mobile applications, websites and offline stores to increase public awareness of the illegal wildlife trade issue among its more than 300 million users around the world;2.  Ctrip and Trip.com will fully support the work of the WTTC and the WWF, as agreed at the London conference, and distribute the WTTC Declaration of Illegal Wildlife Trade in China;3.  Ctrip and Trip.com will develop new ecotourism tours and encourage Chinese tourists to engage in ecotourism;4.  In cooperation with environmental organizations, Ctrip and Trip.com will launch a campaign to discourage and dissuade its vendors and clients from products related to the illegal wildlife trade."Fighting Illegal Wildlife Trade" is a key project of the UK Government to protect wildlife in 2018, and the Chinese government is also working to raise awareness of the significance of wildlife protection. Ctrip and Trip.com are committed to promoting ecological protection via tourism.Jane Sun, the CEO of the Ctrip Group, signed the WWTC Buenos Aires Declaration on Illegal Wildlife Trade in April 2018, and assumed her post in the advisory committee alongside WWF, Hyatt and Emirates, among others. The declaration is aimed at encouraging tourism-related organizations to play a key role in combatting the illegal wildlife trade.The 2018 Illegal Wildlife Trade Conference in London is hosted by the Foreign & Commonwealth Office, Department for International Development and Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs, together with royal support. The conference brings together stakeholders from business, environment NGO's and academia to discuss solutions to the illegal wildlife trade issue.Since the London Declaration on the Illegal Wildlife Trade was announced in 2014, tremendous progress has been made. However, with a recent resurgence in the illegal wildlife trade, the 2018 Conference aims to restate how determined and confident the national governments are to fight the illegal wildlife trade around the world.About Ctrip.com International, Ltd.Ctrip.com International, Ltd. is a leading travel service provider of accommodation reservation, transportation ticketing, packaged tours and corporate travel management in China.

Good Monday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. Happy Monday, it is Monday, October 22nd. Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast. Kicking the week off on a strong note, check out futures this morning, we're at the highs of the morning right now. Dow Industrials set to open up about 115 points, that's one-half of one percent.S&P is also up a half percent. Check out the NASDAQ up 63 points right now, up one percent. This is the high of the morning across the board. This was a mixed session on Wall Street Friday, that's for sure. The Dow snapped the two-day losing streak up, it was up 64 points but the S&P and the NASDAQ, it closed lower at the close on Friday. In Europe this morning, the trend continues upside. Markets are higher. FT-100 up almost a percent, 59 points higher.CAC quarante up almost a half of a percent, 20 points higher. And the DAX Index in Germany up three quarters of one percent, 84 points higher. In Asia overnight, gains across the board but China was the real standout. Shanghai Composite up better than four percent as the Chinese government revealed tax cuts to support the economy that had slowed there.Upholding the alliance, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is going to Saudi Arabia after all today even despite pressure for U.S. to take action against the kingdom. This morning, King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman reportedly called Jamal KhashoggI's son to send their condolences.Plus, caravan crisis. The group of illegal immigrants headed to the United States border is growing. It has now grown to -- get this, 7,000 people on that caravan.On the hot seat, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein headed to Capitol Hill this Wednesday for a long-awaited interview with the House investigators. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte gave me an exclusive preview on what to expect yesterday on "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES."(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA), CHAIR, HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: These are very, very serious allegations. We know he's met with President Trump. President Trump has been satisfied and said that he wants him to continue on as his number two at the Department of Justice. But the Congress has oversight responsibilities.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Coming up. Find out what Goodlatte said about the FISA Court as well. Investors are bracing for the busiest week of earning season so far. 10 Dow components due to report their earnings. Plus technology giant Amazon and Alphabet, they could move markets. They're coming out this week as well. On Friday we get first look at the GDP for the third quarter. Remember the second quarter was at 4.2 percent.We are expecting three percent plus for the third quarter. All those stories coming up this Monday morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Benchmark Managing Partner Kevin Kelly and Independent Women's Voice CEO Heather Higgins. Good to see everybody this morning.HEATHER HIGGINS, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, INDEPENDENTLY WOMEN'S VOICE: Nice to be here.BARTIROMO: Thank you for being here.KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK: It's great to see the markets are up actually.BARTIROMO: Yes.KELLY: I was looking and it's you know, concerns out of Italy have sort of tempered a little bit. The Chinese stimulus is running credence to their markets. So, you know, our markets over here are focusing on the earnings especially with technology because technology has doubled the profit margins than any other sector in the S&P 500. So with those earnings coming out this week, Microsoft notably on Wednesday, I mean, they dominate in the cloud.So let's see what happens at the higher price -- profit margin. Their cloud earnings came out last quarter, CFO Amy Hood said their profit margins went up six basis -- six percentage points from 52 percent operating margins 50 -- 52 to 58.BARTIROMO: Yes. Microsoft had a good quarter.KELLY: And they pay great dividend.BARTIROMO: Yes. You know what though, we were expecting from the beginning, third-quarter earnings, Dagen to be 21 percent higher year-over- year. I mean, we were expecting good numbers, revenue to be up eight percent or something for the third quarter.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Right. In the earnings so far we've only had 17 percent of the S&P report so far, but earnings are up more than 25 percent --BARTIROMO: Wow.METAXAS: -- so far this quarter. And the trouble spot is that revenue is growing at just north of seven percent, 62 percent have beaten revenue estimates if it holds around that level that would be the worst miss in terms of 38 percent missing so far in this earnings cycle.KELLY: Yes.BARTIROMO: But you were reporting earlier about what the Journal was reporting and that is that sales is really where the worry is, right? And then what companies are going to say about revenue and future guidance.KELLY: Well, the problem was if we go back to 2015 we were in an earnings recessions, we didn't even have top-line growth. Look at what this economy is doing. If we're worried about top-line growth because we're having it, I think that's good problem to have and we saw last earnings was up 25 percent, earnings before that was up 25 percent.BARTIROMO: I agree. I just pointed out because, you know, we're looking for any impact of these tariffs.KELLY: Right.BARTIROMO: On the second quarter.HIGGINS: We're looking at the individual companies that the larger picture sell is you've got -- for the first time in years, Capex spending that is actually occurring.KELLY: Correct.HIGGINS: You've got jobs up, you've unemployment seriously at unbelievable lows particularly for blacks and others. It's -- it levels it has never been at. You've got rises in wages, and particularly for blue collar workers and, you know, have talk of the tax cuts.BARTIROMO: Yes. Good backdrop.HIGGINS: Overall it is great news and particularly with the House races in the battleground states at dead-even now, the markets should take some comfort in the fact that there is likely that the House I think I'm still the only person saying this, but I think that the Republicans are going to hold the House.BARTIROMO: Yes. All right. We want to get to get to all of that coming up. And our top story this hour, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will finally appear before House investigators on Wednesday of this week. The interview will be behind closed doors in a classified setting. It will be transcribed. This comes as House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte tells me in an exclusive interview on "SUNDAY MONDAY FUTURES".He plans to get to the bottom of the FISA warrant and allegations of the Justice Department, withholding claims which refute collusion.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOODLATTE: A lot of evidence to support Mr. Ratcliffe's statements and we want to ask Mr. Rosenstein about that, he came in to this matter at the later end but he was involved with the approval of the third renewal of the FISA warrant application which is basically requesting a court in secret to approve a wiretap on an individual who is a United States citizen and this went on for a full year.The last three months of which Mr. Rosenstein was involved in the approval of that. So we have questions for him about that. And we will be sure to ask plenty of questions regarding it.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is Byron York, he is Fox News Contributor and the Washington Examiner's Chief Political Correspondent. Byron, thanks very much for joining us this morning.BYRON YORK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning, Maria.BARTIROMO: And you have an op-ed out this morning talking about this -- the Washington Examiner titled, "The End Could Be Near for House Investigation of Trump-Russia Investigators." And in it, you outlined the revelations that we now know about the Trump-Russia probe due to the work of the House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes and his colleagues. Tell us what you're expecting this upcoming Wednesday.And whether all of this goes away if the Democrats control the House in a couple weeks.YORK: Well, it does go away if Democrats win. I think there is no doubt about that. On Wednesday on this interview with Rosenstein, it's controversial among Republicans because a number of Republicans like Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows who have been working on this whole story are upset because one, they're not going to be there.And two, it's -- some of it is going to be conducted in a classified setting. Congressman Goodlatte told you there would only be a very few people they will be him and Trey Gowdy for the Republicans and there will be Representative Nadler and Cummings for the Democrats. Just four guys and a court reporter and that's it. And it's going to be conducted in a skiff and a classified setting.And the objection is -- wait a minute, if Rod Rosenstein is talking about wearing a wire to record the President or if he is talking about talking to other officials about invoking the 25th amendment to remove the President, is that somehow classified? No, that is a matter of the highest public interest and that should be his answers to those questions should be made public as soon as possible.BARTIROMO: You know, when I asked, Goodlatte as well as Lindsey Graham, do they have a Plan B in terms of these investigations. Should the Democrats take the majority in the House, they said yes, they do have a Plan B. For example, on the House they're going to come out with an interim report coming up with everything that they found out to try to keep the story out there so that there could be accountability.And Lindsey Graham said if he is the chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the Senate he will continue these investigations. So we'll see, but I agree with you that once the committee chairman flip, they're not -- they have different priorities, they want to impeach the President, they don't want to, you know, show the abuse of power, that went on, in a top -- in small group of people top of the FBI.YORK: Well, Well, one of the points I was making was it is important to investigate the Trump-Russia matter. The Senate Intelligence Committee is doing that. The Special Counsel, full law enforcement powers is doing that, but the conduct of the investigators cried out for scrutiny in this case. And look at some of the things that we know now that we would not know had not Devin Nunes and other Republicans in the House pursued it.We know about the role that the dossier played. We know about the anti- Trump bias among some top Republicans. We know that the dossier was used in a very questionable FISA warrant. We know that FBI agents did not think Michael Flynn had lied to them and on and on and on. And we only know those things because Republicans have looked into this and that looking into this will stop completely if Democrats win because they told us that.BARTIROMO: Right.YORK: I mean, Chairman Schiff of the House Intelligence Committee and Chairman Nadler of the Judiciary Committee and Chairman Cummings of the Oversight Committee have all said they want to target the President. They want to target the President's business dealings, his tax returns. Whatever they can to investigate the President and looking into the conduct of the FBI, the Intelligence Community, the Justice Department, that is pretty much over.BARTIROMO: Yes. And those will be the chairman that you mentioned, they're not certain yet.YORK: Correct.BARTIROMO: But they would. Let's turn to the rising tensions with Saudi Arabia. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin headed to Saudi today defending his decision to meet with top officials saying that the trip is aimed at reinforcing ties at a critical moment. This comes as Saudi King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman reportedly called slain Washington Post columnist's Jamal KhashoggI's son to express their condolences.The King is still forcedly denying any connection between the killing and the Crown Prince Mohammed but lawmakers are skeptical. Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did the Crown Prince know anything about it if there were people closely tied to him involved in this operation?ADEL AL-JUBEIR, MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF SAUDI ARABIA: There once people closely tied to him were involved in this operation. This was an operation that was rogue operation, this was an operation where individuals ended up exceeding the authorities and responsibilities they had.SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: It's ridiculous to believe that 18 people would go to Turkey to kill Mr. Khashoggi and nobody in the government know about it, that would be brazen abuse of authority. He was clearly murdered in a consulate. Things like that don't happen in Saudi Arabia without people at the top knowing.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: So Byron, where does this go? I mean, it's pretty clear the King is keeping his son in power. He gave him more authority to reorganize the intelligence community. What do you think? Will the Crown Prince have to step down?YORK: Seems unlikely to me but I think it does end with some sort of U.S. punitive action against Saudi Arabia. I mean. this is a complex story and there have been so many demands for sort of quick reflexive knee-jerk action in this. This is a -- an apparent murder that took place in a foreign country, in a not very transparent one, in the consulate of another foreign country in a not very transparent one.We're trying to find out what happens. The President has said that there will be a severe punishment if it turns out that the Saudis did murder Khashoggi. And that he is trying to find out what has happened and that he is being lied to in all this. He is making a lot of comments that are actually kind of sober and responsible, and I think it's going to end with action against Saudi Arabia but not a complete break.Not demand that Mohammad bin Salman be deposed but some sort of action that is negative to Saudi Arabia.BARTIROMO: Yes. Because you have to do something but then again there are only hope against Iran, right? I mean, when you talk about Saudi Arabia you talk about Iran.HIGGINS: Oh, yes. And remember, this is Saudi Arabia that funded 911, funded the actors in 911 and had been conducting a brutal war in Yemen. So we're now upset about one journalist but the real challenge here is figuring out what actually is punitive to them. Ending trade deals or arms deals does not do that. But for example, insisting that they expand oil production and bring down the price of oil somewhat actually would be punitive, would be beneficial --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: I don't know that they have spoken about that.HIGGINS: No. We have no idea.BARTIROMO: If something --HIGGINS: If someone wants to come away with something that is a genuine, something that hurts the Saudis while helping everybody else that would be it.BARTIROMO: Real quick, Byron, on the border battle. The migrant caravan from Central America marching towards the U.S. is at 7,000 people right now despite threats from President Trump to deploy military shut down border. Where does this go?YORK: Well, first of all, we don't know how many actually arrived, does it grow when it gets to the United States border? Does it even get to the United States border or does it kind of break up and peter out but the President has to take pretty firm action for a couple of reasons. The first and most important is the substance of the thing. If a large number of people are allowed to come to the United States, like this, and get in the precedent that sets.The incentive that sets for future actions -- future similar actions is very, very bad for the United States. The other reason for the President is politics, I mean, we're very close to midterm elections, immigration is an extremely important issue for Republican-based voters. And for the President to be seen as handling this strongly is important to him.BARTIROMO: These pictures are incredible. Byron, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much.YORK: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Byron Work, Washington Examiner. Coming up. All eyes on earnings this week, the busiest week of third-quarter earnings season so far. We'll tell you what to watch for from the big technology companies coming up next.And then from cars to drones. Uber rolls out a timeline for the food delivery service via drones. All the details next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We are sure in countdown to the midterm elections. 15 days away now, President Trump and former President Obama are squaring off dueling campaign rallies today just two weeks ahead of the November contentious election. Blake Burman is live at the White House this morning with more on that. Blake, good morning to you.BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Maria, good morning to you as well. They say politics can make strange bedfellows and will get yet another example later today. You remember it was just a couple years ago that President Trump branded Ted Cruz as Lion Ted. Cruz fired backhauling then-Candidate Trump utterly a moral and a serial philanderer. Fast forward to today though, in Houston the President will head down campaign for Cruz who was locked in a reelection fight there with Congressman Beto O'Rourke.The polls do show that Cruz is leading with a comfortable margin. However O'Rourke raised $38 million last quarter alone. Then later today as well, we will also see former President Obama out on the trail, he will head to Nevada which is where President Trump was over the weekend. The 44th President will also campaign in Wisconsin on Friday which is where the 45th President will head on Wednesday.President Trump will also stomp in North Carolina and Obama's home State of Illinois this week. This was part of President Trump's message over the weekend.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Democrats want to massively raise your taxes, impose socialism on our country, will be on Venezuela. They want to take away your healthcare, destroy your second amendment, and I think the people in Nevada are not big on having your second amendment taken away. Not a big point. That's not a good sound bite.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURMAN: Fifteen days as you mentioned until the midterm elections and the newest poll from The Wall Street Journal and NBC News shows that Americans are tuned in, 68 percent of Republicans say that they have high interest in the upcoming elections while that number is just a tick higher at 72 percent for Democrats. By the way, that poll also shows a mixed bag for President Trump, his approval rating does hit a high of 47 percent for that Wall Street Journal, NBC News poll.However, it also shows his disapproval numbers at 49 percent, that putting him underwater. Maria?BARTIROMO: All right. Blake, thank you so much. Blake Burman.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: I'm sorry?HIGGINS: His disapproval numbers are lower than they were before.BARTIROMO: So it's going --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: You say it's going it's going in his direction?HIGGINS: Yes, those are.BARTIROMO: All right. Coming up. From the streets to the skies, Uber lays out a timeline for its food delivery service by drone. Got those details next. And then new FICO score could soon get a boost. Details on the new changes set to take effect. The new scoring system we've got them here, next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A big week ahead. Lots of corporate earnings and big economic news. Deirdre Bolton on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange this morning with details there. Deidre, good morning.DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: That is right. Good morning, Maria. So a tenth of the Dow components, so 10 companies, that would be a third actually in the Dow 30 are going to be reporting this week. I'm going to go through the list. 3M, McDonald's, United Technologies, Caterpillar and Verizon. And then as far as the S&P 500 companies go, it would be 30 percent of those including some pretty big tech names.So, Microsoft is on Wednesday, Amazon and Google on Thursday. Just to let you know the earnings scorecard so far, we have seen 17 percent of the S&P 500 companies report results, close to 80 percent, have exceeded expectancies. So, so far so good. We've heard from varying industries, one stock we're going to be watching with particular interest this morning. Halliburton, we know we have been following this oil story.We saw over the past at 10 sessions, the price of oil actually coming down even with these increased tensions with Saudi Arabia. So Halliburton, a special focal point this morning, Maria. Back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Deidre. Thanks very much. We could see a rally of about 100 right out of the gate. Deidre will follow that. A group of Americans on a bachelor party were killed in Costa Rica. Cheryl Casone with the details there. Cheryl?CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, Maria. This happened over the weekend a rafting accident killed four American tourists and a Costa Rican guide in the Central American country. The victims were carried away downstream after their raft flipped over. Other people in other rafts managed to cling to the raft or rocks and some were rescued by another guy that was in a kayak as well.The four Americans were visiting Costa Rica as you said for that bachelor party. They were all from the Miami area we should say. Authorities say that the river was swollen by heavy rain and there is a picture of the river. That's where it happened.Well, your credit score may soon get a boost starting next year. FICO is going to institute a new scoring system that takes into account how you manage your money in your checking, your savings and your money market account. Borrowers of at least several hundred dollars in their accounts don't overdraw are likely to see their scores rise. The Ultra FICO score has been called to increase the number of borrowers approved for personal loans.And there's Uber ramping up plans for its food delivery drones. According to a job posting on their Web site, the company wants to hire an executive to get its drone program off the ground next year and launch commercial operations by 2021. However, Uber took the job posting down after an inquiry from The Wall Street Journal saying "it does not fully reflect our program which is still in very early days."OK. The (INAUDIBLE) Uber goes forward on going public next year. Bankers say the IPO could value the company at $120 billion, Maria. At least with the drone delivery, your pizza is warmer. There is a positive --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: There you go. Thank you, Cheryl. Coming up. A crude awakening the price of oil rising amid looking Iran sanctions which are coming onboard. We are breaking down the move with oil now at 69.19.Plus, British businesses already rolling back spending ahead of a formal exit of Britain from the E.U. U.K. Secretary of State for International Trade Lim Fox joins me exclusively to weigh in, next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Monday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, October 22nd. Your top stories right now 8:31 a.m. on the East Coast. Markets are rallying this morning; Futures indicating a gain at the start of trading of 110 points, this is the high of the morning, up one half of one percent on the industrial average as we enter a huge week in terms of third quarter earnings. The S&P is up 12, and the NASDAQ right now up almost one percent, 63 points higher on the NASDAQ.European trading similar story. Take a look at the markets in Europe right now. The FTSE100 in London is up almost one percent, 57 points higher. The CAC Quarante in Paris up a third of a percent, and the DAX Index in Germany up two-thirds of one percent, 66 points higher. Asian markets closed higher overnight, pretty much across the board. Best performer, look at Asia, Shanghai composite in China -- look at China, rather, Hong Kong up 2-1/3 percent, Shanghai up better than four percent.The price of oil inching higher this morning as we are now just two weeks away from U.S. sanctions on crude exports from Iran. Why one big name is saying that these oil prices are unhealthy for the world, at $69.9 a barrel on crude right now.All those coming up this morning, but, first our top story this half an hour targeting trade. The United States, and E.U., trying to hammer out a deal. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross recently said that progress has been unsatisfactory, his word not mine. The U.S. and the U.K. also working to secure a stronger trade ties as U.K. navigates its exit from the European Union. There is an important meeting this week, between E.U. lawmakers and the U.S., and that is the 23rd; so, we will see what comes out of that meeting.Joining us right now is Dr. Liam Fox, he is the U.K. Secretary of State for International Trade and the President of the Board of Trade. It is good to see you, Dr. Fox, thanks so much for joining us.DR. LIAM FOX, U.K. SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE: Nice to see you again.BARTIROMO: First off, tell us what's at stake here in terms of what's -- what the negotiations look like between U.K., and E.U.?FOX: Well, we're looking to get withdrawal agreement where we can maximize our access to the E.U. market and make an access there to the U.K. market, but without tying hands about future opportunities in the growing parts of the world. The IMS saying that 90 percent globally growth in the next 10 to 15 years will be outside continental Europe. We obviously have to be free to able to take advantage of that and not be tied by any agreement with the E.U. after we leave.BARTIROMO: So, is that only way you can do a deal with E.U., that it's, like, exclusive that you will not have access to other bilateral deals?FOX: No, we said one of the conditions of leaving it is that we have to have an independent trade policy. It's one of the main reasons that I campaigned and voted to leave. But we also have, other areas of contention too with E.U.; we will not have any parts of the United Kingdom treated differently from any other, particularly Northern Ireland. We want to ensure that we do not get any restrictions on us, for example the tax harmonization with the E.U. afterwards, and we have to ensure that we ultimately have control over the date at which we end in the transition period.BARTIROMO: And the E.U. is saying, well, what's in it for us?FOX: Access to the world's fifth biggest market.BARTIROMO: There you go.FOX: And Germany's biggest trading partner. And we will be the biggest trading partner -- second biggest trading partner in the world from the European Union when we leave. So, it's crazy to introduce impediments to trade or investment that don't exist today. Why would we want to see tariffs on our goods and add costs to our consumers?BARTIROMO: And you're willing to go as far as you have to go with this stance, right? Because these are tenuous talks -- I mean, people are wondering if, in fact, Britain does exit the E.U. Theresa May, is she committed?FOX: We'll be leaving the E.U. in 29th of March next year. The question is, under what conditions and what our future relationship looks like? And as the prime minister will tell the House of Commons today, the deal is 95 percent done but we have these areas, where our sovereignty is at stake.BARTIROMO: You said it very, very well -- very articulate. You're hosting International Trade Day here in New York to strengthen the trade ties between U.S. and the U.K., tell us about that. What do you want to see with U.S.?FOX: Well, we have a unique relationship with U.S. And it's our biggest single export market as a country. We have a trillion dollars invested in one another's countries, and really, the Americans put to work for U.K. companies and vice versa every day. So, it's very important that we look at future of these growing global markets, see where we have restrictions, what we can do with one another, how do we help, for example, our SMEs? How do we help protect in areas like cybersecurity -- these are the issues that we're discussing today?BARTIROMO: Yes, what would you like to see in a bilateral deal with U.S. I know that there are issues in terms of Europe and U.K., but specifically the U.K. and the U.S., what might that look like?FOX: Well, we want to see where there are restrictions in terms of tariffs and goods, but if you look at real opportunity, it's for us to move forward. This is -- the U.S. is the biggest globally service exporter, we're second. If we can get liberalization there, fantastic. If can get a move towards a single market, for example in financial services, that would be ground breaking globally.BARTIROMO: But how does that -- how does that jive with what's happening already for financial services companies? I mean, you know that businesses need certainty. And over this last year, businesses weren't sure how this would play out, and so they've tried to hedge their bets -- putting some of their employees in Germany, trying to take some others out. I mean, the exit from the European Union has confused some people, certainly financial services companies. Theresa May, the Prime Minister, said that this deal is 95 percent complete, which you just said a moment ago, but have you already seen disruption as a result of the uncertainty?FOX: No, we've seen, actually, more investment coming into U.K.BARTIROMO: How?FOX: Last year, Britain maintained its place as the third top destination for foreign direct investment in the world, and the top in Europe which even when we're seeing a decline in global FDI, there's still an increase in the U.K. It was remarkable. London is still the number one metropolitan destination of the world for investment. And last year, in venture capital on tech, we saw more come into London, just one city, than the whole of France, Germany, Spain and Ireland put together. So, investors have maintained their confidence because of the underlying economic fundamentals in the U.K.BARTIROMO: Very interesting and you make good point about the services part this. This is what you'd like to see up with the U.S.?FOX: Well, the time to meet regulation is where you have market dominance, and why would we wait until China came up lead, for example, before we set the rules around global services? This our time. This is the time, when we can have biggest impact, on our future perspective.BARTIROMO: Do you think that the world has gotten unified behind pushing back on China in terms of their behavior with regard to, you know, stealing intellectual property, forcing the transfer of technology. I mean, the President and the United States, obviously, Donald Trump has been pushing back on China but is U.K. there with the U.S.?FOX: In the analysis, yes, that we want to see over production end subsidy, lack of transparency, not knowing what state and what's private, all that analysis we share. Of course, we don't share the two-three-two mechanism and doing under guise of national security, because in the U.K. we are -- hosting our day on the (INAUDIBLE) carrier setting up New York Harbor, and we supply steel into the U.S. military. And yet, we're not having supply on national security ground, so it's the mechanism we disagree with, not the analysis.BARTIROMO: Do you believe those tariffs on steel go away if you close do close a bilateral trade deal with the United States?FOX: Well, they are sanctions on the European Union. So, when we leave the E.U., then that's an issue between the U.K., and the United States -- that becomes bilateral.BARTIROMO: But has that been one of the talking points, has that been among your negotiating with the United States when you do get a bilateral deal with U.S. Do you want -- obviously, you want the tariffs to go away on steel, right?FOX: We won't want that, but, of course --BARTIROMO: But have they indicated they would?FOX: And we are not allowed, actually, to negotiate that while we're members of the European Union under E.U. law.BARTIROMO: I see. OK, so that's the sticking point. When would you expect all of these deals to take place? You say the U.K. is going to be exiting March 29th of 2019, when would you see a realistic date for a trade deal to be in place with the E.U. and the U.S.?FOX: Well, we have -- we'll expect the E.U. at one point of exit, we'll obviously have that relationship in place. For the United States, we finished our public consultation, this month, on future trade arrangements. The U.S. would like to see that in place by the end of 2020.BARTIROMO: The President has talked about no tariffs, no -- you know, no taxes on any imports and exports. Is that something that you've discussed?FOX: That would be a wonderful place to be. Why would we have any costs for our consumers that we didn't have to have.BARTIROMO: Well, people say that then when they're actually talking about it, you all -- you are giving up money that's already been yours from the U.S. being at a disadvantage in a lot of these deals.FOX: Well, there's a differential on car tariffs, for example, the automobiles. But there's a 25 percent tariff applied by the U.S. to U.K. light trucks, we'd like to see that go. That is not just tariff, of course, it's the nontariff barriers, and that's what we've seen an escalation in, in G20 countries over this decade. Back in 2010, we were operating that 300 none tariff barriers to trade, now the G20 are operating 1200, and that's just not acceptable trend.BARTIROMO: What is the catalyst that we need to be aware of in terms of U.K.-U.S. deal going forward? What should we be watching?FOX: Well, we'll begin those discussions when we leave the E.U., so that will be the end of March next year. And at that point, we'll both set out what we think our ambitions are, what are asks of one another. We are in favor of general liberalization of trade. The U.K. is a very free trade in country. We'll want to see what we can do outside the E.U. that the E.U. couldn't do, for example, on data movement. The E.U. has got restrictions on data movement that U.K. is not committed to, so we can see the where we got areas that we can make progress that we have at the moment.BARTIROMO: How important is securing the borders for the U.K.?FOX: Well, our borders need to be secured in terms of the U.K. must determine who comes into the United Kingdom and who doesn't. One of three reasons that we gave for leaving the European Union is control of our money, control of our laws and control of our borders.BARTIROMO: Yes, why do you think the U.K. has been the under performer of the European economy in all of this? Has it been uncertainty of it? Or how would you characterize the economy and U.K. right now?FOX: See, if you look at an economy, that had its -- an increase in exports of 10.6 percent last year, the third top destination for investments in the world, and the top in Europe. And unemployment rate just dropping below four percent.BARTIROMO: So, you're not buying it, you think things are going well in the U.K.?FOX: The reason why investors are still coming is that economic fundamentals are strong. There are a number of people who've never really come to terms with losing the referendum, and seem to resent the fact our economy is performing so strongly. They told us that we'd see a half a million jobs lost; we have added 600,000 to the economy since the referendum.BARTIROMO: Fair enough, that was fake news, I guess. Let me ask you about Saudi Arabia.FOX: Fake prediction.BARTIROMO: Fake prediction. You recently pulled out of the Future Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia, joining a long list of people to do that including, Fox. Do you see the decision affecting the U.K.'s relationship with the kingdom? What do you want to see in terms of the Saudi Arabian government post Jamal KhashoggI's murder?FOX: We want a suitable explanation, and one that is backed up by credible investigation. We've had a slightly different view from Saudi government overnight about how this event happened. We want to verify that.BARTIROMO: And put this in the scheme of priorities for the U.K. as you look forward toward your Brexit moment next year, what are the priorities for the U.K., in terms of global affairs?FOX: Well, we want to get a good result for with our European partners and future trade, that's still 44 percent of our exports. But we want to make sure that other trading partners in the world are able to trade more freely with us, the United States, being the top.BARTIROMO: Yes. So, it's all about trade. In terms of --FOX: In terms of trade, because I think trade under pins global security. How we put it is that trade is a means to spread prosperity, prosperity under pins social cohesion, social cohesion contributes to political stability, and that's the bedrock of our collective security. So, let's make sure that people can all share, in that prosperity that we generate. But of course, we have to generate it first.BARTIROMO: Very well said, Dr. Liam Fox, it's good to see you. Thanks so much. We'll be watching your international day of trade today. Liam Fox there.News alert, President Trump just tweeted and we want to read you this, he says this: "Sadly, it looks like Mexico's police and military are unable to stop the caravan, headed to the southern border of the United States. Criminals and unknown Middle Easterners are mixed in. I have alerted Border Patrol and military that this is a national emergency. Must change laws!" That's the President this morning as we watch that caravan headed to the border of the U.S.We'll take a short break. When we come back, we're watching oil. Brent rising above $80.00 a barrel, this morning, it is pulling back to $79.00 and change, what's driving this market. Then, 15 days until midterm elections. The President's approval rating is trending upward, Stuart Varney on that.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The economy under President Trump, the President's approval rating jumping ahead of the midterm elections according to new NBC/Wall Street Journal Poll. Joining me now, the host of "VARNEY & COMPANY," Stuart Varney to weigh in on that. Good morning, Stu.STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria. Did you see those jobs numbers? They come right from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and I think they're so spectacular. That may account for the rise in the President's approval rating. In Florida, in the last 12 months, they've added 407,000 new jobs. In Texas, they've added 406,000 new jobs, that's the best job performances in one-year period in history for those two states. In Ohio, the best job gains in 21 years. In Pennsylvania, the best job gains in 18 years.I got to believe that that's got something to do with -- it's not exactly a surge towards the President and the Republicans, but it's certainly a polling moving towards the President and the GOP. You just put up on the screen, the approval rating, 47 percent in an NBC/Wall Street Journal Poll, that's right up there. That's actually a little better than the performance and the approval ratings of President Obama at roughly the same time in his first term.BARTIROMO: Yes.VARNEY: And I should also point out that in 69 tossup districts, which were previously considered toss-ups, they're now leaning towards the Republicans. Interesting stuff.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, you make a really good point that actually Heather made that point earlier in terms of Obama's approval rating in this -- at this point in the cycle. But will voters vote on that, Stu? Are they going to go to the polls knowing that the economic backdrop is completely changed under President Trump, or are they going to vote on something else? I think it's the economy, but I also think it's immigration, too.VARNEY: Oh, yes, I absolutely agree with you. I think this caravan that's heading our way --BARTIROMO: Exactly.VARNEY: That is a new issue in this election. And I think it's very favorable towards President Trump.BARTIROMO: Yes.VARNEY: He says stop them and the Democrats say, don't stop them, essentially, that's the two points of view here.BARTIROMO: Yes.VARNEY: I think the President is being -- you're right by the economy and, yes, you're also right by this caravan, the immigration question.BARTIROMO: And you got a lot on both counts in the top of the show. We're going to see you in about 10 minutes, Stu.VARNEY: I do. Sure thing.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. "VARNEY & COMPANY" has it all on both counts every day, and will this morning at 9:00 a.m. right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA. So, join Stuart in the next 10 minutes.But first, we're taking a look at the price of oil this morning, amid the looming Iran sanctions. They're going to hit in the next two weeks. Oil now just below $80.00 a barrel. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. President Trump just tweeted this: "Every time you see a caravan or people illegally coming or attempting to come into our country, illegally, think of and blame the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws." The President goes on to say, "Remember the midterms. So unfair to those who come in legally." "Every time you see a caravan or people illegally coming or attempting to come into our country illegally, think of and blame the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws." he writes, "remember the midterms. Unfair to those who come in legally," writes the President.I want to take a closer look at oil this morning. Oil has been creeping up, although we're looking at Brent Crude just under 80, and Crude Sweet Oil just under 70 this morning. We are now two weeks away from implementing sanctions against Iranian crude exports. Meanwhile, a recent report from OPEC say that prices could decline in the coming weeks. Joining us now, the Schork Report Publisher, Stephen Schork. Stephen, good to see you, thanks very much for joining us.STEPHEN SCHORK, PUBLISHER, THE SCHORK REPORT: Great to be here. Thank you.BARTIROMO: Impact of Iran sanctions within two weeks. Your view.SCHORK: Well, let's look at this rationally, Maria. We've had a summer where we lost a significant amount of Canadian oil because of an outage at an upgrader in Calgary; we had the greatest demand for crude oil that we've ever seen over the summer; we also had a situation where the State of Texas was exporting more crude oil than it was importing, and during this summer, again, I'll remind you, peak demand for oil, record demand for oil -- by August, we had a 15 percent decline in oil prices, so the market was clearly able to take care of this situation given the current fundamentals. Then, in between August up until about two weeks ago, we had about a 20 percent rise in oil.Now, this is the idiocy, Maria, of speculators, they were buying front month oil, oil that was delivered in months of September, October, or November, that is to say oil where the contracts expire even before the Iranian sanctions go into effect. The November contract today in WTI expires today. The Brent contract spot contract expires at the end of the month, again, before the Iranian sanctions go in.BARTIROMO: Wow.SCHORK: We've had five months to digest this Iranian news. This Iranian news is already priced into the market, and hence, we had a speculative bubble run up to WTI in the high 70s. We're now correcting that bubble and now we're in the high 60s.BARTIROMO: Here's Heather.HIGGINS: Yes. So, my question is there was some internal report that was released that said that OPEC was having trouble expanding their production, and I wondered if you could go into that a little bit for us.SCHORK: Well, that's interesting because again, with this North American, United States greatest oil demand that we have ever seen, the IEA said that in August, the global supply of oil was at an all-time high, and OPEC supply was at a nine-month high because we had increased output out of the Saudi Arabia, out of Iraq, out of Nigeria, out of Libya that compensated for significant losses of oil coming out of Venezuela, and Iran. That's not to say that this will be an overhang to the market, but I am confident that the market regardless of this internal report, the market is showing us over the summer that it's capable of handling the current situation.BARTIROMO: All right, Stephen, it sounds like you think oil is going lower. We will check back.SCHORK: (INAUDIBLE)BARTIROMO: Stephen Schork joining us there. We've got final thoughts when we come right back.BARTIROMO: Great show, everybody. Thank you.MCDOWELL: Seize the day, Maria Bartiromo.BARTIROMO: There you go. You heard it from Dagen McDowell. Seize the day! Right to "VARNEY & COMPANY" we go. Stuart, take it away.VARNEY: Seize the day? Seize the new week, why not?(LAUGHTER)VARNEY: Good morning, everyone. It's going to be a very big week for --Load-Date: October 22, 2018End of Document

US calls on its allies to avoid Huawei teams facing cybersecurity risksCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 23, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 479 wordsBody The US government is contacting key allies to persuade telecommunications companies in their countries to avoid using equipment from Chinese manufacturer Huawei Technologies Co., according to the Wall Street Journal.  US officials contacted their counterparts and executives from countries such as Germany, Italy and Japan to indicate perceived cybersecurity risks, the newspaper reported, citing unidentified sources familiar with the matter.  The US could increase aid for the development of telecommunications in countries that reject Huawei equipment, according to some of the people.  Huawei has long been classified as a security risk by US lawmakers because of its alleged links to the Chinese government, in part because it was founded by former military engineer Ren Zhengfei. While the Shenzhen-based company has denied any inappropriate connection, in Australia it was banned from supplying fifth-generation wireless equipment, faced scrutiny in the United Kingdom and has been excluded from the US market.  Huawei's scrutiny has increased since Donald Trump became president of the United States as trade tensions between Washington and Beijing increased. The closed capital company is currently the second largest smartphone manufacturer and is one of the largest producers of equipment for telephone networks.  The company said that customers around the world choose their products because they trust the company.  "Huawei is surprised by the behavior of the US government detailed in the article," the company said in an email. "If the behavior of a government extends beyond its jurisdiction, that type of activity should not be encouraged."  The 3.25% differential in Huawei's 2022 maturing bonds was extended and investors demanded the highest yield premium since the beginning of July, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Analysts said that the item increased weakness in the stock markets of China and Hong Kong, which led the regional losses.  US officials are concerned about the use of Chinese equipment in countries that have US military bases such as Germany, Japan and Italy, the Wall Street Journal reported. There is concern over China's ability to force companies to comply with government requirements, he said.  A number of large telecom companies allocated more than 5% of their capital expenditures to Huawei, according to data from the Bloomberg supply chain. The companies include Telecom Italia SpA and Japan's NTT Docomo Inc. and KDDI Corp., according to the data.  Huawei has been investing billions in the development of 5G technology and its potential to become the world leader in space would be the reason why Trump blocked the largest purchase of a chip company in history earlier this year .  The US entrance asks its allies to avoid Huawei equipment in the face of cybersecurity risks, it was first published in La Tercera. Load-Date: November 23, 2018End of Document

THE FBI AND CORPORATE DIRECTORS: WORKING TOGETHER TO KEEP COMPANIES SAFE FROM CYBER CRIMEStates News ServiceOctober 1, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 2703 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the FBI:Christopher WrayDirectorFederal Bureau of InvestigationNational Association of Corporate Directors Global Board Leaders SummitWashington, D.C.October 1, 2018The FBI and Corporate Directors: Working Together to Keep Companies Safe from Cyber CrimeRemarks prepared for delivery.Thanks, Peter. It's great to be here with you.One of our priorities at the FBI is building relationships at the corporate level. This is our inaugural meeting with such a large group of board members. And it's incredibly important to me. Because we need your help to confront the threats we face.I was in the private sector for 12 years before coming back to law enforcement. And there are a few things I miss about life in the private sectormostly living outside of the Beltway, way outside of the Beltwayand being able to drive my own car. That's one of the things you don't think about before taking a job like thisthe driving.Another thing I sometimes miss is the focused naturerelatively speakingof practicing law. At my old law firm, I ran an international practice group and served on our firm's policy committee. And I sometimes thought I had a lot on my plate then. My scope of responsibility is just a bit more broad these days. And needless to say, my hair is a lot more gray, as my kids like to remind me on a regular basis.But I was thinking about it, and the same is true for all of you. Not the gray hair partthe responsibility part. You've got to understand almost every aspect of the companies you servestrategy, succession, performance; vulnerabilities; and the needs of management, employees, customers, and shareholders. And you've got to be able to see the big picturewhat's coming down the road. That can be a lot of responsibility.And your burdens aren't getting any lighter in this brave new world. A world where terrorism moves at the speed of social media. A world where hackers for hire and nation-state adversaries are using cyber as a weaponto steal our innovation, our data, our secrets, and our technology. A world where geopolitics, global markets, and crime have converged.I want to give you a sense of how the FBI is thinking about these threatsin particular, cybersecurity and espionage. And some sense, from our perspective, of what we can do together to fight them. And then I'll take a few questions.Let's start with the cyber threat.The cyber threat has evolved dramatically since I left DOJ's leadership in 2005, partly reflecting how much the digital world has itself evolved over that time. Back then, tweeting was something only birds did. I've noticed it's a bit more popular now. Today, we live much of our lives online, and everything that's important to us, and to your companies, lives on the Interneton our devices, our systems, our networks, and in the cloudwhich means this threat is now coming at us from all sides.We're worried about a wider range of threat actors, from multi-national cyber syndicates and insider threats to hacktivists. And we're concerned about a wider gamut of methods, from botnets to ransomware, from spearfishing to business email compromise and APTsadvanced persistent threats. We're seeing these diverse threats in every company, at every level.The days of wondering if you're going to be the next victim are gone. Now it's a matter of how often you'll get hit, and how bad it'll be. And we're not talking just about defense contractors or critical infrastructure. Every company is a target. Every single bit of information, every system, and every network is a target. Every link in the chain is a potential vulnerability.We're talking about the vendors you work with. Your contractorsand their sub-contractors, over whom you may have little or no supervision, or even knowledge. Your supply chainsespecially technology supply chains, because the hardware components and software code often comes from foreign sources, including developers in Russia and China. And even your own employeeswhat we call the insider threat. We're seeing more incidents of employees taking proprietary information when they're about to be on the job market. And we're seeing business competitorsand foreign governmentsseeking to place spies into rival companies to gain access to information.The danger isn't limited to data exfiltration or manipulation or ransomware attacks. Access alone can cause a real problem. And most companies don't see that as an issue. But think about it for a moment. Who has access to your proprietary information? Who has information about your day-to-day operations and decision-making? Your long-term plans? Who holds the keys to the kingdom? Should they? Once someone has access to your data, your ideas, and your innovation, it's practically impossible to pull it back. Even worse, you may never even know you've got a problem.And the more we expand our global footprint, the more we do business in other countries, the more risk we assume on the cyber front. Even local companies often draw from global supply chains, a global talent pool, and global internet and communications systems.I want to focus for a moment on the increase in nation-state sponsored computer intrusions. It's no surprise to anyone in this room that China, in particular, seeks our information, our technology, and our military secrets. They seek to gain any advantage on the global stage, through whatever data they can pilfer. They're using an expanding set of non-traditional methodsboth lawful and unlawfullike cyber intrusions, foreign investment, corporate acquisitions, and supply chain threats.As just one example, last November, the DOJ unsealed indictments against three Chinese nationals for computer hacking, theft of trade secrets, conspiracy, and identity theft against employees and computers of three corporate victims over a six-year period. These three individuals worked for a China-based Internet security firm. They used their access to the computer systems of these three corporations to exfiltrate sensitive internal documents and trade secrets to help Chinese companies improperly gain a competitive advantage.The Chinese government isn't pulling any punches. They're strategic in their approachthey actually have a formal plan, set out in five-year increments, to achieve dominance in critical areas.Another example: In April of this year, we charged nine individuals and companies with conspiracy to commit economic espionage and theft of trade secrets from a U.S. company for the benefit of several Chinese state-owned enterprises.That U.S. company manufactures syntactic foama strong, lightweight material with commercial and military uses, including in U.S. Navy submarines and vessels. Syntactic foam was specifically identified in China's 12th five-year plan as a technology China wanted to acquire. The schemefunded by millions of dollars from Chinainvolved setting up a front company and recruiting employees of the victim company with access to trade secrets.We're getting more serious about the China threat. And we're asking you to get more serious about that threat, too. Because it's only going to get worse. No country poses a broader, more severe intelligence collection threat than China. Actors working to benefit Chinaincluding state-owned and ostensibly private companiesare the most active perpetrators of economic espionage against us.We have economic espionage investigations that almost invariably lead back to China in all 56 field of our field offices, spanning almost every industry or sector. And China is by no means the only aggressor. Russia, for instance, is still a serious threat. But Russia, in many respects, is struggling to stay relevant after the fall of the Soviet Unionthey're fighting today's fight. They remain one of our most tenacious adversaries. But China is fighting tomorrow's fight, and they want what we have so they can get the upper hand on us.A Harvard psychology professor has argued that humans are good at reacting to immediate threats, but we're not so great at reacting to gradual threats. We can recognize acute problems with local, short-term consequencesa child with the flu, a broken air conditioner, a crisis at work. But we don't respond as effectively to chronic problems, even those entailing global, long-term consequences.That's one reason why counterintelligence threats are often underestimated. It's much easier for the FBI to respond to a bank robbery than to understand and combat a gradual process like technology theft or malign foreign influence. Even though these are the generational threats that will shape our nation's future, and determine what we'll look like in 20 years, in 50 years.Our folks in the FBI are working their tails off every day to find and stop the criminals and nation-state adversaries targeting your companies. To address the threat from nation-state actors, we're using a broad set of tools and allies. Sometimes we use our traditional law enforcement authorities to arrest a malicious actor. But we might also work with the State Department to have a subject's visa revoked. We might work with the departments of Commerce or Treasury to sanction a foreign company for misconduct. Or we might work directly with a U.S. company to help identify and remove an insider threat.On the cyber front, we've got Cyber Task Forces in each of our 56 field offices across the countrywith partners from over 180 different local, state, and federal agencies. We have more than 20 cyber investigators in key locations around the world. Our Cyber Action Team maintains an elite rapid response capability we can deploy around the country. And we operate a 24/7 steady-state watch capability called CyWatch.But we can't do it on our own. We've got to work together, particularly with those of you in the private sector. We're sharing indicators of compromise, tactics cyber criminals are using, and strategic threat information whenever we can. I'm sure you can appreciate there are times when we can't share as much as we'd like to, but we're trying to get better and smarter about that.The vast majority of our critical infrastructure is in the hands of the private sector, of course. You own it, you run ityou're on the front lines. You know the risks, you know the weak spots, and you're more likely to see emerging threats coming down the road. That's why it's so important for us to keep these lines of communication open.I want to turn to the role of the board of directors for a moment. As board members, you're expected to take the enterprise-level view. You're expected to have that 360-degree perspective of the whole organization. And unlike the CEO or executive management, you're not typically involved in the day-to-day operation of the company. As leaders, we know that the day-to-day grind is tough. There's too much to do, and too little time to do it. So all the stakeholders of a company, from the shareholders to executive management, are relying on you to see the big picture.They're relying on you to have a mature understanding of the risks and vulnerabilities at hand. What questions should you be asking yourselves? What decisions should you be making right now? Management might be focused on near-term objectives, but you've got to play the long gamebalancing short-term profitability with long-term risk. A decision to enter into a joint venture or contract with a particular vendor or cloud computing company may look good todayit may make a lot of money today. But that decision might not look so great five years down the road, if you're in the middle of a slow bleed of data. Or, worse, if you're suffering a major hemorrhage of intellectual property.As members of the board, you can, and should, help keep the companies you serve focused on what information is most important to protect. You've got to work with executive management to establish and communicate a clear information security plan. You've got to be confident in your organization's plan to restrict access to protected information, and its ability to monitor who's accessing that data. You've got to ensure that the responsible executives have established an enterprise-wide cyber risk management framework. You've got to know that your organization has business continuity plans in place now, before the crisis strikes. And if you do suffer a breach, it's important to take the long-term view.Getting the FBI involved early allows usand our federal partnersto mitigate any ongoing damage to your networks and your data. It helps us connect the intrusion on your systems to any larger threat streams, and give you the information you need to understand what happened. It helps mitigate any risk to your reputation from a delayed notification. And it helps us notify other potential victims.I know there's sometimes a reluctance out there to turn to the feds when you've been hacked. But we're not going to rush in wearing raid jackets and shut down your operations. In our eyes, you areand you should be treated asa victim. But time is of the essence in these cases.So, please, when you see indications of unauthorized access or malware on your systems, when an attack results in a significant loss of data or control of systems, when there's a potential impact to national security, economic security, or public health and safety, or when an intrusion affects critical infrastructure, reach out to us. Call your local field office. In every field office, we have a private sector coordinator dedicated to engaging with your companies. We want to work with you, we want to help you. But we can't do anything to help if you don't turn to us.One of our cyber executives uses a great analogy to describe the cyber threat. He talks about working on a case with the port authority as an agent in South Texas. And there was an accident on the water one night, when a tugboat pushing a number of barges smashed into a pylon on a bridge. The agent asked a few questions: How fast was the tugboat going? And how long does it take to stop? And the port authority guy said, Oh, about 5-7 knots. And it takes about 200 yards to stop.The agent could see the lights on the tug only illuminated the ship up to the bow, which was a big problem. Because the boat captain couldn't see the bridge up ahead. So that accident actually happened about two minutes before the collisionthe moment the tug lost its ability to maneuver around the danger. He couldn't stop, and he couldn't steer fast enough to avoid the collision. The same is true for all of us.The bad guyshackers for hire, nation-state adversaries, and organized criminalsthey're taking advantage of mistakes and vulnerabilities. They're sitting on our systems, lurking. And if they're not there yet, they're making every effort to get there. Many of the intrusions we're seeing now actually happened some time agosometimes even years.For companies to wait until there's an impact before re-positioning, before tightening up systems, is a mistake. Because by then, it'll be too late. The accident will be unavoidable. And when it happens, we're all just reacting after-the-fact to a bad situation. And that's not the best case scenario for anyone.We want to be ahead of the threat; we want to prevent you from being victimized in the first place. To do that, we've got to have a full understanding of what you're seeing. We want to know what keeps you up at night. What could damage your operations, your information, your networks, your people, your reputation? How are you addressing those risks? We've got to get to know each other, and the challenges we're facing.We've got to build these relationships now. If a crisis does strike, it's much easier to work together when we already have that baseline relationshipthat initial sense of trust and understanding. To coin the old saying: The best time to patch the roof is when the sun is shining.We'll keep doing what we can on our end to build these relationshipsat the national level, with conferences like this, and at the local level, through our field offices.

The arrest of Meng Wanzhou, has Huawei in the international spotlightCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 10, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 680 wordsBody Huawei's financial director was arrested in Canada as part of a US investigation into an alleged violation of sanctions against Iran.  With this, tensions between Washington and Beijing resume, a few days after the presidents, Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, tried to resolve their trade conflict at the G20 summit.  Canadian officials said on Wednesday that the United States (US) seeks to extradite Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of Ren Zhengfei, founder of the Chinese telecommunications group, after his arrest on Saturday in Vancouver.  Several diplomatic and government sources with information about the case said that the US is pursuing Meng for a criminal investigation, which is related to Huawei's attempts to sell Iran-made equipment to the US, an action that could be a violation of the sanctions imposed against that country. The US Department of Justice declined to comment.  While the Chinese government immediately asked the US and Canada to release Meng.  His arrest, which came after the recent actions of the Western allies to restrict Huawei's commercial activities for security reasons, added to investors' concern about the increase in trade tensions between Washington and Beijing.  People close to Huawei, who did not want to be identified because they were not authorized to talk about their operations, acknowledged that the company sold telecommunications equipment to Iran, which contained a significant proportion of components made in the US. But they added that those sales came to a halt after the UN imposed sanctions on Iran.  The scope of the entire Huawei operation in Iran is still unclear, but in addition to selling smartphones, people with industry knowledge said the company also signed agreements to install fiber optic cables in Iranian homes, to accelerate access to Internet of the country.  The Shenzhen-based group, whose founder was once an officer of the People's Liberation Army, has long been the center of concerns about corporate espionage and cybersecurity.  Western intelligence officials fear that the dependence of other countries on Huawei may allow China to penetrate foreign telecommunications networks. Many urged their national operators to avoid the group, when updating services to new fifth generation technologies.  Huawei repeatedly denies any connection with Chinese security or military services, and insists it is a private company. But battle to eliminate doubts about the service that Rea provided in the People's Liberation Army.  m {227477}  For a long time, the company has been targeted by US security agencies, and the most recent action comes amid an increase in pressure from the Trump administration on Beijing.  In a speech in October, Mike Pence, the US vice president, warned China that Trump was preparing to take a harder stance than his predecessors.  US telecommunications networks are prohibited from using Huawei equipment. Australia and New Zealand - members of the intelligence sharing network, Five Eyes, along with the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada - also blocked Huawei and other Chinese suppliers for security reasons.  The Financial Times reported that, last month, the UK government issued warnings to British telecommunications companies about the security of their suppliers, which were followed by more public alarms about Huawei last week.  FT also reported that BT was planningRemove Huawei equipment from its 4G core network in the UK and exclude it from bidding for contracts to supply its 5G core network.  Huawei said that Canadian authorities detained Meng - also known as Sabrina Meng - on behalf of the US, which is seeking extradition for "unspecified charges" in the Eastern District of New York, the federal prosecutors' office based in Brooklyn.  "The company has received little information about the charges and is not aware of any crime by Meng," a Huawei spokesman said.  He added that "it complies with all applicable laws and regulations where it operates, including export control and sanctions from the UN, the EU and the European Union."  m {227468} Load-Date: December 10, 2018End of Document

American Institute in Taiwan: PRC State-Owned Company, Taiwan Company, and Three Individuals Charged With Economic EspionageTargeted News ServiceNovember 2, 2018 Friday 8:10 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1515 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: SAN FRANCISCO, California BodyThe American Institute in Taiwan issued the following news release:* * *Investigation Conducted with Assistance of Taiwan Authorities Results in U.S. IndictmentThe Department of Justice announced that a federal grand jury indicted a state-owned enterprise of the People's Republic of China (PRC), a Taiwan company, and three individuals, charging them with crimes related to a conspiracy to steal, convey, and possess stolen trade secrets of an American semiconductor company for the benefit of a state-owned enterprise of the PRC. In addition, the United States filed a civil lawsuit seeking to enjoin the further transfer of the stolen trade secrets and to enjoin certain defendants from exporting to the United States any products manufactured by UMC or Jinhua that were created using the trade secrets at issue. The indictment was filed on September 27, 2018, and unsealed today. The civil lawsuit was filed this morning."I am announcing that a grand jury in San Francisco has returned a multi-defendant indictment alleging economic espionage on the part of a state-owned Chinese company, a Taiwanese company, and three Taiwan individuals for an alleged scheme to steal trade secrets from Micron, an Idaho-based semi-conductor company," said Attorney General Sessions. "Micron is worth an estimated $100 billion and has a 20 to 25 percent share of the dynamic random access memory industry--a technology not possessed by the Chinese until very recently. As this and other recent cases have shown, Chinese economic espionage against the United States has been increasing--and it has been increasing rapidly. I am here to say that enough is enough. With integrity and professionalism, the Department of Justice will aggressively prosecute such illegal activity.""The theft of intellectual property is not only unfair, but stifles technological innovation by disincentivizing investment in long-term research and development. The theft of intellectual property on a continuing basis by nation-state actors is an even more damaging affront to the rule of law," said U.S. Attorney Alex Tse. "We in the Northern District of California, one of the world's great centers of intellectual property development, will continue to lead the fight to protect U.S. innovation from criminal misappropriation, whether motivated by personal greed or national economic ambition.""The attempts by foreign governments to illegally obtain U.S. intellectual property and trade secrets pose a substantial threat to our national security and economy," said Special Agent in Charge John F. Bennett. "The San Francisco Bay Area, with its unique blend of human talent and innovative technologies, is often a target of economic espionage and theft of trade secrets by foreign individuals and governments. This indictment demonstrates the FBI's commitment to protecting American innovation, research, and development."According to the indictment, the defendants were engaged in a conspiracy to steal the trade secrets of Boise, Idaho-based Micron Technology, Inc. (Micron), a leader in the global semiconductor industry specializing in the advanced research, development and manufacturing of memory products, including dynamic random-access memory (DRAM). DRAM is a leading-edge memory storage device used in computer electronics. In the worldwide DRAM supply, Micron holds approximately a 20-25% of the market share. Micron is the only United States-based company that manufactures DRAM. According to the indictment, Micron maintains a significant competitive advantage in this field due in large part from its intellectual property, including its trade secrets that include detailed, confidential information pertaining to the design, development, and manufacturing of advanced DRAM products.Prior to the events described in the indictment, the PRC did not possess DRAM technology, and the Central Government and State Council of the PRC publicly identified the development of DRAM and other microelectronics technology as a national economic priority. The indictment describes the manner and means by which the defendants conspired to steal Micron's intellectual property related to DRAM and convey it to a company controlled by the PRC government.The criminal defendants are United Microelectronics Corporation ("UMC"), a Taiwan semiconductor foundry; Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit, Co., Ltd. ("Jinhua'"), a state-owned enterprise of the PRC; and three Taiwan nationals: Chen Zhengkun, a.k.a. Stephen Chen, age 55; He Jianting, a.k.a. J.T. Ho, age 42; and Wang Yungming, a.k.a. Kenny Wang, age 44. UMC is a publicly listed semiconductor foundry company traded on the New York Stock Exchange; is headquartered in Taiwan; and has offices worldwide, including in Sunnyvale, Calif. UMC mass produces integrated-circuit logic products based on designs and technology developed and provided by its customers. UMC did not possess advanced DRAM technology prior to misappropriating it from Micron.Jinhua is a state-owned enterprise of the PRC, funded entirely by the Chinese government, and established in February 2016 for the sole purpose of designing, developing, and manufacturing DRAM. The indictment describes how UMC, Jinhua, and employees of both, conspired to bypass many years of research and development by illegally obtaining Micron's proprietary technology. The DRAM technology at issue is based on research and development and other proprietary information worth at least hundreds of millions and up to billions of dollars.According to the indictment, Chen was a General Manager and Chairman of an electronics corporation that Micron acquired in 2013. Chen then became the president of a Micron subsidiary in Taiwan, Micron Memory Taiwan ("MMT"), responsible for manufacturing at least one of Micron's DRAM chips. Chen resigned from MMT in July 2015 and began working at UMC thereafter. While at UMC, Chen helped negotiate a cooperation agreement between UMC and Jinhua whereby, with funding from Jinhua, UMC would transfer DRAM technology to Jinhua to mass-produce. The technology would be jointly shared by both UMC and Jinhua. Chen became the head of UMC's division tasked with fulfilling the terms of the cooperation agreement, namely developing DRAM technology to transfer to Jinhua. Chen later became the President of Jinhua and was put in charge of its DRAM production facility.While at UMC, Chen recruited numerous MMT employees, including Ho and Wang, to join him at UMC. Prior to leaving MMT, Ho and Wang both stole and brought to UMC Micron trade secrets related to the design and manufacture of DRAM. For example, Ho and Wang stole confidential and proprietary materials pertaining to the past, current, and future generations of DRAM technology, some still in the research and development phase. Wang downloaded over 900 Micron confidential and proprietary files before he left MMT and stored them on USB external hard drives or in personal cloud storage, from where he could access the technology while working at UMC.In sum, all defendants are charged with one count of conspiracy to commit economic espionage, in violation of 18 U.S.C. section 1831(a)(5); one count of conspiracy to commit theft of trade secrets, in violation of 18 U.S.C. section 1832(a)(5); and one count of economic espionage (receiving and possessing stolen trade secrets), in violation of 18 U.S.C. section 1831(a)(3). Additionally, Wang is charged with two counts of substantive economic espionage and Ho is charged with one count each of economic espionage and theft of trade secrets.An indictment merely alleges that crimes have been committed, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. If convicted, the individual defendants face a maximum sentence of 15 years imprisonment and a $5,000,000 fine for economic espionage charges, and 10 years imprisonment for theft of trade secrets charges. If convicted, each company faces forfeiture and a maximum fine of more than $20 billion. However, any sentence following conviction would be imposed by the court only after consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal statute governing the imposition of a sentence, 18 U.S.C. section 3553.The defendants have been summoned to appear on November 19, 2018 before U.S. Magistrate Judge Susan van Keulen.In the civil complaint, the United States sues UMC, Jinhua, and Chen to enjoin them from exporting to the United States any products containing DRAM manufactured by Jinhua or UMC. The lawsuit also seeks an order preventing the civil defendants from transferring the trade secrets to anyone else. As authority for the lawsuit, the complaint cites 18 U.S.C. section 1836(a), a statute that permits the Attorney General to "obtain appropriate injunctive relief" against violations of 18 U.S.C. sectionsection 1831 and 1832.This prosecution is a result of an investigation by the FBI.

Silicon Valley Sieve: A Timeline of Tech-Industry LeaksAtlantic OnlineOctober 10, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1682 wordsByline: Alexis C. MadrigalBodyGoogle has sprung yet another leak about its secret plans to build a Chinese-government-friendly search engine, apparently in contradiction to the company's public statements about the possibility.It's just the latest piece of unauthorized information to escape from the tech industry's increasingly polarized and disgruntled employees. But just a few years ago, tech companies such as Facebook were famously leakproof. "Unlike tech companies such as Apple and Snapchat, which keep employees in the dark about projects and ambitions, Facebook routinely shares all kinds of secrets with all of its workers at Friday afternoon Q&amp;A sessions that Zuckerberg has been running for a decade,"            Recode wrote in January 2017. "What's most surprising: Almost none of it leaks out."Back then, the companies took different tacks in controlling leaks-Google and Facebook were famously transparent, Apple and Snap famously closed-but all their strategies were effective. Tech rarely leaked. It was considered a coup to get an early product photo, let alone controversial or deep information about the workings of the world's most powerful companies. There was one very clear-cut way to lose your job in tech: talk to a reporter. Sources were understandably skittish.[My Facebook was breached by Cambridge Analytica. Was yours?]Fast-forward a year and a half, and the trickle of information has become a flood. Dozens of leaks from just about every major tech company have brought an incredible amount of new information into the public realm. The companies            continue to hunt the leakers, but they keep delivering information to journalists.What changed? It probably wasn't the election of Donald Trump, but that certainly            heightened the contradictions of the tech industry. After all, nationalist populism contravenes the well-established global cosmopolitanism that's endemic in Silicon Valley. The tech companies purport to be politically neutral platforms for all voices, but            most of their employees are left leaning. At Facebook, Twitter, Google, and elsewhere, employees            started to ask, Do tech platforms have to help people who hated everything they stood for?            Should theyThese debates, in their many manifestations, appear to have cracked open the worker-management wall of secrecy that used to keep corporate information in. Now right-wing leakers go to            Breitbart or            Fox, and left-wing leakers go to            BuzzFeed,            The Intercept, or            Gizmodo. It's impossible to quantify the number of leaks that emanated from the tech industry before and after the campaign and election of Trump, but anyone who has covered the industry would attest that the number of significant leaks from employees in technology companies has increased since the campaign and subsequent election of Trump. As this timeline of widely publicized leaks of the past two and a half years or so shows, once the rank-and-file employees began to talk, the high-note oratory of their bosses began to seem meretricious. Many of these employees seemed to realize, to their horror, that they worked for companies that were more like other companies than they were not. And now the tech industry leaks, just like everyone else, but juicier.October 9, 2018, Google to The Intercept: Employees            leak a July 2018 talk by the search-engine head, Ben Gomes, about the company's            Dragonfly effort in China. The transcript appears to contradict            congressional testimony that Google gave, as well as            a public statement by Gomes.September 26, 2018, Amazon to Gizmodo: Amazon            employees leak an anti-union video being circulated to team leaders at Whole Foods.September 12, 2018, Google to Breitbart: An anonymous source sends Breitbart a video of            Google executives reacting to the 2016 presidential election.September 10, 2018, Google to Fox: An unnamed source            leaks an email to Tucker Carlson in which Google's head of multicultural marketing describes the company's efforts to help Latino voters get to the polls.August 23, 2018, Facebook to Motherboard: Sources give "           hundreds of pages of leaked content-moderation training documents and internal emails" to Motherboard's Jason Koebler and Joseph Cox.August 17, 2018, Google to The New York Times: Some Google employee feeds the Times' Kate Conger lines from a talk that Sundar Pichai was giving about the Dragonfly project.

From the mem "In 2017, Apple caught 29 leakers. 12 of those were arrested."March 29, 2018, Facebook to BuzzFeed: A former employee            surfaces a post by longtime executive Andrew Bosworth titled "The Ugly" about the costs and necessity of Facebook's continued growth. It references the company's "questionable contact importing practices" as well as "the work we will likely have to do in China some day." The unvarnished view of the company's rapaciousness had been posted to an internal message board a year before, but had only circulated internally. The next day, Facebook employees            leak the discussion about Bosworth's memo to The Verge.March 15, 2018, Amazon to Reuters:            Leaked documents show Amazon Prime's numbers and detail its subscriber-acquisition strategy.March 7, 2018, Snap.

THEKEY has Launched its Mainnet Ahead of SchedulePR NewswireNovember 30, 2018 Friday 6:52 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 788 wordsDateline: BEIJING, Nov. 30, 2018 BodyPR NewswireTHEKEY project team released "THEKEY MVP/Testnet Progress Report" which outlined the development progress of the Blockchain Based Dynamic Multi-Dimension Identification (BDMI) on May 28th 2018. 6 months later, THEKEY has successfully completed its Mainnet development, which was set to finish at the end of December this year, far ahead of its original schedule.The following three achievements with regard to the development of the BDMI Testnet were disclosed in May:First, "undeniable" and "unalterable" online Identity Verification (IDV) results were generated for the first time in the world through BDMI technology. BDMI embraces 6 elements simultaneously to realize EA5 (e-authentication-5) level IDV services. Second, THEKEY adopted a 5-pillar private key management system that directly triggers the signing of a smart contract and token circulation. The initial results appear to provide a great starting point for a feasible solution for private key management, deviceless IDV and deviceless payment. Third, also for the first time, THEKEY was able to integrate IDV and digital wallets to form a Real Identity Wallet (RIW).Due to the abovementioned achievements, THEKEY project team was awarded the"Technology Innovation Award of 2018 Chinese Government's Information Product"at the China International Big Data Industry Expo on May 26th, 2018. Along with the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security (MOHRSS), the largest insurance agency in the world, THEKEY launchedthe National Laboratory of Application of Blockchain in Social Insuranceon June 30th, 2018. Additionally, on October 9th, 2018, with support from both the central and local government, THEKEY began to deploy BDMI as the IDV solution for Guizhou Pension Program, serving 35.8 million people and as a national pilot.Against this background, THEKEY project team has developed the BDMI Mainnet which focuses on the following two aspects based on the BDMI Testnet:First, THEKEY has focused on improving the performance, efficiency and reliability of BDMI technology based on what has already been achieved so that it can be implemented in real-world applications as soon as possible. Second, from the development of the BDMI Testnet, THEKEY understands the vital need to have a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) and a Secure Environment (SE) to underpin any of the work BDMI technology will be based on. Therefore, they have also conducted a feasibility study on potential proprietary hardware devices while concurrently developing the Mainnet.THEKEY has releasedthe Technical Report of the BDMI Mainnet Deploymentand the relevant code has been uploaded to GITHUB (https://github.com/thekeygithub/MVP/tree/master/THEKEY%20Mainnet).As stated by Catherine Li, Chairwoman and CEO of THEKEY, due to a variety of factors from increased regulation/supervision from governments to the downturn in the cryptocurrency markets, many of the early participants of the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry have entered a difficult time period with many "crypto celebrities" and blockchain projects vanishing from the ecosystem. "Our team still remains true to our original aspiration and we keep our mission firmly in mind, while we continue our journey through all the turbulence and hardships. We firmly believe THEKEY is and will continue to be one of the strongest projects to come out of the current turmoil and volatility," she said.About THEKEYTHEKEY is a decentralized ecosystem of Identity Verification (IDV) tools integrating national big-data and the blockchain. THEKEY's project team is now developing its identification verification (IDV) tool with blockchain using its proprietary Dynamic Multi-dimension Identification (BDMI) platform, uniquely using Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that has been exclusively authorized by the Chinese Government. THEKEY token (TKY token) is the only method by which to settle smart contracts signed between all participants across THEKEY Ecosystem. THEKEY mainnet was launched in November, 2018. TKY is currently tradable across a number of exchange platforms such as HitBTC,Bit-Z, KuCoin,Lbank,CoinrailandLATOKEN.For more information, please visit:Website:https://www.thekey.vipTwitter:            https://twitter.com/thekeyvipMedium:            https://medium.com/@thekeyvipTelegram:            https://t.me/THEKEYOFFICIALReddit:            https://www.reddit.com/r/THEKEYOFFICIALFacebook:            https://www.facebook.com/TheKey-1439094662870680/YouTube:           https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDuN2bjI7cAhoIIxJ_nTaCQ View original content to download multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/thekey-has-launched-its-mainnet-ahead-of-schedule-300758171.htmlSOURCE THEKEYCONTACT: Xiaohang Wang, 86-18611882507, helen@thekey.vipLoad-Date: December 1, 2018End of Document

MEMBERS AGREE TO HOLD MEETING ON THE USE OF THE LDC SERVICES WAIVERStates News ServiceDecember 7, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 912 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: GENEVA, Switzerland BodyThe following information was released by the World Trade Organization (WTO):Recalling the Nairobi Waiver Decision, LDCs invited members to seize this opportunity to engage in an information sharing exercise, including on how to build awareness of how LDCs benefit from the waiver and how to increase access to LDC suppliers of services. LDCs underlined the importance of carrying out an information sharing exercise which will allow them to showcase their experiences as beneficiaries, and stressed that the dedicated discussion will not in any case replace the standing item on the CTS agenda with respect to the LDC Services Waiver.Many of the WTO members providing preferential treatment to LDC services suppliers stressed the need for the discussion to take a broad approach, extending beyond the preferences permitted under the waiver. They said that the exchange of information should cover the full scope of trade opportunities available to LDC service suppliers. Moreover, they called for the information sharing to be flexible and in no way compulsory, based on a balanced engagement from all members, including the LDCs.Other mattersThe United States reiterated its concerns in relation to existing and proposed cybersecurity measures by China as they would allegedly restrict cross-border transfers of information and require the localization of data in China. According to the US, Chinas proposed legal approach to cybersecurity requires a burdensome security assessment for transfers of any data Chinese government officials consider to be "important data". This would almost imply explicit consent by the owner of the information before any cross-border transfer can take place, said the United States.The US pointed out the provision in China's cybersecurity framework that any "important data" or "personal information" that operators of critical information infrastructure collect or generate in China must be stored in China. All these elements combined could disrupt, deter and, in many cases, prohibit cross-border transfers of information in the ordinary course of business, according to the US. Japan, the European Union, New Zealand, Canada and Chinese Taipei echoed these concerns.China noted that it had already supplied detailed answers in the last CTS meeting in October. However, it took the floor to state that the implementing measures of the Cybersecurity Law are still being drafted while the Chinese authorities receive suggestions from various interested parties with a view to designing their policies on this matter in a more scientific and reasonable manner and creating an orderly market environment for both domestic and foreign enterprises.After stressing that ensuring cybersecurity was a difficult challenge that all members face, China underlined that enhanced cybersecurity measures are essential for protecting national security, public interest and the rights of citizens, legal persons and other organisations, and that these measures are in line with relevant WTO rules.The United States and Japan also reiterated their concerns with regard to existing and proposed cybersecurity measures by Viet Nam. They underlined that service suppliers in data-intensive sectors depend on cross-border data flows and often rely on data centres that cannot economically be replicated in every market they serve; as such, they should not be subject to data localization and local presence requirements. These delegations' concerns were shared by the European Union, New Zealand, Canada and Chinese Taipei.The Vietnamese delegate noted that the National Assembly had carefully considered all comments before passing the law at issue, which had been adopted in pursuit of the legitimate policy objective of ensuring cybersecurity and in strict adherence to Viet Nam's WTO obligations. Relevant implementing regulations were being drafted in an open and transparent manner, and had been already revised in light of the concerns raised, Viet Nam said.Working Party on Domestic RegulationThe CTS was preceded by a meeting of the Working Party on Domestic Regulation (WPDR) on 5 December 2018, where members discussed a proposal by India to develop regulatory disciplines on measures relating to the temporary entry of natural persons, also known as "mode 4".The proposal includes making measures relating to licensing, qualification and technical standards affecting mode 4 trade more transparent and facilitative. To this end, the proposal suggests enhanced publication requirements, streamlined procedures for licensing and qualifications, and adequate procedures to ensure that natural persons who are qualified outside a member's territory are permitted to supply services to another member.Many members highlighted the importance of easing access to markets through mode 4 to create meaningful commercial opportunities in services. In particular, developing countries emphasized that reducing trade barriers created by such measures would help them use trade to better meet their development objectives. In addition, they underlined the need for special and differential provisions for developing members. These include, for example, adequate transitional periods, reduced administrative fees and technical assistance for services suppliers from developing countries.In addition, Korea reported the adoption of non-binding disciplines on domestic regulation at a meeting of APEC ministers in Papua New Guinea held in November 2018. &#8203;Load-Date: December 13, 2018End of Document

Alibaba Sinks Ahead of Its Singles Day Celebration on SundayRealMoneyNovember 10, 2018 Saturday 1:38 PM EDTCopyright 2018 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 862 wordsByline: Kevin CurranHighlight: Alibaba investors might have a lonely feeling on Friday.BodyAlibaba  might be wishing the stock wasn't in a relationship with the overall Chinese market.Shares of the ecommerce giant finished Friday's trading down 2.7% to $144.85 despite its biggest sales day, "Singles Day", coming on Sunday."Singles Day," a holiday created by Alibaba in 2009, takes place on 11/11 each year and has grown into a $25.3 billion online shopping extravaganza. For reference, that represents over 10 times the online shopping spend of Americans on Black Friday last year and dwarfs Amazon's  "Prime Day" purchases.This year, the event will branch out beyond China, as well, as Alibaba's Filipino subsidiary -- and the largest e-commerce operator in southeast Asia -- is delivering deals to drive even more traffic on the day. Given the expansion and further saturation of Alibaba's e-commerce on the tenth anniversary of the holiday, it could mark record sales figures.Still, it is not enough to gloss over longer-term concerns for many following the stock."Other factors impacting the stock are much more important than results from a sales day in the short term," Hans Engel, market strategist for the Vienna-based Erste Group, told Real Money.Trade TurmoilEngel also noted that trade pressures, which have helped drag Chinese stocks down in 2018, should only add to problems at Alibaba, as Jack Ma makes his exit as chairman in 2019.President Donald Trump's administration has noted that it could raise tariffs to 25% on Chinese goods, which would further ruffle relations between the world's two largest economies and likely act to the detriment of major Chinese companies like Alibaba. The Shanghai index is already down over 20% year to date, even without the highest level of tariffs yet enacted."The situation is such that conflicts between the United States and China are still building. Also, Jack Ma has announced his resignation, which adds to uncertainty," Engel explained. "This combination is much more important than short-term sales factors."Engel issued a "Hold" rating for the stock, given the amount of uncertainty going forward.Many analysts on Wall Street are likewise cautious, with the overwhelming majority reducing price targets on the e-commerce giant.That said, bullish sentiment on the stock remains, with almost every analyst surveyed by FactSet issuing a "Buy" rating for the company, despite reeling in price targets after a disappointing earnings release and guidance earlier this month."We view the guidance cut as the last shoe to drop, and would be looking to buy the stock, especially on a mid-term basis," Deutsche Bank analyst Han Joon Kim said. "We believe investors increasingly finding confidence that guidance cuts stem from company-specific issues, rather than macro, could lead to stock recovery."Kim issued a $195 price target for the stock and a "Buy" rating on his belief that macro factors could still be alleviated.For now, the market and most experts are not optimistic on the near term prospects of a resolution to the trade war.This minimized probability is especially likely as  ."Consider the shuttle diplomacy that is now going on by a self-appointed group of Wall street bankers and hedge fund managers," he railed at the Center for Strategic and International Studies on Friday morning. "As part of a Chinese government influenced operation, these globalist billionaires are putting a full-court press on the White House in advance of the G-20."Navarro said that Trump will not fold to the demands of "unregistered foreign agents" on Wall Street and would make a deal on his own terms."If Wall Street is involved and continues to insinuate itself into negotiations, there will be a stench around any deal that is consummated because it will have the imprimatur of Goldman Sachs and Wall Street," he said. "If [Wall Street firms] want to do good, then spend their billions in Dayton, Ohio."Optimism heading into the Buenos Aires G20 meeting at the end of the month is justifiably muted and Chinese stocks could continue sinking as a result.Catalyst Oncoming?The companies longer term prospects remain attractive to many investors, especially given the  .However, given the constant pressure from the trade war, a nearer term catalyst could be necessary to break the stock out of its funk and prove a bull case to investors.Ahead of the singles event, some traders might be eyeing such a possibility in just a few days."BABA has fallen so fast that it is actually starting to look like a value," James "Rev Shark" DePorre pointed out in his  . "With a stock like BABA it is important that it proves itself before you put your hard earned money at risk."There are certainly large scale risks brought on by geopolitical jostling, as Jack Ma himself has acknowledged.Yet, as investors stare down a sales day that could bring on $30 billion or more in revenue, that proof could be coming in short order.Investors will be mindful of the sales number as celebrities like Mariah Carey and Miranda Kerr kick off a spending spree from the world's most populous nation on Sunday.Whether it provides a stock pop to prop up the struggling stock will be a story to watch.Shares are rising slightly post-market.Load-Date: November 11, 2018End of Document

Good Friday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Happy Friday. It is Friday, October 26th, your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the button right now, stocks are in sell-off mode once again. The Dow Jones Industrial Average expected to be down 220 points right out of the gate. That's one percent lower. S&P 500 down 31 points. That's better than one percent right now.And the NASDAQ with a decline of 145 points right. That's down better than two percent right out of the gate. It has everything to do with earnings. We are awaiting the first look at the GDP for the third quarter. The expectation calls for growth in the third quarter of 3.3 percent. We are going to bring you that number as soon as it hits the tape. That's at 8:30 a.m. and we will have the smartest analysis in the morning right here once the number hits. We will bring that to you.Global markets this morning under selling pressure once again. The FT-100 down better than one percent. The CAC Quarante down almost two percent and the DAX Index in Germany down one and a half percent right now. Declines across the board overnight in Asia. As you can see worst performer Korea. Technology earnings are in focus this morning. That's because last night Amazon and Snap among the names reporting and Amazon is down better than eight percent because revenue missed expectations zeroing in on revenue across technology this morning.Snap shares are down almost 12 percent. We're watching Google parent Alphabet, the company's profit was up. Sales were down. Well, it was slowing down lower than people expected and as a result the stock is down five percent on Alphabet. Plus, there's a bombshell report this morning out of Google over sexual misconduct. That's also playing into things here. So we'll have more on that coming up. And then this, the caravan crisis continues.Hundreds more National Guard troops making their way toward the border right now as President Trump calls on the group of illegal immigrants to turn around. That was echoed by Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen last night.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY: This caravan cannot come to the United States. They will not be allowed in. They will not be allowed to stay. If they come here illegally with no legitimate reason to stay, they absolutely will be apprehended and remove immediately.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: We'll have the very latest developments this morning on that. Stay with us on that. All stories coming up this Friday morning. And joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Third Seven Advisors Market Strategist, Michael Block, and Fox News Contributor Liz Peek. Great to see you this morning.LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning. Yes. It does gets worst and worst as we're watching this open. But it's important to note that all those sell-offs overseas we're in the wake of Amazon's report and Google's report, and so forth. I mean it was a tech problem in those markets as well. So, you know, the question is the GDP number going to make a difference?BARTIROMO: Yes, we'll see. I mean the estimate is 3.3 percent growth. I don't know if there's a good outcome here, Dagen, because if we get a strong number on GDP, that basically keeps the Federal Reserve's plan in place to raise interest rates in December, and then another three times next year, if their GDP is worse than expected, that perpetuates the story that the economy is slowing.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Right. And there's a story in The Wall Street Journal today that trade and manufacturing numbers point to slower fourth quarter growth. Many forecasters expect the growth rate to slip below three percent in the -- of the fourth quarter of the current -- the quarter that we're currently in because the trade deficit and goods has widened four months in a row.That's a problem and then also you saw the durable goods report yesterday, big increase in military aircraft orders, but excluding defense durable goods orders fell, and so that's another thing to worry about was for the month of --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: I think we also have to talk about some technical things. You mentioned the lack of companies in the market buying those stocks. There's also tax loss selling going on. This also could be part of this because mutual funds and hedge funds have a fiscal year-end of October 31, so there could be some tax loss selling and as you said earlier companies are not buying back those stock --(CROSSTALK)PEEK: And they're quiet periods. They're not allowed to sort of -- there's a sort of, you know, there's this back vacancy there where they have been in pretty powerful force a lot of these stocks --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: All of these plays into -- in addition to the fundamentals.MICHAEL BLOCK, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, THIRD SEVEN ADVISORS: There's -- there's a (INAUDIBLE) going on in one another tax loss selling this volatility gets more volatility and more losses and more pain. One thing I want to point we're talking about tech earnings and there are some short falls there. But overall growth in tech, Goodyear just reported this morning in industrial space. I've been negative on this space. I just want to point out.They're citing -- they're lowering guidance and they're citing raw material costs escalating. They're blaming China. They're blaming economic uncertainty in Brazil. There's a lot of things they're throwing out there, but these are all other issues that are impacting these markets even if the big tech companies are insulated somewhat from that.MCDOWELL: Just one more statistic as we've been talking about the revenue misses. That's in the headlines of the Amazon numbers that sales underwhelm Alphabet delivering slowing sales growth. Here's a statistic, 43 percent of companies half of the S&P has reported so far roughly half 43 percent of the companies have missed expectations, same period, second quarter. It was only 28 percent missing. So it's a much larger percentage for the current reporting period in terms of missing --(CROSSTALK)PEEK: -- a lot of companies lower their guidance which of course is also a problem for the market and for these shares.BARTIROMO: And that's why you've got tech tumbling this morning. It is about revenue. It is about expectations of slowdown. Global stocks extending declines following disappointing third quarter earnings from internet giants Amazon and Alphabet. That puts a dent in the solid earnings season for technology. Both industry leaders beat on earnings, but fell short on Wall Street revenue expectations as Dagen just mentioned. Amazon also forecast the weakest profit growth in two years.And let's not forget the cost side of this because amazon just raised wages, $15 an hour. That's going to take effect next week. A number of input cost have been going up. Joining us right now on the phone EndPoint Technologies Associates Founder and President, Roger Kay. Roger, good to have you on the program. Thanks for weighing in here. What do you think is going on within technology?ROGER KAY, FOUNDER, ENDPOINT TECHNOLOGIES ASSOCIATES: Yes. Good morning, Maria. Well, so basically, we're on a -- the end of a 10-year boom market, so it's not surprising to think they're slowing down. The other thing is, of course, there's just a lot of volatility after all. It's up hundreds of points yesterday. It's going to open probably off, you know, at least 100 points this morning, and it's been doing that back-and-forth for quite a while.I think volatility scares away investors. It invites speculators that also like to play volatility. But I think that ordinary people are spooked when the market moves several percent a day --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: You mentions -- you mentioned that the length of this bull market, that's something that AlphaOne Capital Partners Founding Pattern Dan Niles mentioned as well. He summed it up this way.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)DAN NILES, FOUNDING PARTNER, ALPHAONE CAPITAL PARTNERS: This is the longest bull market in the S&P 500 since World War II. It's been up for 115 months. The gains over that period of time are up over 330 percent which is the second biggest gain and during a bull market since World War II. But if you look at the big picture around growth, you got a lot of concerns. You got China starting to slow down, auto sales in China went from being up 15 percent year-over-year in April to down 10 percent in the most recent month.That's a pretty big change. We got concerns over Italy and Brexit in Europe. And in the U.S., interest rates are going up. They're at the highest levels in seven years. What you see in general during this earnings season with Boeing being a pretty big exception is that a lot of companies are guiding much lower. I'll give you an example. Texas Instruments reported last night and I think they're one of the best indicators in terms of global health.They do about 16 billion in revenues, a hundred billion in market cap. They missed revenue expectations for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2015. So it's been almost three years since they missed the top line. They talked about every major end market slowing down and they weren't sure when it was going to stop.BARTIROMO: Are we looking at fundamentals deteriorating within technology?NILES: I think you absolutely are and this is exacerbated by the fact that you have a lot of inventory out there. So if you pick the biggest company in the world, Apple for example, that 89 percent inventory growth year- over-year in the June quarter that they reported. Their revenues were up 17 percent. What if the iPhone doesn't sell well? They're going to have to barn that inventory off when we get into the March quarter.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Well, there you go, Roger. And the iPhone's thousand dollars for the iPhone X may not sell very well. What do you think?KAY: Well, right. So, you know, often in the technology industry particularly when you're talking about goods as opposed to service in this because after all part (INAUDIBLE) inventory of services. But it certainly there has been in the past channel stopping where the managers of a company, you know, the main company are motivated to move product at the end of the quarter. They push it to distribution and then let the distribution worry about working it off.That's their problem next quarter. But that of course comes home to roost within a quarter and you realize that the, you know, the mother ship isn't get anymore sales. So I think, you know, that kind of -- it happens, you know, in a badly management situation, you know, Tim Cook is not known for bad management, so it's unusual that they had stop inventory at purpose. But it's possible that normal inventories well went in and that the sales were slowing at the far end of the feds while there was inventory still.But that's indicative of I think across the board this question (INAUDIBLE) of growth that we come through this long period of growth and everybody has been just climbing and climbing and then that's your -- that speak under reported section there was saying there's just a lot of different sources headwind including rising interest rates. I think --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: -- people, you know, they sell first and think alter, Michael.BLOCK: Yes. You know, Roger, we're here looking at this sea of red this morning maybe lost in the clouds here is Intel which, you know, having a rough quarter last time around with their core business, and didn't quite do what they wanted to do in the data room so to speak. Yet, yesterday, really came in better than that lower bar and their core business actually pretty good and they were talking pretty confidentially about the move down in (INAUDIBLE) what do you think of that, you know, are there bright spots here? You know, is everything really --(CROSSTALK)KAY: Yes. What's interesting is I mean the Intel is off a little bit in premarket, but now as much as the others. So, you know, if you look at a handful of big name stocks, you'll see that most of the tech stocks are off in the two percent range some as high as four percent in premarket. But Intel is only a slight decline and I think that reflects the positive attitude that Intel may have been getting back together with respect to the process in technology.So it's interesting that the (INAUDIBLE) the other side of the shop, you know, the non-Intel part of the Silicon industry. It's already basically talking about (INAUDIBLE) but what's interesting is if you look a transistor density rather than the sort of (INAUDIBLE) which is what the (INAUDIBLE) it turns out that Intel's pen is kind of similar to (INAUDIBLE) and so that actually that puts Intel not as far behind as people had thought they were.So if they pull it together on their 10, they're kind of in the game against (INAUDIBLE) and that's good news for them, so I think people interpreting that and conversely they're interpreting the AMD side of that that's both negative.BARTIROMO: Yes.PEEK: So Roger, what could turn this group around? What could get the tech stocks going again?KAY: You know, finding another planet to colonize. There's got to be some way to get more growth out of this.BARTIROMO: Citing more growth? Yes, sure.BLOCK: Isn't Elon Musk doing that?BARTIROMO: (INAUDIBLE) is boring into one. Roger, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much. Thanks for calling in, sir. Roger Kay joining us there. Coming up, the search for a sender is intensifying this morning. Authorities are now zeroing in on Florida after locating a 10th suspicious package. The very latest on that investigation next. And then Saudi Arabia changing its story again about what happened to journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside its Istanbul interment - embassy. Khashoggi's son has arrived in the United States. He was barred from leaving Saudi for a while. Details there next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Markets are lower this morning. Take a look at the sell-off going on right now. Dow Industrials down almost one percent, 221 points lower. The S&P 500 down 32 points, better than one percent lower and the NASDAQ is down two percent. That's 146 points lower. This perpetuating view that things are slowing down last night because Amazon and Google disappointed on revenue. Meanwhile, there's this, the son of the murdered Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, his son has now arrived in the United States. Cheryl Casone with all the details now. Cheryl?CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: This is something, Maria. This is the eldest son that is now in the United States with his family. He previously had been unable to leave Saudi Arabia because of his father's criticism of the Saudi government. Well, the State Department says that U.S. welcomes Saudi Arabia's decision to allow Khashoggi's son to leave that country. Meanwhile, the Saudi government changing its story again now saying the killing was premeditated.Saudi officials say that Turkey's evidence shows the murder was planned contradicting their earlier claim that rouge officials killed Khashoggi by mistake during a fist fight. Well, after an intense nationwide manhunt under -- is underway after 10 pipe bomb packages were sent to prominent Democrats. Some new details for you it. Federal investigators has searched a mail facility in South Florida. That happened last night. Several of the packages actually went through that facility.Investigators also focusing on New York City after one of the bombs was sent to actor Robert De Niro. Meanwhile, President Trump tweeting, funny how lowly rated CNN and others can criticize me at will even blaming me for the current spate of bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September 11th and the Oklahoma City bombings, yet when I criticize them they go wild and scream, it's not just presidential.Well, corporate travel trends are changing and so are companies expense reports, shocker. Lyft made the top 10 list of the most frequently expensed business cost in the U.S. for the first time. This was during the third quarter, certified track all stuff. They're a traveling expense software company. Lyft was number six on the list with Uber in the top spot. Amazon coming in third, interesting. Both Uber and Amazon had been moving up the ranks over the last three years.And then speaking at people getting paid, Sofia Vergara extending her reign as queen of television. The Modern Family actress topping Forbes list of highest paid T.V. actresses for the seventh year in a row whopping 42.5 million was her take. That's only twice the 24-1/2 million that Big Bang Theory actress Kaley Cuoco made. Coming in third place, Grace Anatomy's Ellen Pompeo with 23-1/2 million rounding out the top five, Law & Order's Mariska Hargitay, and then Sofia Vergara's Modern Family co-star, Maria, Julie Bowen which has got lots of money and she's married to a tall drink of water --(CROSSTALK)CASONE: Wow. Lucky to be her.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Cheryl. Coming up, caravan crisis, hundreds more National Guard troops are making their way toward the border right now. President Trump is calling on the group of illegal immigrants to turn around. He says they're not coming in the country. The very latest there. Then we are waiting the first read on third quarter GDP. We have the number. The expert analysis as soon as it crosses 3.3 percent growth is the estimate. Back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Caravan crisis, President Trump is demanding the thousands of Central American migrants headed to the United States make a U-turn. The warning coming as the administration deploys hundreds of troops to the southern border. Joining us right now is Arizona Congressman Andy Biggs and member of the House Judiciary Committee. Congressman, it's good to see you. Thank you for being here. Arizona, obviously, a border state.You recent tweeted that you support sending the troops to the border. Assess the situation for us. Tell us what it looks like today and what can be done.REP. ANDY BIGGS (R), ARIZONA: Well, it's pretty bleak in some respects because the drug cartels control the border putting more military in the border actually gives a show of force even though they're not going to be en0gaged in normal typical military issues. But we're looking at a convoy of people that are going to try to overturn the border for the purpose of the organizers who are (INAUDIBLE) they want to -- they don't want to board -- they don't want a border between Mexico and the U.S.And so it's pretty rough right down there on the border right now.PEEK: Quick - congressman, question. What can the military actually do? You hear different reports on this whether they can actually engage with these marchers or how ever -- this caravan, what role can they play really?BIGGS: Well, they're going to be a supportive role and what that means they'll be able to help track people who are coming across the borders to free up the border patrol agents to actually interdict the people. They all need to be -- they should be armed so they can protect themselves because you got the cartels all armed. You know, they've got the watchers and so they are going to be supportive I think and I think that will be a benefit. But we got so much more to do on the border than just this.BARTIROMO: Are you going to vote for the president -- are you going to vote for Kevin McCarthy's bill and the president's border wall?BIGGS: Well, you knowledge what, I actually introduced my own bill which I think is a bill if that's the -- if that's the only bill that comes out -- if it's Kevin's bill, I'll vote for Kevin's bill. I think mine is better - -(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: -- bill differ from that bill?BIGGS: My bill actually provides funding sources off general funds to pay for that bill. It also restores money to the border patrol agents that were had their pay reduced under the Obama administration and provides equipment for the men and women of the border patrol.BARTIROMO: And let me switch gears and ask you about the fallout from the Kavanaugh confirmation, Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley is referring Michael Avenatti and his client Julie Swetnick for possible criminal prosecution over these allegations of making false statements to Congress, your reaction, sir.BIGGS: Long overdue. I'm glad to see that Chairman Grassley is out there doing that because I think Mr. Avenatti and Ms. Swetnick, they really tried to throw gas on to a fire that was already there for whatever purposes, and it looks like they made false statements and then they should held -- be held accountable for that.BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Congressman, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks very much.BIGGS: Thanks, Maria.BARTIROMO: Congressman Andy Biggs joining us there. We want to take a short break and then we are just moments away from getting the first look at the third quarter GDP. We are going to bring you those numbers as soon as it hits the tape. That is at 8:30 a.m. Eastern. That is in four minutes from now, 3.3 percent growth is what's expected for the first read on the third quarter GDP, next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Friday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Friday, October 26th, your top stories right now just before 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast, we are a minute way away from third quarter GDP number. The expectation calls for growth of 3.3 percent. This will be the first reading of growth for the third quarter. It comes after the second quarter generated growth of 4.2 percent.Ahead of the release, markets are selling-off again this morning. A negative tone for stocks, Dow Industrials expected to be down 200 points almost one percent. The S&P 500 is down better than one percent and the NASDAQ down better than two percent right now all because of disappointing earnings reports. You had revenue misses. Google parent company Alphabet and Amazon -- a sell-off this -- with Amazon down better than eight percent. Alphabet down five percent.The worry here guidance is weaker than expected and revenue is coming in weaker than expected within tech. In Europe, similar story, down across the board in European indices today. The FT 100 down better than one percent. The CAC quarante in Paris down one and three-quarters percent and the DAX Index in Germany down one and a third percent. Asian markets overnight in the red across the board. We are waiting on the first look of third quarter GDP this morning.We are in the middle of earnings season. For the GDP, the expectation calls for 3.3 percent growth and we are expecting earnings to be up 21 percent for the quarter year-over-year. Joining us right now is Jon Hilsenrath, The Wall Street Journal's Global Economics Editor. And Jon, we're going to get the number momentarily. We know that your often focused on the consumer.JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: Right.BARTIROMO: And what consumer is showing within this GDP number, the expect -- 3.5 percent is the number, Jon. 3.5 percent is better than expected. We were expecting 3.3 percent, and we are watching markets for any reaction. Your expectations and your reaction to a 3.5 percent number, Jon.HILSENRATH: Well, that's a strong number. What I want -- what I want to do is break this down a little bit and see where it comes from. I think trade was probably a drag for the quarter. I think we also have to look very carefully in addition to the consumer at government. There's been a - - as we've reported today in The Wall Street Journal, there's been a big pickup in military spending, government spending is contributing a lot to growth right now.BARTIROMO: Consumer spending is up four -- consumer spending is doing well within this, up four percent?HILSENRATH: Yes.MCDOWELL: Correct, four percent in the third quarter. The strongest rate of growth in almost four years on the consumer side.BLOCK: Street was looking for up 3.3 on that as well, so that's a big beat.PEEK: That's big. That's a big beat.BARTIROMO: Yes. Jon?HILSENRATH: Right. And that -- I mean, that makes sense. You've got an unemployment rate that's down under four percent, lowest levels since the 1960s. And you also have tax cuts that are making their way through the system, so we should be seeing strong consumer spending right now. We also have to look at what's going on on the business investment side, you know, for this growth to be sustainable in the long run, we need to see more business investment, and I want to see how that breaks down as well.MCDOWELL: Investment by companies was weak, Jon, non-residential, fixed- investment, spending on commercial construction equipment, intellectual property products like software rose only eight-tenths of one percent in the third quarter. That was after rising in an 8.7 percent rate in the second quarter and 11-1/2 in the first.BLOCK: Inflation is also light here, core PCE came in up 1.6 percent quarter over quarter, street was looking for up 1.8, so there's not some runaway inflation story here. It looks like consumption is strong. As Dagen points out, investment weak --MCDOWELL: And just one --BARTIROMO: Markets improving.MCDOWELL: Right. One more thing, private inventories which is something that Liz was talking about, private inventories added more than two percentage points to the third-quarter growth rate, reversing that trend that you saw in the second quarter when companies were drawing down their stockpiles ahead of the tariffs.PEEK: That has been sort of an offset on going quarter-to-quarter with the trade -- the widening trade deficit. It seems to me that consumer news here is very important, because the fourth quarter is all about holiday sales, all about consumer spending, the fact that that's held up and actually beat by such a wide margin, I think teases up for less pessimism if you want to look at it that way about the fourth quarter.BARTIROMO: And interesting, there's no revisions on the second quarter, Jon. The second quarter was really strong at 4.2 percent, that is not being revised downward, so that stays in place with the better-than- expected initial or advanced reading, the first reading for the third quarter at 3-1/2 percent, Jon.HILSENRATH: Well, so I'd say a few things here based on these breakdowns that you've given me. One is let's go back and talk about that inflation number, the market has been very concerned and the President has been very concerned about the Fed continuing to raise interest rates going into next year. You know, the inflation numbers have come in kind of soft over the last couple of months, and I think the Fed is going to have to start paying attention to that and factor in that into how far they want to go on interest rate increases.On the inventory piece that you talked about, that's a volatile number, it doesn't fundamentally have much to do with economic growth in the long run. So, the fact that it added a lot to growth in third quarter I think becomes a potential drag on growth in the second quarter. A lot of the estimates that we get at The Wall Street Journal for fourth quarter is that it's going to slow down a little bit on overall growth, and it's going to slow down -- growth is going to slow down going into 2019, that inventory piece plays into that.PEEK: It seems to me it's almost a percent number for people who are Fed watchers, though, right? Because it isn't really high enough to spur alarm at the Fed, any kind of acceleration, or you know, incremental rate hikes next year neither is it low enough to kind of take them off their paths. So, it seems to me that's sort of a neutral.MCDOWELL: Although, I will add looking at this report, higher borrowing costs have hurt housing and auto sales.PEEK: Sure.MCDOWELL: Spending on motor vehicles and parts added just 0.09 percentage points, so third quarter growth, and in terms of residential-fixed investment fell at a four percent annual rate in the third quarter. So, is --HILSENRATH: You know, residential has been -- residential has been a really big drag for several quarters now, and that's continuing. It's a little puzzling because there's under supply in the housing market, but builders (INAUDIBLE) building because labor is short, and land supply is short, and costs are going up, so, you know, we should be seeing more building and we're just not getting it right now.MCDOWELL: But, Jon, there is -- during the summer, there was a plentiful amount of inventory coming on the market in many housing markets that were already weak. There are a lot of pockets of weakness in housing in this country that are overlooked because we tend to focus on the metropolitan areas.BLOCK: You know, and supply, actually, has been going up in some of these metrics. I think I saw a 7.1 month supply in one of the -- one of the metrics this week on existing home sales. The only thing I'll point out is, even in the Fed minutes, it was pointed out that higher rates might be crimping residential investments to your point, Jon.BARTIROMO: Well, I also think that it's, you know, understandable that the third quarter rate of business investment was weak. And this is actually the weakest since the fourth quarter of 2016, spending on structures down, 7.9 percent. You would expect companies to pull back in terms of spending with the uncertainties of tariffs, with the uncertainties of the demand picture on the horizon, because there is all of this worry, this narrative that things slow down a bit. So, I'm not surprised that the level of investment spending is weak in this report, Jon, particularly after we've seen animal spirits these last two years, spending has been up.HILSENRATH: Well, there are three things going on in the business investment side we have -- we have to look at. One is you mentioned structure is down, structures has been very strong because there's been a lot of investment going on in oil and gas rates as oil prices came up. They've stabilized so maybe that spurred a growth that we've gotten that's also stabilized.The other thing you just mentioned, you know, with tariffs coming on, a lot of companies are talking about slowing their investment plans because they're just so uncertain about what the trade landscape is going to look like. And then the third piece is tax cuts. You know, the Trump administration, Republicans in Congress cut taxes, corporate tax rates very aggressively to try to spur business investment. But it looks like this tariff uncertainty is taking away some of the boom that they were hoping to get on the business investment side.You know, again, if these growth rates are going to be sustainable, it's going to have to show up in business investment, and I'd say, the soft number there has got to be a little disappointing today.PEEK: I would say politically, too, that's a problem, because Democrats have really made the case that the tax cuts for corporations are really just going into stock buybacks, they're not going to have any impact on workers, and we need investment to get productivity up, so that wages will go up, so I do think it's a disappointing number. And probably is a result of the uncertainty.BLOCK: You know, Jon, the other day, you know, we're starting to hear some noises about the yield curve, there were some comments a few weeks ago saying, well, it's kind of a relief. It was even in the minutes as well that with rates backing up and along the curve may be there's not so much risk of inversion. We see what the 10-year is doing now. Look, my call was actually -- we're going to see the 10-year back below three. You can write that down, I'm saying it right now. Are we going to get the Fed more concerned now about the possibility of inversion and what that can mean? Do they care about that?BARTIROMO: And let's point out this op-ed in The Journal today written by Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari titled "Pause Interest Rate Hikes to Help the Labor Force Grow." Kashkari writes, "With the Fed funds rate at two to 2-1/4 percent, monetary policy is now close to neutral, neither stimulating nor restricting the economy. Prematurely tapping the brakes could restrain wage growth and keep many Americans from participating in the economic recovery." You expect the 10-year to go back down below three percent. Is it partly because you think that they are going to see a pause in the rate hikes?BLOCK: I think we're going to see a slowdown and I think we are going to see that happen. And, you know, look, I'm going to say it right now, I think next year, I think two hikes max.BARTIROMO: Two hikes max.BLOCK: That's where I am right now. I've been there.BARTIROMO: They're at three hikes for next year, Jon, isn't that right?HILSENRATH: Yes. And it all comes down to the inflation numbers. The -- you know, you're talking about the yield curve and long-term interest rates, and I think long-term interest rates are a signal of how concerned the long-term investors are in the outlook for inflation. And if the inflation numbers come -- continue to come in in soft, and it sounds like they were soft in this number, then I think the Fed has going to have to think about maybe slowing down the pace of rate increases. You know, I just wanted to ask you all, we've talked about a lot of different components if this, if anyone has the government spending numbers, I'd love to know what they are, because they -- military spending is a really big impact on growth right now, there's a lot -- there's a lot of --BARTIROMO: Yes, here it is. We got it, Jon.MCDOWELL: Government expenditures were up at 3.3 percent annual rate, and the third-quarter defense spending rising in an annual rate of 4.6 percent, Jon.HILSENRATH: Yes. Yes, that's a big driver, and that one is going to continue. So, the two things I think we have driving economic growth right now are consumers and government, ironically.BLOCK: You know, the last time we didn't mention explicitly here is that exports were down 3.5 percent in Q3 and imports rose at 9.1 percent. It just plays into this whole rising deficit thing. Look, I don't think the bottom market cares but it's part of it.MCDOWELL: But we -- but we would know that watching these trade deficit numbers coming in, in the third quarter, Jon, that the trade deficit has widened throughout the third quarter. Again, there were some pull forward in the second quarter where you had, say, soybeans exporters really pushing inventory overseas ahead of those tariffs between the United States and China that went into place over the summer, so, again, that reversed course and showed up in this GDP figure.HILSENRATH: That's exactly right, Dagen, you have to look at what happened with trade in the second and third quarter combined, there was a lot of anticipatory reaction in the second quarter, particularly in agricultural goods, and that looks like it reversed. But, you know, with the tariffs that we have going on, we have to think about trade being a potential drag for the economy -- for the global economy in the months ahead.BARTIROMO: Yes. And that's what we were -- we're also expecting companies to start pulling back as we have seen in this report, because of the uncertainty of it. You know, what will the impact of these tariffs be in this quarter and into 2019? That's one reason that you --PEEK: That's a little ironic, right? I mean, basically, under Obama, the uncertainty all had to do with regulation and changes that the business community faced day-to-day, now it is so unfortunate that we have that deregulatory cloud sort of lifting, but in its place, we have uncertainty about the tariff policies.MCDOWELL: Well, we switched -- we switched from one form of government swappiness to another.PEEK: Yes, that's true.MCDOWELL: That it's government intervention in business, where if you use steel in this country, you have to go to the Commerce Department hat in hand and beg for waivers.PEEK: That's right.MCDOWELL: There have been thousands of waivers.BLOCK: And there is a huge backlog at the Commerce Department right now for these applications for waivers.MCDOWELL: That's right.HILSENRATH: So, there is a lot of red tape on the trade front.BARTIROMO: Yes, all right, Jon, we leave it there. Great to see you this morning, Jon, thanks so much.HILSENRATH: Great. Thanks a lot.BARTIROMO: Great analysis, as always, from Jon Hilsenrath from The Wall Street Journal. Once again, the GDP is out, this is the first reading of the third quarter, it came in better-than-expected, up 3.5 percent versus an estimate of 3.3 percent.Coming up next, Microsoft on track to pass Amazon in market cap after earnings. We will tell you where that market cap stands. We break down the latest numbers right after this.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We told you the breaking news earlier. The GDP out moments ago. The economy grew at a -- at a rate of 3-1/2 percent in the third quarter. This is the first take on the third quarter. GDP is better than the expectation which calls for 3.3 percent.Futures came off of their lows, then, went back down again. We're still looking at a decline at the start of trading, although, we are off of the lows. Dow Industrials down 160 points, NASDAQ down 116."VARNEY & COMPANY" host, Stuart Varney weighs in. And Stu, what I think is really a good takeaway is the fact that the consumer part of this report --STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes.BARTIROMO: -- consumer spending up four percent, Stu.VARNEY: Yes, the -- what is it? Consumption, that's the proper (INAUDIBLE)BARTIROMO: That's right.VARNEY: Consumption of, what, four percent. Now, that's a big number. That is a very bright spot in this report. You know, Maria, I was the party pooper about the Mega Million jackpot.BARTIROMO: I know you are.VARNEY: Well, I'm not -- I thought I might be the party pooper over GDP because I was really hoping for a four percent number as growth in that quarter. OK, so, we got 3-1/2 percent. I still think that's pretty good. I'm a little disappointed because I was looking for four and more, because that's what we've been promised if we get the tax cut. But, look, I'll take 3.5 percent, especially coming on the back of a 4.2 percent growth rate in the second quarter. That's the best back-to-back quarter performance that we've seen in four years.BARTIROMO: Yes.VARNEY: So, the trend is still very strong and if we keep this up, we're going to have a much better than three percent gain for the full calendar year, 2018. I'll take it, Maria.BARTIROMO: Yes, I'll take it. And let's not forget that the second quarter that you just mentioned, 4.3 percent, no revision there, Stu.VARNEY: Right.BARTIROMO: Right? So, we still got the 4.2 percent in the second quarter and now, 3-1/2 percent for the third quarter. I know you're going to dig deep into these numbers in about 10 minutes. We will see you top of the hour.VARNEY: You got it, Maria. Thank you.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Stu. "VARNEY & COMPANY" begins top of the hour, 9:00 Eastern right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Join Stuart and his great team there.First, though, Microsoft makes a move, the technology giant now on track to pass Amazon's market cap. We've got those numbers. Microsoft's shares today down two percent, Amazon down eight percent. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We have breaking news right now. An 11th suspicious package has been found. This one from an Opa-locka, Florida facility. The FBI is confirming that this package was addressed to New Jersey Senator, Cory Booker. This is an 11th package coming out of the Florida facility and we are following that and other things this morning. We'll bring you the latest there.Meanwhile, we want to look at market, we've got technology earnings have been leading this market sell-off, disappointing revenue numbers last night from a number of high-profile companies.Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange right now with those details. Nic, good morning to you.NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Hey, good morning, Maria. So, we're off of the lows of the morning on that better-than-expected GDP number. But we're looking at Amazon which had that revenue miss and the guidance on revenue, obviously, less than expected. So, some concerns potentially about the holiday season, that's one thing, but the other areas, such as cloud and advertising units continue to grow, have been the area of growth. And you've had a mixed bag, some analysts actually raising their target, some pulling back, and some that are raising still like the long-term growth story on Amazon. And those FANG stocks are up 37 percent annually over the last -- since 2014.By the way, as Amazon pulls back, we might see Microsoft move higher in that closer to the trillion-dollar market. Remember when Apple crossed it, didn't close there, but Microsoft now may be getting closer, may surpass Amazon today with Amazon sell-offs. So, we'll watch for the market cap battle.And then, there's Alphabet, Google. The one area that people were concerned about is people are looking to Amazon to search for products instead of Google. So, we've seen, obviously, they've had surging profit with the slower sales growth. Back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Nic. Thank you so much. And of course, it's been an incredibly volatile and busy week for stocks. We had a really busy week on this program as well. Take a look at some of the top moments with the program.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: (INAUDIBLE) business with the Pentagon. Amazon wants it, too, but Google walks away from the business with the DOD, and yet, they are all-in on going into China.LARRY ELLISON, CO-FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, ORACLE: I hear Jeff Bezos and I absolutely agree. I think U.S. tech companies who say we will not -- we will not support the U.S. military. You know, we will not -- we will not work on any technology that helps our military. But yet, goes into China and facilitates the Chinese government, surveilling their people, is pretty shocking.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is Larry.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey, the Oracle of Oracle. What a pleasure. Nice to see you.BARTIROMO: Tony Stark, I -- did you influence that character?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I've heard that. I didn't know Stanley is (INAUDIBLE) so I guess -- I guess Tony Stark was invented before (INAUDIBLE) so, I guess no.KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO PRESIDENT TRUMP: Part of why the President would like to continue cut tax with the middle class is because it has gone so well. He sees the fruits of that tax cut and jobs act which passed last December without a single Democratic vote.BARTIROMO: This can't possibly happen before the midterms. The midterms are 13 days away and this has to be voted on and Congress is -- the House is not even in session.CONWAY: Well, Washington moves a little bit too slowly for the sheer volume and velocity of the Trump agenda.REP. CHUCK FLEISCHMANN (R), TENNESSEE: Obviously, it was so important to get tax reform passed. We got no help from the Democrats. That's actually very sad, and I think that's going to hurt them in the midterms.MARK PENN, FORMER ADVISOR TO THE CLINTONS: I've seen the biggest buildup and turnout to a midterm election that we've ever seen, which classically has fairly low turnout. And I think we've seen the blue wave become a blue edge, now, I think fairly it's a blue tossup.MERCEDES SCHLAPP, WHITE HOUSE SENIOR ADVISOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS: President Trump has been talking to the -- to Saudi Arabia, to the King, as well as to the Crown Prince. There's a continual dialogue there. Our eyes are wide-open when it comes to what we've seen to be this horrific tragedy.GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST: If he's found to have his fingers on this in any way, I think he is likely to be removed by his -- by his father.LT. COL.

We cannot continue to allow this to happen.BARTIROMO: The migrant caravan from Honduras has swelled to at least 7,000 people now as it makes its way north.KEANE: We've got to protect our borders, and we have got to protect our sovereignty.FLEISCHMANN: We're seeing by virtue of this caravan right now just how chaotic and really anarchistic the border situation has become.BARTIROMO: Violence and intimidation now on both sides of the aisle.REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER: Individual through a great big boulder through -- entered the office and another person entered as well, and they stole equipment. The one thing about America we believe in civil discourse. I mean, you could -- you could agree -- disagree with someone and not be disagreeable, but then now it's in your face.WEST: We should not be politicizing political terrorism or violence such as this. And I would say to those people that are seeking to do so, you know, this is a crazy unhinged individual, this is not acceptable.BARTIROMO: Impact of Iran sanctions within two weeks, your view.STEPHEN SCHORK, PUBLISHER, THE SCHORK REPORT: We've had five months to digest this Iranian news. This Iranian news is already priced into the market. The market has shown us over the summer that it's capable of handling the current situation.SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria. I didn't win the Mega Millions this morning, so here I am joining you from (INAUDIBLE) from New York.JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I haven't checked my numbers yet, but since I didn't buy a ticket, I'm probably not going to win, that's my guess.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Hi, welcome back.

Crude oil's sharp slide is set to trigger some heavy selling in the energy space. The arrest of the chief financial office of Huawei Technologies, Meng Wanzhou in Canada, has sparked worries that trade tensions between the U.S. and China may not get resolved anytime soon. She faces extradition to the United States. Canadian Justice Department spokesman Ian McLeod, Huawei CFO was apprehended in Vancouver on December 1 and that a bail hearing has been set for Friday. The Chinese Embassy in Canada has stated "the Chinese side firmly opposes and strongly protests over such kind of actions which seriously harmed the human rights of the victim. The Chinese side has lodged stern representations with the US and Canadian side, and urged them to immediately correct the wrongdoing and restore the personal freedom of Ms. Meng Wanzhou." Chinese officials are demanding the release of the arrested official. Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters Thursday that the Chinese government also wants Canadian officials to reveal the reasoning behind Meng Wanzhou's arrest Saturday. The market will also react to some key economic data from the U.S. and a report on Canadian imports. Data on Canadian imports for the month of October, is due at 8:30 AM ET. On Wednesday, the benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index ended up 119.05 points, or 0.79%, at 15,182.64. The index scaled a low of 15,122.62 and a high of 15,253.77 in the session. Bombardier (BBD.B.TO) announced that it is targeting revenues of $18 billion or more, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately 10% over 2018 guidance. EBITDA before special items is targeted to grow by approximately 30% over 2018 guidance to a range of $1.65 billion to $1.80 billion. On a normalized basis, before one-time items, Bombardier estimates free cash flow in a range of $250 million to $500 million for 2019. ATS Automation Tooling Systems Inc. (ATA.TO) has announced that it has acquired substantially all of the intellectual property assets of Transformix Engineering Inc. for a total consideration of $10 million. Canadian Western Bank (CWB.TO) has announced that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per common share. This quarterly dividend is consistent with the prior quarter and 8% higher than the dividend declared one year ago. Dollarama Inc. (DOL.TO) reported that its diluted net earnings per common share rose 7.9% to $0.41 in the third quarter of its current financial year, over the year-ago quarter. Canopy Growth Corporation (WEED.TO) said that the company has finalized an all-cash transaction to acquire Storz & Bickel GmbH & Co. KG, related entities, and IP (collectively, "Storz & Bickel" or "S&B") for a purchase price of up to approximately €145 million. Storz & Bickel is widely recognized as the global leader in vaporizer design and manufacturing. Asian markets tumbled on Thursday and most of the markets in Europe were drifting lower as well, with the arrest of a senior Huawei executive over potential violation of U.S. sanctions on Iran raising questions about the Trump administration's overall China strategy.  Among other factors to weigh on sentiment were the sharp drop in U.S. 10-year Treasury yields, Brexit uncertainty and caution ahead of the crucial OPEC meet. In economic news from Europe, Germany's manufacturing orders increased for a third straight month in October, defying expectations for a decline, preliminary data showed. Factory orders grew 0.3 percent from September, while economists had forecast a 0.4% fall. September's 0.3% gain was revised to a 0.1% increase. The ADP payrolls data is due at 8:15 AM ET and the weekly jobless claims report is due out at 8:30 AM ET. ISM services activity report is due for release at 10 AM ET. In commodities, crude oil futures for January delivery were down $2.20, or 4.1%, at 50.69 a barrel, after Saudi Arabia proposed a smaller than expected reduction in crude production. Natural gas futures for January were declining by $0.082, or 1.82%, at $4.387 per million btu. Gold futures for February were down $0.85, or 0.07%, at $1,241.75 an ounce. Silver futures for March were lower by $0.144, or 0.99%, at $14.438 an ounce,  while Copper futures were down $0.055, or 1.95%, at $2.720 per pound.        Load-Date: December 6, 2018End of Document

Espionage case: Huawei's links and investments in ChileCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 8, 2018 SaturdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 526 wordsBody Huawei is to the telecommunications industry what China is to the world. It is a technological and telecommunications company that is present throughout the world, with modern equipment and a deployment of infrastructure, networks and terminals that go beyond cellular, but includes transmission towers and underwater optical fibers. It has 15% of the global market in cellular production, which dethroned Apple and is only surpassed by Samsung.  These days, Huawei has been in the eye of the hurricane after Meng Wanzhou, the financial director and daughter of the company's founder, was arrested in Canada, with a request for extradition from the US. The latter country is investigating the Asian company for a possible violation of sanctions against Iran.  The Chinese company has been targeted for security reasons in several countries, such as the US, New Zealand and Australia, because they fear that Beijing will force the company to reveal industrial secrets and other confidential information that could put security at risk. national. In addition, they suspect that the Chinese government can gain access to fifth generation (5G) mobile networks through Huawei and expand its espionage capacity. Japan announced that it will exclude it from public tenders. Canada, Germany and South Korea have put the firm under evaluation.  Huawei defended its independence, denied the accusations and insisted that it is a private company.  The influence of Huawei in the telecommunications industry in Chile in the last decade has been meteoric. As in the rest of the world, their smart phones are one of the three best sellers.  At the network level, VTR, WOM, Movistar, Entel and Claro work with the Chinese company and have contracts. Of course, Claro and VTR point out that this occurs in photonic networks or fixed internet services. In the mobile world, companies have Huawei as an important provider, but not the only one, given that they also work with other multinationals, such as Ericsson.  Different sources of the industry indicate that the Chinese firm is a contributor to Novator, the international fund owner of WOM. The latter company indicates that "Huawei is an important provider in the development of our network infrastructure (...) and as such has no participation in any part of our structure."  Huawei's business at the local level is not only selling cell phones or lending networks to mobile operators - an area where he has made a high effort in marketing and advertising, with the face of Alexis Sánchez - but they are also working on electrical transmission together with another company in the north of the country, say market sources.  Associated with the local firm CTR, the government tender was awarded, which subsidizes the construction of the austral fiber optic with US $ 100 million. But his most ambitious project would be to connect Chile and China through a fiber optic marine cable. To seek support, Huawei CEO Dou Yong had a meeting over three months ago on the subject with Interior Minister Andrés Chadwick.  The entry Espionage case: the links and investments of Huawei in Chile was first published in La Tercera. Load-Date: December 8, 2018End of Document

Google doesn't care about morals or freedomThe Daily Campus: University of ConnecticutDecember 5, 2018 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: OPINION; Pg. 1Length: 674 wordsByline: Peter FenteanyBodyFILE - This March 23, 2010, file photo shows the Google logo at the Google headquarters in Brussels. Google said Thursday, Nov. 22, 2018 it's expanding stricter political advertising requirements to the European Union as part of efforts to curb misinformation and increase transparency ahead of the bloc's elections next year. (AP Photo/Virginia Mayo, File)Sentiments against Google's controversial Project Dragonfly have been growing, as just this past week employees of the company have come out with an open letter demanding the project be halted. For those not in the know, Project Dragonfly is an attempt by the search engine giant to gain a foothold in the closed-off Chinese market. Google wants to provide a censored search engine, one that cooperates with the Chinese government to disallow sensitive sources or topics from appearing on searches.Hundreds of Google employees have joined human rights groups like Amnesty International, international lawmakers, and people with common sense in opposing the project. As a counterpoint, many in China itself approve of such a change. Currently, China's big search engine (and the second largest in the world) is Baidu, but its results are often criticized for being inaccurate and commercialized. Those in favor of Google coming to China have hope that it will bring at least marginal improvements, even if it still must censor results.And indeed, this is what proponents of Project Dragonfly (including Google) choose to believe. Having a company with western values and ties is better than completely separating the Chinese and western internets, even if there are still limits on what China allows. Of course, Google's product will not be perfect, but with the company's western standards and more global commitments, they will surely have to be better than the alternative.However, this viewpoint falls into the same trap that the entire Republican party has fallen into: it assumes companies are moral. Google is not moral. Google doesn't owe anything to America, China or the world beyond what will ensure it the largest profits.There is clear evidence of this behavior. When Google was just starting out, its corporate values included the simple phrase "Don't be evil." According to its creator, the phrase was chosen as something that, "once you put it in there, would be hard to take out." The motto was then part of their code of conduct for almost two decades until May 2018, when it was mysteriously removed. Of course, societal and company values are sure to change in 20 years' time, but not so much that not being evil is suddenly not a concern. Sure enough, Google has revoked that motto in action, too.The point is, Google is not going to be the western foothold in China that some may want it to be. The company would just as easily bend at the knee to China if it paid out more to shareholders. The scary thing is, with their movement forward of Project Dragonfly, that seems to be exactly the case. Google clearly thinks the profits they have to gain in China are more important than their previous values and the goodwill of the western world. The depressing part is that, for all of the complaints that Google employees and the public have for ventures like Project Dragonfly, it will still go through. As long as we prioritize profits over morality, companies like Google will make their decisions through that lens.By choosing to go forward with Project Dragonfly, Google also aligns itself with censorship as the way of the future. Sure, for now, the censored search engine is just for China, but there is nothing stopping Google from offering the same service to other regimes around the world, once it's developed. If the company thought freedom of speech would prevail, they could simply wait for the censors of the world to fail and disappear, but that is not the case. The most harrowing part of Project Dragonfly's news, then, is not what it spells for Google as a company or China as a country, it's what Google believes it means for freedom as a global value.Load-Date: December 5, 2018End of Document

Jim Cramer: Why the Market Did What It Did Today and What Can Happen TomorrowRealMoneyNovember 6, 2018 Tuesday 7:01 PM EDTCopyright 2018 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1198 wordsByline: Jim CramerHighlight: Now for those of you haven't voted, please go and do so and don't vote this stuff just invest in it!BodyScenarios. Election scenarios. I just wish there were easy ones. Today we are seeing many bets made on outcomes without all that much information. But let me interpret what the buyers and sellers are doing so you know why the market did what it did today and what can happen tomorrow.First, I see most buyers embracing the concept of gridlock from either the House going Democratic or both the House and Senate changing hands. What does gridlock stand for? It stands for a return to high growth because of what is expected to be a do nothing Congress that blocks anything President Trump wants.In a do nothing Congress we anniversary the tax cuts that pumped money into the system so that's gone. We get the president processing his tariff war against China. And we get the Fed raising rates once this year and three times next year.That scenario results in a dramatically slower economy that plays right into the hands of the highest growth stocks, namely the Amazons  , Alphabets  and the cloud and cyber security stocks as well as the non-cyclical semis like Broadcom  and Qualcomm  which are widely regarded to be plays on the secular growth of 5G.The Democrats have historically liked biotech and not liked big pharma. You could easily buy an ETF for biotech; I like the Spider S&P biotech ETF, the  . It will do the job. I could easily give you some individual biotechs but this is a group move and I am trying to catch not anything more than that.What doesn't work? I think the consumer fares not that well. We annualize the tax gift, there's nothing more coming, and we have rates and tariffs going up. There's been a tremendous rally in retail. That could come to a screeching halt. I'd be very careful there. I think that hedge funds would go long Amazon and go short all of the retailers except the discounters like a  or a Burlington  or a Dollar General  .How about if the Republicans keep both houses of Congress? You buy the defense stocks. Northrop Grumman  , Lockheed Martin  and Raytheon  all had OUTSTANDING quarters, among the best we have seen this year. What happened?The stocks got clocked because of fears that the Democrats would cut 2020 appropriations if they won either house. I expect a roaring bull market to be ignited if the GOP keeps its majority because the Democrats will no longer be able to block an even bigger defense budget in the out years.I would also unhesitatingly buy the stock of Boeing  even with a trade war waging because, again, I believe that the Chinese need Boeing more than Boeing needs the Chinese as one in every four Boeing planes goes to China because of insatiable demand because of how the middle class likes to travel so much.I know there are plenty of traders who think that if the Democrats take both houses they will somehow manage to stop Trump from going after China for its multitudinous trading transgressions. I think that the president is incredibly hard to stop and that the Democrats, even if they are in the majority, are not going to be able to say to the president that he can't do what he wants with trade. Many Republicans represent businesses that have been hurt by tariffs and it has meant nothing because you must remember it really isn't about trade anymore it is about regime change. The Trump containment policy, containing the Chinese to their own region of power, isn't going to change no matter what. That's wishful thinking.Which brings me back to why growth stocks may be the way to go because no matter what, under gridlock the president pushes China, Jay Powell knocks over the consumer and secular growth stocks prevail.I know there are whole other sectors that some are trying to make work. I see the industrials off all types going higher today. There isn't a scenario I know that includes their rallying. I do know, though, that as I predicted yesterday, oil is really rolling over and at this point that is a huge win for the industrials. There are investors who also feel that if the House and Senate stay Republican than the Chinese government, which may be betting on a weakened president, are going to have to come to the table and make deals.I don't know about that one. I think it is largely based on hope because as I have said, I do not think the president wants a trade deal. I think he wants the PRC to be a capitalist democratic country that plays fair and believes in human rights for minorities.That's a stretch because right now China is a communist dictatorship that plays unfair and does not believe in human rights for minorities. I don't think that a House and Senate Democratic or Republican sweep will effect that kind of change, to put it mildly and diplomatically.How about some winners no matter what? I like the health maintenance slash insurers because they always seem to win no matter what. My favorite is UnitedHealth  because it pulled out of the Obamacare exchanges and even if the Democrats try to revitalize them there are still losers for most of these insurers. A Democratic sweep and you can buy Humana  , CVS  - Aetna  , the former of which had a really good quarter, and Cigna  .I also like  no matter what because it is totally ingrained in the fabric of Washington and always wins.Pathetic but true.I wish there were more winners. But I keep coming back to the prospect that the president pushes the tariffs to 25% and the Fed pushes up rates four times to overshoot just to be sure we get a lot of layoffs so there's less inflation. They burn down the village to save it if strategy is a time-honored one and I think that Jay Powell right now seems to be tempted to try a little economic arson.One other thought. If we get gridlock there will be a belief that the economy will stall out immediately and you have to go buy utilities and higher yielding food and beverage companies. There I like  , Con Ed  and Dominion  as well as PepsiCo  , Procter & Gamble  and Clorox  , which had the best quarters of the consumer packaged good stocks.However, you need to be very careful because if Powell keeps raising, these will start falling again. They can't compete on a yield basis.One last thought. There may be a lot of money that's been waiting on the sidelines for this election to be finished. These are people who regard the darned thing as one big bad event to get through and in that case once it is over it's okay to buy pretty much anything. I would suggest that under that scenario you play in reverse. You take the stocks that I have said do well in a Democratic sweep or even a one-house win and you sell them and sell them hard. You can keep the Republican stocks but don't overstay your welcome because remember, the next big bad events are the G-20 talks at the end of the month where I think no deal will be reached and then the next Fed meeting where we will get a hike and a firm autopilot statement that the punch bowl must be smashed to smithereens.There you have it.

Companies want out of the 5G network to HuaweiCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 17, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 685 wordsBody US politicians and corporate bosses are using the fury surrounding Huawei to keep the Chinese company out of the lucrative 5G market in the United States, even when doing so could cost companies billions of dollars.  Last week, Meng Wanzhou, the finance director of Huawei and daughter of the founder of the telecommunications equipment manufacturer, was arrested in Canada, and accused of violating US sanctions on Iran. The telecommunications company insisted that it complies with US sanctions laws.  In the days following his arrest, executives and politicians in the US asked the government to keep Chinese companies out of sensitive industries, such as the telecommunications sector, and to pressure their allies to do the same.  Last week, Randall Stephenson, chief executive of AT & T, said at a conference in Washington that US companies are concerned about the number of supply chains that come from China, both for reasons of competition and security.  "Security is going to be everything," said the AT & T executive. "Is all our silicon made in the US? However, guess what, all the software associated with the equipment that enters these networks, is developed, where ?, in China, "said Randall Stephenson.  He added that "it is essential in this sector to establish leadership because if we do not, supply chains will deteriorate and, by default, China will have the leadership position in the 5G network."  After testing the technology in some areas, the largest telecommunications companies expect to release the fastest 5G wireless internet capabilities in the US next year.  Most do it without using the hardware made by Huawei, despite the fact that the company of Chinese origin charges much less than its international competitors. Analysts say that if you use the technology of the Chinese company, the big networks could not sell to the government, from the US, to take into account the concerns of long ago in Washington that this Chinese company could provide sensitive information to Beijing.  m {233089}  "Big companies cost billions of dollars more to not use Huawei," said an industry lobbyist. "But larger companies will not risk using it because otherwise they could not sell to the government."  This situation limits Huawei in the US to sell equipment to a group of small regional networks, which are unlikely to obtain government contracts. Although it does not break down its results by country, Huawei obtained 6.5% of its revenues in the Americas in 2017.  In an action that could further limit the ability of the Chinese company to operate in the US, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) proposed a new rule to prohibit companies that pose a risk to the company. national security, obtain public financing to help develop 5G equipment. Huawei called the proposal arbitrary and capricious.  Some people urge the government to go further. In a speech, Mark Warner, vice president of the Senate intelligence committee, called on the US government to strengthen cybersecurity.  "China's doctrine of cyber sovereignty is the idea that a state has the full right to control information within its borders," warned Warner.  "This takes the form of censorship, disinformation and social control, such as China's social capital system. It also takes the form of traditional exploitation of the computer network, "he added. Meanwhile, the US pressures its allies to take an equally tough stance against Huawei, withsome success Last week, BT, the British company, said it would eliminate Huawei's equipment from its 4G core network in two years.  However, Stephenson said the Trump administration should do more. For example, use future trade negotiations as an advantage.  "No one uses ... Huawei," he said, referring to the large US telecommunications companies. "However, Huawei is widely used in Europe, Asian countries that are not China, in Latin America, in Canada." "Our allies have to align with us in this ... he asked me why we ever made a commercial agreement in which we did not have this type of provisions incorporated into the commercial treaty."  m {233076} Load-Date: December 17, 2018End of Document

The Nikkei average climbed 224.62 points or 1.02 percent to 22,177.02 points, marking the highest level since Nov. 12. The broader Topix index closed 0.58 percent higher at 1,653.66. Index heavyweight Fast Retailing soared 3.6 percent, Fanuc advanced 1.4 percent and SoftBank added 1 percent. A cheaper yen helped lift exporters, with Canon, Panasonic and Sony rising 1-2 percent.  Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma jumped 18.3 percent to reach its highest level since 1990 after the drugmaker said it had resolved all the disputes underlying its patent infringement lawsuit for its depression drug Latuda. Chat app operator Line Corp climbed 2.7 percent to extend Tuesday's rally after it teamed up with Tencent Holdings to offer mobile payment services. Australian markets ended little changed as commodity prices fell broadly on concerns about a slowdown in Chinese demand. The S&P/ASX 200 index ended down 3.20 points at 5,725.10 after rising 1 percent in the previous session. The broader All Ordinaries index also closed marginally lower at 5,800.10. Mining heavyweights BHP and Rio Tinto fell 1-2 percent as Chinese iron ore futures hovered near a four-month low. Gold miners Evolution and Newcrest fell 1 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively after gold prices dipped overnight.  The big four banks ended little changed while wealth manager AMP tumbled 3.3 percent after saying it plans to accelerate its compensation program for customer charged fees for no service. Construction material supplier CSR jumped over 2 percent after announcing the sale of its troubled Viridian Glass business for A$155 million. In economic releases, the total value of construction work done in Australia dropped a seasonally adjusted 2.8 percent sequentially in the third quarter of 2018, a government report showed. That missed expectations for an increase of 1.0 percent. Seoul shares rose as foreign investors lapped up tech shares ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting later this week. The benchmark Kospi gained 8.80 points or 0.42 percent to close at 2,108.22. New Zealand shares advanced, with the benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index finishing up 40.14 points or 0.46 percent at 8,713.96 after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand said it would ease mortgage lending restrictions at the start of next year.  Overnight, U.S. stocks eked out modest gains after reports that the Trump administration has restarted talks with the Chinese government "at all levels". The Dow rose 0.4 percent and the S&P 500 gained 0.3 percent while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite finished marginally higher.        Load-Date: November 28, 2018End of Document

NIO Reveals New Electric Vehicle: 'A Competitive Product In A Premium Segment'Benzinga.comDecember 17, 2018 Monday 6:38 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Accretive Capital LLC d/b/a Benzinga All Rights ReservedLength: 600 wordsByline: Dave RoyseBodyBruno Mars helped Chinese electric car maker Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE: NIO) with the reveal of its second electric vehicle in Shanghai over the wekeend. For now, Mars can t sing about taking a NIO for a ride to Harlem, Hollywood or Jackson, Mississippi   it s not available in the United States   but the company, seen as a rival to Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), is pumping out cars and building EV infrastructure in China that's impressing industry watchers.A More Affordable EVCEO William Li introduced the new all-electric SUV, the five-seat ES6, at a show attended by more than 10,000 people. The vehicle resembles the company s larger first offering, the ES8, but is more affordable, priced around $52,000 before government subsidies. That s about $14,000 less than the ES8. A performance version of the ES6 will sell for $58,000. Deliveries start in June.NIO, which went public earlier this year, also announced a battery upgrade plan for the larger ES8 that will allow drivers to swap their 70-kWH battery pack for a more powerful 84-kWH pack. ES6 buyers will have the option of either battery pack, giving the vehicle a range of just over 250 miles with the low-storage option and about 315 miles with the more powerful battery.BofA Stays Neutral The new EV beat expectations in price and driving range, Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Ming Hsun Lee said in a Monday note. We see the ES6 as a competitive product in the premium segment,  the analyst said. BofA maintained a Neutral rating on NIO with an $8 price target.The stance is based on the following factors, Hsun Lee said: • An expectation of continued negative free cash flow through 2021.• An "unproven track record when facing more competition," in light of peer luxury brands localizing Chinese manufacturing of EVs beginning in 2020 and 2021. • A valuation that already factors in high sales growth in the next two years. • Another potential challenge for NIO comes in the form of American cars, as the Chinese government recently announced the lowering of tariffs on American vehicles from 40 percent to 25 percent for three months beginning Jan. 1, the analyst said. NIO's Growing Electric Infrastructure NIO is one of the few electric car companies in China that has actually delivered cars   nearly 10,000 so far.For those watching the EV market, NIO's update on its battery infrastructure is perhaps just as interesting as the ES6's rollout.NIO said it now has 26  NIO Houses and experience stores  where drivers can swap out a battery for a fully charged one. And more are coming. In 2019, NIO plans to open even more locations, set to total 70 by the end of the year,  the company said in a press release.  In addition to the existing battery swap stations along the G4 Expressway, NIO will set up even more stations along certain expressways in 2019 to meet user demand. The company also highlighted its growing network of service centers across China, which it says will number more than 300 sometime next year.The ES6 will have a virtual assistant, Nomi, that can respond to voice commands for controlling the radio and answering certain questions. It also releases a scent when drivers are tired to help perk them up.NIO shares were down more than 7 percent at $7.15 at the time of publication Monday. Related Articles:Nio On Roller Coaster Since IPO Bernstein Out Bearish On EV Startup NIOLatest Ratings for NIODateFirmActionFromToSep 2018BernsteinInitiates Coverage OnUnderperformView More Analyst Ratings for NIO           View the Latest Analyst Ratings© 2018 Benzinga.com.

Huawei seeks clarification after New Zealand rejects 5G bidStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeNovember 29, 2018 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: HI-TECH; Pg. 1Length: 404 wordsByline: Sandy MccarthyBodyHowever, the Government is confident relations with China won't be affected by the spy agency's decision to ban Spark from working with Huawei to build a new 5G network.Andrew Hampton, the director general of New Zealand's Government Communications Security Bureau , confirmed its decision in a statement, saying: "I have informed Spark that a significant network security risk was identified", said Andrew Hampton, the director general of GCSB. In February Huawei announced it would spend £3bn in the United Kingdom over the next five years.Spark is disappointed by the GCSB's decision to block the company from working with a Chinese communications company over security concerns.Huawei's Bowater said he denied there was any evidence of wrongdoing by Huawei."As the GCSB has noted, this is an ongoing process", the company said in a statement.The development comes days after Washington's mission to discourage its allies from using Huawei's equipment was revealed by the Wall Street Journal.Fans praise for Ronaldo after reaching 100 Champions League winsJuventus edged out Valencia 1-0 to sail through to the round of 16 of the 2018-19 UEFA Champions League . A truly magnificent achievement for one of the greatest players to ever play the attractive game."Under TICSA [The Telecommunications Interception Capability & Security Act], this means Spark can not implement or give effect to its proposal to use Huawei RAN equipment in its planned 5G network". The Chinese government publicly objected to the Australian move.Spark, the country's largest telecommunications company, said on Wednesday that government officials warned it that using 5G equipment from Chinese firm Huawei "would, if implemented, raise significant national security risks". According to the GCSB, telecoms infrastructure is a "highly attractive target for states seeking to engage in espionage, sabotage, or foreign interference, or for criminal actors looking to exploitNew Zealand businesses and individuals".Spark was on Thursday still awaiting a full debriefing from the GCSB. It has not yet been able to review the agency's reasoning for blocking the use of Huawei's equipment."We strongly reject the notion that our business threatensNew Zealand in any way".Huawei said in a statement that it will "actively address any concerns and work together to find a way forward", adding it has signed more than 20 5G contracts with carriers worldwide.Load-Date: November 29, 2018End of Document

Stocks Extend Sell-Off Amid Several Negative Catalysts - U.S. CommentaryCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 20, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1056 wordsBody       Extending the sell-off seen in recent sessions, stocks moved sharply lower over the course of the trading session on Thursday after showing a lack of direction early in the day. With the steep drops, the major averages once again tumbled to their lowest levels in over a year. The major averages ended the day firmly in the red but off their lows of the session. The Dow plummeted 464.06 points or 2 percent to 22,859.60, the Nasdaq tumbled 108.42 points or 1.6 percent to 6,528.41 and the S&P 500 slumped 39.54 points or 1.6 percent to 2,467.42. The continued weakness on Wall Street reflected several negative catalysts, including the increased risk of a partial government shutdown. President Donald Trump told House Republicans he is unwilling to sign a short-term spending bill approved by the Senate due to a lack of funding for his controversial border wall. "The president informed us he will not sign the bill that came from the Senate last evening because of his legitimate concerns for border security," House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said after a meeting with Trump. The Senate bill passed by a voice vote Wednesday night would fund key government agencies through February 8th but pushes a debate over funding for the border wall into the next Congress. Trump's apparent unwillingness to sign the Senate bill comes as lawmakers face a December 21st deadline to fund key government agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department and the Interior Department. Renewed concerns about U.S.-China trade talks also weighed on the markets after the Justice Department announced the criminal indictment of two computer hackers associated with the Chinese government. The unsealed indictment charges the two Chinese nationals with conspiracy to commit computer intrusions, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and aggravated identity theft. The defendants, identified as Zhu Hua and Zhang Shilong, are accused of conducting global campaigns of computer intrusions targeting, among other data, intellectual property and confidential business and technological information at managed service providers. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said Zhu and Zhang allegedly committed their crimes in association with a Chinese intelligence service known as the Ministry of State Security. Traders also continued to digest Wednesday's rate hike by the Federal Reserve as well as the less dovish than hoped accompanying statement. Raising concerns among some investors, the Fed indicated it plans to continue to raising interest rates despite signs of slowing economic growth. Disappointing economic data has added to concerns about the Fed's plans, with a Labor Department report showing initial jobless claims rebounded in the week ended December 15th. The report said initial jobless claims rose to 214,000, an increase of 8,000 from the previous week's unrevised level of 206,000. Economists had expected jobless claims to climb to 216,000. A separate report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve said manufacturing activity in the Philadelphia region continued to grow but remained subdued in the month of December. The report said the diffusion index for current general activity dropped to 9.4 in December after tumbling to 12.9 in November. While a positive reading still indicates growth in regional manufacturing activity, economists had expected the index to rise to 15.0. Meanwhile, the Conference Board released a report shortly after the start of trading showing an unexpected increase in leading U.S. economic indicators in the month of November. The Conference Board said its leading economic index rose by 0.2 percent in November after falling by a revised 0.3 percent in October. Economists had expected the index to come in unchanged compared to the 0.1 percent uptick originally reported for the previous month. "The LEI increased slightly in November, but its overall pace of improvement has slowed in the last two months," said Ataman Ozyildirim, Director of Economic Research at the Conference Board.  He added, "Solid GDP growth at about 2.8 percent should continue in early 2019, but the LEI suggests the economy is likely to moderate further in the second half of 2019." Sector News Energy stocks showed a substantial move to the downside on the day amid a sharp pullback by the price of crude oil. After jumping $1.57 to $48.17 a barrel on Wednesday, crude for February delivery plunged $2.29 to a seventeen-month closing low of $45.88 a barrel. Reflecting the weakness in the energy sector, the Philadelphia Oil Service Index plummeted by 4.9 percent, while the NYSE Arca Natural Gas Index and the NYSE Arca Oil Index tumbled by 2.8 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively. Substantial weakness also emerged among retail stocks, as reflected by the 2.4 nosedive by the Dow Jones Retail Index. The index slumped to its lowest closing level in eight months. Biotechnology, software, commercial real estate and chemical stocks also saw considerable weakness amid another broad-based sell-off on Wall Street. Meanwhile, gold stocks were among the few groups to buck the downtrend, with the NYSE Arca Gold Bugs Index spiking by 5 percent after plunging by 5.8 percent in the previous session. The rebound by gold stocks came as gold for February delivery surged up $11.50 to $1,267.90 an ounce after coming under pressure in electronic trading on Wednesday. Other Markets In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved mostly lower during trading on Thursday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index plunged by 2.8 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index dropped by 0.9 percent. The major European markets also moved to the downside on the day. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index slid by 0.8 percent, the German DAX Index and the French CAC 40 Index tumbled by 1.4 percent and 1.8 percent, respectively. In the bond market, treasuries moved modestly lower over the course of the session after seeing recent strength. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, inched up by 1.1 basis points to 2.789 percent. Looking Ahead Trading on Friday may be impacted by key economic data, including a final reading on third quarter GDP as well as reports on durable goods orders, personal income and spending, and consumer sentiment.        Load-Date: December 20, 2018End of Document

It all seems to have started in August when a Russian Instagram user posted an image of herself falling out of a private jet. The trend has since arrived to Chinese social media, where it s dubbed a more self-explanatory  wealth-flaunting challenge  (as spotted by Abacus).Since the meme is essentially materialistic, it was ripe for co-opting by tech companies, pet food companies, and the government alike, all for self-promotion and marketing. All types of brands are using it to show off their wares. Xiaomi, for example, posted an image taken on the Mi Mix 2S of an employee clutching what appears to be the company s unreleased flagship, the Mi Mix 3, while surrounded by other noteworthy phones.Not to be outdone, DJI made an Instagram video set to Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg s  The Next Episode,  where a guy strolls over with a luggage full of drones, trips and falls. This is my personal favorite because there s actually a narrative to the whole thing.     View this post on Instagram         The DJI guy accidentally fell, who wants to come over and clean up? #dji #drone #dronephotography #fallingstars #fallingstarschallenge #fallingstars2018A post shared by ValueQ (@valueq_global) on Oct 15, 2018 at 11:17pm PDTThe Chinese government also got in on the action in classic  How do you do, fellow kids?  fashion, with security guards, police, and bureaucrats all participating in their own versions. Some of the police that got involved from the Luanchuan Forest Public Security Bureau in northern China posed next to an alarming number of guns.Yet, as is the case with many viral memes, not everything turned out to be fun and games. Two women in China who posed as falling out of their car with Gucci bags and makeup were later found by police and fined for disturbing traffic. A couple in Shanghai was fined for parking their luxury car the wrong direction while in the midst of taking one for the  gram. In both instances though, the fines were no more than 150 RMB or $21.65, a mere slap on the wrist for anyone wealthy enough to participate.See Campaign:https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18001450/weibo-wechat-falling-stars-challenge-meme-china-wealth-flaunting-xiaomi-pubgContact Information:Shannon LiaoTags:,            Wire,            Artificial Intelligence Newswire,            United States,            EnglishLoad-Date: October 24, 2018End of Document

In the third quarter, net revenues for our online games stood above RMB10 billion for the second consecutive quarter, supported by a game portfolio that is more diversified than ever before. While the performances from our flagship titles remain remarkably steady, we are innovators at our core. NetEase is one of the very few companies that has consistently created distinct new game IP for both PC-client and mobile platforms. Over the last few months, we rolled out several more hit games including Justice, Ancient Nocturne and Night Falls: Survival. Additionally, we have taken a more global view of our online games business. As a result, our international expansion, took another leap forward this quarter, contributing more than 10% of total online game net revenues for the first time in our company s history. We are also very excited about our collaboration with Blizzard to bring one of their biggest games to mobile players, increasing our visibility and expanding our foothold in the global online games market. Our e-commerce business grew 67.2% year-over-year in the third quarter, well outpacing the industry average. While we continue to grow this business, we are maintaining a disciplined approach to spending. In addition to e-commerce, we believe there is tremendous value in many of our incubated business initiatives that are yet to be fully realized. We are particularly pleased to have completed the latest round of financing in NetEase Cloud Music. We believe this financing underscores the value of our proprietary platform, and with this partnership in place we are ready to take the business to the next level,  concluded Mr. Ding.Third Quarter 2018 Financial ResultsNetRevenuesNet revenues for the third quarter of 2018 were RMB16,855.3 million (US$2,454.2 million), compared to RMB16,283.9 million and RMB12,477.8 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017, respectively.Net revenues from online games were RMB10,348.4 million (US$1,506.8 million) for the third quarter of 2018, compared to RMB10,060.8 million and RMB8,111.7 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017, respectively. Mobile games accounted for approximately 68.0% of net revenues from online games for the third quarter of 2018, compared to 74.7% and 68.3% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017, respectively.Net revenues from e-commerce were RMB4,458.8 million (US$649.2 million) for the third quarter of 2018, compared to RMB4,365.5 million and RMB2,667.5 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017, respectively.Net revenues from advertising services were RMB644.2 million (US$93.8 million) for the third quarter of 2018, compared to RMB634.1 million and RMB631.4 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017, respectively. The top performing advertising verticals in the third quarter of 2018 were automobile, real estate and internet services sectors. Net revenues from e-mail and others were RMB1,403.8 million (US$204.4 million) for the third quarter of 2018, compared to RMB1,223.5 million and RMB1,067.2 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017, respectively.Gross Profit/(Loss)Gross profit for the third quarter of 2018 was RMB7,547.3 million (US$1,098.9 million), compared to RMB7,245.1 millionand RMB5,947.6 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017, respectively.  The year-over-year increase in online game services gross profit was primarily due to increased revenue contribution from self-developed mobile games such as Chu Liu Xiang, Knives Out and Identity V and PC-client games such as Justice and Fantasy Westward Journey Online. The quarter-over-quarter increase in online game services gross profit was primarily due to increased revenue contribution from PC-client games such as Justice, and partially offset by the decreased revenue contribution from self-developed mobile games.The year-over-year increase in e-commerce gross profit was primarily due to the rapid development of Kaola and Yanxuan.The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter decreases in advertising services gross profit were primarily due to higher staff-related costs and content purchase expenditures.The year-over-year increase in e-mail and others gross loss was primarily due to decreased revenue contribution from certain online platform businesses, which have relatively higher gross profit margins, as well as higher recognized costs related to certain licensed music content. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in e-mail and others gross loss was primarily due to higher revenue contribution from NetEase Cloud Music and certain online platform businesses.Gross Profit/ (Loss) MarginGross profit margin for online game services for the third quarter of 2018 was 65.1%, compared to 64.3% and 62.5% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017, respectively. The year-over-year increase in gross profit margin was mainly due to increased revenue, while certain costs related to the Company s online games segment were fixed. The quarter-over-quarter increase in gross profit margin was mainly due to increased revenue contribution from PC-client games, which have relatively higher gross profit margins than mobile games.Gross profit margin for e-commerce for the third quarter of 2018 was 10.0%, compared to 10.1% and 11.5% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017, respectively. The year-over-year decrease in e-commerce gross profit margin was primarily due to certain sales discounts in the third quarter of 2018 to support the rapid development of Kaola and Yanxuan.Gross profit margin for advertising services for the third quarter of 2018 was 63.6%, compared to 67.0% and 68.0% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter decreases in gross profit margins were mainly due to higher staff-related costs and content purchase expenditures.Gross loss margin for e-mail and others for the third quarter of 2018 was 3.3%, compared to gross loss margin of 7.3% and gross profit margin of 13.1% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017, respectively. The year-over-year decrease in gross margin was primarily due to decreased revenue contribution from certain online platform businesses, which have relatively higher gross profit margins, as well as higher recognized costs related to certain licensed music content in the third quarter of 2018. The quarter-over-quarter improvement in e-mail and others gross margin was primarily due to higher revenue contribution from NetEase Cloud Music and certain online platform businesses.Operating ExpensesTotal operating expenses for the third quarter of 2018 were RMB5,440.1 million (US$792.1 million), compared to RMB4,911.5 million and RMB3,397.9 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases in operating expenses were mainly due to increased staff-related costs, research and development investments and marketing expenditures. Shipping and handling costs included in selling and marketing expenses for the third quarter of 2018 were RMB385.5 million (US$56.1 million), compared to RMB386.6 million and RMB294.8 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017, respectively.Income TaxesThe Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB843.8 million (US$122.9 million) for the third quarter of 2018, compared to RMB420.5 million and RMB225.5 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017, respectively. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2018 was 34.2%, compared to 15.7% and 8.1% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017, respectively. Certain subsidiaries of the Company are recognized as Key Software Enterprises and therefore subject to a preferential tax rate of 10% for the relevant fiscal years. The Company then recognizes such tax credits in the quarters when they are received. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter changes in the effective tax rate were mainly due to the recognition of such tax credits. The effective tax rate represents certain estimates by the Company as to the tax obligations and benefits applicable to it in each quarter.Net Income After TaxNet income attributable to the Company s shareholders for the third quarter of 2018 totaled RMB1.6 billion (US$232.4 million), compared to RMB2.1 billion and RMB2.5 billion for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017, respectively. Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company s shareholders for the third quarter of 2018 totaled RMB2.3 billion (US$328.9 million), compared to RMB2.7 billion and RMB3.0 billion for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017, respectively.During the third quarter of 2018, the Company had a net foreign exchange gain of RMB56.1 million (US$8.2 million), compared to a net foreign exchange gain of RMB232.8 million and a net foreign exchange loss of RMB109.9 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter changes in foreign exchange gains and losses were mainly due to unrealized exchange gains and losses arising from the Company s U.S. dollar-denominated bank deposits and short-term loan balances as the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the RMB fluctuated over the periods. NetEase reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$1.81 and US$1.80, respectively, for the third quarter of 2018. The Company reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$2.36 and US$2.35, respectively, for the preceding quarter, and basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$2.79 and US$2.77, respectively, for the third quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS were US$2.56 and US$2.55, respectively, for the third quarter of 2018, compared to non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$3.05 and US$3.04, respectively, for the preceding quarter, and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$3.34 and US$3.32, respectively, for the third quarter of 2017.QuarterlyDividendThe board of directors has approved a dividend of US$0.45 per ADS for the third quarter of 2018, which is expected to be paid on December 7, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 30, 2018.NetEase paid a dividend of US$0.38 per ADS for the fourth quarter of 2017 on March 2, 2018, a dividend of US$0.23 per ADS for the first quarter of 2018 on June 8, 2018 and a dividend of US$0.61 per ADS for the second quarter of 2018 on August 31, 2018.Under the Company s quarterly dividend policy announced on May 13, 2014, quarterly dividends will be set at an amount equivalent to approximately 25% of the Company s anticipated net income after tax in each fiscal quarter. The determination to make dividend distributions and the amount of such distributions in any particular quarter will be made at the discretion of the board of directors and will be based upon the Company s operations and earnings, cash flow, financial condition and other relevant factors.Other InformationAs of September 30, 2018, the Company s total cash and cash equivalents, current and non-current time deposits and short-term investments balance totaled RMB42.6 billion (US$6.2 billion), compared to RMB43.2 billion as of December 31, 2017. Cash flow generated from operating activities was RMB3.6 billion (US$526.7 million) for the third quarter of 2018, compared to RMB2.0 billion and RMB1.7 billion for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017, respectively.Share Repurchase ProgramOn November 15, 2017, the Company announced that its board of directors had approved a share repurchase program of up to US$1.0 billion of the Company s outstanding ADSs for a period not to exceed 12 months beginning on November 16, 2017. On June 11, 2018, the Company announced that its board of directors approved an amendment to its share repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of up to an additional US$1.0 billion of the Company s outstanding ADSs. This expands the US$1.0 billion repurchase program that was approved on November 15, 2017 for a period not to exceed 12 months, bringing the total authorized repurchase amount to US$2.0 billion. As of September 30, 2018, the Company had repurchased approximately 4.5 million ADSs for approximately US$1,168 million under this program.The Company also announced today that its board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program of up to US$1.0 billion of the Company s outstanding ADSs for a period not to exceed 12 months beginning on November 16, 2018.Under the terms of the current approved program, NetEase may repurchase its issued and outstanding ADSs in open-market transactions on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. The timing and dollar amount of repurchase transactions will be subject to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 10b-18 requirements. It is also expected that such repurchases will be effected pursuant to a plan in conformity with SEC Rule 10b5-1. The extent to which NetEase repurchases its ADSs will depend upon a variety of factors, including market conditions, regulatory requirements and other corporate considerations, as determined by NetEase s management team. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.** The United States dollar (US$) amounts disclosed in this press release are presented solely for the convenience of the reader. Translations of amounts from RMB into United States dollars for the convenience of the reader were calculated at the noon buying rate of US$1.00 = RMB6.8680 on September 28, 2018 as set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board. No representation is made that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted into US$ at that rate on September 28, 2018, or at any other certain date. The percentages stated are calculated based on RMB.Change in Segment ReportingEffective in the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company changed its segment disclosure to separately report the financial results of its e-commerce business in light of the significant growth of the revenue contribution from e-commerce to the Company s total consolidated net revenues in 2017. This segment primarily reflects the results of NetEase s two e-commerce platforms, Kaola and Yanxuan, which were established in January 2015 and April 2016, respectively. The Company now reports four reporting segments: online game services, e-commerce, advertising services, and e-mail and others. This change in segment reporting aligns with the manner in which the Company s operating decision maker ( CODM ) currently receives and uses financial information to allocate resources and evaluate the performance of reporting segments. This change in segment presentation does not affect consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of income or consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company retrospectively revised prior period segment information to conform to current period presentation.Impact of the recently adopted major accounting pronouncementsOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Topic 606  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  using the modified-retrospective transition approach and recorded a reduction of its deferred revenue of approximately RMB81.7 millionand a net increase to its retained earnings of approximately RMB27.4 million (net of tax) as a result of estimating game point breakage. The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a significant impact on the Company s operating results for the third quarter of 2018 and comparable periods.On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-01  Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. , and reclassified RMB38.2 million of accumulated other comprehensive income for the Company s available-for-sale equity securities that existed as of December 31, 2017 into retained earnings upon the adoption. In addition, the Company recorded net investment losses of RMB238.4 million related to the equity investments with readily determinable fair value for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. Given that there were no material observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investments of the same issuer, the Company did not record any changes to the carrying value of equity investments without readily determinable fair value for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.The Company also adopted ASU 2016-18  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash  starting from the first quarter of 2018. Pursuant to the new guidance, the Company s cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash increased by an aggregate of RMB22.3 million for the third quarter of 2017, compared to the amounts presented under previous guidance.Conference CallNetEase s management team will host a teleconference call with simultaneous webcast at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday, November 14, 2018 (Beijing/Hong Kong Time: 9:00 a.m., Thursday, November 15, 2018).

These statements are made under the  safe harbor  provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these forward-looking statements by terminology such as  will,   expects,   anticipates,   future,   intends,   plans,   believes,   estimates  and similar statements. The accuracy of these statements may be impacted by a number of business risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or anticipated, including risks related to: the risk that the online game market will not continue to grow or that NetEase will not be able to maintain its leading position in that market, which could occur if, for example, its new online games or expansion packs and other improvements to its existing games do not become as popular as management anticipates; the ability of NetEase to successfully expand its mobile internet offerings; the ability of NetEase to effectively market its games and other services and achieve a positive return on its marketing expenditures; the risk that NetEase s affiliates will not be able to continue operating Minecraft, World of Warcraft®, StarCraft® II, Hearthstone®, Diablo® III: Reaper of Souls , Heroes of the Storm®, Overwatch® or other games licensed by it for a period of time or permanently due to possible governmental actions or the risk that such games will not be popular with game players in China; the risk that changes in Chinese government regulation of the online game market and the market for NetEase s e-commerce businesses may limit future growth of NetEase s revenues or cause revenues to decline; competition in the online advertising business and the risk that investments by NetEase in its content and services may not increase the appeal of the NetEase websites among internet users or result in increased advertising revenues; the risk that NetEase may not be able to continuously develop new and creative online services, including its ability to maintain and enhance the popularity of its e-mail, mobile and e-commerce businesses and develop attractive mobile games; the risk that NetEase will not be able to control its expenses in future periods; competition in NetEase s existing and potential markets; governmental uncertainties (including possible changes in the effective tax rates applicable to NetEase and its subsidiaries and affiliates and the ability of NetEase to receive and maintain approvals of the preferential tax treatments and general competition and price pressures in the marketplace); the risk that fluctuations in the value of the Renminbi with respect to other currencies could adversely affect NetEase s business and financial results; and other risks outlined in NetEase s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. NetEase does not undertake any obligation to update this forward-looking information, except as required under the applicable law.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresNetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company s shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS, as supplemental metrics in reviewing and assessing its operating performance and formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ).NetEase defines non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company s shareholders as net income attributable to the Company s shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company s shareholders enables NetEase s management to assess its operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses, which are non-cash charges. NetEase believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating the Company s current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP financial measure facilitates investors  assessment of its operating performance.Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company s shareholders is that it does not reflect all items of expense that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses have been and may continue to be incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company s shareholders. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company s shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company s performance. See  Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results  at the end of this press release. NetEase encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.Contact for Media and Investors:Margaret Shi NetEase, Inc.ir@service.netease.comTel: (+86) 571-8985-3378Brandi PiacenteInvestor Relationsbrandi@corp.netease.comTel: (+1) 212-481-2050NETEASE, INC.NOTES TOUNAUDITEDFINANCIALINFORMATIONNote 1: The conversion of Renminbi (RMB) into United States dollars (USD) is based on the noon buying rate of USD1.00 = RMB6.8680 on the last trading day of September 2018 (September 28, 2018) as set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board.Note 2: Share-based compensation cost reported in the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income is set out as follows in RMB and USD (in thousands): Tags: See Campaign:http://corp.netease.com/Contact Information:NetEase, Inc.Tags:,            Wire,            Disclosure Newswire,            Asia,            EnglishLoad-Date: November 15, 2018End of Document

Major Averages Close Higher After Recovering From Initial Drop - U.S. CommentaryCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 27, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 673 wordsBody       After recovering from an initial move to the downside, stocks fluctuated over the course of the trading session on Tuesday. The major averages spent of the day bouncing back and forth across the unchanged line.  The major averages eventually ended the day in positive territory, although the Nasdaq inched up just 0.85 points or less than a tenth of a percent to 7,082.70. The Dow climbed 108.49 points or 0.4 percent to 24,748.73 and the S&P 500 rose 8.75 points or 0.3 percent to 2,682.20. The initial pullback on Wall Street reflected renewed skepticism about a trade deal between the U.S. and China following President Donald Trump's comments in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. In the interview published Monday, Trump told the Journal it was "highly unlikely" he would delay an increase in tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods from 10 percent to 25 percent. Trump also suggested the U.S. could slap 10 percent tariffs on iPhones and laptops imported from China, contributing to an early sell-off by shares of Apple (AAPL). The comments from Trump come just days before he is due to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at a G20 summit in Argentina later this week. Trump has previously argued his tough talk on trade has actually helped the U.S. to make deals, including the new trade agreement between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada.  Selling pressure waned shortly after the start of trading, however, as traders seemed reluctant to continue selling stocks following recent weakness. Comments from top White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow about trade talks with the Chinese government "at all levels" contributed to the subsequent recovery by the markets. On the U.S. economic front, the Conference Board released a report showing a bigger than expected decrease in consumer confidence in the month of November. The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index dropped to 135.7 in November after rising to 137.9 in October. Economists had expected the index to dip to 136.5. The bigger than expected decrease by the consumer confidence index came after it reached its highest level since September of 2000 in the previous month. Sector News Despite the turnaround by the major averages, substantial weakness remained visible among steel stocks. The NYSE Arca Steel Index tumbled by 2.4 percent to its lowest closing level in well over a year. Steel stocks extended a recent downward trend amid concerns about global demand amid the ongoing trade dispute between the U.S. and China. Gold stocks also showed a significant move to the downside on the day, dragging the NYSE Arca Gold Bugs Index down by 2 percent. The weakness among gold stocks came amid a decrease by the price of the precious metal, with gold for December delivery sliding $9 to $1,213.40 an ounce. Natural gas, chemical and biotechnology stocks also saw notable weakness, while some strength emerged among utilities and healthcare stocks. Other Markets In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved mostly higher on Tuesday, although Chinese stocks bucked the uptrend. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index climbed by 0.6 percent, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 Index rallied by 1 percent. Meanwhile, the major European markets moved to the downside on the day. While the German DAX Index fell by 0.4 percent, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index and the French CAC 40 Index dipped by 0.3 percent and 0.2 percent, respectively. In the bond market, treasuries moved higher following the modest weakness seen in the previous session. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, edged down by 1.7 basis points to 3.055 percent. Looking Ahead Trading on Wednesday may be impacted by reaction to a revised reading on third quarter GDP as well as a report on new home sales in October. Additionally, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to deliver a speech on "The Federal Reserve's Framework for Monitoring Financial Stability" at the Economic Club of New York.        Load-Date: November 28, 2018End of Document

TCHRD NEW WEBSITE HONOURS THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PRINTING AND DISTRIBUTION OF TIBETAN UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTSStates News ServiceDecember 6, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 770 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: DHARAMSALA, India BodyThe following information was released by the Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy (TCHRD):To honour the significant and valuable contributions exhibited by the Drepung monastery monks in the history of Tibetan freedom struggle by carrying out peaceful demonstrations while distributing woodblock printed Tibetan translations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in the year 1988 in capital Lhasa, the Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy launched a maiden Tibetan language website on Universal Declaration of Human Rights at an event at the conference hall of Hotel Tibet, Mcleod Ganj, Dharamshala.30 November marks the date of the sentencing of 'Group of Ten' monks for distributing Tibetan translation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Chinese authorities convicted the monks of producing 'reactionary literature' and 'venomously slandering China's socialist system characterized by the people's democratic dictatorship'. The 'Group of Ten' monks were sentenced to 5 years to 19 years in prison.The chief guests at the event include Ven Ngawang Delek and Ven Ngawang Woeber, who were among the peaceful demonstrators of the 1987 protest in Lhasa. TCHRD also invited Mrs. Lhakpa Dolma, wife of Jamphel Monlam who was sentenced to 5 years prison term for translating and printing UDHR into Tibetan using carved wooden blocks in the year 1989."Even though we did not have proper equipment and facility to have banners and Tibetan flags, however, we drew Tibetan flag on clothes and prepared handwritten banners calling for 'Free Tibet', "Tibet belongs to Tibetans' and "May His Holiness the Dalai Lama live for 10,000 years' said Ven Ngawang Delek in his speech. "Along with me and several other Drepung monks, we secretly planned a peaceful demonstration and took to the streets of Lhasa on 27 September 1987. We were then arbitrarily arrested and detained for a few months. My cousin Jamphel Tsering was also one among the 'Group of Ten' Drepung monks. He was sentenced to 5 years and was released after the completion of his 5-year prison term. Nevertheless, he also took part in the 2008 uprising and was arbitrarily detained for few months."Mrs Lhakpa Dolma said "Jamphel Monlam would often tell that even though he spent 5 years in Chinese prison and underwent severe torture but he never really faced any health complications and it is because that he would always picture His Holiness the Dalai Lama in his mind when the torture equipment was meted onto him by the prison authorities and because of which it didn't really inflict much pain for him.""Chinese government's rhetoric of protecting the religious freedom of Tibetans inside Tibet is nothing but a big lie to the world and a travesty of justice. The reality is that monasteries in Tibet are extensively controlled by the Chinese authorities. Enrolment of the number of monks is limited strictly to 450. For instance, decades have passed by yet there are still only 450 monks at Drepung Monastery and children below 18 years of age are not allowed to join Monastery as their wish. Therefore, it is conspicuous that there is no freedom of religion in Tibet" said former Political Prisoner Ven Ngawang Woeber in his speech.As the event unfolded to the next session, TCHRD staff Mr. Ngawang Namdul gave a thorough description of the new Tibetan language website to a packed conference hall constituting representatives of different Tibetan NGO's, Monasteries, members of Regional Tibetan Women's Association, Tibetan college students and news reporters.The new Tibetan language website will give access to information on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Tibetan language, UN Conventions translated in Tibetan language and seeks engagement from the Tibetan public to spread awareness by promoting and engaging on the importance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The website also features human rights related posters and word cloud banners from which people can download and share on social media. The full feature of the website can be accessed here: http://tibetanhumanrightsdeclaration.org/It is important that the world know about the significance of the UDHR in the Tibetan freedom struggle because a representative of People's Republic of China, Dr. Peng-Chun Chang equally took part in the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 but the criminalization and subsequent prosecution of the 'Group of Ten' Drepung monks for printing and distributing Tibetan translation of the UDHR speaks true of China's blatant mockery of human rights to the international community.Load-Date: December 6, 2018End of Document

THIS WEEK IN CONFLICTS: TRUMP'S APPROACH TO TAXES, FEDERAL FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES AND THE DEMOCRATS PREPARE FOR ETHICS REFORMStates News ServiceNovember 2, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1152 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the Sunlight Foundation:by Lynn WalshThis week, the latest edition of the Trump, Inc. podcast takes a look at how President Donald Trump approaches taxes, Forbes takes a look at what the president's financial disclosures include, what they don't and why that's a problem, and the Democrats talk about possible ethics reform.Trump's Approach to TaxesIn the latest edition of Trump, Inc., WNYC Studios and ProPublica look at patterns that exist in how President Trump approaches taxes.The news organizations focus on three areas:President Trump's history of ignoring norms, like releasing his tax returnsHow the president's family has a history of breaking tax rules, something a New York Times investigation explained in depthPresident Trump's ability to change tax rules to benefit himself and his wealthy peersThe podcast also includes an interview with tax expert Jenny Johnson Ware who explains why, because of certain things happening right now, "it's a great time," to be aggressive as a taxpayer.Trump and Disclosure RulesIn a recent news story, Forbes explains what President Trump is required to disclose under federal ethics laws, what he is not and why all of this matters.One property the news organization focuses on is 1290 Avenue of the Americas, a skyscraper in New York City that President Trump partially owns."The federal filing meant to reveal the president's potential conflicts of interest, his 92-page annual financial disclosure report, makes no mention of the building's $950 million mortgage or the fact that Trump's 30% stake in the property puts him on the hook for 30% of that partly Chinese-financed debt," the article reads.While President Trump is a partial owner of the building it is partly financed by the Chinese government, a potential conflict as the president continues to go back and forth with China on tariffs and trade.What the article points out is that President Trump is not breaking the law by not sharing this information."Federal ethics laws require public servants to list everything from credit card balances to boat loansbut not the debt held by their businesses, even if their lender is a foreign power," according to Forbes. "In fact, a close reading of the rules shows a long list of financial arrangements and entanglements that can be kept secret. Government officials can partner with foreign investors, take in money from foreign governments and apparently stash money in their family members' names, all without ever having to tell the public."The Sunlight Foundation's Tracking Trump's Conflict of Interest database is built from information found in the financial disclosures. As Forbes points out, the information on the disclosures does not paint the full picture. That's why we need your help. If you know anything about particular businesses connected to President Trump please contact us so we can work together to bring transparency to these potential conflicts of interests.Wilbur Ross MeetingsAnother Forbes article discusses Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross.According to the article, Ross "put himself at risk of violating a criminal conflict-of-interest law by discussing business matters with Chevron executives while his wife apparently owned a stake in the company worth more than $250,000."Forbes reported on a meeting between Ross and Chevron's then-CEO John Watson in July but government agencies refused to disclose what was discussed during the meeting. Now, after a legal battle, a detailed version of Ross' calendar has been released and it shows that theJuly meeting was focused on oil and gas developments, tax reform and trade issues.As Forbes explains, "federal law prohibits officials from taking certain actions that affect financial interests held by them or their spouses. Conflicted officials can weigh in on broad issues that impact the whole economy, but not more specific matters that will directly, and predictably, impact companies in which they are investors."In some cases, officials can get waivers to allow them to get around the rules but the Commerce Department has not answered questions about whether Ross got a waiver.Democrats Get Ready for Ethics ReformAs the midterm election gets closer, so do races in the House and Senate. At stake is which party will have majority control. The Republicans think they have it but so do the Democrats. Who wins could determine what the lawmakers tackle next.As a recent article in Time Magazine explains, "Democrats have begun touting an ethics reform package that will top their legislative agenda if they take over the House of Representatives."Approximately 100 advocacy groups support the legislation, which is still being written. It is part of a campaign called "A Declaration for American Democracy." According to Time, the legislation is expected to incorporate proposals for campaign finance reform, voting rights and ethics and accountability. It also is expected to include a provision that President Trump must release his tax returns.Democrats need to flip 23 seats to have control of the House.More conflicts of interest in the newsTurkish group froze plans for lavish Trump Hotel event during talks on US pastor's fateTrump official in charge of separated kids has been accused of violating ethics rulesPress struggles with amplifying Trump's pre-midterms claimsBusinesses pose issue if Newsom becomes California governorSources: Justice Department investigating Interior Secretary Ryan ZinkeJimmy Carter Calls For Georgia Secretary Of State's Resignation In Personal PleaAdd Ryan Zinke to the list of Trump administration officials who flout the rules (Opinion)Menendez race pits ethical concerns against party loyalty, and loyalty is winningTrump's Corruption: The Definitive List (Opinion)About this ProjectSunlight's "Tracking Trump's Conflicts of Interest" project provides a free, searchable database detailing President Donald J. Trump's known business dealings and personal interests that may conflict with his public duties as President of the United States. The project also documents news coverage of these potential conflicts. Read our reporting to stay current on related news, explore our database, and learn more about the project.

Stories from SlateSlate MagazineDecember 7, 2018 Friday 10:12 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Washingtonpost.Newsweek Interactive Company, LLC. All Rights ReservedSection: THE INDUSTRY; TechnologyLength: 427 wordsByline: Aaron MakHighlight: Chinese Tech Giant Huawei's CFO Was Arrested for Allegedly Violating U.S. Sanctions Against IranBodyCanadian authorities revealed in a Vancouver court on Friday that the U.S. had asked them to arrest Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of the Chinese tech giant Huawei, on charges of sanctions fraud. Meng allegedly deceived U.S. financial institutions into processing transactions that violated American sanctions against Iran, Canadian prosecutors said.Meng was arrested while transferring flights in Canada on Saturday, the same night that President Trump and President Xi Jinping struck a 90-day truce on the trade war between the U.S. and China at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires.The arrest sent shockwaves through financial markets and the international community when it became public on Wednesday. Meng is a prominent tech executive and the daughter of the founder of Huawei, a company with close ties to the Chinese government. The U.S. Department of Justice had declined over the past few days to specify the reason for Meng's arrest.Canadian prosecutors told the court that the U.S. believes that Meng had been obscuring ties between Huawei and SkyCom, a Hong-Kong-based company that was            reportedly selling U.S.-made technology to Iran. The U.S. Commerce and Treasury departments            forbid technologies developed in America from being shipped to Iran. Meng allegedly informed an unnamed financial institution during a presentation that Skycom and Huawei were separate entities.  Prosecutors claim that Skycom was an unofficial subsidiary of Huawei. Meng could face up to            30 years in prison if found guilty of the charges.The arrest is sure to complicate current negotiations between the U.S. and China to end the trade war before the 90-day truce is over. Xi is attempting to persuade Trump to loosen tariffs on $200 billion of imports from China, while Trump is attempting to get Xi to            lower trade barriers and open China's economy further to American companies. CNN            reported that some officials in the Trump administration believe that Meng could be used as leverage during the negotiations.The stock market fell on Thursday in reaction to the arrest, with the S&P 500 down as much as 2.9 percent, before rebounding and then dropping again on Friday.Meng's lawyer offered two Vancouver properties to make a cash deposit for her bail and contended that she would not embarrass her father, Huawei, and China by violating a court order. Prosecutors argued that Meng is a flight risk and should be held without bail awaiting possible extradition by the U.S. The U.S. Justice Department has 60 days to present evidence and make a request for extradition.Load-Date: December 8, 2018End of Document

Tencent will check the ages of all its gamersCNN WireNovember 5, 2018 Monday 5:24 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 313 wordsByline: Jordan Valinsky, CNN BusinessDateline: NEW YORK (CNN Business) BodyNEW YORK (CNN Business) --  Tencent will check the identities of all its gamers in China by 2019 with the aim of limiting the hours young people spend playing. The tech conglomerate announced the sweeping new rules for its hundreds of millions of customers on Monday. It will check gamers' IDs against police databases and block any accounts it can't verify.Tencent is responding to the Chinese government's increased scrutiny of video games. China claims it wants to reduce the incidence of nearsightedness in children and adolescents.In a practice called "health system," Tencent said customer accounts will be "forcibly verified with real-name police system" to ensure people are who they claim to be. Unverified accounts won't be allowed to sign in.Tencent piloted the new system for Honor of Kings, a hugely popular mobile game that it released in 2017. The new rules will be enforced on nine more of its mobile games by the end of this year, before being extended to all mobile and PC games in 2019.To tackle concerns about video game addiction, Tencent is capping players under 12 to one hour per day and not letting them play from 9 pm to 8 am. The company will also enforce a two-hour limit on users between 12 and 18 years old.Tencent shares slipped in Hong Kong, closing down nearly 4%.The Chinese media and tech company is having a rough year. In August, the China's Education Ministry said it wanted to "control" how many new games come online. The government also said it will look into setting up a system to remind people about which games are appropriate for different age groups.Tencent reported a rare decline in profit in August, blaming the drop mainly on regulators not approving licenses for new games.The stock has lost nearly 30% of its value since the beginning of the year.TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

The quarter-over-quarter increase in online game services gross profit was primarily due to increased revenue contribution from PC-client games such asJustice, and partially offset by the decreased revenue contribution from self-developed mobile games.The year-over-year increase in e-commerce gross profit was primarily due to the rapid development ofKaolaandYanxuan.The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter decreases in advertising services gross profit were primarily due to higher staff-related costs and content purchase expenditures.The year-over-year increase in e-mail and others gross loss was primarily due to decreased revenue contribution from certain online platform businesses, which have relatively higher gross profit margins, as well as higher recognized costs related to certain licensed music content. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in e-mail and others gross loss was primarily due to higher revenue contribution fromNetEase Cloud Musicand certain online platform businesses.Gross Profit/ (Loss) MarginGross profit margin for online game services for the third quarter of 2018 was 65.1%, compared to 64.3% and 62.5% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017, respectively. The year-over-year increase in gross profit margin was mainly due to increased revenue, while certain costs related to the Company's online games segment were fixed. The quarter-over-quarter increase in gross profit margin was mainly due to increased revenue contribution from PC-client games, which have relatively higher gross profit margins than mobile games.Gross profit margin for e-commerce for the third quarter of 2018 was 10.0%, compared to 10.1% and 11.5% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017, respectively. The year-over-year decrease in e-commerce gross profit margin was primarily due to certain sales discounts in the third quarter of 2018 to support the rapid development ofKaolaandYanxuan.Gross profit margin for advertising services for the third quarter of 2018 was 63.6%, compared to 67.0% and 68.0% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter decreases in gross profit margins were mainly due to higher staff-related costs and content purchase expenditures.Gross loss margin for e-mail and others for the third quarter of 2018 was 3.3%, compared to gross loss margin of 7.3% and gross profit margin of 13.1% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017, respectively. The year-over-year decrease in gross margin was primarily due to decreased revenue contribution from certain online platform businesses, which have relatively higher gross profit margins, as well as higher recognized costs related to certain licensed music content in the third quarter of 2018. The quarter-over-quarter improvement in e-mail and others gross margin was primarily due to higher revenue contribution fromNetEase Cloud Musicand certain online platform businesses.Operating ExpensesTotal operating expenses for the third quarter of 2018 were RMB5,440.1 million (US$792.1 million), compared to RMB4,911.5 million and RMB3,397.9 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases in operating expenses were mainly due to increased staff-related costs, research and development investments and marketing expenditures. Shipping and handling costs included in selling and marketing expenses for the third quarter of 2018 were RMB385.5 million (US$56.1 million), compared to RMB386.6 million and RMB294.8 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017, respectively.Income TaxesThe Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB843.8 million (US$122.9 million) for the third quarter of 2018, compared to RMB420.5 million and RMB225.5 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017, respectively. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2018 was 34.2%, compared to 15.7% and 8.1% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017, respectively. Certain subsidiaries of the Company are recognized as Key Software Enterprises and therefore subject to a preferential tax rate of 10% for the relevant fiscal years. The Company then recognizes such tax credits in the quarters when they are received. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter changes in the effective tax rate were mainly due to the recognition of such tax credits. The effective tax rate represents certain estimates by the Company as to the tax obligations and benefits applicable to it in each quarter.Net Income After TaxNet income attributable to the Company's shareholders for the third quarter of 2018 totaled RMB1.6 billion (US$232.4 million), compared to RMB2.1 billion and RMB2.5 billion for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017, respectively. Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders for the third quarter of 2018 totaled RMB2.3 billion (US$328.9 million), compared to RMB2.7 billion and RMB3.0 billion for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017, respectively.During the third quarter of 2018, the Company had a net foreign exchange gain of RMB56.1 million (US$8.2 million), compared to a net foreign exchange gain of RMB232.8 million and a net foreign exchange loss of RMB109.9 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter changes in foreign exchange gains and losses were mainly due to unrealized exchange gains and losses arising from the Company's U.S. dollar-denominated bank deposits and short-term loan balances as the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the RMB fluctuated over the periods.NetEase reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$1.81 and US$1.80, respectively, for the third quarter of 2018. The Company reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$2.36 and US$2.35, respectively, for the preceding quarter, and basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$2.79 and US$2.77, respectively, for the third quarter of 2017.

Cash flow generated from operating activities was RMB3.6 billion (US$526.7 million) for the third quarter of 2018, compared to RMB2.0 billion and RMB1.7 billion for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017, respectively.Share Repurchase ProgramOn November 15, 2017, the Company announced that its board of directors had approved a share repurchase program of up to US$1.0 billion of the Company's outstanding ADSs for a period not to exceed 12 months beginning on November 16, 2017. On June 11, 2018, the Company announced that its board of directors approved an amendment to its share repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of up to an additional US$1.0 billion of the Company's outstanding ADSs. This expands the US$1.0 billion repurchase program that was approved on November 15, 2017 for a period not to exceed 12 months, bringing the total authorized repurchase amount to US$2.0 billion.As of September 30, 2018, the Company had repurchased approximately 4.5 million ADSs for approximately US$1,168 million under this program.The Company also announced today that its board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program of up to US$1.0 billion of the Company's outstanding ADSs for a period not to exceed 12 months beginning on November 16, 2018.Under the terms of the current approved program, NetEase may repurchase its issued and outstanding ADSs in open-market transactions on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. The timing and dollar amount of repurchase transactions will be subject to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 10b-18 requirements. It is also expected that such repurchases will be effected pursuant to a plan in conformity with SEC Rule 10b5-1. The extent to which NetEase repurchases its ADSs will depend upon a variety of factors, including market conditions, regulatory requirements and other corporate considerations, as determined by NetEase's management team. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.** The United States dollar (US$) amounts disclosed in this press release are presented solely for the convenience of the reader. Translations of amounts from RMB into United States dollars for the convenience of the reader were calculated at the noon buying rate of US$1.00 = RMB6.8680 on September 28, 2018 as set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board. No representation is made that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted into US$ at that rate on September 28, 2018, or at any other certain date. The percentages stated are calculated based on RMB.Change in Segment ReportingEffective in the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company changed its segment disclosure to separately report the financial results of its e-commerce business in light of the significant growth of the revenue contribution from e-commerce to the Company's total consolidated net revenues in 2017. This segment primarily reflects the results of NetEase's two e-commerce platforms,KaolaandYanxuan, which were established in January 2015 and April 2016, respectively. The Company now reports four reporting segments: online game services, e-commerce, advertising services, and e-mail and others. This change in segment reporting aligns with the manner in which the Company's operating decision maker ("CODM") currently receives and uses financial information to allocate resources and evaluate the performance of reporting segments. This change in segment presentation does not affect consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of income or consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company retrospectively revised prior period segment information to conform to current period presentation.Impact of the recently adopted major accounting pronouncementsOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Topic 606 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" using the modified-retrospective transition approach and recorded a reduction of its deferred revenue of approximately RMB81.7 million and a net increase to its retained earnings of approximately RMB27.4 million (net of tax) as a result of estimating game point breakage. The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a significant impact on the Company's operating results for the third quarter of 2018 and comparable periods.On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-01 "Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.", and reclassified RMB38.2 million of accumulated other comprehensive income for the Company's available-for-sale equity securities that existed as of December 31, 2017 into retained earnings upon the adoption. In addition, the Company recorded net investment losses of RMB238.4 million related to the equity investments with readily determinable fair value for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. Given that there were no material observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investments of the same issuer, the Company did not record any changes to the carrying value of equity investments without readily determinable fair value for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.The Company also adopted ASU 2016-18 "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash" starting from the first quarter of 2018. Pursuant to the new guidance, the Company's cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash increased by an aggregate of RMB22.3 million for the third quarter of 2017, compared to the amounts presented under previous guidance.Conference CallNetEase's management team will host a teleconference call with simultaneous webcast at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday, November 14, 2018 (Beijing/Hong Kong Time: 9:00 a.m., Thursday, November 15, 2018).

These statements are made under the "safe harbor" provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these forward-looking statements by terminology such as "will," "expects," "anticipates," "future," "intends," "plans," "believes," "estimates" and similar statements. The accuracy of these statements may be impacted by a number of business risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or anticipated, including risks related to: the risk that the online game market will not continue to grow or that NetEase will not be able to maintain its leading position in that market, which could occur if, for example, its new online games or expansion packs and other improvements to its existing games do not become as popular as management anticipates; the ability of NetEase to successfully expand its mobile internet offerings; the ability of NetEase to effectively market its games and other services and achieve a positive return on its marketing expenditures; the risk that NetEase's affiliates will not be able to continue operatingMinecraft,World of Warcraft®, StarCraft® II, Hearthstone®,Diablo® III: Reaper of Souls(TM),Heroes of the Storm®,Overwatch® or other games licensed by it for a period of time or permanently due to possible governmental actions or the risk that such games will not be popular with game players in China; the risk that changes in Chinese government regulation of the online game market and the market for NetEase's e-commerce businesses may limit future growth of NetEase's revenues or cause revenues to decline; competition in the online advertising business and the risk that investments by NetEase in its content and services may not increase the appeal of the NetEase websites among internet users or result in increased advertising revenues; the risk that NetEase may not be able to continuously develop new and creative online services, including its ability to maintain and enhance the popularity of its e-mail, mobile and e-commerce businesses and develop attractive mobile games; the risk that NetEase will not be able to control its expenses in future periods; competition in NetEase's existing and potential markets; governmental uncertainties (including possible changes in the effective tax rates applicable to NetEase and its subsidiaries and affiliates and the ability of NetEase to receive and maintain approvals of the preferential tax treatments and general competition and price pressures in the marketplace); the risk that fluctuations in the value of the Renminbi with respect to other currencies could adversely affect NetEase's business and financial results; and other risks outlined in NetEase's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. NetEase does not undertake any obligation to update this forward-looking information, except as required under the applicable law.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresNetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS, as supplemental metrics in reviewing and assessing its operating performance and formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP").NetEase defines non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders as net income attributable to the Company's shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders enables NetEase's management to assess its operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses, which are non-cash charges. NetEase believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating the Company's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP financial measure facilitates investors' assessment of its operating performance.Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders is that it does not reflect all items of expense that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses have been and may continue to be incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. See "Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results" at the end of this press release. NetEase encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.Contact for Media and Investors:Margaret ShiNetEase,

Soy rose less than expected in ChicagoCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 5, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 456 wordsBody Soybean prices rose 1.2% yesterday on the Chicago Stock Exchange, the day after the truce signed on Saturday in Buenos Aires by the presidents of the United States, Donald Trump, and China, Xi Jinping. Due to its proportion, the improvement showed the skepticism of the operators due to the lack of clarifications that remained after the conclave.  "Throughout the day the market waited for certainty, but there were no certainties, which is why the rises that were initially seen were diluted with the passing of the hours, for example, the January soybean position in Chicago had its maximum wheel at $ 339.42 per ton, the minimum at $ 332.35, and the closing at $ 332.81. I think that until there is public knowledge of the fine print of the agreement no one in the market will take too much risk It will significantly change its position, "Adrián Seltzer, of the brokerage Granar SA, told LA NACION.  After the meeting between the presidents, the White House reported on Saturday that China agreed to "buy an unspecified but very important amount of agricultural products." However, no explicit references were made to soybean or the 25% Chinese tariff against the US oilseed.  Yesterday, through his Twitter account, Trump wrote: "Farmers will have a very big and fast benefit from our agreement with China, they intend to start buying agricultural products immediately."  But beyond the positivism of the message there were no specific mentions in terms of products or tariffs imposed by China. However, in a previous tweet, Trump was specific about the tariffs that the Chinese government imposed on the automotive industry: "China has agreed to reduce and eliminate tariffs on cars arriving from the United States, currently the rate is 40%" .  The doubts of the operators were strengthened in the course of the afternoon when the Secretary of Agriculture of the United States, Sonny Perdue, affirmed that "it has not yet been determined whether China will eliminate tariffs on imports of US soybeans."  For Delfín Morgan, of the broker Morgan, García Mansilla y Cía. SA, the closing of the market accentuated doubts about the capacity that the meeting between Trump and Xi will have to cause a change in trend "in the face of an American megaproduction, to Brazil, which is on track to repeat another productive success, and to China, that has a program to cut soy imports. "  Among the operators, yesterday, the chance for China to buy US soya to strengthen its strategic reserves through state-owned Sinograin, without modifying the 25% tariff, gained momentum. Thus, private companies would continue to concentrate their demand on the South American remnant.  Copyright Grupo de Diarios América - GDA / La Nación / Argentina Load-Date: December 5, 2018End of Document

The oxymoron that watches the networkCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 11, 2018 SundayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 392 wordsBody        China could be close to achieving something "never before seen at any time in history," said the famed economist Nicholas Eberstadt last week: "market totalitarianism."  No country has achieved a vibrant business evolution under an environment where there are no freedoms.  A dictator like Mao Zedong could drag his country from peasant poverty to industrialization. However, investors need a foreseeable state of law.  The formula is simple: capitalists depend on free flows of information and, at the same time, innovation comes from schools that foster creativity and debate. Something else, success is linked to freedom.  This has always been the case. The exception is Singapore, but it is a small city-state that, as it grew, was politically freer than what China is today.  Can China challenge this rule? That was an underlying question during a Hoover Institution forum convened by former Secretary of State George Shultz, where Eberstadt, an academic at the American Enterprise Institute, spoke.  If the answer is affirmative, one of the reasons that will make this phenomenon possible is called the Internet.  More than 730 million Chinese are online and do not demand privacy for their data. Thus, the Chinese government knows much more about its netizens, than any other dictatorship throughout history: where they are at each moment, with whom they communicate, what they like and what they think.  China plans to use that information to classify everyone according to its social utility; he will reward and punish them according to his parameters.  As noted during the forum on the campus of Stanford University, Maria Repnikova, of the State University of Georgia, the Communist Party of China does not use technology only for control. In a system that she calls "responsible authoritarianism"; the party employs thousands of people to measure, hour by hour, the satisfactions and discontent of the people.  In China there are officials who create pages for people to vent, although complaints about national leaders or against the party itself are not tolerated.  There is not much we can do to determine the success or failure of market totalitarianism within China. But they observe the way our democracy seems unable to fix: immigration, build the necessary infrastructure or invest in the right types of training and education. Load-Date: November 11, 2018End of Document

Tencent Reports Earnings on Wednesday: 5 Important Things to WatchRealMoneyNovember 12, 2018 Monday 7:57 PM EDTCopyright 2018 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 604 wordsByline: Eric JhonsaHighlight: Gaming commentary, mobile payments growth and spending trends are among the things to watch as the Chinese tech giant reports.BodyTencent's  shares have fallen about 35% this year, stung by currency pressures, a selloff in Chinese tech stocks and worries about a gaming crackdown by local regulators.That spells low expectations ahead of the Chinese tech giant's Q3 report. On average, analysts polled by FactSet expect revenue of RMB80.93 billion (up 24% annually and equal to $11.66 billion) and non-GAAP EPS of RMB1.91 ($0.27). The revenue estimate has fallen by $2.5 billion since June, and the EPS estimate by $0.08.Here are a few things for investors to keep an eye on as Tencent reports on Wednesday morning and hosts an earnings call at 7 a.m. EST.1. Gaming Trends and CommentaryA recent Chinese government freeze on game approvals -- pending the rollout of  -- has naturally taken a heavy toll on Tencent, easily China's biggest game publisher. In Q2, the company's online games revenue (over a third of total revenue)  , a marked slowdown from Q1's 26% growth. The company's Internet valued-added service (VAS) revenue, which also covers other digital content businesses, grew 14%, a slowdown from Q1's 34%.Thanks to the gaming slowdown, the consensus is for VAS revenue to be just 9% annually in Q3 to RMB45.8 billion ($6.6 billion). Any commentary that Tencent provides about the game-approval halt and its expected lifting will be closely watched.2. User GrowthMonthly active users (MAUs) for Tencent's WeChat mobile platform (all but ubiquitous in China), rose 9.9% annually in Q3 to 1.06 billion. On the flip side, MAUs for Tencent's older QQ and Qzone social platforms fell by 5.5% an 9.5%, respectively, to 803 million and 548 million.Expect Tencent to report another quarter of WeChat growth and QQ/Qzone declines. The company might also -- as it does from time to time -- share some stats about individual WeChat services, such as  or its fast-growing  platform.3. "Social Networks" and Advertising GrowthWhile gaming revenue grew just 6% in Q2, Tencent's "social networks" revenue, which covers content businesses such as video subscriptions and live-streaming services and is also part of its VAS revenue, grew 30% to RMB16.9 billion. Video subscriptions more than doubled annually, and total subscriptions rose 30%.Likewise, Tencent's ad businesses collectively grew 39% to RMB14.1 billion, thanks in part to the strong growth seen in WeChat Moments and Mini Programs ad sales. For Q3, the consensus is for ad revenue to grow 41% to RMB15.6 billion ($2.25 billion).4. WeChat Pay and Cloud Revenue GrowthTencent's "Other" revenue, which is believe to stem in large part from its WeChat Pay and cloud services platforms, grew 81% in Q2 to RMB17.5 billion. The Q3 consensus is for Other revenue to grow 61% to RMB19.4 billion ($2.79 billion).Though its growth has slowed a bit, WeChat Pay still has quite a lot of momentum. On its Q2 call, Tencent reported having over 800 million mobile payments MAUs at the end of June, and said its average daily transaction volume grew over 40% annually. Offline payment volume is said to have grown 280%.5. Spending and Margin Trends  archrival Alibaba  , Tencent isn't shy about investing aggressively. Sales and marketing spend rose 74% annually on an RMB basis in Q2, while R&D spend rose 35%. In addition, capital spending, which impacts gross margin as depreciation expenses are recorded on capex, rose 135%.For Q3, the consensus is for sales/marketing and R&D spend to rise 44% and 26%, respectively. Gross margin, impacted both by capex and a revenue mix shift towards digital content businesses that carry relatively low margins, is expected to be down by 3 percentage points annually to 48.6%.Load-Date: November 13, 2018End of Document

USA: LAWMAKERS MUST NOT LET GOOGLE OFF THE HOOK OVER DRAGONFLYStates News ServiceDecember 10, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 362 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, NY BodyThe following information was released by Amnesty International USA:US lawmakers must press Google CEO Sundar Pichai on the company's disturbing plans for a censored search app in China, Amnesty International said ahead of Pichai's appearance before Congress tomorrow.Pichai is due to testify in Congress over allegations of political bias in Google's search algorithm. The tech giant also faces questions over its prototype search engine for the Chinese market codenamed Project Dragonfly which would blacklist search terms like "human rights" and facilitate Chinese authorities in targeting dissidents online."Sundar Pichai has some serious questions to answer tomorrow. How can Google square Project Dragonfly with its own human rights commitments? Does Google care more about profits than people? Will Google listen to the outcry of protest from its own workforce over its China plans?" said Joe Westby, Technology and Human Rights Researcher at Amnesty International."This is a crucial moment for internet freedom. We call on Congress to demand clarity from Sundar Pichai and urge him to drop Project Dragonfly."On 26 November Amnesty International organized a day of worldwide protests against the plans, and hundreds of Google staff signed an open letter joining Amnesty's call to drop Dragonfly.Amnesty also released a new satirical video today showing a fake Google employee objecting to criticism from "Google staff, Amnesty International and a whole bunch of other human rights organizations". It is the sequel to Amnesty's fake job ad for Project Dragonfly which was used to alert Google staff to the #DropDragonfly campaign through LinkedIn advertising.Amnesty International also published an open letter signed by 61 NGOs and 11 individuals, including Edward Snowden.Part of the letter reads:"Facilitating Chinese authorities' access to personal data, as described in media reports, would be particularly reckless. If such features were launched, there is a real risk that Google would directly assist the Chinese government in arresting or imprisoning people simply for expressing their views online, making the company complicit in human rights violations."Load-Date: December 14, 2018End of Document

The "Trump tweet" effect kept up the price of soy in ChicagoCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 4, 2018 SundayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1075 wordsBody        Soybean prices rose again yesterday on the Chicago Stock Exchange, under the influence of the so-called "Trump tuit", in reference to the upward momentum generated after the message shared by the president of the United States on Thursday on the social network Twitter, in which he commented that the commercial discussions with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, "are progressing very well".  At the close of the round, the slates of the US market reflected increases of US $ 2.29 and 2.11 over the November and January soybean contracts, whose adjustments were 321.60 and 326.19 dollars per ton. In the weekly balance, these positions added 3.58 and 3.50% against the values ??in force the previous Friday, of 310.49 and of 315.17 dollars per ton.  With the investment funds in the first line, the market opted yesterday to sustain the bet for an eventual rapprochement between the US positions. and China to end the trade war that has interrupted the trade of soy between the two countries, as a result of the 25% tariff imposed by the Chinese government on the US grain.  While many of the operators linked the sudden approach of Trump to his Chinese counterpart with the legislative elections to be held next Tuesday in the United States, where the mood of the producers can determine luck or misfortune for the candidates of the Republican Party in agricultural regions, the most optimistic consider that the imminent meeting between the two leaders during the G-20 summit in Argentina could be a starting point for a cessation of tariff hostilities.  Yesterday, in addition, the positive tone of soybean contributed the USDA's 2019/2020 preliminary report, in which the agency projected a drop of 7.40% of the planting intention of the oilseed in the United States (as it is extended separately).  The US crop projection published by the consultancy Informa Economics, which calculated 126.47 million tons of soybeans, was also upward, below the 127.63 million estimated by the USDA in its monthly work in October.  A data that could dull the effect "Trump tweet" during the next week was provided by the USDA agricultural aggregate in China, which yesterday estimated total imports of soy from that country in 85 million tons, well below the 94 million expected by the agency in its report last month.  Domestic calm  In the local market, soybean prices closed the week down. The offers of the factories for the merchandise with delivery in the terminals of the Gran Rosario fell from 9000 to 8700 pesos per ton, while the proposals of the exporters declined from 9200 to 9000 pesos.  "The little supply that appears is going to the export, because to the factories the margins do not give them to pay much more than what they are offering", told LA NACION a source from the commercial sector, which he estimated in "no more than 15,000 tons "the volume of soy sold yesterday.  The appreciation of the peso against the dollar was one of the factors that conspired against the value of soy, since it reduced the buyers' payment power. In the week, the Argentine currency recovered 3.68% of its value, given that the parity between both currencies went from 36.64 to 35.29, according to the buyer's exchange rate (currency quote) of Banco Nación.  For the soybean of the next harvest, the interested ones returned to propose 240 dollars by ton of the merchandise with delivery in May.  In the Mercado de Término of Buenos Aires (Matba), soy was negotiated with ups and downs. While the November position fell US $ 1.50 after closing with a value of 257 dollars, the May contract added up to US $ 0.80 with an adjustment of 253.90 dollars.  Regarding cereals, the export yesterday offered 4650 pesos per ton available for theGreater Rosario area, $ 100 more than in the previous round. The proposals remained stable for Bahía Blanca and for Necochea, at 4800 and 4500 pesos, respectively.  The Bolsa de Cereals of Buenos Aires (BCBA) reported that consumptions paid between 4900 and 5350 pesos per ton of dry corn, depending on quality, provenance and form of payment.  In the Matba the positions December and April closed without variants, in 138 and in 145 dollars per ton.  Per ton of wheat with immediate delivery, the exporters offered again yesterday on the Rosario Stock Exchange 175 dollars. The proposals in pesos, however, fell from 6150 to 6100 pesos. The mills paid between 6400 and 8300 pesos.  Regarding wheat deferred deliveries, buyers improved their proposals from 170 to 175 dollars for cereal with unloading in December; from 175 to 178 dollars for January; from $ 178 to $ 180 for February, and $ 180 to $ 182 for March.  Balance in favor in Chicago  3.24%  Soy  With the last three positive wheels, the value of soy in the US market closed the week with a rise of 3.24%, from 310.49 to 321.60 dollars.  0.94%  Corn  More modest was the weekly improvement of corn, which reached 0.94%, after passing the December position adjustment of 144.78 to 146.15 dollars per ton.  The surface with cereals in the US would grow  In a preliminary evaluation for the agricultural campaign 2019/2020, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA, for its acronym in English) projected yesterday a growth of intent to plant corn and wheat by US producers, to the detriment of soy, which would resign land, as a result of the fall experienced by their prices since the beginning of the trade war with China.  According to the figures published yesterday, which will be re-evaluated in the coming months by the technicians and presented in February during the USDA Annual Forum, the agency projected the planting of corn in 37.23 million hectares, 3.24% above the 36.06 million covered in the 2018/2019 campaign.  For all wheat varieties, the expected increase in US sowing is 6.72%, with a transition from 19.34 to 20.64 million hectares.  Most of the cereal area growth will be at the expense of soybeans, whose sowing was projected by the USDA at 33.39 million hectares, 7.40 percent below the 36.06 million hectares implanted in the present season.  Among the factors that detract from soybean planting, the first is the fall in prices due to the trade war between the United States and China, which restricts exports and raises the volume of stocks, but also weighs in the consideration of American producers the continued growth of the South American offer.  Copyright Grupo de Diarios América - GDA / La Nación / Argentina Load-Date: November 4, 2018End of Document

Global Smart Electric Drive Market to 2024: Opportunities in Integrated Mobility Solutions And Ride-Hailing & Surging Demand For Electric VehiclesPR NewswireNovember 23, 2018 Friday 8:45 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1612 wordsDateline: DUBLIN, Nov. 23, 2018 BodyPR NewswireThe"Global Smart Electric Drive Market- Technologies, Market Share and Industry Forecast to 2024"report has been added toResearchAndMarkets.com'soffering.Global smart e-drive market to retain a strong position till 2024 with a CAGR of 31.8%Smart electric drive is also known as smart Fortwo electric drive that came into existence in 2007 with a series of vehicles known as first generation in North America. Moreover, the latest generation of smart electric drive vehicles conquered the market in August 2017.Geographically, early adoption of smart electric drive vehicles took place in North America, especially in the U.S. For instance, Daimler AG has announced that it is discontinuing the gas powered smart vehicles and converting all the cars in smart electric cars.Global smart electric drive market is driven by various factors that include increase in demand for fuel efficient, high performance & low emission vehicles and government incentives to promote use of electric vehicles.According to the Consumers Union (a non-profit organization, United States), the sales of electric vehicles (EVs) crossed 1 million units in 2015 globally. Further, as per the International Energy Agency (IEA, France), total number of electric cars on the road reached more that 3 million units across the globe in 2017, with an increase of more than 50% as compared to that of 2016.Moreover, according to the International Energy Agency's (IEA) estimations, total number of hybrid electric vehicles across the globe have exceeded 3 million in 2017 accounting for increase of 54% from 2016 figures.Moreover, according to IEA's estimations, China is largest market for electric cars followed by United States. Furthermore, according to Electric Drive Transportation Association (EDTA), in 2016, globally, total hybrid electric passenger vehicle sales were 346,948 units. In addition, total plug-in passenger vehicle sales were 157,112 units (2016).Moreover, total electric passenger vehicle sales were recorded to be 17.3 million units. Hence, such high sales of electric (low emission) vehicles tend to drive the global smart e-drive market.Government incentives for electric vehicles is a major factor promoting global smart e-drive market growthGovernments across the globe are supporting the purchase of electric vehicles for various advantages that include low greenhouse gas emissions, reduced noise and air pollution etc. The governments provide incentives, special allowances, tax credits and others for promoting the purchase of electric vehicles.For instance, in the U.S., the Federal Government announced tax credits (depend upon battery capacity) under American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (in a range of $2,500 to $7,500 per vehicle) on electric vehicles. In addition, tax credits are also applicable to conversion kits to retrofit conventional powered vehicle with electric vehicle capability ($4,000 per vehicle, maximum).Other than the Federal Government, the State governments also provide special allowances on the purchase of electric vehicles.For instance, 47 states in the U.S. provide rebate or tax benefits for HEV (hybrid electric vehicle) purchases. These include Arizona, Colorado, California, DC and others. Further, German Federal government has also announced tax allowances. This includes tax exemption on pure electric vehicles licensed before 31st December 2015 is now extended to 10 years.Also, pure electric vehicles that will be licensed from 1st January 2016 to 31st December, 2020 will have the special allowance of tax exemption for 5 years. Moreover, Chinese government also provide rebates in vehicle registration fee and purchase tax for all types of electric vehicles such as fuel-cell, pure electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles.Japan Government provides special allowance by not charging acquisition and tonnage tax to electric vehicles. Hence, supportive government incentives boost the adoption of electric vehicles, thereby fueling the global smart electric drive market.Europe is expected to register fastest CAGR under smart e-drive market till 2024High research & development spending in battery technology along with strict emission regulations and high demand of electric vehicles are the major factors attributing to the fastest growth rate of Europe over the forecast period (2016-2023).According to EUROBAT (the Association of European Automotive and Industrial Battery Manufacturers), Europe battery manufacturing industry had an R&D budget of $870.59 Million over last 5 years (from 2012). Hence, high R&D spending on batteries is expected to aid the Europe smart electric drive market. Further, European Union has strict emission reduction initiatives that also help Europe smart electric drive market growth.According to European Union, EU's objective to reduce CO2 emissions by 40% up to 2030 as compared to levels of 1990 and abolishing fossil fuel cars by 2050.Hence, the government initiatives regarding CO2 emissions is driving Europe smart electric drive market. In Paris agreement, during July 2017, the government of France declared a five-year plan to completely ban all diesel and petrol vehicles by 2040 which is expected to boost the low carbon emitting electric vehicle sales in the country.Moreover, presence of key players such as Daimler AG (Germany) GKN (UK), Robert Bosch (Germany), Siemens (Germany), MAHLE (Germany), Continental (Germany), ZF Friedrichshafen (Germany) and others aid European smart electric drive market.Key Topics Covered:1.

Stocks plunge to 8-month lows on growth fears; J&J nosedivesAssociated Press InternationalDecember 14, 2018 Friday 10:22 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; Financial MarketsLength: 1034 wordsByline: By MARLEY JAY, AP Markets WriterDateline: NEW YORK BodyNEW YORK (AP) - Stocks staggered to eight-month lows Friday after weak economic data from China and Europe set off more worries about the global economy. Mounting tensions in Europe over Britain's impending departure from the European Union also darkened traders' moods.Major U.S. indexes fell about 2 percent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped as much as 563 points. On the benchmark S&P 500 index, health care and technology companies absorbed the worst losses.Johnson & Johnson plunged by the most in 16 years after Reuters reported that the company has known since the 1970s that its talc Baby Powder sometimes contained carcinogenic asbestos. The company denied the report.China said industrial output and retail sales both slowed in November. That could be another sign that China's trade dispute with the U.S. and tighter lending conditions are chilling its economy, which is the second-largest in the world. Meanwhile, purchasing managers in Europe signaled that economic growth was slipping.Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said investors are concerned that weakness will make it way to the U.S. They're wondering if the U.S. economy is likely to run out of steam sooner than they had thought."Market consensus has been that the next recession is probably in 2020 or beyond," he said. Now, he said, the market is "really testing that assumption and trying to figure out whether it's sooner."Rising interest rates and tighter credit conditions are adding to investors' nervousness because they both tend to slow down economic growth. This week the European Central Bank said it is ending a bond-buying program that has pumped trillions into Europe's economy. The Federal Reserve is expected to increase U.S. rates again on Wednesday, as it's been doing for the last three years. It may also shed light on whether it plans to raise rates further in 2019.For more than 20 years, China has been one of the biggest contributors to growth in the global economy, and when investors see signs the Chinese economy is weakening, they expect it will affect other countries like the U.S. that sell things to China.In Europe, the index of purchase managers fell in France, which is racked by protests, to a level that points toward economic contraction. Germany's reading still pointed to growth, but it fell to its lowest level in four years.Those reports canceled out some potential good news on trade: the Chinese government announced a 90-day suspension of tariff increases on U.S. cars, trucks and auto imports. It's part of a cease-fire that China and the U.S. announced earlier this month to give them time to work on other issues.December is typically the best month of the year for stocks as a "Santa Claus rally" often adds to the year's gains. With 10 trading days left this month, however, the S&P 500 is down 5.8 percent. That followed a small gain in November and a steep 6.9 percent drop in October.The S&P 500 index lost 50.59 points, or 1.9 percent, to 2,599.95, its lowest close since April 2. The Dow retreated 496.87 points, or 2 percent, to 24,100.51. The Dow has fallen 10 percent from its record high in early October, reaching a mark known on Wall Street as a "correction." The other major U.S. indexes were already in "corrections."The Nasdaq composite slid 159.67 points, or 2.3 percent, to 6,910.66. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks fell 21.89 points, or 1.5 percent, to 1,410.81.Johnson & Johnson dropped 10 percent to $133 in very heavy trading. Its market value fell by $40 billion.Reuters reported that court documents and test results show Johnson & Johnson has known for decades that its raw talc and finished Baby Powder sometimes contained asbestos, but that the company didn't inform regulators or the public. The company called the story "false and inflammatory."In July the company lost a lawsuit from plaintiffs who argued that its products were linked to cases of ovarian cancer and mesothelioma. A St. Louis jury awarded plaintiffs $4.7 billion. Johnson & Johnson faces thousands of other lawsuits.Among technology companies, Apple dipped 3.2 percent to $165.48. Adobe skidded 7.3 percent to $230 after its fourth-quarter profit disappointed investors and it also forecast lower-than-expected earnings in the current fiscal year. Industrial companies sank as well. Boeing lost 2.1 percent to $318.75.Oil prices again turned lower, as a slower global economy would weaken demand for oil and other fuels. Benchmark U.S. crude fell 2.6 percent to $51.20 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, dropped 1.9 percent to settle at $60.28 a barrel in London.European Union leaders rejected British Prime Minister Theresa May's request to make changes to their deal covering Britain's departure from the EU on March 29. British legislators aren't satisfied with the terms May negotiated, and she canceled a scheduled vote earlier this week because it was clear Parliament wouldn't approve it. Britain's economy and financial markets across Europe face severe disruption without an agreement.In other trading:-European bond prices rose and yields fell. Both the British pound and the euro weakened. The pound slipped to $1.2579 from $1.2660 and the euro fell to $1.1303 from $1.1367.-Germany's DAX declined 0.5 percent and the CAC 40 in France declined 0.8 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.5 percent.-Japan's Nikkei 225 index slid 2 percent and the Kospi in South Korea lost 1.3 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng was down 1.6 percent.-Bond prices edged higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.89 percent 2.90 percent.-In other commodities trading, wholesale gasoline lost 3 percent to $1.43 a gallon. Heating oil fell 1.7 percent to $1.85 a gallon and natural gas dropped 7.2 percent to $3.83 per 1,000 cubic feet.-Gold fell 0.5 percent to $1,241.40 an ounce. Silver dipped 1.5 percent to $14.64 an ounce. Copper was little changed at $2.77 a pound.-The dollar fell to 113.29 yen from 113.60 yen.____Associated Press Writer Josh Boak contributed to this report from Washington.___AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAPLoad-Date: December 15, 2018End of Document

Global SMT Carrier Tape Market Size Worth USD 144.0 Million by 2025: Hexa ResearchPR NewswireDecember 18, 2018 Tuesday 7:10 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1248 wordsDateline: FELTON, California, December 18, 2018 BodyPR NewswireThe globalsurface mount technology (SMT) carrier tape marketsize is expected to reach USD 144.0 million by 2025. Increasing demand for electronic components in the manufacturing sector including automotive, consumer electronics, medical devices, and industrial automation is expected to boost the market growth in near future. Furthermore, increasing preference for Electric Vehicles (EVs) in major economies including Germany and China on account of rising concerns regarding harmful emissions is expected to fuel the demand for passive components, thereby augmenting market growth. Raw materials, such as, paper and thermoplastics including polycarbonate and polystyrene are used to manufacture SMT tapes. Crude oil is expected to remain one of the key commodities used in plastic production.Fluctuating crude oil prices are expected to put additional pressure on plastic manufacturers. Furthermore, the prices of raw materials, especially, pulp and paper is increasing at a steady pace. These factors may hamper the market growth. Asia Pacific leads the global market on account of expanding manufacturing sector in automobiles, consumer electronics, and medical device industries in countries like China, India, Taiwan, Singapore, Japan, and Indonesia. Favorable government policies are supporting electronic component manufacturing, thereby boosting the regional product demand. For instance, the Chinese government provides subsidy to Taiwanese manufacturers if they hire local workers.India is one of the emerging markets for white goods and consumer electronics. The government of India has started programs like Digital India and Make in India, which encourage electronic component manufacturing. The government has also allowed 100% Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) for the Electronics Systems Design & Manufacturing sector, which, in turn, is projected to boost the product demand. Moreover, in July 2018, Samsung announced that it will be expanding its manufacturing unit by investing USD 745.82 million to increase the production capacity from 68 million to 120 million devices. Thus, favorable government initiatives coupled with demand for mobiles and electronic products are expected to propel the demand for SMT carrier tapes in India.Browse full research report with TOC on"Surface Mount Technology (SMT) Carrier Tape Market Size And Forecast, By Product (Plastic SMT Tape, Paper SMT Tape), By Application (Consumer Electronics, Communication, Healthcare, Automotive, Industrial) And Trend Analysis, 2015 - 2025"at:https://www.hexaresearch.com/research-report/surface-mount-technology-smt-carrier-tape-marketThe advent of energy-efficient electronic components including passive components due to escalating demand for smart electronic devices is also likely to support market growth. On a global level, the sales of electronic circuit components from exports was estimated to USD 629 billion in 2017. Since 2013, exports of these components increased by 24% for all the exporting countries. Asia led with 86% of the global market share in 2017. Europe held the second position and accounted for around 7.0% market share, while North America held 6.0% of the total market share. Stringent government regulation to reduce carbon footprint and plastic usage is forcing manufacturers to develop biodegradable embossed carrier tape.For instance, in August 2017, 3M introduced polycarbonate carrier 3000 tape, which is a recyclable, carbon-filled thermoplastic polymer film. Furthermore, carrier tape machine manufacturers are adopting integration strategy owing to the increasing demand from healthcare, automotive, and consumer electronic sectors. Moreover, manufacturers are relocating their units in China and Taiwan to reduce production cost. The global SMT carrier tape market is moving towards fragmentation. 3M; Advantek, Inc.; Carrier Tech Precision Co., Ltd.; Taiwan Carrier Tape Enterprise Co., Ltd.; Oji F-Tex Co., Ltd.; ITW ECPS; C-Pak Pte.

Nibble on This Bearish Strategy in Shake Shack: Market ReconRealMoneyNovember 2, 2018 Friday 7:58 AM EDTCopyright 2018 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1486 wordsByline: Stephen GuilfoyleHighlight: SHAK beat expectations for both EPS and revenue, but same-store sales decreased. Here is how I would play it.BodyRisk On?I'll be honest, I did enjoy the broad boost in  sentiment that could be felt across equity markets, and quite frankly across the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday afternoon. Now, I can be wrong. You and I both know this. Though I did expect October to be volatile (a very easy thing for financial talking heads to say), I did not expect, and certainly did not call the correction that hit most of us in the rib-cage last month.However, even though I still see issues down the road regarding the problems that can be caused by both hostile monetary policy and reckless fiscal policy, November sets up as very interesting. The veil of uncertainty over who will control congress -- in particular, the House of Representatives -- will be lifted by Tuesday. This will be a market positive, as long as gains on the left fall short of a veto-proof majority, and nobody sees anything close to that happening. Those tweets though...Everything Chinese is now suddenly hot. President Trump tweets about a "very good" conversation with President Xi. "The discussions are moving along nicely," as apparently President Trump seems to have asked plans to be drawn up for some kind of trade deal with China ahead of the two men meeting toward the end of the month at the G-20 summit in Buenos Aires. International markets cheered this news across the globe -- from China to Japan to Europe. Safe-haven assets, such as the U.S. dollar and U.S. sovereign debt securities, finally seem to be taking a breather. The softer U.S. dollar alone is a welcome support for our domestic marketplace.Election Head-Fake?Tough question. Some are mentioning this. Though there is no doubt that both nations have started to feel enough of the strain created by this conflict to motivate negotiation. I don't know President Trump, but I have spoken to his economic adviser Larry Kudlow many times off set as I have followed him on financial TV a number of times. I know him to be careful in his words, and in my opinion... to be very honest. The fact that Mr. Kudlow used the word "thaw" in describing U.S. / China relations after the presidents spoke is, in my opinion, somewhat significant. The danger of course, would be a failure to make progress in Argentina. Both presidents need to be able to present a perception of victory.One more thing. I guess that many of you have noticed the Commerce Department's indictment of Fujian Jinhua, a mainland Chinese corporation, and Microelectronics Corporation of Taiwan for stealing trade secrets from U.S. memory chip manufacturer Micron Technology  . The fact that three Taiwanese nationals are included in this action might be seen as some kind of olive branch by the Chinese government. Might be.Jobs DayThis might just be the monthly "Jobs Day" that I have been asked about the very least since I have been doing the financial media circuit. It is as if suddenly nobody cares. I think that they better care. The central bank has been overtly hostile toward U.S. economic growth. Though we all see the obvious danger to the yield curve caused by putting upward pressure on short-term interest rates while simultaneously draining potential liquidity, those making these decisions do not. Six years later, the permanent damage done to the yield curve during the "Operation Twist" era has never been addressed, nor even mentioned as an economic condition in need of repair.That said, instead of buckling down and doing the necessary homework, our central bankers will likely focus solely upon today's wage-growth numbers, as well as the results from next month's BLS results -- when they decide on once again increasing their target for the Fed Funds Rate on December 19, the next meeting that will come complete with the dog and pony show.Although we already know that today's numbers will be a little lumpy, thanks to the storms that hit the panhandle of Florida and the U.S. southeastern coastal states, we also know that the year-over-year print for wage growth that could hit the tape above 3% is dangerous going forward. Are we rooting against out own labor force? Of course not. We just hope that if the growth is there, that it sticks.FYIWhat has become obvious, I think, is that U.S. oil producers as well as international players have been aggressive ahead of U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil. That action will be implemented on Monday. Of particular interest this week, I thought was not the domestic inventory build. That did not surprise all that much. The fact that U.S. production had hit an incredible 11.3 million barrels per day? That's a shocking print. And in my opinion, the primary reason for how sharply crude prices have declined, along with dollar strength.My thought here runs along the lines of the pre-tariff inventory builds that we have seen across other industries that now impact domestic manufacturing surveys. How long will it take the planet to work through this runup in production from the U.S., from Iran, form the rest of OPEC? It could take months.In the meantime, I am adding to my exploration and production names on the weakest days for the group. My thought is to inch along in small increments here. For me, those names are British Petroleum  , Royal Dutch Shell  , and ExxonMobil  , which reports Friday morning. I would add to oil services, but I have been long and wrong that space for a bit. My Schlumberger  long position is sizable enough, for now. The underlying positive for all of these names is that they are all solid dividend payers, and I feel belong in any well-diversified portfolio. (BP and SLB are holdings of Action Alerts Plus.)The DriveAbout a mile and a half from where I live, on a main road, there is a little place that sells cheeseburgers, french fries and milkshakes. I mean the food at this place is delicious. Every time I drive past it, my brain really wants to stop there for a meal. It's tempting. This is where having a spouse comes in handy. I will forget my age for a good cheeseburger. My bride will not.Apparently, we are not the only ones currently driving past Shake Shack  locations these days as we go about our business. SHAK reported its third quarter  night. You may have been   results at the time, so perhaps you did not notice. SHAK beat expectations for both EPS and revenue. The bad news? Same-store sales decreased. That's right... -0.7% versus a projected +0.9%. How does consensus miss the  that badly, unless every one is copying someone else's homework. If this was fifth grade back in the day, the nuns would have had a field day.The firm has also guided toward a few less new store openings than had previously been planned, but actually raised its corporate outlook for full-year revenue (but still below the questionable industry consensus). Needless to say, investors did not only flee this name overnight, they have been in flight since early Summer.What screams out from this year-to-date chart of SHAK is the strict technical obedience that this stock has shown to both a 61.8% retracement of the February-through-June move higher, and the recent upper chamber of the downward-sloping Pitchfork model.Given that this name is off more than 5% overnight, it becomes difficult for me to price options' premiums for you in the wee hours of the morning. I will tell you this, however. I think the stock is too expensive in relation to sales. Way, way, way too expensive. I would have loved to have gotten short this name this week, but I'm not that sharp.SHAK: What The Cheeseburger Kid Can DoWhat I can still do, in a risk-controlled way, is get long what is known as a "bear put spread." In a Utopian world, I would like to purchase $50 puts expiring the third week of December, while writing $42.50 puts of the same expiration. If the underlying equity adheres to my Pitchfork, this trade is doable.The trader would be at risk for the net debit paid on the premiums. That's the worst case. Max revenue on these positions would be $7.50. My thought is if I can put this trade on for $3 or less, for me this becomes worth it in terms of the risk/reward. Otherwise, I'll find something else to do Friday morning.October Employment Situation(08:30 ET)Non-Farm Payrolls: Expecting 190K, Last 134K.Average Hourly Earnings: Expecting 3.1% y/y, Last 2.8% y/y.Average Workweek: Expecting 34.5 hrs, Last 34.5 hrs.Participation Rate: Expecting 62.8%, Last 62.7%.Unemployment Rate: Expecting 3.8%, Last 3.7%.Underemployment Rate: Last 7.5%.Other Economics (All Times Eastern) 08:30 - Balance of Trade (Sept):Expecting $-53.5B, Last $-53.2B.10:00 - Factory Orders (Sept):Expecting 0.4% m/m, Last 2.3% m/m.10:00 - ex-Transportation (February): Expecting 0.1% m/m, Last 0.1% m/m.13:00 - Baker Hughes Oil Rig Count (Weekly):Last 875.Today's Earnings Highlights (Consensus EPS Expectations) Before the Open: (2.01),  (1.12),  (2.09),  (1.51),  (1.21),  (1.56),  (1.56)After the Close: (0.95)Load-Date: November 3, 2018End of Document

Rice professor under investigation for role in 'world's first gene-edited babies'CNN.comNovember 27, 2018 Tuesday 11:55 AM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: HEALTHLength: 835 wordsByline: By Sandee LaMotte, CNNBodyRice University is investigating bioengineering professor Michael Deem after he was quoted in media reports as having been involved with the work of He Jiankui, the Chinese researcher who claims to have created the world's first gene-edited babies.Deem was He's adviser at Rice for 3Â½ years and published three papers with He."This research raises troubling scientific, legal and ethical questions," said Doug Miller, director of Rice University's media relations team. In a statement, Miller said Rice had "no knowledge of this work.""We have begun a full investigation of Dr. Deem's involvement in this research."He claims that he used a tool called CRISPR-Cas9, which can insert or deactivate certain genes, to alter the CCR5 gene in the DNA of several embryos to make them resistant to HIV.Two babies, twin girls named Lulu and Nana, were supposedly born a "few weeks ago," He announced in a video on YouTube, saying they were "as healthy as any other babies" and were home with their parents, Grace and Mark.He defended his his work Wednesday at the Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing conference in Hong Kong and announced that there was a second pregnancy using genetically edited eggs, which he said was in an early stage.Worldwide reaction to He's Sunday announcement was swift. Hundreds of Chinese biomedical and AIDS researchers issued statements condemning the research. Several scientists said the experiment was "monstrous," "premature, dangerous and irresponsible." The Chinese government announced an "immediate investigation" to verify He's claims, questioning the ethical approval process and wondering whether the families were adequately informed of the nature of the experiment.Deem has not responded to CNN's calls and emails but told The Associated Press that he was in China with the families at the time they gave consent and "absolutely" believed they understood the risks.Deem also said he holds "a small stake" and is on the scientific advisory board of two of He's companies.Rice University said it did not believe that any of the clinical work was performed in the United States, but "regardless of where it was conducted, this work as described in press reports, violates scientific conduct guidelines and is inconsistent with ethical norms of the scientific community and Rice University."While at Rice, Deem has worked extensively on influenza vaccine efficacy, immune system modulation and HIV. Deem also says a research interest is the "mathematical model of evolution that accounts for cross-species genetic exchange."A recent paper by Deem on math modeling for flu was co-written by biomedical ethics researcher Kirstin Matthews at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy.Matthews wrote in an email that she was surprised "to find out that Professor Deem was involved in this research." Adding that she had only recently began working with Deem, she said she had not "seen anything to suggest that Professor Deem's scientific work is in question," nor did she believe any data in co-authored paper was affected."Had Professor Deem informed me of his work using CRISPR on human embryos to develop a baby, I would have recommended extreme caution using this technology on human embryos and to wait for more data on risks before using manipulated embryos for pregnancies," Matthews wrote.Deem's past work has been funded by various governmental agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, but spokeswoman Renate Myles said Deem has not received a grant from that agency since 2014.In a statement Wednesday, Director Dr. Francis Collins reiterated the agency's stance against gene-editing in human embryos and expressed deep concern over He's behavior:"This work represents a deeply disturbing willingness by Dr. He and his team to flaunt international ethical norms. The project was largely carried out in secret, the medical necessity for inactivation of CCR5 in these infants is utterly unconvincing, the informed consent process appears highly questionable, and the possibility of damaging off-target effects has not been satisfactorily explored."Should such epic scientific misadventures proceed, a technology with enormous promise for prevention and treatment of disease will be overshadowed by justifiable public outrage, fear, and disgust."According to a news release on the Rice University website, He became a graduate student under Deem in 2007 and co-wrote several papers "of tremendous significance" with Deem.He, who the university says was "the son of rice farmers in Hunan Province in China," was lead author with Deem on a paper presenting a mathematical model that could determine within two weeks whether a new strain of the influenza virus should be included in the annual seasonal flu vaccine. The World Health Organization's model takes up to six months."Jiankui is a very high-impact student," Deem said in 2010. "He has done a fantastic job here at Rice, and I am sure he will be highly successful in his career."Load-Date: November 29, 2018End of Document

Continue reading How Congress missed another chance to hold big tech accountableFrom time to time the entire technology press corps gets together on Twitter, spends several hours live-tweeting the same event, and then writes a series of blog posts about how nothing important happened. This event is known as a Congressional hearing, and today we witnessed our final one of the year.After months of polite deferrals, Sundar Pichai finally went before Congress on Tuesday, and over the course of three and a half hours, said as little as possible. The hearing before the House Judiciary Committee was defined, as had been the Facebook hearings before it, by the widespread befuddlement of our lawmakers.There was, for example, the question from Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) about why a picture of Donald Trump comes up when you Google  idiot.  Adi Robertson has the correct answer, for the record:News outlets reported on the Trump  idiot  results earlier this year. If you search the term now, in fact, you ll mostly get pictures from stories explaining why it happened. It appeared to be the result of outside parties gaming Google s search results, a well-known tactic known as  Google bombing. Trump isn t the first president to get Google-bombed: in the mid-2000s, searches for  miserable failure  famously returned results about President George W. Bush. It can be a politicized (or just funny) extension of normal search engine optimization tactics. In this case, it s convincing Google that a Trump picture is what most people want when they search for  idiot,  by upvoting or linking to posts with that combination of words and images.Then there was the moment that Rep. Steve King (R-IA) asked Pichai   the CEO, we repeat, of Google   to explain why his daughter s iPhone was behaving strangely: I have a seven-year-old granddaughter who picked up her phone during the election, and she s playing a little game, the kind of game a kid would play,  King told Pichai.  And up on there pops a picture of her grandfather. And I m not going to say into the record what kind of language was used around that picture of her grandfather, but I d ask you: how does that show up on a seven-year-old s iPhone, who s playing a kid s game? Adi Robertson took a crack at that one, too:It s not clear what King was referring to, but it s possible his granddaughter s iPhone (or possibly Android phone) was displaying a notification card about a news story. The language around his photo may forever remain a mystery, but during campaign season, there was no shortage of writers with strong feelings about King s numerous racist and anti-immigrant statements, or his endorsement of a Canadian white nationalist mayoral candidate. In any case, during the hearing, King also suggested that Congress should check Google employees  social media profiles to monitor their political leanings   so some confusing troubleshooting requests were probably the least of Pichai s worries.But before we write off Congress entirely, it s worth noting that they did attempt to get to the bottom of the Project Dragonfly situation. Is Google building a censored search engine for China   the subject of much internal dissent   or is it not? Here s Ryan Gallagher in The Intercept.Pichai repeatedly insisted that Dragonfly was an  internal effort  and the Google currently had  no plans to launch a search service in China.  Asked to confirm that the company would not launch  a tool for surveillance and censorship in China,  Pichai declined to answer, instead saying that he was committed to  providing users with information, and so we always   we think it s ideal to explore possibilities. ... We ll be very thoughtful, and we will engage widely as we make progress. Pichai s claim that the company does not have a plan to launch the search engine in China contradicted a leaked transcript from a private meeting inside the company. In the transcript, the company s search chief Ben Gomes discussed an aim to roll out the service between January and April 2019. For Pichai s statement to Congress to be truthful, there is only one possibility: that the company has put the brakes on Dragonfly since The Intercept first exposed the project in August.Despite lawmakers  efforts to follow up, they didn t break much new ground. (Though in a follow-up interview with the Washington Post, Pichai seemed to suggest Project Dragonfly might wind up being something other than search:  Can we explore and serve users in China, in areas like education and healthcare?  he said.  We may not end up doing search. We re trying to understand a market. )Why did reporters have better luck with Pichai today than Congress did? Shira Ovide, reading my mind, lays the blame with the bizarre structure of these hearings, which gives maximum opportunity for witnesses to wriggle out of questioning:Pichai repeatedly fell back to saying that this China project is  exploratory  and that Google will be transparent if it moves ahead. That s not a good enough answer. He needs to say how many employees are working on this project, what Google s criteria are for returning web search to China and whether Google will build tools that will enable the Chinese government to surveil its own citizens without their knowledge.To be clear, I don t want to repeat the false idea that members of Congress are old luddites who aren t able or willing to understand how tech companies work. Some members of Congress asked great questions on Tuesday. Some of them did not. This format, however, does not feel like a good way to decide public policy. 1 The thorny topic of the power of big technology companies deserves much better than this from all sides.What would help? Lawmakers demonstrating basic platform literacy; anticipating the non-answers that tech CEOs have prepared for them; scripting more penetrating follow-up questions; coordinating avenues of attack with their fellow representatives. Lawmakers might also try to debate their proposed solutions with CEO   bringing real policy questions to the table, instead of simple gotcha-oriented soundbites.For their part, tech CEOs could do better answering the spirit of lawmakers  questions, even when those lawmakers get the details wrong. It s usually apparent what a lawmaker is concerned about, even if it s not entirely clear how they have been led to their often bizarre and conspiratorial conclusions. Pichai, for example, could have spent more time talking about why Google has a strong financial incentive to keep search results free of political bias, rather than simply asserting, over and over again, that it does so.Maybe next year.DemocracyRussia fines Google for not complying with search results law: TASSRussia has issued what may be the smallest fine ever issued against Google, Reuters reported:Russia fined Google 500,000 roubles ($7,530) on Tuesday for failing to comply with a legal requirement to remove certain entries from its search results, Russia s communications watchdog was quoted as saying by TASS news agency.Russia said last month that it had opened a civil case against Google as it had not joined a state registry that lists banned websites that Moscow believes contain illegal information and was therefore not compliant with the law.Leaked Audio Reveals Google s Efforts to Woo ConservativesNitasha Tiku gets a hold of leaked audio from March in which Googlers describe their efforts to win over conservatives:In February, The New York Times Magazine published a cover story urging regulators to break up Google because the company abuses its dominance in search to crush promising competitors. The next day, representatives from two conservative think tanks published blog posts defending Google and attacking the article s call for antitrust enforcement. Both think tanks have received funding from Google. Both blog posts referenced studies by a professor who has received fundingfrom Google. In one post, the study referenced was published in a quarterly journalowned by third think tank, which has also received funding from Google.In a company-wide meeting a couple of weeks later, on March 1, Google s public policy team described the blog posts as the fruit of Google s efforts to build deeper relationships with conservatives, according to an audio recording of the meeting reviewed by WIRED. The recording of a contentious hour-long meeting offers a window into how Google thinks about its relationships in Washington, DC, its sensitivity to claims of political bias, and how executives explain to employees actions that some view as at odds with Google s values.Political tweets,  infowars  and a Russia: how a fake news row went mainstreamWas a row about an anti-disinformation think tank part of a Russian influence campaign? Labour and the Foreign Office disagreeLinkedIn co-founder backs $35 million voter data project in  existential threat  to Democratic PartyLinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman plans to spend $35 million a definitive voter database for Democrats, raising the possibility that some good will have come from building LinkedIn:With tens of millions of dollars at their disposal, the people behind Hoffman-backed project could eventually create their own voter file, making the Democratic Party s file less valuable. That process, however, would likely take several years and would be nearly impossible to complete by the 2020 election.As a result, DNC officials say the committee is open to collaborating with Hoffman, or perhaps joining forces with him.ElsewhereHateful conspiracies thrive on YouTube, despite pledge to clean up  problematic  videosCraig Timberg, Elizabeth Dwoskin, Tony Romm, and Andrew Ba Tran have a fresh entry in the genre of content that involves searching YouTube for terrible things and then writing about what you find:YouTube is particularly valuable to users of Gab.ai and 4chan, social media sites that are popular among hate groups but have scant video capacity of their own. Users on these sites link to YouTube more than to any other website, thousands of times a day, according to the recent work of Data and Society and the Network Contagion Research Institute, both of which track the spread of hate speech.The platform routinely serves videos espousing neo-Nazi propaganda, phony reports portraying dark-skinned people as violent savages and conspiracy theories claiming that large numbers of leading politicians and celebrities molested children. Critics say that even though YouTube removes millions of videos on average each month, it is slow to identify troubling content and, when it does, is too permissive in what it allows to remain.PewDiePie gives shout out to hateful, anti-Semitic YouTube channelYouTube s most popular creator, the man known as PewDiePie, has a history of bad behavior. Most recently he promoted a channel known for its hateful content, Julia Alexander reports:E;R s videos are disturbing. They often use the guise of film, anime, or cartoon criticism to convey anti-Semitic and hateful thoughts or imagery. This is particularly disturbing when linked to Kjellberg, who dealt with his own controversy after showing men holding up a sign reading  Death to All Jews  in 2017.Facebook is hiring engineers and researchers for its blockchain teamDoes the current bear market in cryptocurrency make it easier or harder for Facebook to hire for its blockchain team? Please reply if you know!Facebook wants to add a data scientist, a data engineer, and a couple of software engineers to its growing blockchain team, according to its careers page (viaSludgeFeed). The blockchain team is a startup within Facebook, with a vision to make blockchain technology work at Facebook scale,  the ads say.  It s a small, fast-growing, but talented group of people who are passionate about changing the world.  Social media outpaces print newspapers in the U.S. as news sourceOne in five Americans say they get their news via social media  often,  according to new Pew data, slightly higher than the 16 percent who say they often get their news from newspapers. Elisa Shearer:Overall, television is still the most popular platform for news consumption   even though its use has declined since 2016. News websites are the next most common source, followed by radio, and finally social media sites and print newspapers. And when looking at online news use combined   the percentage of Americans who get news often from either news websites or social media   the web has closed in on television as a source for news (43% of adults get news often from news websites or social media, compared with 49% for television).LaunchesFacebook opening Bryant Park pop-up to teach users about privacyPart of me wants to fly to New York just to experience the surreal majesty of the Facebook privacy pop-up kiosk in person. It will take place on Thursday in midtown, Nicolas Vega reports: It s been a tough year, and people have a lot of questions,  Khaliah Barnes, a privacy and public policy manager at Facebook, told The Post.  We wanted to have the opportunity to connect with people face to face. Visitors to the kiosk, to be located next to Bryant Park s Holiday Market, will be able to stop by without an appointment, speak with Facebook employees and drink free hot chocolate.Facebook relaunches search ads to offset slowing revenueFacebook is bringing back search ads, Josh Constine reports:The reintroduction of search ads could open an important new revenue stream at a time when Facebook s revenue growth is quickly decelerating as it runs out of News Feed ad space, the Stories format that advertisers are still adapting is poised to overtake feed sharing on social apps and users shift their time elsewhere. In Q3 2018, revenue grew 33 percent year-over-year, but that s far slower than the 49 percent YOY gain it had a year ago, and the 59 percent from Q3 2016. Opening up new ad inventory for search could reinvigorate the sagging revenue growth rate that, combined with Facebook s privacy and security scandals, has put intense pressure on Facebook s leaders Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg.Instagram is testing Creator Accounts for high-profile influencersInstagram is launching  Creator Accounts  to give high-profile users additional controls and analytics.TakesDelete All Your AppsIn the aftermath of the New York Times  story on how app developers use and abuse location-history data, Jason Koebler suggests it s time to delete all of our apps. Bold!This problem is getting worse, not better: Facebook made WhatsApp, an app that managed to be profitable with a $1 per year subscription fee, into a  free  service because it believed it could make more money with an advertising-based business model.What this means is that the dominant business model on our smartphones is one that s predicated on monetizing you, and only through paying obsessive attention to your app permissions and seeking paid alternatives can you hope to minimize these impacts on yourself. If this bothers you, your only options are to get rid of your smartphone altogether or to rethink what apps you want installed on your phone and act accordingly.Facebook Has Better Uses for Its Cash Than Stock BuybacksShira Ovide wishes Facebook wasn t planning to spend $9 billion buying up its own stock:If I were making a short list, I would put on it hiring more moderators to do the terrible, laborious work of actively sniffing out hoaxes, election-related tamperingand calls to violence on Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and other Facebook-owned hangouts. It might not hurt to increase investment on cybersecurity to do more to prevent foreign governments from using Facebook as a tool for propaganda or to prevent thieves from taking advantage of Facebook software loopholes to compromise accounts of tens of millions of people. Facebook could spend even more on policy wonks to shape and prepare for more heavy-handed regulation of tech companies. I could go on.And finally  Twitter is often the story of a company that can t stop hitting itself, and in the wake of Jack Dorsey s recent public lashing over his Burmese meditation retreat, the CEO has decided to land a few more self-inflicted blows.jack@jack · Dec 9, 2018 Replying to @jackThanks for reading!

LEADER MCCARTHY DISCUSSES THE GOOGLE HEARING WITH MARTHA MACCALLUMStates News ServiceDecember 12, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 372 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON D.C. BodyThe following information was released by the office of House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy:House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (CA-23) joined The Story with Martha MacCallum to discuss Google CEO Sundar Pichai's appearance in front of the House Judiciary Committee.Excerpts of the interview are below, or watch online here.[embedded content]"The first thing you have to understand is how powerful Google is. The Wall Street Journal says 90% of all searches on the internet go through Google. Think about that power, if you end up the amount of information you are gathered, the power of what they have you see, two-thirds of all adults get their information from the internet and Google also owns YouTube. So the thing that concerned me the most, of course it was privacy, of course it was political bias but what really concerned me was the dealings with China, this Dragonfly. Remember in 2010, I gave Google a lot of credit, they pulled out of China because they said they didn't want to censure individuals in there, see what they are doing on the internet. But now they talk about doing Dragonfly. He said they weren't working with the Chinese government but they had 100 engineers working on a long-term project. To have 100 engineers working on a project such as that, concerns me about what's going forward and Sundar did not rule out of one day reentering China. And remember, when Google was created, their motto was 'Do No Harm.' They took that away a year or so ago, I wonder why.""This administration has some real some concerns about some of the technology that China is doing. Remember, about Tencent and others. Those technology companies are real concerning to me. My true belief is a free world needs a free and open internet. So what does Google want to be? Do they want to be part of the free world? The things that China do about reeducating people that they disagree with their religions, monitoring individuals. I mean remember what China recently came out with, that they're going to score individuals inside the actions of their own government about whether they could even get on the bus or not. That's a real concern to me about moving forward and I don't think Google would want to be a part of that."Load-Date: December 12, 2018End of Document

Huawei hasn t given up hope in playing US 5G role.Huawei has urged US authorities to reconsider the effective ban on its equipment in the country, claiming that the current measures will ultimately delay the rollout of 5G.The telecommunications equipment manufacturer has been virtually frozen out of the US market because its kit is believed to be a national security risk due to perceived links with the Chinese government.The US fears that Huawei equipment could have backdoors that would facilitate Chinese espionage   allegations that the company has continually denied.• What is 5G? Everything you need to knowHuawei 5GAustralia recently passed measures that will prevent Huawei from supplying 5G equipment to its operators, but other countries have not had the same level of concern. In the UK, Huawei is a key supplier to several operators and will pay a vital role in 5G rollout.In its latest submission to the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Huawei argues that it generates 60 per cent of its revenues outside China and sells products to more than 500 operators in 170 countries without issue   including to some smaller US networks.Should it continue to be frozen out of the US market, it says that prices will rise, harming consumers and harming innovation. Ultimately, it claims, this could delay 5G rollout and hand the momentum to global rivals like China. In the US, where Huawei s share of the telecommunications infrastructure equipment market is small and equipment prices are resultantly higher than in other markets, Huawei primarily serves small carriers in rural and remote areas,  said the filing. Huawei urged the Commission to consider the substantial costs of the [proposals], in particular its impact on carriers in rural and remote areas, many of whom are attracted to Huawei as a result of Huawei s commitment to affordable, quality products and attentive customer service. Furthermore, Huawei s lack of presence in the US would raise prices, harm competition, hinder innovation, and ultimately delay 5G deployment. The filing suggests Huawei hasn t given up in its bid to play a role in the US market where its effective exclusion has allowed Nokia and Ericsson to agree huge deals with carriers. Ericsson is investing significant amounts in R&D and manufacturing in a bid to accelerate the rollout of 5G in the US.See Campaign:https://www.techradar.com/news/huawei-tells-fcc-that-us-ban-could-mean-country-falls-behind-in-5gContact Information:Steve McCaskillTags:,            Wire,            Artificial Intelligence Newswire,            United States,            EnglishLoad-Date: October 4, 2018End of Document

Why this Idaho chipmaker is suddenly at the center of the US-China trade warCNN WireNovember 4, 2018 Sunday 6:42 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 918 wordsByline: Analysis by Julia Horowitz, CNN BusinessDateline: NEW YORK (CNN Business) BodyNEW YORK (CNN Business) --  Micron, a company in Idaho that makes memory chips, has been locked in bitter trade secrets dispute with a state-backed Chinese rival called Fujian Jinhua. Now it has the US government in its corner. Last week, the Trump administration targeted Fujian Jinhua in a major escalation of its push against alleged economic espionage. On Thursday, the Justice Department charged Fujian Jinhua, along with a Taiwanese company and three Taiwanese individuals, with conspiracy to steal trade secrets from Micron. The charges move the government's attack on Chinese intellectual property theft beyond tariffs and tough talk.The charges, along with a ban on American companies from doing business with Fujian Jinhua, gives Micron the "upper hand" in its tangle with the Chinese company, said Mehdi Hosseini, a semiconductor analyst at Susquehanna International Group. "They now have more ammunition to make sure the memory industry in China is marginalized," he said.Micron's allegationsMicron (MU), which was founded in 1978, is the largest memory chip maker in the United States and directly competes with the biggest players in the global market, according to Hosseini. In recent years, the company has had to contend with a growing threat from China, which has made building successful homegrown semiconductor companies a pillar of its plans to become a global tech powerhouse. Fujian Jinhua has been building a $5.7 billion plant in southeastern China to get in the game, and it's far from the only player.Micron sued Fujian Jinhua and Taiwanese semiconductor company UMC in California federal court in December 2017. Micron claimed that as early as 2015, UMC and Jinhua devised a plan to get former employees of Micron's Taiwanese affiliate to steal Micron's trade secrets and deliver them to UMC, which would then pass them to Jinhua.According to Micron's complaint, UMC would get $700 million in research and development equipment and fees in return, as well as co-ownership in the resulting technology.Former employees of the Micron affiliate in 2015 and 2016 successfully pilfered tech secrets from the company by uploading confidential data to their laptops, removable drives and Google drives before they left the firm, Micron said.The case is still working its way through the court system. And Micron has since had to battle a countersuit in Chinese court from Jinhua and UMC, which filed a patent infringement suit against Micron in January. The court in July temporarily barred Micron from selling 26 products in the country including memory chips, memory sticks and hard drives.Micron said it only learned about the Trump administration's export ban after it was announced on Tuesday. "Micron strongly supports global fair trade and the protection of intellectual property," a spokesperson said in a statement.On Thursday, after the Justice Department announced the charges against Fujian Jinhua and UMC, Micron's general counsel commended the agency's decision to "prosecute the criminal theft of our intellectual property."UMC said in a statement Friday that it "takes seriously any allegation that it may have violated any laws," and "fully intends to respond to [the Justice Department] allegations accordingly."It's no surprise that Micron said it appreciated the government's legal action."This lawsuit corners new entrants out of China," Hosseini said. As China pumps billions into technology such as semiconductors, it's a vital edge.Trade war impactMicron's claims of economic espionage are given heft by the US government's lawsuit. But filing charges against the Chinese firm also serves a political purpose for the Trump administration.Negotiations with Beijing could be back on after President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke on the phone Thursday and said they were willing to meet at the upcoming G20 summit in Argentina. A Bloomberg report early Friday said that Trump has asked officials to draft a trade deal with China ahead of the meeting.The buzz could be a ploy to boost markets ahead of next week's midterm elections, according to Michael Every, head of Asia financial markets research at investment bank Rabobank. But should talks resume, the United States could find itself in a stronger position.Fujian Jinhua probably can't operate without access to US software and technology, according to analysts."These actions are meant both to increase leverage in the current negotiations and as a deterrent to others," said Scott Kennedy, an expert on the Chinese economy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "The US isn't going follow the standard playbook any longer because it has only emboldened China."When the United States went after Chinese phone and telecom equipment company ZTE earlier in the year, it said it was the result of specific, sanctions-related violations. Implementing export controls with a sweeping national security rationale is different, according to Dan Wang, technology analyst at Gavekal Research."Unlike the ban on ZTE, the US action against Fujian Jinhua is no one-off penalty for a specific infringement, but part of a much broader policy drive," he said in a note this week, citing the US government's language.The Commerce Department said Fujian Jinhua threatened the supply chain for essential military components.CNN's Jethro Mullen, Daniel Shane, Sherisse Pham and Yong Xiong contributed to this report.TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Sensex, Nifty To Open On Cautious Note On Weak Global CuesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 21, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 456 wordsBody       Indian shares look set to open on a cautious note Friday amid mixed catalysts. While weak global cues may keep underlying sentiment cautious, the downtrend in oil prices and the dollar's weakness in overseas markets may keep local stocks in good stead versus other emerging markets. U.S. crude oil futures rose over 1 percent in Asian trade after tumbling 4.8 percent overnight to $45.88 a barrel, the lowest settlement in seventeen months, weighed down by concerns about excess supply in the market and on worries about possible drop in energy demand. The U.S. dollar hit a three-month low versus the yen as the Fed's policy stance added to investor worries over slowing global growth.  Benchmark indexes Sensex and the Nifty ended a lackluster session slightly lower on Thursday, snapping a seven-session winning streak.  The rupee rose further by 69 paise to close at 69.70 against the dollar, marking its highest closing level since November 30 as the Fed lowered its projection for future hikes. PSU banks could be in focus today after the government said it would infuse Rs. 83,000 crore in state-run banks in the next few months.  Separately, provisional data released by RBI showed that non-food bank credit rose by an annual 15.07 percent during the fortnight ended December 7 from 14.92 percent in the previous fortnight.  Asian stocks followed their U.S. peers lower, with benchmark indexes in Australia, China, Hong Kong, Japan and New Zealand falling over 1 percent on concerns over the global economic outlook.  U.S stocks plunged overnight to extend the sell-off seen in recent sessions, as a government shutdown loomed and investors fretted about the U.S. slipping into a recession in the next few years.  It appeared the federal government could be heading toward a shutdown after President Trump told House Republicans he is unwilling to sign a short-term spending bill approved by the Senate Wednesday night due to a lack of funding for his controversial border wall. Renewed concerns about U.S.-China trade talks also weighed on markets after the Justice Department announced the criminal indictment of two computer hackers associated with the Chinese government. The Dow lost 2 percent while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite fell around 1.6 percent to hit their lowest levels in over a year.  European markets ended Thursday's session deep in the red after the Federal Reserve signaled further rate hikes and the Bank of England warned that Brexit uncertainties had "intensified considerably" during the past month. The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index gave up 1.5 percent. The German DAX tumbled 1.4 percent, France's CAC 40 index shed 1.8 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 declined 0.8 percent.        Load-Date: December 21, 2018End of Document

Protecting Your Security and Rights OnlineTargeted News ServiceDecember 11, 2018 Tuesday 9:20 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1128 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK BodyHuman Rights Watch issued the following news release:* * *- Interactive Game Shows Why Encryption MattersHuman Rights Watch released an interactive online game today to help people understand how important strong encryption is to everyone's security in the digital age. The interactive feature, "Everyday Encryption," shows how encryption protects people in their daily lives.Technology companies and nongovernmental groups rely on encryption to secure sensitive data from malicious actors. At the same time, governments contend that encryption will limit their surveillance capabilities, saying that they are "going dark" in their ability to investigate crime and monitor potential terrorist threats. On December 6, 2018, the Australian parliament rushed to pass the Assistance and Access Bill to enable access to encrypted data. However, cybersecurity experts warn that this would weaken the security measures people rely on every day, in Australia and worldwide."Encryption helps shield our online transactions, personal data, intimate photos, and sensitive communications from prying eyes," said Cynthia Wong, senior internet researcher at Human Rights Watch. "But how these technical defenses work is sometimes opaque, so we hope people who play the game will learn more about how important encryption is to their safety."It is a choose-your-own-adventure style game where the player is asked to guide a character in making choices about how they communicate or manage their data. The game takes around 15 minutes to play and directs users to further resources on digital security and the policy debate on encryption.Encryption scrambles data so that it is only readable by those who have the "key" to decode it. Financial institutions, online file storage services, phone and laptop makers, and other companies regularly use encryption to secure people's personal data from cybercriminals and identity thieves. Websites increasingly support encryption, like Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS), to help shield people's browsing habits from government agencies and others who may monitor their networks. And apps like WhatsApp, Signal, and iMessage encrypt chat messages end-to-end, in which the app provider doesn't retain encryption keys and cannot read messages sent by users.The interactive game, designed by Human Rights Watch's 2017-2018 Ford-Mozilla open web fellow Rebecca Ricks, shows how encryption protects people in their daily lives - when they are surfing the web on a coffee shop's Wi-Fi, for example - and what may happen if encryption built into devices or software is deliberately weakened. The game also demonstrates how encryption helps protect people who often find themselves under disproportionate scrutiny, such as activists, communities of color, or domestic violence survivors seeking safety from abusers.Officials in several countries have begun demanding that companies like Apple, WhatsApp, and Telegram build intentional security weaknesses, known as "backdoors," into their services to allow security agencies to get encrypted data. But this approach would weaken encryption for everyone and make people less safe.In September 2018, law enforcement officials from the Five Eyes intelligence alliance - a group that includes Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States - warned that if companies don't voluntarily facilitate access to encrypted data, the countries "may pursue technological, enforcement, legislation or other measures" to force them to do so.Australia's sweeping new law will allow security agencies to order technology firms to take vaguely described actions to enable access to encrypted data, without adequate judicial oversight and other critical safeguards.The broadly drafted powers could, for example, enable authorities to force Apple and WhatsApp to send users fake software updates that would break encryption, secretly add third parties to users' chats, or turn phones or smart speakers into live listening devices.Australia's law is modelled on the UK's Investigatory Powers Act, which similarly requires companies to potentially introduce intentional security vulnerabilities into encryption. In the US, law enforcement officials continue to call for anti-encryption legislation, even though they have been criticized for overstating the problem encryption poses to investigations. The Federal Bureau of Investigation had earlier tried to force Apple to override security measures built into iPhones to defeat encryption that protects user data. Authorities were investigating the perpetrators of the 2015 attack in San Bernardino, California, but eventually withdrew the court order because they were able to access the phone data without Apple's help through a third-party contractor.In April, Russia's state media and communications watchdog, Roskomnadzor, obtained a court ruling to block Telegram for the company's failure to provide encryption keys to the Federal Security Service under counterterrorism legislation passed in 2016. Roskomnadzor then blocked millions of Internet Protocol addresses in an attempt to cut off access to Telegram inside the country, broadly disrupting access to unrelated websites and services. Iran also blocked Telegram in May and China has similarly passed a cybersecurity law that, if interpreted broadly, could require companies to install backdoors or refrain from using end-to-end encryption. In April 2017, the Chinese government released a Draft Encryption Law that, if passed, could harden backdoor requirements and restrict use of encryption to only pre-approved domestic products.Government efforts to weaken encryption will endanger people and undermine rights. Where software makers do not retain encryption keys, the nearly universal view among cybersecurity experts is that it is impossible to build a backdoor for one government that wouldn't leave all users exposed to people who would try to uncover that vulnerability for malicious purposes.Repressive governments could exploit backdoors to identify "troublemakers" and throw them in jail, and cybercriminals seek them out to steal data for identity theft and credit card fraud. Even former Five Eyes intelligence officials and Europol have warned that undermining encryption for one purpose may have serious and widespread consequences that weaken cybersecurity overall."The debate over backdoors isn't about privacy versus security, but rather inadequate security versus basic security for everyone," Wong said. "With Australia and others passing laws that gut encryption in the technology we use every day, the public has a right to know just how much that will put our safety at risk, online and off."Copyright Targeted News Services11R-Swain-6546014 11R-SwainLoad-Date: December 11, 2018End of Document

In US territory, the outlook for earnings of listed companies is encouraging the stock market.  The week in the markets began with widespread optimism, and Wall Street is no exception. The mood is underpinned by the good news about the Chinese and European economies and the expectation of the results to be presented by several US companies, including Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon.  In New York, the S & P 500 opened 0.19% for the 1,781.52 points, followed by Dow Jones industrialist, who advanced 0.39% to 25,543.92 points and finally the Nasdaq technology, which earns 0.62% to the 7,495.39 points.  There are a total of 160, among the 500 listed companies that comprise the S & P 500 generalist index, to present accounts this week. Among them, highlight Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon: the first has the revelation of results scheduled for Wednesday, 24, while the rest share on October 25, all pronouncing after the closing. Alphabet is adding 0.93% to $ 1,115.48, Microsoft is making a similar move (+ 0.79%) to $ 109.52, while Amazon appreciates 0.99% to 1,781.52.  The economy's growth and significant corporate tax cuts by Donald Trump dictate that the expectation of results point to increases of 22% in the third quarter, Refinity estimates, quoted by Reuters.  Already in China, a cut in the tax burden borne by companies is also causing buzz among investors. The Chinese index has risen more than 4%, the highest since March 2016, and a radical reversal from the four-year low reached in the previous week. The turnaround comes after the Chinese government has pledged to lower the IRS to counterbalance the negative effect of the trade war being waged with the US, in addition to pledging to support business if the economy slows down.  In Europe, he is breathing with relief after the rating agency Moody's decided to keep Italy's rating "off the mark" despite the instability created by Italy's proposed budget for Brussels. In addition, the stable outlook means that, in the short term, Moody's should not place the country's debt in the category of speculative investment. Load-Date: October 22, 2018End of Document

Mid-Day ETF Update: ETFs, Stocks Fall as Volatility, Political Woes and Fading Consumer Confidence WeighMT Newswires Live BriefsDecember 27, 2018 Thursday 1:35 PM ESTCopyright 2018 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 1132 wordsBody Active broad-market exchange-traded funds in Thursday's regular session: SPDR S&P 500 (SPY): -2% iShares MSCI Emerging Index Fund (EEM): -1.3% SPDR Select Sector Fund - Financial (XLF): -1.7% Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 (QQQ): -2.6% iPath S&P 500 VIX ST Futures ETN (VXX):+8.2%Broad Market Indicators Broad-market exchange-traded funds, including IWM and IVV were lower. Actively traded PowerShares QQQ (QQQ) was down 2.6%. US stocks continued to trade lower at session's half, with Wall Street's major indices were trading with outsized losses as all 11 sectors of the S&P 500 and all 30 Dow components fell into the red. Weighed down by fading consumer confidence and declining oil futures, the blue chip index was down as much as 500 points before finding support at the 50% Fibonacci retracement of Wednesday's range. As a result of stock market volatility, political turmoil and a simmering trade war with China, consumer confidence declined in December with the Conference Board index falling to its lowest level since July. But while respondents' views of their current situation were unchanged, the expectations index fell to a two-year low of 99.1 from November's 112.3. Wednesday's massive 1,000+ point rally in the Dow was also compromised by worries that the partial government shutdown will continue through the end of the year after President Donald Trump pledged to do "whatever it takes" to fund his border wall. And trade tensions resurfaced after the White House initiated efforts to ban US companies from conducting business with China's ZTE Corp and Huawei. Thursday morning's other economic data was initial jobless claims, which showed 1,000 fewer individuals filed for first-time unemployment claims for the week ending Dec. 22, in-line with expectations. Power Play: Consumer Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (XLP) was down 1% and Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (VDC) and iShares Dow Jones U.S. Consumer Goods (IYK) were lower. Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) was down 2.6% while retail funds SPDR S&P Retail (XRT) and Market Vectors Retail ETF (RTH) were weaker. China Automotive Systems (CAAS) rose nearly 10% after it said it has entered into a joint-venture agreement with South Korea-based Hyoseong Electric Co. Ltd. to design, manufacture and sell electric motors for automotive electric power steering systems. The company will own 51% of the joint venture, which will be called Hyoseong (Wuhan) Motion Mechatronics Systems, while Hyoseong Electric will own the remaining 49% interest. The JV plans to build a production facility in Wuhan, China for a total investment of RMB550 million ($80.1 million). Winners and Losers Financial The Select Financial Sector SPDRs (XLF) was down 1.8%. Direxion Daily Financial Bull 3X shares (FAS) was down 5.3% and its bearish counterpart Direxion Daily Financial Bear 3X shares (FAZ) was up 5.5%. Wells Fargo & Company (WFC) was down more than 3% after it said that Luxembourg's financial regulator, Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF) has granted a non-objection to the expansion of Wells Fargo Asset Management Luxembourg's (WFAML) existing license. The expansion of the license in Luxembourg will permit the provision of discretionary portfolio management and investment advisory services to Wells Fargo Asset Management's (WFAML) European institutional investors, the lender said. As part of WFAML's efforts to support its European Union client base, it will broaden its presence with branches in Frankfurt and Paris, the bank said. Since 2015, WFAML has served as the management company for WFAM's Luxembourg-domiciled UCITS, which launched in 2008.Technology Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) was down 2.4%, while tech funds iShares Dow Jones US Technology ETF (IYW) and iShares S&P North American Technology ETF (IGM) were in the green. Among semiconductor ETFs, SPDR S&P Semiconductor (XSD) was down 1.7% and Semiconductor Sector Index Fund (SOXX) was down 1.6%. Net Element Inc. (NETE) rose 2% after it said it has acquired certain cash flow assets from Argus Merchant Services LLC and Treasury Payments LLC for a total of $1.42 million. Net Element made the acquisitions through its subsidiary Unified Portfolio Acquisitions, and expects to generate "well over $4 million in gross profits over the next four years" from the assets, it said. In addition, the total billing commitment by Argus to Unified over the next five years is expected to generate more than $19 million in gross margin, said Net Element. Energy Dow Jones US Energy Fund (IYE) was down 2.3% and Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) was down 2.2%. Shale gas output at PetroChina's (PTR) Sichuan field hit a daily record of 20.11 million cubic meters on Dec. 24, more than double volumes on the same day a year ago, Reuters reported. The record output comes after the Chinese government called on oil firms to ramp up the pace of exploration in order to meet the country's energy requirements, the company said in its official newspaper. PetroChina has 143 drilling rigs in use, compared with 38 rigs last year, according to the Reuters report. PTR ADRs fell nearly 3%.Commodities Crude was down 2.8%. United States Oil Fund (USO) was down 3.7%. Natural gas down 1% while United States Natural Gas Fund (UNG) was up 2.1%. Gold was up 0.6%. SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) was up 0.9%. Silver was up 1.4%, while iShares Silver Trust (SLV) was up 1.5%. Health Care Health Care SPDR (XLV) was down 1.4% while other health care funds including Vanguard Health Care ETF (VHT) and iShares Dow Jones U.S. Healthcare (IYH) were lower. Biotechnology fund iShares NASDAQ Biotechnology Index (IBB) was down 2.6%. Retrophin (RTRX) fell nearly 5% after it said that the first patient has been treated in a late-stage clinical trial evaluating the long-term nephroprotective potential of sparsentan for the treatment of IgA nephropathy (IgAN), a rare kidney disorder that often leads to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). "With no approved therapies indicated for IgA nephropathy, dosing the first patient in the pivotal Protect study brings us closer to our goal of ultimately delivering sparsentan as the first approved therapy for patients living with this rare disorder," Retrophin chief medical officer Noah Rosenberg said in a statement. Approximately 280 patients with IgAN, aged 18 years or older, are expected to be randomized to receive either sparsentan or an active control, irbesartan. The primary efficacy endpoint in the study is the change in proteinuria from baseline after 36 weeks of treatment. Retrophin expects enrollment in the study to be completed in H1 2021, and top-line data from the 36-week primary endpoint efficacy analysis to become available in H1 2022. Price: 241.34, Change: -4.84, Percent Change: -1.97Load-Date: December 28, 2018End of Document

Ferguson, Nye discuss modern challenges to democracyeval(ez_write_tag([[728,90],'stanforddaily_com-box-3','ezslot_0']));The Stanford Daily: Stanford UniversityNovember 14, 2018 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 708 wordsByline: Daniel YangBodyOn Tuesday, the Hoover Institution held a panel discussion on the challenges that technological change and the communications revolution pose to democracies. Moderated by former U.S. Secretary of State and Hoover senior fellow Condoleezza Rice, the panel was the third in Hoover's "Governance in an Emerging New World" series, led by former Secretary of State George P. Shultz.Harvard professor and former Kennedy School of Government dean Joseph Nye spoke on the panel with Hoover senior fellow Niall Ferguson, who faced controversy in spring over his own online communications. Specifically, leaked emails in May revealed Ferguson's collaboration with the Stanford College Republicans to conduct "opposition research" on a student.The panelists began by addressing the vulnerabilities of democracy in the age of information warfare. Ferguson discussed the rise of technology in the early 2000s and said that the weaponization of information could be detrimental to democracies if not properly managed."The public sphere in the United States dramatically changed in its structure in less than a decade," Ferguson said. "[There is a] real failure of domestic regulation to manage this transformation and to create an economic protection for the democratic system."Nye added that, while foreign powers could exploit the existing divisions in society through information warfare, the root of the problem should be attributed to cultural changes.The panelists also warned against the "echo chamber" effect, the phenomenon where people tend to seek out or be presented with information that only reinforces their own beliefs or views."Network platforms, as presently constituted, are engines not just of confirmation bias ... but [they] are accentuating divisions in our society in a way that is profoundly dangerous," Ferguson said.The panelists also discussed authoritarian regimes' responses to the information challenge. According to Nye, while authoritarian regimes like China and Russia may use "network sovereignty" - claims to exert control over certain network and cyberspace boundaries - to justify censorship and provide Internet stability in the short run, the centralization of information in this way would prove unsustainable in the long run."If something unpredicted occurs, it's not clear that the system that they've developed in China is going to be properly adapted," Nye said. "Right now they have a tactical advantage, but I'm reluctant to say that authoritarians have the answer."Ferguson added that heavy use of surveillance technology by the Chinese government exposes the authoritarian regime's sense of vulnerability."This is a regime that spends more on domestic security than on national security," Ferguson said. "You don't do that if you don't to some level fear about some people."When asked for suggestions on what the road ahead should be for democracies, both panelists called for corporations to take on more social responsibility and for governments to collaborate on ways to better safeguard the cyberspace.Stone Yang '22 and Stanford Medical School visiting researcher Sophie Neuenfeldt said Tuesday's event was thought-provoking."As someone [who is] not from the political academic world, I was impressed by Ferguson's idea that every topic should be discussed and everyone should be open to discussion," Neuenfeldt said."I think [the panelists] expanded and dug deep into the issues, such as international norm-building, that I have been debating myself," Yang added.The final event in the Hoover series - which will focus on economic development and public transparency in Latin America - will be held on Dec. 3 in the Hauck Auditorium of the Hoover Institution's David & Joan Traitel Building.Elena Shao contributed to this report.Contact Daniel Yang at danieljy 'at' stanford.edu.While you're here...We're a student-run organization committed to providing hands-on experience in journalism, digital media and business for the next generation of reporters.

Nobody's Cellphone Is Really That SecureAtlantic OnlineOctober 26, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1260 wordsByline: Bruce SchneierBodyEarlier this week, The New York Times reported that the Russians and the Chinese were eavesdropping on President Donald Trump's personal cellphone and using the information gleaned to better influence his behavior. This should surprise no one. Security experts have            been           talking           about the potential security vulnerabilities in Trump's cellphone use since he became president. And President Barack Obama            bristled at-but acquiesced to-the            security rules prohibiting him from using a "regular" cellphone throughout his presidency.Three broader questions obviously emerge from the story. Who else is listening in on Trump's cellphone calls? What about the cellphones of other world leaders and senior government officials? And-most personal of all-what about my cellphone calls?There are two basic places to eavesdrop on pretty much any communications system: at the end points and during transmission. This means that a cellphone attacker can either compromise one of the two phones or eavesdrop on the cellular network. Both approaches have their benefits and drawbacks. The NSA seems to prefer bulk eavesdropping on the planet's major communications links and then picking out individuals of interest. In 2016, WikiLeaks published a series of classified documents listing "target selectors": phone numbers the NSA searches for and records. These included senior government officials of Germany-among them Chancellor Angela Merkel-           France,            Japan,            and           other           countries.[           Read: Is Trump still tweeting from his unsecured Android phone?]Other countries don't have the same worldwide reach that the NSA has, and must use other methods to intercept cellphone calls. We don't know details of which countries do what, but we know a lot about the vulnerabilities. Insecurities in the phone network itself are so easily exploited that 60 Minutes eavesdropped on a U.S. congressman's phone            live on camera in 2016. Back in 2005, unknown attackers targeted the cellphones of many Greek politicians by            hacking the country's phone network and turning on an already-installed eavesdropping capability. The NSA even            implanted eavesdropping capabilities in networking equipment destined for the Syrian Telephone Company.Alternatively, an attacker could intercept the radio signals between a cellphone and a tower. Encryption ranges from            very weak to            possibly strong, depending on which flavor the system uses. Don't think the attacker has to put his eavesdropping antenna on the White House lawn; the Russian Embassy is close enough.The other way to eavesdrop on a cellphone is by hacking the phone itself. This is the technique favored by countries with less sophisticated intelligence capabilities. In 2017, the public-interest forensics group Citizen Lab uncovered an extensive eavesdropping campaign against Mexican            lawyers,            journalists, and            opposition politicians-presumably run by the government. Just last month, the same group found eavesdropping capabilities in products from the Israeli cyberweapons manufacturer NSO Group            operating in Algeria, Bangladesh, Greece, India, Kazakhstan, Latvia, South Africa-45 countries in all.These attacks generally involve downloading malware onto a smartphone that then records calls, text messages, and other user activities, and forwards them to some central controller. Here, it matters which phone is being targeted. iPhones are harder to hack, which is reflected in the prices companies pay for new exploit capabilities. In 2016, the vulnerability broker Zerodium            offered $1.5 million for an unknown iOS exploit and only $200 for a similar Android exploit. Earlier this year, a new Dubai start-up announced            even higher prices. These vulnerabilities are resold to governments and cyberweapons manufacturers.Some of the price difference is due to the ways the two operating systems are designed and used. Apple has much more control over the software on an iPhone than Google does on an Android phone. Also, Android phones are generally designed, built, and sold by third parties, which means they are            much less likely to get timely security updates. This is changing. Google now has its own phone-Pixel-that gets security updates quickly and regularly, and Google is now trying to            pressure Android-phone manufacturers to update their phones more regularly. (President Trump reportedly uses an iPhone.)Another way to hack a cellphone is to install a backdoor during the design process. This is a real fear; earlier this year, U.S. intelligence officials            warned that phones made by the Chinese companies ZTE and Huawei might be compromised by that government, and the Pentagon            ordered stores on military bases to stop selling them. This is why China's            recommendation that if Trump wanted security, he should use a Huawei phone, was an amusing bit of trolling.[           Read: Leaked transcripts show how foreign leaders manipulate Trump].Given the wealth of insecurities and the array of eavesdropping techniques, it's safe to say that lots of countries are spying on the phones of both foreign officials and their own citizens. Many of these techniques are within the capabilities of criminal groups, terrorist organizations, and hackers. If I were guessing, I'd say that the major international powers like China and Russia are using the more passive interception techniques to spy on Trump, and that the smaller countries are too scared of getting caught to try to plant malware on his phone.It's safe to say that President Trump is not the only one being targeted; so are members of Congress, judges, and other senior officials-especially because no one is trying to tell any of them to stop using their cellphones (although cellphones            still are not allowed on either the House or the Senate floor).As for the rest of us, it depends on how interesting we are. It's easy to imagine a criminal group eavesdropping on a CEO's phone to gain an advantage in the stock market, or a country doing the same thing for an advantage in a trade negotiation. We've seen governments use these tools against dissidents, reporters, and other political enemies. The            Chinese and            Russian governments are already targeting the U.S. power grid; it makes sense for them to target the phones of those in charge of that grid.Unfortunately, there's not much you can do to improve the security of your cellphone. Unlike computer networks, for which you can buy antivirus software, network firewalls, and the like, your phone is largely controlled by others. You're at the mercy of the company that makes your phone, the company that provides your cellular service, and the communications protocols developed when none of this was a problem. If one of those companies doesn't want to bother with security, you're vulnerable.This is why the current debate about phone privacy, with the FBI on one side wanting the ability to eavesdrop on communications and unlock devices, and users on the other side wanting secure devices, is so important. Yes, there are security benefits to the FBI being able to use this information to help solve crimes, but there are            far greater benefits to the phones and networks being so secure that all the potential eavesdroppers-including the FBI-can't access them. We can give law enforcement            other forensics tools, but we must keep foreign governments, criminal groups, terrorists, and everyone else out of everyone's phones. The president may be taking heat for his love of his insecure phone, but each of us is using just as insecure a phone. And for a surprising number of us, making those phones more private is a matter of national security.Load-Date: October 27, 2018End of Document

A unique combination of several optional security features ensures trust in the comprehensive IoT ecosystem. The solution is ideal for the growing mass of industrial solutions that require extreme efficiency, expanded coverage and long life such as utility meters and smart city solutions.LPWA NB-IoT drives massive IoT growth leading to increased security concernsThe IoT is accelerating at dizzying speed with China leading the way and the European market following with more than 415 million connections expected in the next five years1. The majority of these connections are emerging in the industrial IoT (IIoT) sector where highly efficient, Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technologies such as NB-IoT are driving massive expansion. A recent report by Custom Market Insights predicts the NB-IoT market will grow at a CAGR of 90% between now and 20252. As the number of connections continues to raise, so do cyberattacks making digital security an urgent concern.Gemalto security "double play" ensures trust in NB-IoTLeveraging Gemalto's strong capability in securely managing billions of digital credentials, the Cinterion NB-IoT platform will offer an integrated eSIM in selected platform products. Gemalto eSIMs authenticate IoT devices, encrypt data and            securely manage connections to cellular networks . Soldered to the IoT module, eSIMs reduce the size and cost of solutions while strengthening security and reliability. Pre-installed certificates simplify secure onboarding to cloud services by authenticating leading cloud platform providers.Extended efficiency, long life battery, expanded coverage rangeThe new Gemalto Cinterion ENS22 NB-IoT wireless module gives developers a single mode NB-IoT connectivity solution designed to meet the highest standards and requirements of the European and APAC regions. Gemalto's advanced power management system significantly boosts energy performance extending battery life for up to 10 years. The module is ideal for stationary IoT applications that send data only at intermittent intervals. Gemalto's evolution strategy enables easy forward migration within Cinterion product families while allowing a single device design for any technology standard or geographical area where it is used.Incremental updates protect NB-IoT devices for long lifeTo better manage devices in the field over long life cycles, the Cinterion NB-IoT module enables incremental firmware updates over-the-air (FOTA), a mandatory feature for cost savings and device lifecycle management. These updates allow revision of only the portion of code that needs updating. This significantly reduces transmission time, power draw and throughput, which are all essential in preserving the investment in NB-IoT technology."Gemalto debuted its Cinterion NB-IoT Platform early in China, a market that is driving global expansion of NB-IoT for IIoT connectivity," said Dan Shey, ABI Research . "With Gemalto's successful pilot product and the Chinese government's aggressive NB-IoT goal of achieving 600 million connections in the coming years, Gemalto is well positioned to be a global leader in the NB-IoT category.""Gemalto's Cinterion NB-IoT platform delivers a proven, high quality connectivity solution at the market's most cost competitive price while delivering an industry unique security feature set," said Andreas Haegele, SVP IoT Products, Gemalto. "The Gemalto NB-IoT solution strengthens the business case for cellular IoT technology and expands feasibility to use cases that were formerly cost prohibitive."About GemaltoGemalto (Euronext NL0000400653 GTO) is the global leader in digital security , with 2017 annual revenues of (EURO)3 billion and customers in over 180 countries.

Google's Censored Search Engine Faces BacklashWXOU 88.3 FM: Oakland UniversityNovember 28, 2018 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 360 wordsByline: Emily Morris           Wednesday, November 28BodyFeatured Photo: NDTVBy: Emily Morris Wednesday, November 28Google has plans to introduce a controversial filtered search engine that is causing uproar from its employees. The search engine, Dragonfly, led Google employees to write an open letter to the company about "human rights".If completed Dragonfly would allow the Chinese government to censor their citizens searches and eliminate some websites. Even the available websites would censor certain terms, such as ideas relating to democracy and human rights, according to The Intercept. Along with these restrictions, the Communist government would also have the capability to monitor searches, ensuring no one would slip through the cracks of this system.In the letter, Google employees said, "Our opposition to Dragonfly is not about China: we object to technologies that aid the powerful in oppressing the vulnerable, wherever they may be..."The letter continued to discuss the effects of Dragonfly outside of China, as well. Dragonfly would open doors for other countries to make greater requests about search engines."Dragonfly in China would establish a dangerous precedent at a volatile political moment, one that would make it harder for Google to deny other countries similar concessions," added Google employees.This is not the first time Google has gotten recent attention though. U.S. News reports a bipartisan group of 16 U.S. members of the House of Representatives sent a similar letter to Google's CEO, Sundar Pichai. Earlier in the this month, Google employees also took a stand against Google's procedures around sexual misconduct in the workplace by scheduling a walkout. Despite the size of the corporation, Google is not exempt from having to look in the mirror occasionally and analyze.Thus far, there are still uncertainties surrounding Dragonfly because of the recent backlash weighed with the possibilities of the business venture. The letter has caught the attention of the media and more employees though. A petition has been connected to the letter, encouraging more voices to be introduced to the conflict."Google is too powerful to not be held accountable," said Google employees.Load-Date: February 4, 2019End of Document

Asian shares climb on strong US earnings; BOJ stands patAssociated Press InternationalOctober 31, 2018 Wednesday 4:14 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; Financial MarketsLength: 581 wordsByline: By ANNABELLE LIANG, Associated PressDateline: SINGAPORE BodySINGAPORE (AP) - Asian markets were mostly higher on Wednesday after big American companies reported strong earnings for the third quarter, soothing fears that rising interest rates may deter corporate investment.KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 index jumped 1.8 percent to 21,841.65 and the Shanghai Composite index added 1.1 percent to 2,597.05. Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.6 percent to 24,732.97. Australia's S&P-ASX 200 slipped 0.2 percent to 5,795.04 and the Kospi in South Korea dropped 0.1 percent to 2,012.11. Shares were higher in Taiwan and throughout Southeast Asia.WALL STREET: Earnings reports lifted major benchmarks on Tuesday, as smaller and more U.S-focused companies including basic materials makers showed strong gains. The S&P 500 index rallied 1.6 percent to 2,682.63, a day after closing at a five-month low. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.8 percent higher at 24,874.64 and the Nasdaq composite advanced 1.6 percent to 7,161.65. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks rebounded 2 percent to 1,506.64.U.S. EARNINGS: Big companies including Mondelez, which makes Oreos, Cadbury chocolates and Trident gum, reported strong quarterly earnings on Tuesday. Mondelez's stocks rose by the most in a year, gaining 5 percent to $42.12, after it announced third-quarter profits that surpassed market expectations. Athletic apparel maker Under Armour also posted strong quarterly earnings. Even Facebook's shares inched higher in after-hours trading after it reported revenue that was slightly under projections. This dimmed fears over steady interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve that raise the cost of borrowing. Another increase is expected later this year, with more to come in 2019.ANALYST'S TAKE: "U.S. fundamentals keep driving the U.S. dollar as other major economies struggle to keep up," Alfonso Esparza, senior market analyst at OANDA, said in a commentary. Data backing consumer confidence and spending "keep validating the Fed's decision to keep hiking rates despite the negative comments from the Trump administration," he added.CHINESE PMI: On Wednesday, China reported that its official manufacturing purchasing managers' index slowed to 50.2 in October from 50.8 a month earlier. Figures had declined across the board except for production outlook, which was unchanged. Readings above 50 indicate expansion, while lower numbers indicate contraction on the index's 100-point scale. Still, sentiment was supported by an open call from the Chinese government to funds to support the equity markets.BANK OF JAPAN: As expected, Japan's central bank kept its monetary stance intact as it wrapped up its latest policy meeting. The Bank of Japan kept the key interest rate at minus 0.1 percent and its target for long-term bond rates at around zero. The bank also downgraded its GDP forecast for the fiscal year through March, to 1.4 percent from 1.5 percent, with an estimate of 0.8 percent for the following fiscal year.ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude added 25 cents to $66.43 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract dropped 86 cents to settle at $66.18 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained 49 cents to $76.44 per barrel. In the previous session, it dropped $1.42 to $75.95 a barrel.CURRENCIES: The dollar strengthened to 113.20 yen from 113.13 yen late Tuesday. The euro slipped to $1.1342 from $1.1343.____AP Markets Writer Marley Jay contributed to this report.Load-Date: November 1, 2018End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 26 of 359TTM Technologies, Inc.
