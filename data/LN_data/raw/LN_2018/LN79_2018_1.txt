PROMISE KEPT: PUTTING THE PRESSURE ON CHINAStates News ServiceSeptember 24, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 7585 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the Republican National Committee:President Trump's America First Tariffs Have China's Economy Shaking And Its Communist Leaders Rattled, While The U.S. Is FlourishingTOP TAKEAWAYSToday, President Trump issued tariffs of 10% on $200 billion of Chinese imports, a sign of the President's continued commitment to crack down on China's trade cheating and put American workers first.Today's tariffs build on 25% tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports already issued by the Trump Administration in July and August of this year.Today's tariffs are another fulfillment of a campaign promise the President made to put Americans' interests first.Candidate Trump: "If China does not stop its illegal activities, including its theft of American trade secrets and intellectual property, I will apply countervailing duties until China ceases and desists."In the months since the first round of tariffs on China went into effect, China's economy has already felt the heat and its Communist leaders have been rattled.Due in part to anxiety over the U.S. tariffs, China's stock market has been one of the world's worst performing major markets of the year, losing 27% of its value.While the tariffs have put pressure on China, the U.S. economy continues to boom and remains largely unaffected.The Wall Street Journal: "Tariffs have yet to meaningfully affect the U.S. economy."Since the first tariffs were announced in June, the U.S. has gained 348,000 jobs.Since its entrance to the WTO in 2001, China has consistently flouted international trade rules and unfairly tilted the playing field against the U.S.The USTR reported China consistently engaged in rampant intellectual property theft, erected unfair trade barriers against foreign pharmaceutical companies, sponsored the subsidization and dumping of cheap steel in the global market, and raised barriers to the free flow of data, blocking U.S. websites and instead promoting domestic competitors.PRESIDENT TRUMP IS MAKING GOOD ON HIS PROMISE TO PUT A STOP TO CHINA'S TRADE CHEATINGToday, President Donald Trump's Tariffs Of 10% On $200 Billion Dollars Worth Of Chinese Goods Go Into EffectToday, Additional Tariffs On Chinese Goods Instituted By The Trump Administration Will Go Into Effect.

"As part of the United States' continuing response to China's theft of American intellectual property and forced transfer of American technology, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) today released a list of approximately $200 billion worth of Chinese imports that will be subject to additional tariffs." (Press Release, "USTR Finalizes Tariffs On $200 Billion Of Chinese Imports In Response To China's Unfair Trade Practices," The United States Trade Representative , 9/17/18)On January 1, 2019, The Level Of The Additional Tariffs Will Increase To 25%.

REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP: "We are going to enforce all trade violations against any country including through the use of taxes and tariffs, against any country that cheats." (Donald J. Trump, Address Accepting The Presidential Nomination At The Republican National Convention , Cleveland, Ohio 7/21/16)Trump Promised To Put A Stop To "China's Outrageous Theft Of Intellectual Property, Along With Their Illegal Product Dumping." TRUMP: "This includes stopping China's outrageous theft of intellectual property, along with their illegal product dumping, and their devastating currency manipulation. They are the greatest that ever came about; they are the greatest currency manipulators ever! Our horrible trade agreements with China and many others, will be totally renegotiated." (Donald J. Trump, Address Accepting The Presidential Nomination At The Republican National Convention , Cleveland, Ohio 7/21/16)"If China Does Not Stop Its Illegal Activities, Including Its Theft Of American Trade Secrets And Intellectual Property, I Will Apply Countervailing Duties Until China Ceases And Desists." TRUMP: "If China does not stop its illegal activities, including its theft of American trade secrets and intellectual property, I will apply countervailing duties until China ceases and desists." (Donald J. Trump, Remarks To The Economic Club Of New York At The Waldorf Astoria , New York, New York, 9/15/16)Today's Tariffs Add On To Previous Tariffs Of 25% Placed On $50 Billion Worth Of Chinese ImportsOn June 15, 2018, The United States Trade Representative (USTR) Issued 25% Tariffs On $50 Billion Worth Of Chinese Imports Containing "Industrially Significant Technologies."

" The list contains 279 of the original 284 tariff lines that were on a proposed list announced on June 15. Changes to the proposed list were made after USTR and the interagency Section 301 Committee sought and received written comments and testimony during a two-day public hearing last month. Customs and Border Protection will begin to collect the additional duties on the Chinese imports on August 23."

A person who picked up the phone at the think tank said that the document was genuine and that its release had not been intended.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Issues Testimony From Interos SolutionsTargeted News ServiceSeptember 13, 2018 Thursday 6:10 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 5076 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee issued the following testimony by Jennifer Bisceglie, president and CEO of Interos Solutions, at a hearing entitled "Evolving Threats to the Homeland":"Chairman Johnson (R-Wis.), Ranking Member McCaskill (D-Mo.), and Members of the Committee, thank you for the invitation and opportunity to speak with you today on the underappreciated threats to the homeland that, if not mitigated, could significantly damage the nation's critical infrastructure and/or disrupt people's lives, especially as it relates to the global supply chain and the use of information and communications technology, or ICT."By way of introduction, Interos is a company I founded over 13- years ago to evaluate risks in the global economy and the business partnerships, alliances and distribution networks that comprise our supply chains. Interos is built on my over 25 years in the global supply chain industry, having helped numerous US-based companies off-shore their manufacturing and take advantage of different skillsets, labor pools and competitive business arrangements with partners around the world."During those years, I've watched risk concerns in the supply chain transition and grow from quality, to physical security, to resiliency and now to include product integrity. Interos recently supported the U.S.-CHINA ECONOMIC and SECURITY REVIEW COMMISSION for their report ('the Report") on Supply Chain Vulnerabilities from China in the U.S. Federal Information and Communications Technology (ICT) which outlines several recommendations, the most important being that the U.S. establish a "National Strategy for Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) in U.S. ICT" with supporting policies, so that the Nation's security posture is forward-leaning vs reactive and based on incident response. Our adversaries have strategies they are executing; it's my opinion this is missing in the U.S. and providing easy opportunities for nefarious actors to drive up risk exposure and cost."In being invited here, today, I'd like to address six (6) areas that are directly related to the Report and remain highly relevant to this hearing's discussion. However, I would like to stress that whether it is 5G, blockchain, the Internet of Things (IoT), or any other emerging technology or threat, an underlying foundation for security is an understanding of who the stakeholders are across your business partnerships, alliances and distribution eco-systems, where your vulnerabilities lie, - what's most important - and having a comprehensive strategy for security and risk management."Given its position in the market, Interos has had the opportunity to work with many public and private sector organizations across industries and the situation is always the same - if the organization's leadership doesn't take a focused and comprehensive approach to risk management - there will be unmanaged exposure and invariably negative impact."The rest of my testimony is organized as follows:* A brief assessment of the emerging economic and national security risks from next generation connectivity and devices (particularly the IoT and 5G networks) for the U.S. with specific reference to the risks posed by other economies such as China, Russia and other sensitive countries. What additional risks, if any, does use of IT, standards, and/or equipment developed in sensitive countries pose to U.S. security? Are existing authorities and regulations adequate to address these challenges?* How reliant are the U.S. government and U.S. IT firms on sensitive country firms and the IT products and services of those countries?* What are the potential vulnerabilities from U.S. usage of sensitive country, China for example, IT, standards, and/or equipment?* How, if at all, has the government of sensitive countries leveraged IT and IoT for the purposes of intelligence collection, censorship, or to launch or enable cyber-attacks? What are the implications for the integrity of U.S. government IT supply chains, for U.S. economic health, and for U.S. national security interests?* Assess U.S. government's success in managing the risks associated with a company, and those products and services, from sensitive countries, to its IT procurement supply chains. How is the U.S. government seeking to address/mitigate its supply chain risks? How successful have those efforts been? What are the remaining challenges? Is existing legislation and regulations adequate to address these challenges?* What steps should the U.S. government and U.S. Congress take to address the emerging security and economic risks from technology sourced from outside of the US?1. A brief assessment of the emerging economic and national security risks from next generation connectivity and devices (particularly the IoT and 5G networks) for the U.S. with specific reference to the risks posed by other economies such as China, Russia and other sensitive countries. What additional risks, if any, does use of IT, standards, and/or equipment developed in sensitive countries pose to U.S. security? Are existing authorities and regulations adequate to address these challenges?"Software supply chain attacks will become easier - and more prevalent - as developing technologies such as fifth generation (5G) mobile network technology and the IoT exponentially increase the avenues for attack.1 Gartner predicts that by 2021 there will be 25.1 billion IoT units installed,2 and by 2020, IOT technology will be in 90 percent of new computer-enabled product designs.3 This growth in IoT connectivity will have a significant impact on the ICT SCRM challenge. Relevant to the Report, increasing IoT installations will expand the attack surface of federal ICT networks while decreasing the time required to breach them, yet to date, the time required to detect breaches is not decreasing. The responsibility of both the public and private sector in improving their approach to risk awareness and management in the commercial technology supply chain cannot be overstated."The information technology (IT) supply chain threat to U.S. national security stems from products produced, manufactured, or assembled by entities that are owned, directed, or subsidized by national governments or entities known to pose a potential supply chain or intelligence threat to the U.S., including China, North Korea, and Russia. These products could be modified to 1) perform below expectations or fail, 2) facilitate state or corporate espionage, or 3) otherwise compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a federal information technology system."In the past, this concern was exemplified by counterfeit components entering the supply chain of U.S. defense systems, such as counterfeit integrated circuits from China discovered in the U.S. Navy's P-8A Poseidon airplane, in a U.S. Air Force cargo plane, and in assemblies intended for Special Operations helicopters.4 In 2011, the Senate Armed Services Committee investigated 1,800 cases of counterfeit components which created vulnerabilities throughout the Department of Defense's supply chain, and reported that 70 percent of all counterfeits come from China, and a majority of the remaining counterfeits could be traced back through the supply chain to China. In these cases, recycled, obsolete, or modified components passed off as genuine circuits had potential to perform below expectations or fail, threatening U.S. national security and the safety of U.S. service members."Increasingly, the importance of an ICT component's physical structure pales in comparison with the firmware and software operating within it. In 2016, researchers identified vulnerabilities that allowed hackers to surveil and manipulate users by hacking the embedded firmware of their computer monitors.5 In 2017, researchers uncovered vulnerabilities in printers manufactured by Hewlett-Packard, Dell, and Lexmark that allowed attackers to steal passwords, shut down printers, and even reroute print jobs.6 The mid-2017 CCleaner supply chain attack, in which hackers accessed the code development structure of Piriform in order to install malware into the company's Windows utility product, typifies the types of threats federal ICT systems will continue to face. Over 2.2 million users downloaded CCleaner and unwittingly installed the hacker's embedded malware at the same time. This malware compromised 40 international technology firms, 51 international banks, and at least 540 computers connected to various governments.7 Firms targeted by the hackers included many within the federal ICT ecosystem, including Cisco, Google (Gmail), Microsoft, Intel, Samsung, Sony, HTC, VMware, Vodafone, Epson, and Oracle.8"As information technology advances, and connectivity increases, these risks will multiply. Concepts such as the IoT, are but one avenue by which risk to federal IT systems will increase. The National Institute of Standards and Technology stated in Draft NISTIR 8200, released in February 2018, that "the adoption of IoT brings cybersecurity risks that pose a significant threat to the Nation."9 Other aspects of supply chain risk depend on technologies that are not yet fully developed or deployed, such as 5G mobile network technology, which is expected to start deploying in 2020. The full deployment of 5G networks is expected to dramatically expand the number of connected devices, reduce network energy use, and decrease end-to-end round trip delay (latency10) to under one millisecond.11 5G is important for subsequent developments in virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and seamless integration of IoT.12,13 Faster connectivity supplied by 5G networks will enhance productivity, efficiency, and facilitate greater interconnectedness through the IoT. But these benefits come with increased cybersecurity risks."What additional risks, if any, does use of IT, standards, and/or equipment developed in China pose to U.S. security?"The Chinese government and Chinese firms are hoping for a larger stake in the new 5G developments than they had in 3G and 4G-LTE.14 Key decisions on these standards will be made in international organizations such as the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). The ITU is a specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for ICT issues; the 3GPP is a collaborative organization among telecommunications associations. In both arenas, China has sought leadership positions to increase its influence. In the 3GPP, China has been represented by members of Huawei and China Mobile. In October 2014, Houlin Zhao was elected secretary general of the ITU.15 His four-year term began January 1, 2015 and concludes at the end of 2018."Although the finalization of 5G standards may be years away, Chinese entities (specifically Huawei and ZTE) have made large strides in patenting ICT innovations, and China could emerge as an industry leader in this technology.16 Of the 4,123 patents that ZTE applied for in 2016, more than 1,500 are 5G-related.17 Huawei's 5G research dates to 2009 and includes advances in polar coding and network splicing routers. Huawei has also bought technology patents from Sharp, IBM, Siemens, Harris Corporation, and other U.S., Japanese, and European companies. These patent acquisitions focus on communication technologies such as the Session Initiation Protocol.18"A March 2017 report by LexInnova laid out the major players in the 5G network technology IP landscape.19 Exhibit 7 of the report shows the share of 4G-LTE and 5G IP among top firms. Qualcomm, Nokia, InterDigital, Ericsson, Intel, and Huawei are the top six firms for 5G IP. Qualcomm, Samsung, Intel, Ericsson, Nokia, and LG were the top six firms for 4G-LTE IP. Many of the top firms from 4G-LTE development remain competitive in the 5G sphere, with Qualcomm continuing to lead the group, and Nokia, Ericsson, and Intel increasing their share of relevant IP rights in 5G with respect to 4G-LTE. Although Samsung was a close second to Qualcomm in 4G-LTE innovation, it has fallen to 10th in 5G IP, according to the LexInnova data. LG has similarly struggled, losing influence in 5G innovation to its competitors. Newly important players include InterDigital (a nonparticipating U.S. entity that owns IP but does not produce products) and Huawei."According to the LexInnova data, Huawei may control as much as 6.3 percent of critical 5G mobile network technology IP, a shift from its lack of influence in 4G-LTE. All Chinese entities together (including contributions from Huawei, ZTE, the China Academy of Telecommunications Technology, Zhejiang University, and Lenovo Group) control 9.8 percent of the IP LexInnova deemed critical to the 5G standard. Chinese firms have the largest presence in the Radio Front End/Radio Access Network category, where Huawei has 41 patents, China Academy of Telecommunications Technology has 14, ZTE has 11, and Zhejiang University has 10. In the area of Modulation/Waveforms, Huawei has 27 patents, while Lenovo Group has 7. In the area of Core Packet Networking Technologies, Huawei has 24 patents and ZTE has 8. However, Chinese entities still lag behind ICT powerhouses such as Ericsson, Qualcomm, and Nokia, which represent the bulk of 5G-related patent holders.20 The LexInnova report notes that the presence of Chinese entities among the top IP assignees may indicate that China's 5G deployment timeline is similar to that of the U.S."Are existing authorities and regulations adequate to address these challenges?"In short, the answer is 'no'. An example is the recently implemented Modernizing Government Technology Act (MGT Act), introduced by U.S. Representative Will Hurd (R-TX), chairman of the House Information Technology Subcommittee, in September 2016. The Act creates a $500 million central modernization fund against which agencies can borrow to update aging IT systems. The Act also creates working IT capital funds that allow agencies to retain savings achieved from ongoing modernization efforts, provided they are used for future modernization projects. The Bill was amended to the Senate version of the FY18 National Defense Authorization Act, which was passed by Congress in November 2017 and signed into law on December 12, 2017."The MGT Act seems to presume that legacy equipment and systems are the primary source of risk, and that this risk can be mitigated through modernization. But modernization will increase risk if newly adopted technologies, which have stronger supply chain connections to China, Russia, North Korean, Iran, Israel and other sensitive countries, are not assessed appropriately before being integrated into federal IT networks. The Bill establishes responsibilities and provides financial rewards to agencies for modernizing their IT infrastructure, naming OMB and GSA as permanent members of a supervisory board. However, it does not require any measure of supply chain security as part of modernization efforts. In the 'Implementation of the Modernizing Government Technology Act' signed by Director Mick Mulvaney on February 27, 2018, there are multiple pages of guidelines for the execution of the program, but no requirement for SCRM as part of an Agency's modernization effort."An understanding of emerging technologies, their pedigree, and their interconnectivity is crucial to proactively identify and mitigate future supply chain risk to federal ICT systems. The Chinese government and Chinese companies have developed joint strategies to influence future developments to the advantage of Chinese ICT products. China's role in setting international technology standards is likely to increase, and similar strategies are likely to be used in the future in fields beyond ICT, such as pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, medical technology, nanotechnology, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence. Until U.S. leadership takes this vulnerability seriously, it will remain an 'easy button' for our adversaries.2. How reliant are the U.S. government and U.S. IT firms on sensitive country firms and sensitive country-made IT products and services?"Over 95 percent of all electronics components and IT systems supporting U.S. federal IT networks are commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products, and China's role in this global supply network is significant. The supply chain for civilian IT is a global enterprise dominated by suppliers in East Asia.21 In addition to Chinese firms, many companies headquartered in Taiwan and Singapore base their manufacturing operations primarily in China. China assembles most of the world's consumer and commercial electronic devices, produces parts such as flash cards, and dominates the world in volume of IT industrial capacity. A recent report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) noted that China is the largest importer and exporter of IT hardware globally, as well as a key manufacturing location of workstations, notebook computers, routers and switches, fiber optic cabling, and printers.22"Many of the top enterprise IT providers to the U.S. government are also among the largest manufacturers of federal ICT equipment, including leading providers of COTS products, such as Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Dell, Cisco, Unisys, Microsoft, and Intel.23 Their supply chain is potentially influenced by China due to the fact that many of the companies and/or their sub-tier suppliers have manufacturing locations there."China is not the only country the U.S. is concerned about, but their economic decision to invest in being the world's technology manufacturer should prioritize them.3. What are the potential vulnerabilities from U.S. usage of sensitive country, China for example, IT, standards, and/or equipment?"The Chinese government considers the ICT a "strategic sector" in which it has invested significant state capital and influence on behalf of state-owned ICT enterprises. Since 2013, China has accelerated its efforts at indigenous production and independence in ways that have created a more restrictive environment for companies doing business in China, extracting concessions from large multinationals in exchange for market access."New policies requiring companies to surrender source code, store data on servers based in China, invest in Chinese companies, and permit the Chinese government to conduct security audits on its products open federal ICT providers--and the federal ICT networks they supply--to Chinese cyberespionage efforts. China also continues to directly target U.S. government contractors and other private sector entities as part of its efforts to gain economic advantage and pursue other state goals."Specific risks include intellectual property theft, theft of Personally Identifiable Information of U.S. citizens that can be used for financial gains, and the insertion of counterfeit products and services meant to create disruption and do harm."The use of Chinese standards further complicates any security strategy the U.S. may have in place as it provides a documented path of access for our adversaries."How will the deployment of 5G and greater usage of IoT affect these vulnerabilities?"These new emerging technologies are just two (2) more examples that need to be proactively evaluated through a security lens as part of a national supply chain risk mitigation strategy. These, and other emerging technologies will expand the attack surface and increase the potential vectors for opportunists.4. How, if at all, has the government of sensitive countries leveraged IT and IoT for the purposes of intelligence collection, censorship, or to launch or enable cyber-attacks? What are the implications for the integrity of U.S. government IT supply chains, for U.S. economic health, and for U.S. national security interests?"There are multiple documented examples of the sensitive countries' governments leveraging IT for intelligence collection and economic and state espionage efforts. One of the most infamous is probably the breach of Office of Personnel Management's database in 2015, a mammoth break-in that exposed the records of more than 22 million current and former federal employees."In 2014 and 2015, the Chinese government ramped up implementation of laws and policies that raise market access concerns among ICT manufacturers and suppliers in the U.S. by threatening to decrease competition, favor Chinese firms over foreign firms, or extract concessions from multinational firms seeking to do business in China. These new regulations present a serious dilemma for U.S. multinationals and a threat to U.S. national security. If U.S. multinationals fail to adhere to Chinese government regulations, they may face restricted market access in China, which could decrease their revenues and global competitiveness. But if U.S. companies--which are the primary providers of ICT to the U.S. federal government--surrender source code, proprietary business information, and security information to the Chinese government, they further open themselves and federal ICT networks to Chinese cyberespionage efforts."Bottom line, we need our full defenses up at all times to thwart enemy attacks.5. Assess the U.S. government's success in managing the risks associated with sensitive country- firms and the products and services supplied, to its IT procurement supply chains. How is the U.S. government seeking to address/mitigate its supply chain risks?"A challenge facing federal SCRM efforts is that federal government laws and policies do not address risk management comprehensively. Rather, supply chain risks to federal ICT systems has been divided in multiple ways-- among federal information systems and other initiatives designed to protect critical infrastructure or high-value assets and among national security systems (NSS) as a subset of federal information systems."How successful have those efforts been? What are the remaining challenges?"In some instances, very impactful. Interos supported one federal agency where over 75% of the supply chain risk assessments conducted in the past three (3) years have identified concerns that altered acquisition decisions or influenced market analysis. That said, this mature program is in the minority when compared to those of other agencies where such programs exist. Not to mention, there are agencies that have not been resourced to implement a SCRM program at all. And, more importantly, as the Chief Information Officer (CIO) of that agency changed from a permanent to a political position, and this administration has not taken a strong stand on SCRM, the CIO cancelled the VERY SUCCESSFUL six-year running program. We were four (4) days from contract renewal and no reason for program cancellation was provided."In the current supply chain risk ecosystem, responsibility for risk management is held at different levels within agencies. This often results in offices and lines of effort in several agencies that function largely as under-resourced stovepipes lacking in executive sponsorship or oversight, and catering to the needs and procurement policies of individual clients. The DoD and the intelligence community maintain largely separate policies, many of which are not transparent to or applicable to the broader federal government due to procurement practices and classification concerns, among other reasons.6. Is existing legislation and regulations adequate to address these challenges?"In short, no. There is little to no priority placed on SCRM, minimal leadership involvement and limited accountability. I do not know what it will take to get this level of attention or how many other incidents need to occur before Congress or the Executive Branch gets more involved, but I see this as a major flaw in U.S. national security. At the same time, I would like to commend the agencies that have taken their own initiative to set up programs for internal security reasons - they are making a difference, but unfortunately these models are not scalable or shareable in their current form.7. What steps should the U.S. government and U.S. Congress take to address the emerging security and economic risks from technology sourced from outside of the U.S.?"As previously mentioned, the Federal ICT supply chain risks can be best managed by focusing on four (4) areas: 1) embracing an adaptive SCRM process, 2) promoting supply chain transparency, 3) centralizing federal ICT SCRM efforts, and 4) crafting forward-looking policies."This concludes my testimony. I thank the Committee and I would be pleased to answer your questions."* * *Footnotes:1 The Internet of Things refers to a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, and living beings equipped with network connectivity that enables them to connect and exchange data.2 Peter Middleton, Tracy Tsai, Masatsune Yamaji, Anurag Gupta, Denise Rueb, "Forecast: Internet of Things -- Endpoints and Associated Services, Worldwide, 2017," Gartner, Inc., December 21, 2017. https://www.gartner.com/doc/3840665/forecast-internet-things--endpoints.3 Benoit J.

Google's Development of Censored Search Engine for China Capitulation to Free Speech RestrictionsTargeted News ServiceAugust 2, 2018 Thursday 7:47 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 506 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK BodyPEN America issued the following news release:Google's reported development of a censored search engine for China evinces a troubling capitulation to China's restrictions on free speech and access to information, PEN America said today.On August 1, The Intercept reported, drawing from internal documents and interviews with anonymous Google employees, that Google was developing a censored version of its search engine for use in China. The Intercept reports that the censored engine will filter out search terms and results that are blacklisted by the Chinese government, to include specific websites and terms related to human rights, democracy, and peaceful protest. The app has reportedly already been demonstrated to Chinese officials, and Google will operate the censored app as a joint venture with an unnamed partner company, which will presumably be based in China.The Chinese government maintains an extensive system of censorship and control over the Internet within its borders, a system often referred to as "The Great Firewall." Government regulators impose a broad and constantly-updated set of restrictions on internet service providers, blocking a broad array websites and search terms."Given that Google has long prided itself on its informal motto, 'Don't be evil,' it's impossible to believe that Google is living up to its values with this decision," said Summer Lopez, Senior Director of Free Expression Programs at PEN America. "Google needs to understand the significance of their choice. If they move forward with this censored search engine, they will become an active partner in the largest system of online censorship in the world, and be complicit in the silencing of dissent and independent voices in China."Earlier this year, the news that Apple would partner with a government-linked Chinese company to manage storage of Chinese user data raised concerns that the government was being given back-door access to private data.PEN America's March 2018, Forbidden Feeds: Government Controls on Social Media in China, outlines how China's digital censorship regime relies on conscripting digital services providers to censor their own users, and how regulators constantly impose new censorship obligations. The report concludes that compliance with Chinese censorship laws, posited as a condition of entry to the market, would represent "complicity" with the government's efforts to silence dissent, running "directly counter to the[ir] professed values and mission statements." PEN America recommends that all foreign technology companies "Refrain from doing business in the Chinese market unless and until you have secured an agreement with the government that the company will not be obligated to enforce Chinese laws and regulations related to censorship, or to otherwise violate China-based customers' rights to privacy, free expression, access to information, or related rights."Contact: Anoosh Gasparian, external relations manager, agasparian@pen.orgCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6395316 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: August 3, 2018End of Document

Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee Issues Testimony From American Enterprise InstituteTargeted News ServiceJuly 24, 2018 Tuesday 8:00 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2140 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific and International Cybersecurity Policy issued the following testimony by Dan Blumenthal, director of Asian studies at the American Enterprise Institute, at a hearing entitled "The China Challenge, Part 1: Economic Coercion as Statecraft":"Mr. Chairman and Mr. Ranking Member:"Thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today."We are slowly waking up to a set of strategies by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) meant to enhance Party power internally and globally at our expense. The CCP has adopted a number of strategies to strengthen the Party's grip on the country so that it can lead China back to "Middle Kingdom Centrality." These strategies have been in place for a while, but have been accelerated by Communist Party Secretary General Xi Jinping."The broad strategic context for Chinese economic statecraft includes:* China's Grand Strategy of the China Dream of Grand Rejuvenation, which requires:- Building a world class military to challenge the United States and Allied military primacy;- Strengthening political warfare and propaganda campaigns that interfere in target nations' politics to both block activities that the CCP does not like and to build more favorable support for China abroad.- Advancing unlawful claims in the South China Sea and militarizing the seas to gain control of them.- Challenging Japan's lawful claims in the East China Sea- Building ports and facilities throughout the Indian Ocean- Attempting to make certain countries dependent on China's loans and construction projects as part of the "One Belt One Road" initiative"I am not including more benign diplomatic initiatives that are also a tool in the CCP's broader strategy. And, as you can see, when I say "China's policies", I mean those of the Chinese Communist Party. We do not know what "China's policies" would be in a more pluralistic society that is not completely dominated by a Leninist regime. I imagine we would get along very well with a China that is not under the CCP's grip.Economic Coercion as a tool of the China Dream"Here is some more context. The era of reform and opening is over. Now, state banks, state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and their associated links with Party officials are what drive the Chinese economy. The CCP is willing to accept slowing economic growth in exchange for a tighter grip on the Chinese economy."Thus, China's economic coercion cannot be thought of as absent the needs of the CCP's grip on China, or its strategies for growth and influence -- which as we now know include massive technology theft, the blocking of market access in key sectors, the control of capital flight, efforts to make exports cheaper (through subsidies and consumer repression), and other related measures."The CCP has extensively targeted the United States and its key allies in the region with this economic coercion. Let's go through the CCP's tactics in each of these countries:1. The United States"The CCP's unfair and illegal economic practices, such as mass subsidization of SOEs, gives China an unfair competitive advantage. This, coupled with the widespread theft of US intellectual property (IP), hurts the US economy. We are slowly challenging them on these fronts, and while these practices are the most harmful, they can be separated analytically from direct economic coercion. Instead, direct coercion includes:* Forced technology transfers. As US Ambassador Dennis Shea highlighted at the World Trade Organization (WTO) in June 2018, China's "forced technology transfers" remain an implicit requirement for overseas companies hoping to access China's domestic market, especially through partnerships with SOEs.* Pressuring US business executives. That same month, Xi Jinping also spoke with a number of top American business executives at the Global CEO Council in Beijing in an attempt to pressure U.S. executives to convince the U.S. government to ease trade tensions. A major form of coercion against the US has been the attempts to force US businessmen to lobby the US government to adopt more favorable policies from China's perspective. This practice has been ongoing for decades. The CCP will split Americans into "friends of China" who might lobby on their behalf and others who refuse to do so will not be granted access to China's massive market.2. Taiwan"Taiwan stands as "ground zero" for China's coercive economic activities.* There is a longstanding practice by China of pressuring Taiwanese business people to vote for Taiwan political parties that are perceived to be more pro-China or else lose market access or face economic harassment, and to pressure the Taiwanese government to accept terms that are unacceptable to the vast majority of the Taiwanese people.* As we have seen recently, the CCP is also pressuring international companies to not identify Taiwan by name in an attempt to erase Taiwan as a separate entity from the global "mental map." Examples of these include the incited apologies from Marriot and Delta for including "Taiwan" on the list of countries in which they operate.* Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) military exercises in Taiwan's surrounding waters are meant to remind the people of Taiwan that the CCP can cut Taiwan off from international trade altogether.* China consistently targets and lures away top Taiwanese talent from its information and communications technologies (ICT) industries in an attempt to hollow out and dominate these industries.3. Japan"The CCP has used its military might and the blocking of exports and imports to pressure Japan on political disputes.* China's combined military-economic coercive tools caught the world's attention in 2010, when a Chinese ship collided with two Japanese coast guard vessels during a standard fishing trip near the disputed Senkaku islands. The Japanese coast guard arrested the Chinese fishing trawler, which lead to combative rhetoric on both sides and China halting rare earth mineral exports to Japan. At the time, China produced 93% of the world's rare earth minerals, and essentially had a monopoly on these materials. By halting these exports to Japan, Japanese products such as hybrid cars, wind turbines, and guided missiles were under threat.* The CCP also incites the Chinese public into action after controversial events that paint China in a bad light. Given China's anti-Japanese sentiment that can be traced back throughout history, the Chinese population has served as an effective proxy that the CCP uses to indirectly pressure the Japanese government into making concessions.- For example, in 2012 as tensions between China and Japan became heated over the disputed islands, Japanese firms in China such as Toyota and Honda had to shut down their facilities after demonstrations and violent protests against Japanese businesses broke out across China. Such demonstrations reveal broader Chinese government attempts to "hold foreign businesses hostage to its political agenda."4. Philippines"The CCP has done the same thing towards the Philippines, demonstrating a pattern in squeezing neighboring countries to achieve aims favorable to Chinese interests across the region.* After the Philippines began challenging Chinese claims in the South China Sea in 2012, China restricted banana imports from the Philippines and abruptly cancelled several Chinese tour groups that were going to the Philippines.* After the Philippines brought a case against China to the Permanent Court of Arbitration challenging China's expanding territorial claims in the South China Sea, China continued to squeeze the Philippines economically by tightening controls on Philippine fruit and continuing to cut the number of Chinese tourist visits to the Philippines. As the third-biggest export market for the Philippines and the fourth in foreign tourists, such cuts have a severe impact on the Philippine economy. In response to this, the Philippines was forced to "intensify [its] efforts to diversify [its] trade with other countries."5. South Korea"The pressure on South Korea after the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-ballistic missile defense system reveals not only Beijing's pressure tactics, but also some of the organizations involved and more specific practices used by the CCP.* For example, when the CCP decided to limit tourists to South Korea after announcements of the deployment, the China National Tourism Administration became a key organization in implementing the CCP's policies. Semi-private corporations such as Chinese airlines also limited the number of plane tickets sold or flights to and from the targeted country.* When the CCP attempts to rally its citizens to boycott or protest foreign businesses, as it did against South Korean supermarket Lotte, Chinese state media will actively encourage it.* As the CCP limits certain imports of foreign goods, the Chinese Customs agency will not approve shipments, while Chinese ports will wrap merchant ships up in new regulations delaying their shipment.* Local governments and actors have also gotten involved in Chinese economic coercion efforts.* When the CCP targeted Korean supermarkets in China during a particularly strained period of Sino-ROK relations, it was up to the local governments to conduct "inspections" and shut down Lotte for "fire safety violations". Or, "lone actors" in China conducted "patriotic hacks" against South Korean company databases to steal data from Samsung.6. Vietnam and the South China Sea"Lastly, there is the troubling category of combined military-economic coercive tactics that China employs particularly against smaller countries in the region. For example, the CCP has used its military and economic might against Vietnam and other nations that have ongoing disputed claims to the South China Sea areas. China has engaged in operations such as:* Cutting the cables of oil exploration ships in the South China Sea. In 2012, two Chinese fishing vessels cut cables of a Vietnamese vessel doing seismic oil exploration work in the South China Sea.* Announcing and enforcing unilateral fishing bans. In May 2018, China unilaterally announced a fishing ban in the South China Sea for two months, directly affecting the livelihoods of Vietnamese, Bruneian, Malaysian, and Filipino fishermen.* Or even directly threatening countries with overt military pressure, as was the case when China placed an oil rig in Vietnam's exclusive economic zone in May 2014 and surrounded it with an armada.Fighting Back"Thus, China holds meaningful sway over most of the countries it targets and the scale of China's economy and resources is its biggest strength. Many countries - particularly smaller countries in Asia that China actively targets -- still hope for access to the China market or seek to receive investment from the PRC."However, there are limitations to China's economic coercion, particularly with respect to the United States. For one thing, China's economy is more dependent on the US economy than vice versa. Moreover, "good money" is leaving China to be invested here or other Western safe havens. In fact, one of the biggest complaints by Chinese elites is that the Xi administration is making it harder for them to get their money out of China."Since the US is not dependent on China for as much as we think, we should have plans for an economic coercion strategy of our own. Some of these measures would include:* Limits on the children of party elite's student visas;* Bans on market access in accord with European actors on the worst-offending SOEs (for example, those that consistently engage in forced technology transfers);* Targeted information campaigns within China in Chinese that advertise the corrupt patronage networks that exist between the CCP and key SOEs;* Global armadas that convoy fisherman and oil exploration vessels to areas they are lawfully allowed to conduct their economic activities;* Enhancing economic ties including the quick signing of a Bilateral Investment Treaty and cyber-cooperation with Taiwan."But our approach to CCP economic coercion needs to be more comprehensive. Besides some of the defensive actions we could take listed above, the United States should consider a more proactive trade agenda that targets the countries that will become increasingly important to the US in the future - Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines -- as well programs to help strengthen the rule of law in these countries so that they are not as susceptible to outright Chinese bribery."The greatest economic coercion strategy we can place on China is helping to build free-market trade agreements and free-market economies in Asia whose standards are so high that a statist CCP will not be able to join."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6381323 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: July 25, 2018End of Document

HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH LETTER TO FACEBOOKStates News ServiceAugust 7, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 2479 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:Dear Mr. Zuckerberg:We write to express our concern about the significant risks associated with Facebook's possible entry into China. Though Facebook remains blocked in the country, we understand that your firm has engaged local partners for your advertising services. You have also sought ties inside and outside China with senior Chinese government officials. As you consider whether and how to operate in China, we urge you to be certain that your operations will neither assist nor enable Chinese authorities in censoring peaceful expression, conducting abusive surveillance, or retaliating against netizens who wish to use Facebook to "share and make the world more open and connected."1 Given China's worsening human rights climate and a regulatory regime that requires companies to conduct censorship and surveillance, Facebook's formal entry would entail considerable risk of it becoming complicit in serious human rights abuses. The company should not proceed without publicly clarifying how it will approach these issues and taking a strong stance in support of freedom of expression and user privacy.Human Rights Watch is an international nongovernmental organization that monitors and reports on human rights abuses in some 90 countries around the world. We have documented abuses and advocated for redress in China for more than two decades, and similarly defended the freedom of expression and privacy online for over a decade. In the course of our work, we have had to opportunity to engage with Facebook on a range of issues related to online censorship and privacy, including through the Global Network Initiative (GNI).Netizens across China have made remarkable use of the Internet and social media to publicize injustices, access and share information, and mobilize public opinion, vigorously embracing the only relatively free public space available to them. Through discussing public events like the Tianjin warehouse blast in 2015, the Wenzhou train crash in 2011, or unsafe consumer products, such as the 2008 melamine baby formula scandal, people across the country have collectively pushed for greater accountability and transparency from their government.Since assuming leadership in March 2013, however, President Xi Jinping's government has reversed gains in freedom of expression and presided over the most severe assault on human rights in two decades. The government has moved aggressively to limit free expression and the activities of civil society. It has severely restricted access to virtual private networks (used by some netizens to access blocked content), further compelled bloggers to register with their real name so they can be identified and targeted, and pressured companies to store user data locally so that it is more accessible to law enforcement. In 2014, Instagram was reportedly blocked in mainland China as pro-democracy protesters used it to document the Umbrella Revolution protests.2The government views the Internet as a threat to its power, "the primary battlefield for ideological struggle," and believes all media should serve to "protect the [Chinese Communist] Party's authority and unity."3 Its long-term strategy has been and remains protecting domestic Internet companies in China, monitoring and punishing online critics, and retaining as much control as possible over what information users may share and access.To implement Beijing's goals, the government enlists Internet companies, foreign and domestic, to disclose user data and ensure technologies are "secure and controllable." In 2015, the government passed several new security laws that require Internet firms, including foreign ones, to censor content and verify the identity of customers.4 Authorities also stated they plan to embed police within major domestic Internet companies to combat "malicious" online content.5 In May 2016, the Ministry of Public Security enlisted Sina Weibo to launch an online platform for identifying and investigating "rumors" on the service, potentially leaving Weibo users more vulnerable to abuse if they share independent information that deviates from official narratives.6 All technology firms, including foreign firms, are required to assist with broad surveillance powers and law enforcement access to data to investigate online crimes, with no real safeguards or legal controls.Such expanded surveillance powers come at a particularly dangerous time for social media users. In September 2013, the government issued a new judicial interpretation expanding existing law to punish expression online.7 In recent years, the Chinese government has cracked down on "rumors" by targeting netizens who share independent information on subjects as varied as air pollution, industrial disasters, or stock market troubles on social media.8 Authorities have targeted for detention and imprisonment well-known online commentator Charles Xue and other popular social media personalities, known as "Big Vs," on Weibo and have closed down popular public accounts on WeChat.9 In December 2015, one of China's best-known human rights lawyers, Pu Zhiqiang, was found guilty of "picking quarrels and stirring up troubles" and "inciting ethnic hatred" for comments he made on social media, including comments that criticized government crackdowns on ethnic minorities.10 The laws used by the government in these cases penalize peaceful expression in ways that are inconsistent with China's human rights obligations.While Facebook's goal may be to enable users in China to express themselves, authorities there will see Facebook's products as an invaluable platform for surveillance and yet another arena for information control. Recently adopted laws, clear political intent, and longstanding government practice make clear that Facebook will be asked to aid abuses against its users.In this context, the company should undertake extensive human rights due diligence and implement clear human rights protections to ensure that its operations do not contribute to or exacerbate an already dire human rights environment. Broad assumptions that the Chinese people would be better off with than without Facebook are no substitute for these essential precautionary measuresboth to avoid Facebook's complicity in Chinese abuses and to ensure that Facebook's presence is really a net plus for the Chinese people.To that end, we ask that you publicly disclose information on any human rights policies or procedures that Facebook will implement to protect users in China. This includes policies in place globally, as part of its commitments as a GNI member, and those specific to China. In addition, we have specific questions about your possible operations in China, including:Protection of user data and "authentic identity" policy: Facebook holds highly sensitive information about users' contacts and networks, affiliations, location and movements, and the contents of private communications. The government would seek access to such information, potentially as part of abusive prosecutions of peaceful expression, among other risks. In addition, the company's "authentic identity" policy exacerbates the danger that Facebook will contribute directly to human rights abuses in China because it prevents users who may share politically sensitive content from using pseudonyms. Facebook's "authentic identity" policy requires individuals to use their "authentic name," one that is commonly used by family and friends, but that would also be found on certain types of identity documents. Human rights organizations, including HRW, have long criticized this policy because it can chill online expression.11 The policy is also likely to be disproportionately enforced against those already at risk of reprisals, including at-risk minorities and online activists.12a) How will Facebook protect its users in China from reprisals for their online activity?b) How will Facebook respond to data localization requirements, formal or informal, to store user data inside the country?c) Given the government's current crackdown on social media users, how will Facebook respond to government requests for user information and how will the company assess such requests in order to prevent the government from using Facebook's user data to silence, intimidate, and punish independent voices?Censorship of content: The Chinese government requires Internet companies to censor content on its behalf through both legal and informal pressure. Chinese social media companies employ hundreds (if not thousands) of content "censors" to monitor and take down content that could run afoul of the government's vaguely worded requirements, often doing so proactively without waiting for a request that identifies specific posts.a) How will Facebook respond to China's censorship requirements, and will the company proactively take down content in the absence of a specific government request that identifies particular posts deemed unlawful?b) How will Facebook staff resist pressures, formal and informal, to limit access to content in the absence of a specific government directive?c) What type of infrastructure will Facebook have to put into place to comply with Chinese laws and regulations?d) If Facebook offers the same version of its service that is available globally, rather than a domestic Chinese version, how will Facebook ensure government censorship requirements do not affect access to posts by users outside China?e) Will Facebook commit to notifying users when specific content they attempt to access has been censored under Chinese law?Encryption and "technical assistance": Human Rights Watch welcomes WhatsApp's decision to implement end-to-end encryption for its global user base. We encourage Facebook to refrain from retaining WhatsApp message metadata, which could be disclosed at the request of governments.China's new counterterrorism law, passed in December 2015, is also drafted broadly enough to potentially require companies to build "back doors" into secured systems or retain encryption keys and make them available in counter-terrorism investigations, as well as provide other kinds of unspecified "technical assistance."a) Will Facebook offer WhatsApp in China in its current, end-to-end encrypted form?b) How will you respond if the government asks for technical assistance to circumvent or re-design security features in WhatsApp, Messenger, or other Facebook products?c) How will the company respond to requests for source code or invasive "security audits"?Local partners: China has long imposed restrictions on foreign investment in industries the government views as crucial to maintaining power, including the Internet and telecommunications industries. In practice, such limits oblige foreign Internet companies to operate with or through a local partner in China.13a) What criteria will Facebook use to vet potential local partners for human rights risk?b) How will Facebook ensure local partners, subsidiaries, and other entities linked to the firm's operations respect the rights of users and implement the company's human rights policies?c) What access to user data will such local partners and business entities have?Liu Xiaobo, the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize winner and the world's only imprisoned laureate, once described the Internet as "God's gift to China," an essential tool for people in China to "strive for freedom." We urge that as Facebook considers its future in China, it places human rights at the core of its discussions and clarify to its users worldwide how it will resist becoming an agent of repression.Sincerely,Kenneth RothExecutive Director1.

Big Tech: We Won’t Display Alex Jones Content, but We Will Work with Chinese GovernmentCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 18, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 935 wordsBody       Google is helping the Chinese dictator-for-life to design a censorship engine (WikiMedia). Google has a major hypocrisy problem. Apparently, as the new moral guardians of what we are allowed to see and hear, it is their duty to ban the content of Alex Jones and his Infowars site. YouTube, which is owned by Google and is a major platform for viewing all types of media content, has removed Jones and content from all of his affiliated channels. However, recent reports suggest that Google has no qualms about working with the Chinese Communist government, which is by a lightyear, the greatest abuser of human rights in the world today. Specifically, Google is helping to design a search engine that will meet the ideologically restrictive demands of the totalitarian regime in Beijing. Just as the Beijing regime, and its dictator-for-life &#8220;president&#8221; Xi Jinping, seek to infiltrate the academic world under the auspices of the Confucius Institute, now they seek to infiltrate the tech world by partnering with the world&#8217;s leading technology company so that they force-feed Communist lies down the throats of their 1.3  billion citizens. We can only imagine what such a search engine might look like: Looking for information about Tibet, the Dalai Lama, and its Buddhist population? Tibet has always been part of China, the Dalai Lama is a fraud and a counter-revolutionary, and Buddhists are not good Communists. Want to find out about China&#8217;s mass concentration camps for political prisoners? They don&#8217;t exist. The Tiananmen Square massacre? It didn&#8217;t happen. No one was killed&#8230;and certainly not for merely exercising their right to freedom of speech. The protesters weren&#8217;t lauding American values, and certainly no one was run over by tanks. Mao Zedong? The father of Chinese Communist and a heroic fighter in the anti-imperialist struggle who set China on the majestic path where it finds itself today. His &#8220;Five Year Plans&#8221; were the envy of the peoples republic, and a model for the world. If you were to enter &#8220;How many people did Mao kill?&#8221; into Google in the United States, you would quickly find out that Mao&#8217;s homicidal mania is unparalleled in human history. At the top of the search results, you&#8217;ll find an article from The Guardian, detailing how from 1958-1962, as the rest of the world was experiencing an economic boom, Mao&#8217;s majestic central planning killed 45 million people. Let&#8217;s go out on a limb here, and imagine that Google&#8217;s new &#8220;search engine&#8221; (or should we really term it a &#8220;censorship engine&#8221;) is set up in China, and one were to query: Mao Zedong. Or Mao Zedong five year plan. Mao Zedong legacy. Mao Zedong deaths. What would show up? Would the search engine merely obliterate the truth entirely? Or would it place the truth far below &#8220;revisionist&#8221; (read: paid for by the Chinese Communist Party) historians who bent and distorted the truth to suit Beijing&#8217;s ideological whims? Or would they massage the figures to explain away and apologize for the greatest humanitarian catastrophe of the last century? And that is a historical topic. We can only imagine what the search engine might find with regard to contemporary topics. Imagine, for example, searching for results for &#8220;Chinese censorship&#8221; or &#8220;Google search engine helps Chinese government to censor&#8221;&#8230;oh the irony! You see&#8230;for the left-wing ideologues at Google, the Chinese government is not the real threat. Alex Jones and his merry band of banshees and conspiracy theorists with their &#8220;hate speech&#8221; constitute the real clear and present danger. They due a disservice to all Americans with their &#8220;fake news&#8221; stories, and degrade the &#8220;civility&#8221; in our political discourse. I am well aware of the numerous faults of Alex Jones&#8230;but claiming school shootings were staged is a far cry from sending hundreds of thousands of political, social, and religious dissidents to concentration work camps. Sharing a story about the government putting hormones in the water to make amphibians gay is a far cry from murdering 45 million people on the altar of central-planning, socialism, and cult-of-personality idol worship. Claiming that 9/11 was an inside job is a far cry from taking away freedom of speech, assembly, and the press from 1.3 billion people. Google is led and staffed by the far-left. Peruse their campaign contributions&#8230;which go almost entirely to the Democratic Party. Take a look at the way they inject far left-wing bias into search results. But more than anything, just look at what Google top executives, themselves, had to say after Trump&#8217;s election: https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/09/12/leaked-video-google-leaderships-dismayed-reaction-to-trump-election/ Sergey Brin, the &#8220;refugee&#8221; and &#8220;immigrant&#8221; from Communism in the Soviet Union, didn&#8217;t have anything to say about Bernie Sanders and his socialist activists taking over the Democratic Party. Trump was the problem. In fairness to Google, in 2010 they did pull out of China when numerous employees complained about complicity in dealing with the Chinese government. Their apparent return should be cause for great alarm&#8230;as should their enthusiasm for censoring Alex Jones. When it comes to our democracy&#8230;its very foundation is freedom of speech. Freedom of speech is under attack from our nation&#8217;s own big tech. And that should be a major cause of concern for us all.Load-Date: September 18, 2018End of Document

Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee Issues Testimony From American Enterprise InstituteTargeted News ServiceSeptember 5, 2018 Wednesday 7:04 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 4620 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific and International Cybersecurity Policy issued the following testimony by Oriana Skylar Mastro, visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, at a hearing entitled "China Challenge, Part 2: Security and Military Developments":"On August 18, 2018, the Department of Defense released its seventeenth Annual Report to Congress on Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China. Since 2002, the annual reports have addressed the current and probable future course of the military-technological development of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), as well as the development of Chinese grand strategy, security strategy, military strategy, military organizations, and operational concepts through the next quarter-century.1 Since 2012, the reports have tripled in length to incorporate more information on China's force modernization and special topics. This year's report includes five special topics: China's expanding global influence, China's approach to North Korea and its diplomatic history and objectives, the PLA's progress in becoming a joint force, overwater bomber operations, and Xi's innovation-driven development strategy and the push to turn China into a science and technology powerhouse by 2050."The annual report to Congress is a crucial tool for collating information and maintaining awareness of China's growing military capabilities. Its systematic collection of data is a useful resource for scholars like me, and in this testimony I do not challenge the facts or assessments it presents. However, the U.S. government generally is less adept at understanding the implications of these developments, what they bode for the future, and the best way to respond. Therefore, in this testimony, I will discuss several misconceptions about cooperation and competition with China that may hinder U.S. attempts to deter Chinese aggression and compete effectively with China regionally and globally. I will also present recommendations about what Congress should do to improve the U.S.'s ability to interpret and respond to China's challenge. The bottom line is that great power competition requires expanding U.S. efforts beyond traditional friends and allies, and the U.S. needs a whole-government approach to identifying and responding to the China challenge.Cooperation with China"The term 'cooperate' and its various derivations are used three times more often than 'competition' in the 2018 annual report. This highlights the central role of cooperation as a longstanding part of U.S. strategy in navigating the potential challenges of a rising China. As the report states: "The United States seeks a constructive and results oriented relationship with China. U.S. Defense contacts and exchanges conducted in 2017 were designed to support overall U.S. Policy and strategy toward China. They are carefully tailored to clarify and develop areas of cooperation where it is in our mutual interest and to manage and reduce risk."2"One way the United States seeks to enhance cooperation with China is through military exchanges. The annual report to Congress describes three goals of developing military-to-military contacts with China: "(1) building sustained and substantive dialogue; (2) promoting risk reduction and risk management efforts that diminish the potential for misunderstanding or miscalculation; and (3) building concrete, practical cooperation in areas of mutual interest."3 Overall, military-to-military contacts between the two nations are meant to be a "stabilizing element" for the U.S.-China relationship.4 In 2017, these contacts "focused on risk reduction" and "developing the capacity to cooperate in multilateral settings."5"In furtherance of these aims, the U.S. and China engaged in high-level military contacts to facilitate the "exchange [of] views, identify common interest areas, manage differences, and facilitate common approaches to shared challenges."6 In addition, the U.S. and China have engaged in recurring military exchanges through forums such as the Defense Policy Coordination Talks, the Army-to-Army Dialogue Mechanism, the Joint Staff Dialogue Mechanism, and the Asia-Pacific Security Dialogue.7 The U.S. and China also maintain functional and academic exchanges that "focus on advancing risk reduction, understanding, and communication channels to promote deconfliction and coordination," in addition to conducting ship visits and exercises to "promote trust between the two sides and improve the ability to interact and coordinate in providing international public goods in areas of mutual interest."8"While cooperation is thus a critical pillar of U.S. strategy, in practice it comes with at least five key assumptions that must be recognized and moderated."First, there is the common belief that cooperation in some areas will lead to reduced tensions in others. Specifically, this is the belief that the two countries should establish greater cooperation in less contentious (but also less important) areas, and that this will facilitate cooperation in more contentious areas that are currently driving the tense relationship. This would be the case if the source of tension were strategic distrust; then greater dialogue and interaction could mitigate this obstacle. But my view is that the problems in the U.S.-China relationship are primarily the result of conflicting fundamental interests, not misunderstandings. Therefore, cooperation in areas such as global health or humanitarian assistance is unlikely to lead to breakthroughs in dealing with the critical security challenges in the South China Sea, East China Sea, Taiwan, and North Korea. This does not mean, however, that the two sides should not pursue cooperation when possible, but rather that we need to adjust our expectations and strategies. In other words, cooperation is not a good for its own sake, but a means to accomplish specific policy goals."Recommendation 1: The United States should consider working more closely with China only when Chinese involvement decreases the costs and/or increases the likelihood of success of a particular U.S. policy. We should not cooperate simply for the sake of generating goodwill or momentum for cooperation in another area."The second problematic assumption is that there are more benefits than downsides to cooperation when it can be obtained. In fact, there are situations in which the benefits of cooperation outweigh the costs. Currently, the goal of cooperation seems to be greater Chinese involvement with insufficient consideration of Chinese capabilities, tactics, and preferences. In some spaces, like global health, Chinese involvement is crucial because of the transnational nature of the threat. But in other spaces, like counterterrorism, Chinese involvement depends largely on Chinese capabilities and preferences. There are two situations in which it would be better to discourage Chinese involvement. First, when China has the capability to contribute but has goals that conflict with those of the United States. Second, when China shares the same goals as the United States but possesses limited capability. This is because in the security realm, operational missteps can worsen a situation on the ground."Recommendation 2: If China's interests clash with the U.S.'s, or if China lacks relevant capabilities, the United States should encourage Chinese 'free-riding' on certain security issues. Only when Chinese preferences and capabilities contribute to U.S. policy goals should the United States actively seek cooperation with China. An exception to this is when China is already involved, in which case the United States may pursue cooperation as a means to shape the nature and degree of its involvement."The third problematic assumption is that the U.S.-China relationship can improve only with active cooperation. Here I define cooperation as the process of working together for greater benefits, even if each side has somewhat differing interests. But another mechanism for improving bilateral military relations is coordination, a situation in which states may be agnostic about which policy to adopt, but would be better off if they did the same thing (for example, it does not matter which side of the road we drive on, only that we all choose the same side). And then there is deconfliction, a situation in which each side simply ensures that its independent policies have no negative impact on the other side. We unnecessarily narrow the prospects for U.S.-China relations when we focus only on cooperation."Recommendation 3: The U.S. should welcome the use of use of deconfliction and coordination with the PLA, rather than always seeking only active cooperation on security issues."Deconfliction, for example, is desirable for military operations to ensure that our forces do not unnecessarily come into contact with each other in the South China Sea or the East China Sea, or in the event of a crisis on the Korean Peninsula. Notification of operations and exercises, coupled with military dialogues and exchanges about the nature of both sides' military operations, could reduce the likelihood of an accident. With coordination, there is a lower likelihood of operational risk if China is operating separately from the United States. The Gulf of Aden operation is a good example of coordination: China coordinates with the international community to ensure that its participation contributes to the broader goals, but its navy does not conduct operations with other navies."A fourth troublesome assumption is that there are generally laws or norms against which we can measure Chinese behavior and hold China accountable. According to the annual report, "the military-to military relationship seeks to encourage China to act in a manner consistent with international law and norms."9 But in reality, certain aspects of the international order are nonexistent, weak, unstable, ambiguous, or incomplete. Cybersecurity norms are one example."And China will exploit this uncertainty to its benefit. In such cases, the U.S. must work hard to forge an informal consensus among countries and present that united front to China on the global stage."Recommendation 4: in addition to documenting the bilateral U.S.-China exchanges, the Defense Department should report on military contacts with other countries and the ways they are being used to establish broader consensus on contentious issues in the U.S.-China relationship."In the past year, the United States has had high-level military-to-military exchanges in which China would invariably have been a central topic of discussion - but the outcomes of such exchanges are not systematically collated with reference to China. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford visited his Thai military counterparts in February to discuss "opportunities to strengthen the alliance and interoperability between the two militaries," and with Australian military officials in April to discuss "the global threat of terrorism and security in the Pacific region."10 Dunford also visited South Korea in October 2017 to discuss the North Korean crisis.11 The Commander of U.S. Pacific Command visited the Philippines in August 2017, followed by a visit from the Chief of Staff for the Armed Forces of the Philippines to Pacific Command headquarters in October of that year.12 New Zealand and Vietnam have also received visits from high-level U.S. military officials in the past year.13 The United States and India have established an ongoing Military Cooperation Group that will be "the primary forum for developing, implementing, and refining a 5-year mil-to-mil plan, in support of the emerging 2+2 U.S.-India ministerial dialogue and the Defense Policy Group."14 However, none of the readouts from these bilateral military contacts refer to China as a topic of discussion (although many refer to the topic of regional security)."Fifth, the U.S. has traditionally considered China an actor only in the Indo-Pacific, when in fact it is an increasingly global actor. As a corollary, the scope of U.S.-China military exchanges remains largely confined to bilateral issues, when in fact the PLA increasingly has a routine global presence. For example, it is likely that in the future U.S. naval forces will have greater (or even routine) interaction with the PLAN in the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, and that U.S. ground forces will increasingly encounter PLA ground forces through peacekeeping actions and potentially in counterterrorism and stability operations."Recommendation 5: U.S.-China military exchanges should not be limited to U.S. Indo-Pacific Command; they should include other relevant geographic combatant commands, such as Central Command and Africa Command. These exchanges should focus on confidence-building and awareness of operational methods to mitigate the risk of unintended consequences or crises.Competition with China"China's expanding global influence is changing the contours of great power competition. With millions of Chinese nationals overseas and hundreds of companies doing business abroad, it is not surprising that one mission of the PLA is to secure Chinese interests abroad.15 The 2018 DOD annual report to Congress notes that China's "international interests have grown," and that its military modernization is "more focused on investments and infrastructure to support a range of missions beyond China's periphery, including power projection, sea lane security, counterpiracy, peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance/disaster relief (HA/DR), and noncombatant evacuation operations."16 The 2018 report also predicts that China will look to follow its establishment of a base in Djibouti by expanding its military logistics agreements with friendly countries around the world.17 China's growing global mission is also seen in PLAN's mission expansion to include "open seas protection" in addition to its previous limited focus on "offshore waters defense."18"There are, however, a range of other Chinese activities that may portend different forms or arenas of competition in the future. The 2018 DoD report recognizes that China's trillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which has already funded serious projects across Africa and Asia, is part of an effort to "leverage China's growing economic, diplomatic, and military clout to establish regional preeminence and expand the country's international influence." The report notes that countries participating in the BRI might "develop economic dependence on Chinese capital, which China could leverage to achieve its interests."19 On the face of things, the Chinese are using this economic initiative to build infrastructure for developing countries. But the money comes with strings attached. Many of these developing nations are susceptible to Chinese influence on the political, military, and economic levels. For example, in July 2017, Sri Lanka and China signed a 99-year lease for the Hambantota Port, which is both a militarily and economically strategic location in the Indian Ocean.20"Given our tendency to mirror-image, we may misinterpret Chinese behavior and craft ineffective policy responses as a result. Over the course of history, great powers have relied on a particular model of interaction with other states to accumulate, exercise, and maintain power. The Mongol empire connected lands through trade for the first time to fuel its growth; the Qing dynasty built a tributary system; Great Britain built an empire of colonies; the Soviet Union expanded by land, creating a Communist bloc in Eastern Europe and various spheres of influence around the world; the United States established an institutionalized order and a global military presence. In the same way, China is accumulating and exercising power in a way that is different from that used by the United States."These examples highlight a common feature of countries that successfully rose to great power status: entrepreneurial actions. A rising power is entrepreneurial if it looks for new sources of power and accumulates and exercises power in a way not previously attempted. There are many types of actions that could be considered entrepreneurial. A country can introduce new types of international organizations, provide new services or benefits to other countries, or increase influence in a different geographic area. A rising power can also attempt to do something that other countries do, such as provide foreign aid, but do it in a different, more efficient way. Lastly, like corporations, countries can identify supply shortages and respond to them by providing knowledge, products, or services that the incumbent power cannot or will not supply."China has, in recent years, displayed an effective entrepreneurial strategy. The BRI is the centerpiece of its strategy to accumulate and exercise power in a way that diverges from historical patterns and that therefore does not elicit a proportionate backlash. China would probably have met greater resistance if it sought to build colonies, as Britain did in the nineteenth century, or to establish a global institutional framework, as the U.S. did in the twentieth. Instead, China has built influence in novel ways. Its provision of advice to autocrats on best practices in internal surveillance and its provision of aid without any strings attached are good examples of this type of entrepreneurial action.21 Delaying military modernization and then focusing on asymmetric defensive capabilities, coupled with conducting nonthreatening military operations such as the UN peacekeeping and antipiracy missions in the Gulf of Aden, have also been innovative ways to create ambiguity about its intentions."Entrepreneurial action allows China to accumulate power and influence without triggering a strong response, because it creates uncertainty that hinders the U.S.'s ability to respond. This uncertainty is about the nature of the action itself - an action may go undetected because the United States understands power accumulation according to its methods and therefore is looking for actions similar to its own. For example, the DoD is looking for indicators that "China require[s] access to selected foreign ports to pre-position the necessary logistics support to sustain naval deployments,"22 because this is how the U.S. projects power, failing to realize that China may seek to strengthen its position in a different way. In other words, even if the BRI did not turn out to have strong military dimensions, that does not mean it is not designed to limit U.S. military power. China could use its economic clout to more efficiently constrain the U.S. Also, even though China has overseas interests, it may not pursue a global military presence like the U.S.'s, choosing instead to rely primarily on local authorities to protect its interests."China's entrepreneurial actions may also delay a U.S. response if the U.S. is skeptical about whether these actions will be successful. When the BRI was first announced, for example, many commented that the initiative was likely to fail. The BRI's infrastructure development is carried out by Chinese state enterprises, which do not fear bankruptcy because they expect to be bailed out by the government. Thus, these Chinese firms are economically and politically incentivized to invest in countries where they have little to no experience compared to their Western counterparts, and are likely to invest in projects that are deemed unprofitable or risky to other investors.23 Moreover, countries that benefit from long-term loans can easily default on loans from China and put China's economy in a dangerous position.24"We can see the delaying effects of entrepreneurial actions in the DoD report to Congress itself. China has been leveraging its economic power to achieve its national goals for almost two decades now, but the 2015 annual report to Congress mentions this fact for the first time, identifying China's use of punitive trade policies and limits on foreign direct investment as instruments of coercion in low-intensity conflict.25 U.S. analysts have a viewpoint about how threatening countries will behave and how the international system operates based on U.S. experience and thus may misjudge China's challenge by applying traditional critical success criteria without recognizing how these criteria have changed.26 My research shows that countries like the United States may recognize the challenge posed by a rising power, but tend to underestimate the rising power's capabilities and the effectiveness of its strategies."China's strategy of diversifying the types of power it accumulates coupled with its efforts to build power in an entrepreneurial way leads me to three policy recommendations."Recommendation 6: The United States needs a whole-government approach to ensure that we are accurately and completely identifying what China is doing across domains. There should be not only a DoD annual report to Congress on Chinese security and military developments, but also a USAID report on Chinese foreign aid, a State Department report on China's diplomatic efforts, a Commerce Department report on its growing economic clout, and so on."Recommendation 7: All agencies need to engage in a type of red teaming not only to evaluate the strategic environment from China's perspective, but also to explicitly ask how China may approach an objective given that its main goal is to create uncertainty about what it is doing and the payoffs associated with that action. We are too quick to assume that the U.S. way is 'best' and that China will follow suit if it can, which makes us blind to new ways China is seeking to challenge the U.S."Recommendation 8: Engaging successfully in great power competition with China (per the NSS) requires a global strategy, not a U.S.-China strategy. The United States needs to look beyond its traditional partners and allies to increase its influence across the board. Also, the U.S. needs to be entrepreneurial in its own right, identifying what countries need and providing those services in new ways instead of defaulting to what the U.S. currently has to offer."Recommendation 9: Once we get the collection of information and interpretation right, we need a point person on great power competition, a China Czar of sorts, to ensure that the U.S. is taking appropriate matching actions and counteractions to maintain its influence and power around the globe. This could be an expansion of the current role of the National Security Council's Senior Director for Asian Affairs. However, given the additional responsibilities of coordinating with all agencies on U.S. policies beyond Asia (with a focus on what China is doing in those countries), across all issue areas, an additional position may be necessary."The bottom line is that while we can learn from history and experience, we find ourselves in an unprecedented situation. China as a rising power that is primarily accumulating and exercising political and economic power (for now), within an institutionalized and integrated international system such as we have never had, facing the United States as a hegemon more constrained than previous ones, in a region that is also rising on the whole. As a result, we need new approaches, new institutions, and new processes to ensure that China's rise does not come at the expense of the United States."* * *Footnotes:1 "S. 1059 -- 106th Congress: National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000," 1999.2 Office of the Secretary of Defense, "Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China 2018," U.S. Department of Defense, iii.

Google's Reported Plan to Launch Censored Search Engine in China Raises Bipartisan Concern Among SenatorsTargeted News ServiceAugust 3, 2018 Friday 7:14 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 960 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe office of Sen. Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey, issued the following news release:U.S. Senator Bob Menendez and a bipartisan group of Senators wrote Google CEO Sundar Pichai to raise grave concerns and critical questions about Google's reported plan to launch a censored version of its search engine in China that would prohibit websites and search terms objected to by the Chinese government and Communist Party. Senators Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) joined the letter."If true, this reported plan is deeply troubling and risks making Google complicit in human rights abuses related to China's rigorous censorship regime," the Senators wrote. "Chinese authorities, however, continue to censor a broad range of news and social media topics that they have deemed politically 'sensitive' due to their belief that these topics may contribute to criticism of the Chinese government and Communist Party, and possibly lead to collective action," they added.According to media reports, China has in recent years harnessed the power of communications technology to advance its surveillance and social control efforts. Furthermore, Google's reported activity to build applications compatible with Chinese censorship demands would set a worrying precedent for other companies seeking to do business in China without compromising their core values.The full text of the letter can be found here and below.Dear Mr. Pichai:We write in response to recent news reports about Google's plan to launch a censored version of its search engine in China--codenamed "Dragonfly"--that would prohibit websites and search terms deemed objectionable by the Chinese government and Communist Party. If true, this reported plan is deeply troubling and risks making Google complicit in human rights abuses related to China's rigorous censorship regime.After a cyberattack that compromised the Gmail accounts of dozens of Chinese human rights activists, Google's March 2010 decision to stop censoring results on Google.cn was widely praised. The company's statement at the time noted: "We want as many people in the world as possible to have access to our services, including users in mainland China, yet the Chinese government has been crystal clear throughout our discussions that self-censorship is a non-negotiable legal requirement."Chinese authorities, however, continue to censor a broad range of news and social media topics that they have deemed politically "sensitive" due to their belief that these topics may contribute to criticism of the Chinese government and Communist Party, and possibly lead to collective action. In recent weeks, a significant vaccine scandal in China, which may have affected the health of hundreds of thousands of Chinese children, has run afoul of censors. News reports indicate that, as of last Monday, the Chinese word for "vaccine" was one of the most restricted on Weibo, China's Twitter-like microblog platform.Moreover, China has in recent years harnessed the power of communications technology to advance its surveillance and social control efforts. The Financial Times recently reported that the largest technology companies in China--including Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, and JD.com--are "inextricably linked with the Chinese state and its security apparatus, and the authorities retain the upper hand in the relationship." Google's reported activity to build applications compatible with Chinese censorship demands is all the more concerning in light of relationships that Google has made with these companies, including a technology cross-licensing joint venture with Tencent and an investment of $550 million in JD.com.It is a coup for the Chinese government and Communist Party to force Google--the biggest search engine in the world--to comply with their onerous censorship requirements, and sets a worrying precedent for other companies seeking to do business in China without compromising their core values. In light of these reports, we respectfully request answers to the following questions:- Is Google in the process of developing a censored search engine or other censored applications for China? If so, will this be part of a joint venture with a Chinese domestic partner?- What has changed since 2010 to make Google comfortable cooperating with the rigorous censorship regime in China?- In many cases, the entrance of a western firm in China is conditioned upon that firm entering a joint venture with a domestic Chinese firm. Was Google's decision to enter a joint venture with Tencent connected in any way with its efforts to enter the Chinese market via the custom search app?- If Google is working on a search product for the mainland Chinese market, which "blacklist" of censored searches and websites are you using? Are there any phrases or words that Google is refusing to censor?- Will Google employees involved in managing "Dragonfly" be required to attend the official mandatory trainings on "Marxist news values" and "socialist values" as required of other technology companies that provide Internet news content services in China?- Presumably Google will comply with China's Cybersecurity Law and its data localization requirements.

GOOGLE'S REPORTED PLAN TO LAUNCH CENSORED SEARCH ENGINE IN CHINA RAISES BIPARTISAN CONCERN AMONG SENATORSStates News ServiceAugust 3, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 948 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez:U.S. Senator Bob Menendez and a bipartisan group of Senators wrote Google CEO Sundar Pichai to raise grave concerns and critical questions about Googles reported plan to launch a censored version of its search engine in China that would prohibit websites and search terms objected to by the Chinese government and Communist Party. Senators Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) joined the letter.If true, this reported plan is deeply troubling and risks making Google complicit in human rights abuses related to Chinas rigorous censorship regime, the Senators wrote . Chinese authorities, however, continue to censor a broad range of news and social media topics that they have deemed politically sensitive due to their belief that these topics may contribute to criticism of the Chinese government and Communist Party, and possibly lead to collective action, they added.According to media reports, China has in recent years harnessed the power of communications technology to advance its surveillance and social control efforts. Furthermore, Googles reported activity to build applications compatible with Chinese censorship demands would set a worrying precedent for other companies seeking to do business in China without compromising their core values.The full text of the letter can be found here and below.Dear Mr. Pichai:We write in response to recent news reports about Googles plan to launch a censored version of its search engine in Chinacodenamed Dragonflythat would prohibit websites and search terms deemed objectionable by the Chinese government and Communist Party. If true, this reported plan is deeply troubling and risks making Google complicit in human rights abuses related to Chinas rigorous censorship regime.After a cyberattack that compromised the Gmail accounts of dozens of Chinese human rights activists, Googles March 2010 decision to stop censoring results on Google.cn was widely praised. The companys statement at the time noted: We want as many people in the world as possible to have access to our services, including users in mainland China, yet the Chinese government has been crystal clear throughout our discussions that self-censorship is a non-negotiable legal requirement.Chinese authorities, however, continue to censor a broad range of news and social media topics that they have deemed politically sensitive due to their belief that these topics may contribute to criticism of the Chinese government and Communist Party, and possibly lead to collective action. In recent weeks, a significant vaccine scandal in China, which may have affected the health of hundreds of thousands of Chinese children, has run afoul of censors. News reports indicate that, as of last Monday, the Chinese word for vaccine was one of the most restricted on Weibo, Chinas Twitter-like microblog platform.Moreover, China has in recent years harnessed the power of communications technology to advance its surveillance and social control efforts. The Financial Times recently reported that the largest technology companies in Chinaincluding Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, and JD.comare inextricably linked with the Chinese state and its security apparatus, and the authorities retain the upper hand in the relationship. Googles reported activity to build applications compatible with Chinese censorship demands is all the more concerning in light of relationships that Google has made with these companies, including a technology cross-licensing joint venture with Tencent and an investment of $550 million in JD.com.It is a coup for the Chinese government and Communist Party to force Googlethe biggest search engine in the worldto comply with their onerous censorship requirements, and sets a worrying precedent for other companies seeking to do business in China without compromising their core values. In light of these reports, we respectfully request answers to the following questions:Is Google in the process of developing a censored search engine or other censored applications for China? If so, will this be part of a joint venture with a Chinese domestic partner?What has changed since 2010 to make Google comfortable cooperating with the rigorous censorship regime in China?In many cases, the entrance of a western firm in China is conditioned upon that firm entering a joint venture with a domestic Chinese firm. Was Googles decision to enter a joint venture with Tencent connected in any way with its efforts to enter the Chinese market via the custom search app?If Google is working on a search product for the mainland Chinese market, which blacklist of censored searches and websites are you using? Are there any phrases or words that Google is refusing to censor?Will Google employees involved in managing Dragonfly be required to attend the official mandatory trainings on Marxist news values and socialist values as required of other technology companies that provide Internet news content services in China?Presumably Google will comply with Chinas Cybersecurity Law and its data localization requirements. Will Google provide information about the search histories of individual users to Chinese government authorities? What confidence does Google have that its local joint venture partner will abide by any user protections that Google puts in place?We appreciate your prompt reply to this inquiry, including any views that you are prepared to share as to how this reported development can be reconciled with Googles unofficial motto, Dont be evil.Sincerely,###Press ContactFrancisco_Pelayo@menendez.senate.govLoad-Date: August 3, 2018End of Document

Origin: A Step Closer to the Commercialization of Corn Seed GMO Technology; - Origin Entered More Cooperation Programs for Biotech Traits in Order to Capture Multi-Billion Dollar Biotech Corn Seed Market in ChinaPR NewswireAugust 23, 2018 Thursday 10:30 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 763 wordsDateline: BEIJING, Aug. 23, 2018 Body Origin Agritech Ltd. (NASDAQ: SEED), ("the Company" or "Origin") an agriculture technology and rural e-commerce company, today announced thatthe Company has started new cooperation programs with other seed suppliers in China to integrate the company's GMO traits with the seed varieties from other suppliers."This is a significant step forward for the commercialization of our GMO technologies. As more and more corn seed suppliers are realizing the value of GMO technology, they start to work with us in order to get ready to license our GMO technologies," said Dr. James Chen, Origin's Chief Executive Officer.Origin is the leading technology provider for corn seed GMO technologies in China. According to the "Thirteenth Five Year State Science and Technology Innovative Plan" published by the Chinese government in 2016, the Chinese government set to target the commercialization of corn seed GMO technologies during the central government's Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, which ends in 2020. Additionally, the recent crackdowns of illegal GMO seeds of several high profiled corn seed providers by the Chinese government help the government to pave the way for full commercialization of the corn seed GMO technology.  Origin has prepared to be ready for the commercialization of its GMO technologies and is working with other seed suppliers to integrate its GMO traits into the seed varieties of these suppliers in order to license its technologies upon the commercialization approval from the Chinese government. China has the corn planting acreage similar to the United States and the market value for the corn seed GMO technology could reach over multi billion dollars in China.About Origin Agritech LimitedOrigin Agritech Limited, founded in 1997 and headquartered in Zhong-Guan-Cun (ZGC) Life Science Park in Beijing, is China'sleading agricultural technology and a rural social e-commerce company, expanding in mid-2018 from crop seed breeding and genetic improvement business to be a leading technology developer in new rural e-commerce platform and Blockchain technologies. In crop seed biotechnologies, Origin Agritech's phytase corn was the first transgenic corn to receive the Bio-Safety Certificate from China's Ministry of Agriculture. Over the years, Origin has established a robust biotechnology seed pipeline including products with glyphosate tolerance and pest resistance (Bt) traits.

Although China is technologically advanced in many respects, with the world's largest e-commerce market and a thriving mobile-payments landscape, businesses have been slow to invest in IT initiatives that improve operational efficiencies or provide a competitive advantage, including those related to automation or advanced analytics.1 China's delay in moving to the enterprise cloud is one major factor behind the low digitization rates.That may soon change, however. Within the technology sector, Chinese business leaders now acknowledge that their low cloud-usage rates are an increasing liability. They're demonstrating their concern by increased investment in both the public and private cloud-and they might leapfrog their global peers. Even the Chinese government has taken note of the cloud's importance and has stated its commitment to growth. According to an action plan issued by the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, officials want to increase the scale of the cloud-computing industry more than 2.5 times by 2019, compared with 2015 levels.2SidebarOur survey methodologyIn early 2018, we surveyed IT decision makers at 504 enterprises based in China about their cloud preferences. Approximately 120 respondents stated that their companies spent more than 1 million renminbi (about $154,000) on external cloud services, and we asked this group over 40 questions about their goals for cloud expenditures, migration of workloads to the cloud, and vendor preferences. Sample questions included, "What criteria are important for selecting a cloud vendor?" and "What are the main barriers to cloud adoption today?" The respondents represented a mix of industries, including internet services; financial; artificial intelligence and high tech; industrials; and travel, transport, and logistics (exhibit). The companies ranged in size from fewer than 100 employees to more than 10,000. Similarly, revenues ranged from under 350 million renminbi annually to over 35 billion renminbi.For public-cloud providers, these trends represent an important opportunity. Although most Chinese companies now prefer the private cloud, analysts predict that public-usage rates could rise more than 20 percent annually over the next three years. The major public-cloud providers, both local and global, are already moving aggressively to capture business. To gain more insight into this vibrant market, we researched the current state of the enterprise cloud in China, looking at trends related to both private and public usage. We also conducted a cross-industry survey of over 500 Chinese enterprises, with a deep dive on approximately 120 players that spent more than 1 million renminbi (about $154,000) on cloud services (see sidebar, "Our survey methodology"). Here's what we found.Market snapshot: The current state of the Chinese cloudChina's recent cloud growth initially seems impressive. The country devoted around 14 percent of its total IT budget to cloud services in 2017-more than double the amount spent in 2013. But even with this growth, China still lags behind its global peers in cloud expenditures. In the United States, for instance, cloud spending accounted for around 29 percent of the total IT budget in 2017, up from around 14 percent in 2013 (Exhibit 1).Exhibit Link to Image China also differs from many of its global peers in its preference for the private cloud. In the United States, public-cloud spending accounted for around 24 percent of the average IT budget, compared to around 5 percent for the private cloud. In China, however, IT spending is almost evenly split between the public and private cloud.This snapshot of the Chinese cloud shows where things are now, but it doesn't reveal what's ahead. While the potential opportunities for public-cloud providers appear enormous, competition is already so intense that leading players dropped their prices by more than 30 percent in 2017.3 Our survey provides some insight into the opportunities and challenges ahead.All public-cloud providers will continue to find opportunities, regardless of size or locationOne survey finding should give hope to all players: the door is open to any qualified provider in China, regardless of size or country of origin. In our survey, respondents reported that four Chinese providers now receive about 64 percent of their public-cloud spend (Exhibit 2). The remainder went to multinationals and other Chinese players. Respondents anticipated that the breakdown would be roughly similar three years from now.Exhibit Link to Image In the future, the public-cloud market should remain wide open, largely in line with the pattern seen today. Although over half the respondents in our survey said that they wanted to work with large-scale Chinese vendors over the long term, 30 percent stated that they'd prefer to engage with global players that had facilities in China and license to operate there (Exhibit 3). Smaller Chinese players will also find a place in the future market, since they were the top choice for 16 percent of respondents.Exhibit Link to Image Public-cloud providers will find that opportunity varies by industry and workloadAs in the United States, Chinese internet-services companies, financial services companies, and those within high tech or artificial intelligence are most likely to use the public cloud (Exhibit 4). Among these businesses, usage was by far the highest for internet-services companies, with all respondents in this area reporting some public-cloud expenditures. Financial services was a distant second, at 65 percent.Exhibit Link to Image We also identified cloud patterns associated with IT workloads. Using IT spending as a proxy for growth, we asked survey respondents which workloads now received the most funding and whether this would change in 2021. They anticipated some of the greatest increases to be in consumer applications, big data, and business intelligence over the next three years (Exhibit 5). This trend correlates with the Chinese government's push to expand cloud use in these areas to promote GDP growth.Exhibit Link to Image Public-cloud providers will face a strong challenge from the dominant private cloudPublic-cloud providers aren't just competing against one another-they also have to overcome the reluctance of companies to move to the cloud. While Chinese businesses may have multiple reasons for wanting to delay migration, our survey suggests that two are particularly important (Exhibit 6).Exhibit Link to Image First, there's the cost and difficulty of migration, which 66 percent of respondents identified as a major barrier to cloud usage. Their concerns are justified, since most Chinese companies have less advanced technology stacks, with most lacking a standard virtualized or containerized workload. These factors complicate all migrations, but the problems tend to be most severe when using a public-cloud provider. On the cost side, Chinese companies face big expenses during cloud migration because they must typically build or create most hardware and software necessary for the shift. That means public-cloud vendors in China can't claim that their services will reduce IT costs, at least over the first few years of migration, as they do in other countries.The second major concern relates to security, which 61 percent of respondents cited as a barrier. This finding sharply differentiates China from the United States, where public-cloud providers now offer sophisticated security solutions that enterprises often cite as a benefit. Several factors may explain why our survey respondents lacked confidence in cloud security. First, both local and multinational players in the Chinese market vary in their ability to manage security challenges, so enterprises are naturally concerned that their chosen provider might lack essential capabilities. Their fear of poor security is also heightened because enterprises in China must follow strict data-transmission and storage requirements to meet local regulatory requirements. They can't risk selecting a public-cloud provider that might put them afoul of government standards.  It's possible that US providers might allay some of these concerns if they describe their security capabilities to Chinese enterprises.While migration difficulties and security concerns won't discourage all companies from moving to the public cloud, adoption could be slow. In many cases, the hybrid cloud may emerge as the preferred alternative, since it provides the best of both worlds. For highly sensitive information, companies can maintain private firewalls and control third-party access. At the same time, they can take advantage of the public cloud's scale and low-cost compute power for less sensitive information. In our survey, IT decision makers often indicated that they wanted IT-services companies to provide the expertise required to design and implement hybrid solutions so they could optimize their total cloud spending.Enterprises are open to different working models and prioritize performancePublic-cloud providers are increasingly investing in specific areas, such as artificial intelligence and the management of large data sets, to differentiate themselves from the competition. However, our survey found that Chinese companies did not always require their vendors to have such specialized knowledge. When asked whether they'd prefer to work with a single vendor or a combination of companies that can provide "best of breed" capabilities, they were almost evenly split (Exhibit 7).Exhibit Link to Image For vendor-selection criteria, most respondents stated that performance and technical requirements were the top considerations-a finding that would likely be replicated in most countries. Pricing was in second place, closely followed by service and support.Next steps for cloud vendorsChinese businesses are at different points in their cloud-migration journey, with some having advanced capabilities and others still taking their first tentative steps. Likewise, their needs and requirements will vary. Although public-cloud vendors won't find a single recipe for success in this heterogeneous market, our survey suggests that they'll improve their odds by keeping the following points in mind:• It's essential to win based on technology. Cloud vendors need to develop a full portfolio of capabilities that meet all needs of Chinese enterprises, including those that want to increase their efforts in artificial intelligence, big data, and automation. The best companies will adapt their current strategies to suit the Chinese technology stack, rather than expecting companies to possess the same sophisticated hardware and software found in many developed countries.• Price wars are inevitable. In the United States, public-cloud vendors have aggressively lowered prices to gain market share. This approach is possible because they take advantage of scale, increased efficiencies, and falling hardware prices to optimize their cost base and pass the benefits to their customers. This trend has encouraged a faster pace of cloud adoption in the United States. We expect Chinese enterprises to follow a similar pricing strategy as they optimize costs, which could encourage greater public-cloud growth.• Migration must become easier. With our survey showing that Chinese companies view the costs and difficulty of migration as the greatest barrier to the cloud, vendors must make the process as inexpensive and seamless as possible. This won't be easy because the IT infrastructure within Chinese companies tends to be more diverse than elsewhere. In the United States, for instance, the leading virtualization solution has more than 90 percent share; in China, the leading solution has a 50 percent share. This IT diversity is a challenge for both public- and private-cloud vendors because they must invest in migration tools for multiple technology stacks to enable the rapid shift of workloads from traditional IT environments to their platforms.• Security is paramount. With Chinese companies on high alert for security breaches, especially in industries such as financial services with extensive confidential data, vendors need to share the same priorities. Safeguarding their cloud should be their primary concern.• Vendors must make the case for cloud investment. Since Chinese companies face high migration costs, vendors must build a strong business case for the cloud. They should present it as an engine for digital transformation, not just a technology service, and emphasize that companies can achieve real bottom-line benefits through digitization. Without such prompts, companies may never overcome their initial inertia.China is among the top three countries in the world for venture-capital investment in major digital technologies, including artificial intelligence.4 That alone shows a real belief in the power of technology. Paradoxically, however, Chinese businesses have been slow to use these solutions.5 It's only recently that they've begun to acknowledge the danger of falling behind and devoted more attention to the cloud. Public-cloud vendors-global and local, large and small-can capitalize on this opportunity, but technical prowess alone won't be enough to win. They'll also have to create an ecosystem that contains system integrators and solution providers with specific industry expertise that can help turn technology investment into business profits. Together, they can unlock value from the public cloud.About the authorsHari Kannan is an associate partner in McKinsey's Silicon Valley office, and Christopher Thomas is a partner in the Beijing office.Footnotes1 For more information, see "Digital China: Powering the economy to global competitiveness," McKinsey Global Institute, December 2017.2 China sets ambitious goal in cloud computing," Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, April 2017, chinadaily.com.3 McKinsey analysis.4 McKinsey analysis.5 McKinsey analysis.McKinsey InsightsFor more of McKinsey's latest thinking, install our app for iPad or            Android.Load-Date: February 20, 2020End of Document

Fail Facebook&#39;s last attempt to enter ChinaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 27, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 664 wordsBody Facebook Inc.'s fleeting attempt to open an "innovation center" in China highlights how difficult it will be for the social network to form a significant presence in the country.  Shortly after a government website showed that a subsidiary of the social network could register a company in Zhejiang, which purported to be a center for interacting with Chinese developers, the announcement disappeared. While no reason was given, the New York Times reported that the approval was withdrawn after the national regulator disagreed with the approval of the provincial government for the subsidiary.  China, which strictly controls the media and the internet, remains elusive with Facebook, even despite the proposals made by the firm's top executive, Mark Zuckerberg. The plans to install an office in Beijing did not come to fruition, the application to share photos Colorful Balloons did not manage to gain strength, WhatsApp works intermittently and its social network has been blocked for almost a decade. At the same time, WeChat, of Tencent Holdings Ltd., has become almost ubiquitous, raising questions about whether the US company could win customers even if approval is reactivated.  "Given the widespread current cleanup of all media in China, I think it is now even more difficult for Facebook to bring its main platform to China," said Andy Tian, ??senior executive of Asia Innovations Group, which operates a streaming service in China. I live all over China and has worked for Zynga and Google in the country.  The problem highlights the complexity of navigating the regulatory terrain of China, particularly in an Internet area that is one of the most monitored and censored in the world. "They should have had a direct conversation with the ministry in charge of the internet to say 'we are not going to take the Facebook platform to China; all we want is to do some engineering and have investments, '"said Tian.  The government of China restricts the information and content that its citizens can access, even imposing its will on local social networks. While WeChat and Weibo, a Chinese service similar to Twitter, censor publications on sensitive issues, Facebook and other foreign companies are out of Beijing's control.  When asked at a briefing why the Facebook request had been rejected, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang sent all detailed inquiries to "the relevant authorities", but not before adding a comment on the influence of China.  "The Chinese Internet market is booming. China has the largest number of Internet users in the world. We would like to share the development opportunities that Internet development provides, "he said. "As long as these foreign internet companies comply with Chinese laws and regulations, we welcome their development and commercial opening in China."  The center proposed by Facebook highlights a change in strategy for US companies that are prohibited from operating their main divisions in China: building small bridgeheads that do not attract attention, but still promote their brands among developers, engineers and consumers who are tech savvy. . Google, whose main services are blocked, is focusing on promoting its TensorFlow software with developers, injecting money into an artificial intelligence research center in Beijing and launching some applications that do not challenge the Chinese government's censorship controls. He has also been investing in local startups.  While China is still a big hole in Facebook's global presence of 2,230 millionpeople, the company has many other challenges, such as the slowdown in growth, the fall in the price of shares and scandals on user data.  That helps to emphasize why he still wants to be in China and continues to take small steps to establish a presence in the country, as with the innovation center.  Facebook did not respond immediately to a request for comments.  The entry Fails Facebook's last attempt to enter China was first published in La Tercera. Load-Date: July 27, 2018End of Document

The Chinese government does not believe in Winnie PoohCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 13, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 189 wordsBody Disney is doing a lift to their classic movies, and this time it was the teddy Winnie The Pooh. Christopher Robin is a new version of this story that mixes actors with computer animations. But is it difficult for the film to be seen in China? due to the resemblance between the bear and its president, Xi Jinping. On the one hand, in China circulate memes that compare it with Pooh; the most famous of 2013, where a walk of the Chinese premier with the then President Obama is replicated in a drawing of the bear with his friend Tigger. The thing went viral and the joke was consecrated. On the other hand, the Chinese government only allows 34 foreign films per year.  Which of the two causes is responsible for this censorship? We believe that both: it is difficult for a film like this to obtain the approval of the censors. Recall that General Onganía banned Aunt Vicenta magazine because Landru had drawn him as a walrus. Think of the Kirchner penguins and the Macri cat. Being president means belonging to a certain animal species, and few like to be reminded.  Copyright Grupo de Diarios América - GDA / La Nación / Argentina Load-Date: August 13, 2018End of Document

Administration Moving Ahead With New Tariffs On Additional $16B In Chinese ImportsThe FrontrunnerAugust 8, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 2255 wordsBodyThe Administration's announcement Tuesday that it is moving ahead with plans to impose 25 percent tariffs on an additional $16 billion in Chinese imports is receiving light media coverage. Reports cast the move as being made despite complaints from American companies that it would raise operating costs. None of the networks covered the move last night, but Fox News' Special Report (8/7, 2.1M) reported the Administration says it will go ahead with tariffs on $16 billion in Chinese imports of industrial products. Customs officials will begin collecting tax on such products August 23. The "new taxes are in addition to 25% tariffs that took effect July 6 on Chinese products. China has responded with the retaliatory tariffs of its own." Breitbart (8/7, Moons, 1.28M) reports that Trump told reporters, "As you know we have 200 billion in abeyance and then after the 200 billion we have 300 billion in abeyance."USA Today (8/7, Collins, 11.4M) says the move "further escalat[es] a trade war with Beijing," and to the AP (8/8, Wiseman), the announcement "was not a surprise. In April, the administration had announced plans to slap tariffs on 1,333 Chinese product lines worth $50 billion a year. After receiving public feedback, it cut 515 products from the list in June and added 284." According to Bloomberg News (8/7, Mayeda, 4.46M), the Administration will begin imposing the duties "in two weeks" on "279 product lines, down from 284 items on the initial list." It will mark "the second time the US slaps duties on Chinese goods in about the past month, despite complaints by American companies that such moves will raise business costs and eventually consumer prices."To Reuters (8/7, Lawder), the "action is the latest by...Trump to put pressure on China to negotiate trade concessions after imposing tariffs on $34 billion in goods last month." China, Reuters says, "has vowed to retaliate to an equal degree." While USTR "removed a handful of items from its original list after a 46-day public comment and review period found they would cause 'severe economic harm,'" the Semiconductor Industry Association "expressed disappointment at USTR's decision to keep the sector on the tariff list." SIA President John Neuffer said in a statement, "We have made the case to the administration, in the strongest possible terms, that tariffs imposed on semiconductors imported from China will hurt America's chipmakers, not China's, and will do nothing to stop China's problematic and discriminatory trade practices."The Washington Examiner (8/7, Williams, 340K) reports that "large corporations like Caterpillar have raised costs to mitigate the impact of the new tariffs, while Ford Motor Co., General Motors and others are warning that profits will be lower in 2018 as a result of the Trump administration's trade agenda." Meanwhile, "several smaller manufacturers, who are unable to pass the cost of the tariffs along to customers, are laying off workers and cutting production as a result of the trade skirmishes with China, the European Union, Mexico and others." The Wall Street Journal (8/7, Simon, Subscription Publication, 6.13M) reports that smaller US businesses and startups are being hit particularly bad, and USA Today (8/7, Hayes, 11.4M) says a "South Carolina television-making company says it might be forced to shut down a plant and lay off its employees because of the ongoing trade war between the US and China." The Element Electronics plant in Winnsboro, "one of the biggest employers in Fairfield County, said unless its parts are removed from the tariff list, it will be forced to close down and layoff 126 people."The AP (8/7, Liedtke, Gill), meanwhile, warns that the "prices of headphones, speakers, high-tech lighting and internet service could all go up if the US trade war with China continues." However, it "remains unclear how much prices might rise, partly because the next round of tariffs won't be imposed until the fall." The Hill (8/7, Elis, 2.71M) reports China "has already slapped back at the US with its own tariffs," and "is expected to respond in kind to the latest round of tariffs." According to The Hill, China's "responses are already having an effect, particularly in the agricultural sector." Congressional Republicans, meanwhile, "worry that the escalating trade war will take the winds out of their sails as they seek to campaign on a strong economy and their tax cut law ahead of November's elections."CNBC (8/7, 4.81M) reports that China's state media "continued its aggressive rhetoric" against the Administration, "accusing Washington of being 'double-faced' amid an ongoing trade dispute." The People's Daily newspaper wrote in an editorial, "Pointing China with (sic) gun and artillery and then asking for a talk, the US showed zero sincerity."White House Officials Met With Tech Groups To Reassure Them About China Policy.David McCabe of Axios (8/7, McCabe, 2.49M) reports that "White House officials sought to reassure tech industry representatives at a private meeting last week that the Trump administration's pugnacious trade policies will ultimately aid their businesses." Citing "multiple sources," McCabe says the White House officials "argued that tariffs will help the administration push China to change course on issues that matter to tech, including the forced transfer of American intellectual property into Chinese hands." One source is quoted as saying, "the administration did its best to suggest there is a coherent strategy behind all this churn." According to McCabe, "The White House meeting was attended by staffers for trade groups representing the tech and telecom industries, as well as representatives of some individual companies."Bloomberg News: While US Stocks Continue To Post Gains, Trump's Trade War Is Weakening Xi.Bloomberg News (8/7, Kawa, 4.46M) reports US stock indices are continuing to post gains. Bloomberg says "it turns out that a trade war isn't enough to tarnish President Trump's favored report card: the American stock market." Bloomberg notes that the S&P 500 "logged back-to-back gains the past two sessions that pushed the benchmark close to its January record, despite China's unveiling of tariff plans on Friday," and "was less than half a percent from the all-time high on Tuesday." Bloomberg adds, "With the S&P 500 climbing by some $1.3 trillion since Trump unofficially kicked off the trade war by announcing aluminum and steel tariffs on March 1, he has all the more reason to escalate the trade battle between the world's two largest economies."A second Bloomberg News (8/7, Martin, Crawford, 4.46M) report says that only a short while ago, Chinese President Xi Jinping "seemed unstoppable," but now Xi "looks like he may have overreached. An economic slowdown, a tanking stock market, and an infant-vaccine scandal are all feeding domestic discontent, while abroad, in Western capitals and financial centers, there's a growing wariness of Chinese ambitions." Bloomberg adds, "And then there is the escalating trade war with the US. China initially refused to believe it would happen, but in the past few weeks it's become the prism through which Xi's perceived failings are best projected." According to Bloomberg, its "slowing economy makes China more vulnerable to damage from a trade war, which economists predict could cut as much as half a percentage point from growth."Senators Urge Administration To Counter "Predatory" Chinese Lending To Poor Countries.The Washington Times (8/7, Boylan, 460K) reports that a group of 16 bipartisan senators wrote a letter to the Administration "about their alarm that Pakistan could soon request an International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout loan to repay China for a series of 'predatory Chinese infrastructure financing' projects." In the letter to Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and Secretary of State Pompeo, the senators asked how the Administration "plans to address the dangers of China's so-called Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which they argue seeks to leverage lending into strategic military footholds across Asia." Wrote the senators, "As financially strapped countries negotiate with China to free themselves of mounting debt, Beijing has extracted onerous concessions, including equity in strategically important assets. Further, Beijing has repeatedly used economic pressure to affect foreign policy decisions."Chinese Intellectual Warned Beijing It Was Being Too Complacent Over Trump.The South China Morning Post (8/7, Leng, 138K) reports that a "contrarian Chinese research report published two years ago that challenged the consensus that Donald Trump's rhetorical threats could be safely ignored has left the unknown professor who wrote it basking in the spotlight." One week after the election in November 2016, economics professor Yang Qijing "wrote that some in China mistakenly considered [Trump's] victory a strategic opportunity that would support China's rise." Instead, that assessment was very likely to be "an over-optimistic and very dangerous strategic misjudgment," Yang wrote, "warning that China needed to study immediate countermeasures to the policies Trump would pursue."State-Run Chinese Outlet: Apple May Be Made To Suffer If Trade War Is Prolonged.CNBC (8/7, 4.81M) reports that China's People's Daily warned in an article published Tuesday that Apple "has benefited from cheap labor and a strong supply chain in China and needs to share more of its profit with the Chinese people or face 'anger and nationalist sentiment' amid the ongoing trade war." CNBC "highlights how Apple made $9.6 billion in revenues in China in the June quarter," and says "the continuing trade war between the US and China could leave Apple and other US firms vulnerable as 'bargaining chips' for Beijing." The People's Daily said "China doesn't want to close its doors to Apple despite the trade conflict, but if the US company wants to earn good money in China, its needs to share its development dividends with the Chinese people."People's Daily Praises Google For Submitting To Government's Censorship Demands.The Washington Post (8/7, Shaban, 15.68M) reports, "In an opinion piece and on social media posts on Monday, Chinese state media welcomed Google back to the country, as long as it follows the law." The Post adds that "the commentary by People's Daily, the main newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, follows reports that the search giant is developing a censored version of its app that would earn the blessing of the Chinese government." The Post notes that The Intercept "first reported that Google planned to develop a China-compliant search engine that would blacklist websites and search terms tied to human rights, peaceful protest and democracy."Beijing Demands Christians Infuse Faith With "Chinese Characteristics."The AP (8/7, Wang) reports that "without warning," residents of China's "Christian heartland province of Henan ha[ve] found themselves on the front lines of an ambitious new effort by the officially atheist ruling Communist Party to dictate - and in some cases displace - the practice of faith in the country." Under President Xi Jinping, Christians "are seeing their freedoms shrink dramatically even as the country undergoes a religious revival." According to the AP, the crackdown "is part of a broader push by Xi to 'Sinicize' all the nation's religions by infusing them with 'Chinese characteristics' such as loyalty to the Communist Party."Chrysler CEO Expected To Push Trump To Rethink Auto Tariffs.Bloomberg News (8/7, Coppola, 4.46M) reports Fiat Chrysler "has won tweets of praise from President Trump for its decision to shift pickup production from Mexico to Michigan," but "now new [CEO] Mike Manley must try to parlay that goodwill into a change in the president's trade policy." Along with other CEOs, Manley was to meet with Trump in New Jersey on Tuesday evening. According to Bloomberg, "Automakers have been loudly and publicly lobbying against the Trump administration's consideration of a tariff on imported cars, warning it would trigger retaliation from other countries, depress sales, and force them to lay off workers." Reuters (8/7) reports that along with Manley, "expected attendees include the heads of...Boeing Co, FedEx Corp, and Honeywell International Inc.," while Bloomberg News (8/7, Talev, 4.46M) says Trump "will be joined by aides including his daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner; Larry Kudlow, his top economic adviser; and deputy chief of staff for policy coordination Chris Liddell."Breitbart (8/7, Spiering, 1.28M) reports that during Tuesday night's dinner, Trump "boast[ed] of all the great economic news for the country." Trump reportedly told the gathering, "We're taking our economy to incredible new heights." China, he added, has "not treated us fairly for many decades," placing "the blame squarely on past presidents," and "predicting success at the bargaining table."NYTimes: Metal Tariffs Could Increase Costs For Construction Industry.The New York Times (8/7, Hughes, 19.33M) reports that "with the prices of steel and aluminum rising, it may only be a matter of time before prices on new homes go up, too." The Administration's tariffs on imported metals are "rattling the construction industry." But "because builders buy materials well before any ground is broken - and months, if not years, ahead of the opening of sales and rental offices - the effect of tariffs on apartment prices and rents may take a while to filter through the system."Load-Date: August 8, 2018End of Document

China: US Tech Firms Risk Complicity in AbusesTargeted News ServiceAugust 7, 2018 Tuesday 7:54 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1531 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK BodyHuman Rights Watch issued the following news release:Stakeholders and shareholders in Google and Facebook should urge the companies not to exchange user rights for access to China's market, Human Rights Watch said. According to reporting in The Intercept, Google has been developing a search engine app to comply with China's expansive censorship requirements. Facebook previously developed a censored version of its service for China, though never launched it.The US Congress, European Parliament, and other legislatures around the world should express concern at US companies who are cooperating with China's censorship and surveillance, Human Rights Watch said."Technology companies should be challenging China's censorship - not complicit in it," said Cynthia Wong, senior internet researcher at Human Rights Watch. "Shareholders in Google and Facebook who care about human rights should urge these companies not to compromise them for access to China's market."Leaked documents examined by The Intercept describe the company's plans to launch a censored version of its search engine as an Android app. According to the media report, Google has already demonstrated the app to Chinese officials and is waiting for approval for launch. The project, code-named Dragonfly, has been in development since spring 2017. According to reporting by The Intercept, work on the project accelerated following a meeting between Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Chinese government officials in December 2017, and the app could launch in the next six to nine months. The company is also in talks with potential Chinese partners to provide other cloud services inside the country, according to separate media reports.Human Rights Watch reached out to Google to ask how it proposes to safeguard human rights as it seeks to expand its products and services in China. HRW had not received a response for the record at time of this publication.China's extensive censorship regime restricts a wide range of peaceful expression that officials deem politically sensitive, including criticism of government policy and information that does not conform to official narratives. China's Great Firewall Internet filtering system blocks websites at the national level, including Google and Facebook services. Broadly drafted laws also require social media services, search engines, and websites that host user content to censor politically sensitive information on its behalf. The government issues vaguely worded censorship orders and expects companies to proactively restrict access to broad categories of information."Google withdrew from China in 2010 because the human rights and cybersecurity environment was too precarious," Wong said. "Since then, China renewed its crackdown on rights and enacted new laws that conscript tech firms in censorship and surveillance, but the company hasn't explained how this time will be any better."According to media reports, Google's custom Chinese search app would comply with the censorship regime by automatically identifying and filtering sites blocked by the Great Firewall. Filtered sites would not be shown in response to searches, and the company would notify the user that some results may have been removed. Examples of websites that would be censored include the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and Wikipedia, according to documents seen by The Intercept.Google is not the only US internet company considering whether to censor to seek access to the Chinese market. In November 2016, the New York Times reported that Facebook was developing software "to suppress posts from appearing in people's news feeds in specific geographic areas," specifically "to help Facebook get into China." The report states that Facebook would "offer the software to enable a third party--in this case, most likely a partner Chinese company--to monitor popular stories and topics," and would allow that third party to "have full control to decide whether those posts should show up in users' feeds."Facebook's formal entry into China would raise many of the same human rights concerns faced by Google. Facebook holds highly sensitive information about its users' networks and affiliations, which the government may demand the company disclose. Online activists could be particularly at risk because of Facebook's policy of requiring users to employ an "authentic identity" - a name that is commonly used by family and friends, that might also be found on certain types of identity documents. Human rights organizations and officials, including Human Rights Watch and United Nations special rapporteur on freedom of expression David Kaye, have long criticized this policy, because it can chill online expression and is also likely to be disproportionately enforced against those who use pseudonyms because they are at risk of reprisals.In 2016, Human Rights Watch wrote to Facebook to ask whether the proposed system would proceed and how Facebook intends to avoid complicity with Chinese state censorship, and also asked how Facebook would protect its users from abusive surveillance and reprisals for their online activity if Facebook launches a version of their application that complies with Chinese law. In a written response, Facebook stated that "at this time we have not concluded how or when access to Facebook could be restored for people in China, recognizing the principal role the Chinese government plays in making this decision" and that "as we continue to study this market, we will consider the important points you raise."In May 2017, Facebook quietly launched a photo-sharing app, Colorful Balloons, in China through a local company without a public connection to Facebook. The company has also unsuccessfully sought to open an innovation hub and subsidiaries in China.In August 2018, Human Rights Watch again contacted Facebook for updates to its approach to China. HRW had not received a response for the record at time of this publication.From 2006 to 2010, Google ran a censored version of its search engine in China. In March 2010, the company announced it would stop censoring search results in China, citing concerns about online censorship, surveillance, and cyber-attacks directed at the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists. As a result, the search engine has remained inaccessible to mainland Chinese users, along with other Google services.Since 2010, the Chinese government has only broadened and intensified its crackdown on human rights, especially after President Xi Jinping took power in 2013. In recent years, authorities have tightened censorship requirements, restricted access to censorship circumvention tools, and strengthened ideological control over all media. In 2017, the government shut down dozens of social media accounts, called on internet companies to "actively promote socialist core values," and passed stricter regulations to require real-name registration, disabling people from protecting their identities if they engaged in disfavored speech. Authorities have subjected more human rights defenders, including foreigners, to show trials, subjected them to torture, and often held them incommunicado for months.The government has significantly broadened mass surveillance efforts using big data and artificial intelligence-driven technology across China, particularly in the minority region of Xinjiang. The government also recently enacted laws that impose new requirements on companies to facilitate online surveillance. The Cybersecurity Law requires certain technology companies to retain, store, and disclose user data inside China and monitor and report "network security incidents." Other new rules require app providers to keep user logs for 60 days to reduce the spread of "illegal information." Under Chinese law, "security incidents" and "illegal information" are often defined broadly to encompass peaceful criticism of the government.The Chinese government's intensified offensive against human rights makes the timing of Google's and Facebook's actions particularly troubling and disappointing, Human Rights Watch said.Google already provides two apps in China, Google Translate and file management app Files Go, though its own app store, Google Play, remains blocked. However, offering services via mobile phone apps raises additional human rights concerns that were not present when Google first entered China in 2006, when smart phones were not ubiquitous. Mobile applications can access extraordinarily sensitive data stored on phones, including contact lists, files, messages, photos, device identifiers, and location information, and can also turn on a phone's camera and microphone if given permission by the user. Often users approve access without fully understanding the personal data that would be available. Such personal data would be more vulnerable to monitoring and collection by mobile service providers and public security agencies in China."US tech companies shouldn't enter China until they can show they won't become repression's helping hands," said Wong. "In the current human rights environment, that seems unlikely."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6399691 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: August 8, 2018End of Document

CHINA AND HUMAN RIGHTS: IS AUSTRALIA 'MAKING A DIFFERENCE'?States News ServiceAugust 29, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1196 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:Sophie RichardsonChina Director SophieHRWAustralia's relationship with China has been tumultuous of late: political scandals, security threats, a perceived need for draconian new legislation, angry rhetoric from Beijing. It's not a surprise that officials, including members of the new Australian government, and ordinary people across Australia have struggled to find the right answers to a complex and charged relationship.But as Australia tries to strike a balance between benefiting from and being threatened by its relationship with Beijing, a key piece of solving this puzzle has largely dropped out of the debate: pressing for better respect for human rights inside China.Since coming to power in 2013, Chinese President Xi Jinping and his government have directed the most pervasive rollback on rights since the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre. China has adopted a slew of laws on national security, cyber-controls, and civil society that further restrict everything from the right to a fair trial to privacy rights to freedom of expression and association. Authorities have increased deployed mass surveillance technology to stamp out perceived dissent, and directed particular hostility at ethnic and religious minorities: hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs, an ethnically Turkic Muslim minority, are currently being arbitrarily detained for "political education" without a legal basis for doing so.Not content to limit human rights at home, Chinese authorities have taken their repressive policies global. Human Rights Watch has documented concerted efforts by China to undermine key United Nations human rights mechanisms, limiting the ability of independent voiceseven those not focused on Chinafrom making use of these global arenas. China is launching its own rights-free institutions, like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and skillfully manipulating existing ones, such as Interpol, to carry out abuses.The Chinese Communist Party is so confident in its global hunt for corruption suspects that Chinese police and party "discipline" officials go to countries such as Australia to intimidate their targets into returningand without informing local law enforcement. Threats to free inquiry on university campuses worldwide are now painfully clear to the Australian public.Australia's response to these developments has been at best perfunctory. It opted to confine most of its human rights concerns through an official bilateral dialogue which, like most others, was virtually invisible to those who need to see the outside world defending their human rights: activists and ordinary people across China. Those dialogues also suited Chinese officials intent on keeping the discussion contained and out of high-level meetings. China began pressing to downgrade the dialogue around 2014, and a round hasn't been held since (a fact that seems to have escaped former Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, who once heralded these dialogues).From time to time Australia has joined - but not led - critically important, coordinated international interventions, including an unprecedented joint statement on the crackdown against activists and lawyers at the March 2016 United Nations Human Rights Council, and a joint letter calling for an end to Beijing's abuses of human rights lawyers in March 2017. Former foreign minister Julie Bishop's March 2017 Singapore speech suggested she was taking a tougher position on China's lack of democratic rule. And Australian diplomats in China do try to monitor political trials and meet with human rights defenders.But has Australia weighed in consistently with China to defend the values it says it cherishes on the occasions when it's needed most? Quite simply: no.When Liu Xiaobo, an imprisoned Chinese literary critic, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010, then-opposition leader Bishop penned an editorial calling for him to be allowed to attend the Oslo ceremony. When Liu died in state custody in 2017, she issued the tersest of statements.Indeed, it is hard to remember the last time senior Australian diplomats said anything publicly about justice for the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre, or publicly challenged Chinese leaders over their abuses of human rights defenders. Earlier this year China proposed a resolution at the Human Rights Council that threatens key elements of international human rights law and norms - leaving decisions to states, squeezing out independent civil society, rejecting discussion of accountability. Australia abstained.Even in the high-octane debate about Chinese political interference in Australia, Canberra focused narrowly on concerns about espionage, registering "foreign agents", and restrictions on foreign funding to political parties and "political" organisations. Less attention has been paid to intimidation of critics and members of the diaspora in Australia - and less still has been devoted to mitigating some of these problems at their root in China. If the Chinese Communist Party wasn't so intent on censoring criticism and imposing its views worldwide, there might not be concerns about threats to academic or press freedom in Australia. If China had a credible, independent legal system, Australia would likely face far fewer headaches over tradeor over cases like Stern Hu or Feng Chongyi.Recently Beijing blinked in the face of relentless public and private diplomacy, and finally released Liu Xia, Liu Xiaobo's widow who had been held under house arrest for eight years, and let her leave the country. Her release demonstrates that values-based interventions on human rights can produce the desired result.China's human rights abuses do not stem from a lack of robust Australian interventions, but the Australian government's half-hearted pressure has helped embolden the Chinese government. It is encouraging to see Australia reject a role for problematic Chinese firms like Huawei and ZTE as threats to security, and to hear new Foreign Minister Marise Payne state that Australia's greatest challenges come from countries - including China - that do not follow the rules-based international order.But there's far more for Australia to do. It can demonstrate the commitments articulated in its role as a member of the UN Human Rights Council by consistently raising concerns about human rights abuses in China, and threats posed by China to the UN human rights system. It can pivot from the Huawei decision to ensure that Australian companies operating in China do so in conformity with the UN principles on business and human rights. The new government should prioritise ensuring that Australians live free of fear of Chinese government or Communist Party intimidation. And Foreign Minister Payne and others should in all high-level meetings with Chinese counterparts unambiguously challenge China's human rights violations, which threaten that international rules-based order.At this moment it couldn't be clearer that China's and Australia's human rights realities are increasingly intertwined. The question is whether Australia will face that challenge squarely and fight for everyone's rights.Load-Date: August 30, 2018End of Document

Internet Sleuths Are Hunting for China's Secret Internment Camps for MuslimsAtlantic OnlineSeptember 15, 2018 SaturdayCopyright 2018 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 2001 wordsByline: Sigal SamuelBodyCitizen journalists and scholars are in a race against time, scouring the internet for evidence before the Chinese government can erase it. Since last year, the country has been sending vast numbers of Muslims to internment camps, where it tries to force them to renounce Islam and embrace the Communist Party, as The New York Times and other            media           outlets have reported based on interviews with former inmates. At this point, as many as one million Muslims are being held in the camps, according to an estimate widely cited by            the UN           and           U.S. officials.China has denied that it aims to indoctrinate Muslims in the camps, telling a UN panel last month that "there is no such thing as reeducation centers," even though the Chinese government's own documents have            referred to them as such. The country now claims the camps are just vocational schools for criminals, and journalists            have described attempts            to keep them away from the heavily guarded sites. Yet as China went about building its massive internment system, it left behind electronic traces, like government webpages and social-media posts containing images and details of the camps.As Beijing faces intensifying international scrutiny-the Trump administration is            weighing sanctions against officials involved with the camps-it has begun to delete these documents, according to scholars and journalists monitoring the websites where they appear. That's left a handful of people around the world rushing to capture and archive them before they can be scrubbed. Compared with China's            high-tech surveillance state, their tools are simple: Google. Twitter. The Wayback Machine."All you need is Mandarin skills, a computer, and an internet connection," said Timothy Grose, one of the China scholars involved in this effort, which he characterized as virtual detective work. "The situation is becoming urgent because the government is becoming more aware that there is this paper trail and they've been erasing a lot of documents. So anyone who wants to get involved should, and they should do so quickly. The more time we wait, the fewer pieces of evidence are going to be left on the Chinese internet."[           China is treating Islam like a mental illness]Grose starting hunting down evidence in the spring. Step one was running a search for "reeducation center" using Baidu, the Chinese equivalent of Google. He said that led him to news reports that described how local officials, under a policy known as qu jiduanhua gongzuo ("de-extremification work"), were "reeducating" Muslim ethnic minorities-notably Uighurs and Kazakhs-in the northwestern Xinjiang region, which Beijing has long viewed as a breeding ground for extremism and separatism. Step two was using that policy's name as a search term in Baidu, which he said led him to government websites. Step three was seeing what those websites said about the centers' activities and locations.Using this simple process, Grose said he found photos of a ribbon-cutting ceremony at a recently built facility in Xinjiang, along with a local government press release. "They have officials standing in front of a gate, and the gate quite clearly says in Chinese and Uighur 'reeducation center,'" he said. "So there we have physical proof." After finding photos like this or other documentation, Grose would save the material as PDFs or upload them to the digital archive known as the Wayback Machine, and post the contents on Twitter.Another important type of evidence has come in the form of construction bids and tender notices that Chinese government officials posted online as they sought companies to build the camps. Adrian Zenz, a researcher at the European School of Culture and Theology in Germany, has found and            listed more than 70 of them. Many bids specify that the compounds must include high walls, watchtowers, barbed wire, surveillance systems, facilities for armed police forces, and other security features, according to Zenz.He has also catalogued official recruitment notices for camp administrators, which he told me have "suspiciously low educational requirements, such as a middle school education." If the camps were really vocational schools, as the government now claims, they would be recruiting staff with college degrees, Zenz said, adding that that's the level of education typically required to work in such schools in China.[           China's jaw-dropping family separation policy]Along with scholars, citizen activists are joining the search for online traces of China's camps. It's worth noting that in other cases, internet sleuthing has yielded false leads and misinformation. For instance, in the cases of both the            Boston Marathon bombing and the            Newtown school shooting, some Twitter and Reddit users misidentified suspects and publicized their photos, generating harassment for innocent people. Such cases highlight the informational limitations, and possible risks, of a citizen-driven approach.  Nevertheless, Shawn Zhang, a 29-year-old Chinese law student in Canada, has been playing an important role alongside scholars like Zenz and Grose. Like them, he began hunting for information on what was happening in Xinjiang by searching the internet for "reeducation center" using Baidu and Google. He, too, noticed the construction bids, many of which specified where the camps were to be built. Then he took an additional step: He plugged the location information into Google Earth-and found satellite imagery of what appeared to be camps.Zhang told me he started doing this in May after reading news reports saying hundreds of thousands of Muslims were being sent to Chinese camps. "When I saw the news, I was skeptical. I thought, how is it possible to detain so many Uighurs? ... How is it possible for this kind of thing to happen in 2018? So I decided to check out this information myself."Seeing the satellite imagery convinced him that it really was possible that Muslims were being detained en masse in his native country-and that some of            the camps kept growing, month after month. He started posting the images on            his blog and            his Twitter account, along with the coordinates of the facilities, so that anybody could examine them. This project, to which he said he devoted an hour of free time each day on average, soon attracted the attention of professional journalists and scholars. They began to collaborate.Zhang said journalists on the ground in Xinjiang have asked him for help identifying potential internment camps. "They sometimes ask me if I can give them some camps that are more accessible, easier to visit, so they can visit them onsite." An            important Wall Street Journal investigation, which involved a visit to a camp in the city of Turpan, made use of Zhang's work. Journal reporter Josh Chin confirmed to me that he'd asked Zhang to help analyze photos and satellite images of the Turpan site to see if its characteristics resembled the characteristics of other sites Zhang had catalogued as camps. The features did match, and in fact, Zhang said, he had already found the Turpan site via Google Earth and surmised that it was a camp.Explaining why he hadn't posted the details of that camp online, Zhang told me he sometimes finds a structure that he thinks looks like it may be an internment camp, but he avoids publicly identifying it as such unless he can verify it. In the Turpan case, he said, "I didn't post it on my blog because I didn't have corroborating evidence. I need to find at least one [piece of] corroborating evidence, like a tender notice or some local news, before posting it."Zhang said internment camps have telltale visual hallmarks that help distinguish them from other facilities he can identify from government tender notices and construction bids as regular prisons, detention centers, or schools. For instance, he said, detention centers are typically one or two stories high and have very little yard space, unlike the camps, which tend to have at least three or four stories and occupy sprawling grounds. Nevertheless, it can be difficult to say with certainty that a facility viewed only through satellite imagery is a camp, which is why scholars, journalists, and Zhang himself try to supplement that approach with other methods of verification. "Satellite image analysis is a time-honored method. It's been used for a lot of extremely helpful human-rights documentation in the past," said Ethan Zuckerman, the director of the Center for Civic Media at MIT, who cited examples of successful use in Zimbabwe, Darfur, and Nigeria. "My skepticism would be, you'd need to know a lot about the document chain to know that you're looking in the right place-to know that you're looking at a camp and not a tractor factory." He said that in order to be sure he wasn't misreading an image, he'd want to see solid documentation, like government construction bids that have been authenticated, or some form of "groundtruthing," like an eyewitness report from a journalist in Xinjiang.In addition to these forms of cross-referencing, Grose said it's important to talk to Uighurs themselves. "Government documents and even physical representations can only give us a superficial representation of what's going on. It doesn't explain what's going on inside. ... We don't know how local officials are interpreting the policies," he said, adding that the accounts of former inmates and their relatives have yielded vital information about the locations of camps and the treatment of inmates, which can vary from camp to camp.[           China is going to outrageous lengths to surveil its own citizens]Among the most active gatherers and archivists of information pertaining to the camps are Uighurs themselves-both the journalists in the region, such as those with Radio Free Asia, as well as citizens who have left China and remain concerned about relatives back home. According to Grose, a Uighur woman who goes by the pseudonym Nur was the first to dig up a now-widely-circulated image showing inmates in what appears to be an internment camp in Lop County, Hotan, Xinjiang. He said the woman, who frequently            tweets her findings, found this and other photos by sifting through months' worth of posts published by the government's official account on WeChat, a Chinese social-media platform. When I contacted her through Twitter, Nur declined to disclose her real name or current whereabouts, because she fears her family in Xinjiang will be further punished, she told me. "I use VPN every time I hit the internet for some digging," she wrote to me. "My fear is that [the] Chinese government is capable of anything and they might be able to track my IP and eventually me. You can tell the extreme paranoid state that I am in. Since I started digging for information, some nights I can't sleep because of anxiety and fear."She started searching for evidence in June, she said, after coming to the conclusion that "no matter where you live, you can't escape the constant, indirect mental torture of what is happening in Xinjiang. Finally, I came to a point where I realized I need to do something, otherwise I might mentally break down."Since June, Nur has amassed a Google Drive full of PDFs, Word documents, and screenshots bearing photos and details related to the camps, some posted by the government's official WeChat account. She shared it with Grose, who shared it with me with her permission. It contains 174 documents-and counting. The digital methods being used to retrieve, archive, and circulate information about the camps are low-tech and open-source, favoring immediacy, transparency, and collaboration. For a scholar like Grose, it's a reflection of the urgency of the situation. "The platforms that we have for academic writing take so long. To get an article published, you have to count on at least a year," he said. "We don't have the luxury to wait a year with what's going on in Xinjiang right now. ... This is a race against time, so we have to use the tools that are going to give us the most immediate and effective results."Load-Date: September 16, 2018End of Document

CHINESE MEDIA SLAMS APPLE FOR REFERRING TO TAIWAN AS 'ON PAR' WITH BEIJINGStates News ServiceSeptember 14, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 913 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:A state-backed Chinese newspaper has hit out at Apple over its listing of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and mainland China as separate entities, claiming that the democratic island of Taiwan is "an inalienable part" of its territory.Hong Kong and Taiwan were listed "on par" with China on a slide showing markets for the new iPhone XS, the Global Times newspaper, sister paper to ruling Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece the People's Daily, said.The paper appeared to warn that such a lack of "political consciousness" could harm Apple's interests, citing Li Haidong, international relations expert at the state-backed China Foreign Affairs University."Apple is not the first multinational company to adopt such a double standard," the Global Times reported in a signed opinion article on Thursday."Ikea, referring to Taiwan the same way as China and other countries, caused similar disputes in August."It said a number of airlines had also "received letters" earlier this year protesting their listing of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau as separate destinations in a list on their websites.A drop-down menu of store locations on Apple's website on Friday offered China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macau as possible options, with the prompt "choose a country or region."E-mailed requests for comment from Apple's China division had received no reply by the time of publication.Taiwan president Tsai Ing-wen last month called on the international community to resist China's efforts to isolate the island by forcing its diplomatic ties to break links with Taipei under the "one China policy."Tsai said the 23 million residents of Taiwan, which has never been ruled by the Chinese Communist Party, was "entitled to [a] place in the world." A nationalistic mood Beijing-based rights activist Li Wei said the Chinese government is currently taking every opportunity to whip up nationalist sentiment as a way of countering the impact of what it sees as hostile foreign ideology, but that foreign companies can choose how they will respond."The Chinese government has always tried to create a nationalistic mood, as an ideological antidote to anything from the West," Li told RFA. "As for how foreign companies respond, it depends on where their bottom line is; I hope they won't do any more evil.""I hope that they won't carry out data collection for the Chinese government, or hand over intelligence reports," he said.Guangdong-based rights activist Jia Pin said the Global Times article showed that Beijing is constantly seeking to project its power beyond its borders."This is really a way of exercising hegemony, including the way it exerted pressure on the airlines to drop Taiwan as a destination," Jia told RFA. "It also shows that it is continuing to concentrate more and more power in its hands, to the extent of interfering in international affairs."According to Taiwan's president Tsai, Beijing has also sent military aircraft to encircle Taiwan, forced international airlines to change the way they refer to it as a destination, and deprived Taichung city of its right to host the East Asian Youth Games.Chinese money was also behind El Salvador's switch of recognition to Beijing, which came after Taiwan denied repeated requests for massive injections of funding for its Port La Union project, according to Taiwan's ministry of foreign affairs.The island's Republic of China government, a remnant of the Kuomintang nationalist regime that abandoned the Chinese mainland after losing a civil war with Mao Zedong's communists in 1949, has said it will continue to pursue "greater democracy, freedom, and sovereignty." Support for self-rule Recent opinion polls indicate that there is broad political support for self-rule in Taiwan, where the majority of voters identify as Taiwanese rather than Chinese.But Beijing regards the island as part of China, and has threatened to invade if Taiwan seeks formal independence. Beijing has succeeded in isolating Taiwan diplomatically by insisting that its diplomatic partners break off ties with Taipei under the "One China" policy.China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) is gradually preparing for a possible invasion of Taiwan, according to a military analysis published by the Pentagon in Washington last week.Armed forces under the ruling Chinese Communist Party "continued to develop and deploy increasingly advanced military capabilities intended to coerce Taiwan, signal Chinese resolve, and gradually improve capabilities for an invasion," the U.S. Department of Defense said in an annual report on China's military capabilities.Taiwan was ruled as a Japanese colony in the 50 years prior to the end of World War II, but was handed back to the Republic of China under the nationalist KMT government as part of Tokyo's post-war reparation deal.When the KMT regime fled to Taiwan in 1947 after losing a civil war to Mao Zedong's communist troops, the Republic of China ceased to control most of China, but continues to be the official name of the Taiwan government.Taiwan began a transition to democracy following the death of Chiang's son, President Chiang Ching-kuo, in January 1988, starting with direct elections to the legislature in the early 1990s and culminating in the first direct election of a president, Lee Teng-hui, in 1996.

Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. Happy Thursday I am Maria Bartiromo. It is Thursday, August 2nd. Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast. Ramping up pressure on China. The Trump administration is looking to more than double, the proposed tariffs on Chinese imports.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The President is going to continue to hold China responsible for their unfair trade practices. This is gone on for long enough and he is going to do something about it.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: And what that is is perhaps applying 25 percent tariff on $200 billion of imports out of China. China is threatening to retaliate saying it is fully prepared to escalate what it is now calling a trade war. The trade fears taking a toll on markets this morning. Futures indicating a decline at the start of trading this morning in an hour and a half. Dow Industrials expected to be down 150 points. That's two-thirds of one percent.And this is off of the lows. The S&P 500 is down 15 and the NASDAQ is down 55. Three quarters of one percent there on the NASDAQ. This after mixed performance yesterday, strong economic data sent the yield on the 10-year treasury up to three percent one again. Then later in the day, the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged. It's the statements on the economy though that things are going very well.That is suggesting we will see a rate hike in the next month's meeting in September. Yesterday, the Dow industrials were down 81 points. The Bank of England raised interest rates to three quarters of percent. As expected that rate now at .75 percent. It's the second increase in rates in a decade out of the Banker of England. As you see, markets are down across the board. In European Indices right now, the DAX Index is down 200 points, 1-1/2 percent lower./In Asia overnight, declines across the board with the worst performers were in Hong Kong and China. Hang Seng Index down 2-1/4 percent, Shanghai Index down two percent. Tesla pumping the brakes on the cash burn. The automaker doubled its quarterly loss, it announced it last night. But CEO Elon Musk promised a profit later this year. And that as investors cheering, the stock up eight -- almost nine percent right now on Tesla as cash burn rate slows down.Apple race to $1 trillion hitting the pause button this morning. Stock is down after closing it a record-high yesterday. I'll be speaking with one top technology investor to get his sense at the landscape right now. Dan Niles giving us his take on Apple and the entire group this morning. Stay with us for that interview. Plus America's oil boom. We are taking you live to a rig in Texas highlighting a new issue tied to soaring production. The need for more pipeline.All those stories coming up this Thursday morning. And joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, The Wall Street Journal's assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman, and PwC partner, Mitch Roschelle. Great to see everybody this morning.JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Interesting thing about tariffs were smack in the middle of earning season and we're hearing mixed stories in terms of our guidance, in terms of whether or not the tariffs are impacting business or not. But one thing that's clear, companies do not want impact in margin and if there's an increase in cost, they're passing it along to the customer which is inflationary, so we'll see.BARTIROMO: So, you do you think -- do you think margins do take a hit?FREEMAN: I think --BARTIROMO: Because the earning story had been one of the best stories in terms of the economy.FREEMAN: I don't think they're going to let it impact margins unless it's marginal, very marginal, I think that they're going to pass the cost along. And we've seen that in a lot of the consumer staples that they're just saying, you know what, this is starting to impact the cost of supply chain. We're going to pass along --BARTIROMO: So prices go up.FREEMAN: Prices go up.BARTIROMO: For a lot of things.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: The -- particularly at this 25 percent tariff get slapped on the $200 billion in imports from China that is going to show up on everybody's grocery bill, that's going to show up on everybody's receipt if they're going to a Wal-Mart or Target or frankly shopping at almost any store here in the United States. And ultimately that will have some political consequences that remain to be seen when that happen.MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC CHARITABLE FOUNDATION: And it's going to impact this holiday season. Some of the toy manufactures, they're trying to prebuy stuff that they're importing from China, the retailers that is but it's going to certainly be seen in this holiday season.BARTIROMO: So you would expect then that 4.1 percent GDP slows down by your end.ROSCHELLE: Considering how important the consumer is to that GDP number. Yes.BARTIROMO: All right. All right. We'll talk about all of that coming up this morning. But first, coal country campaigning. President Trump is headed to Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania this evening for a Make America Great Again rally. This as the administration considers increasing the rate on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. Blake Burman is at the White House this morning with the very latest. Blake, good morning to you.BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Maria, good morning to you as well. The Trump administration more than doubling up its threats as relates to trade and China. The top trade Rep Bob Lighthizer yesterday announcing that is relates to the next tranche of potential tariffs, some $200 billion worth he's been instructed to look whether or not that should be increased to 25 percent.Remember, the initial proposal here was 10 percent but sources tell Fox it is the President himself who wants that number raised. A senior administration official saying there wasn't one specific incident that led to this, Lighthizer saying the following in a statement, "we have been very clear about the specific changes China should undertake regrettably instead of changing its harmful behavior."China has illegally retaliated against U.S. workers, farmers, ranchers and businesses. Here was the Press Secretary Sarah Sanders.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SANDERS: We like to see unfair trade practices stopped but until that happens the President is go to hold their feet to the fire, he's going to continue to put pressure on China and he is not going to sit back and allow American industries and American workers to be taken advantage of.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURMAN: China reacted to initial reports yesterday with some tough talk of its own. A top government official saying the following, "U.S. pressure and blackmail won't have an effect if the United States takes further escalatory steps. China will inevitably take counter measures and we will resolutely protect our legitimate rights. Maria, it is important to point out here that the earliest that this $200 billion trench possibly a 25 percent to be implemented in September 5th.So you're talking about a month to five weeks out. Quite possible that we hear from President Trump about this later this evening as he holds a campaign style rally in the Wilkes-Barre Pennsylvania tonight. Maria?BARTIROMO: All right, Blake. Thanks very much. We of course are going to be following the President and covering that live for you. So do stay with us. Joining me right now to talk more about all of that is Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. Secretary Ross, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us.WILBUR ROSS, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF COMMERCE: Thank you for having me on, Maria.BARTIROMO: So let me ask you. What was it that caused the President to change his mind to ramp this up and go perhaps 25 percent tariffs on Chinese goods all the way up to $200 billion in goods?ROSS: Well, the reason for the tariffs to begin with was to try to convince the Chinese to modify their behavior. Instead they've been retaliating. So the President now feels that it's potentially time to put more pressure on in order to modify their behavior.BARTIROMO: But Secretary Ross, I mean, the Chinese won't even admit it, right? I mean, they won't even admit the fact that they're forcing the technology transfer, that they are stealing intellectual property. So why do you think or the President think that these tariffs are going to change their behavior?ROSS: Well, we have to create a situation where it is more painful for them to continue their bad practices than it is to reform them. That's the purpose of the whole exercise.BARTIROMO: In doing so, are you hurting American consumers? We just had a whole discussion. I don't know if you heard it on idea that look, if these tariffs cut into margins companies are just going to pass that on and that means raising prices and that means higher prices for all sorts of stuff for American people. For American consumers and that's going to mean inflation.So do you worry that all this while good intentioned is going to actually impact he economy negatively and wipe away what you've been able to achieve from the tax cuts and the rollback in regulations.ROSS: Well, let's put it into arithmetic perspective, 25 percent on 200 billion if it comes to pass, is $50 billion a year. $50 billion a year on an 18 billion or so -- 18 trillion or so economy is three-tenths of one percent. It's not something that's going to be cataclysmic.BARTIROMO: Well, it could be cataclysmic for some companies. I mean, did you check out the op-ed in the Journal today when the only tool you have is a tariff from Chris Pratt who talks about working for the largest mail manufacturer in the country, they fought hard to survive in the face of unfair Asian competition but now they're on the brink of extinction and they are blaming the government's trade policy.ROSS: Well, that company, mid-continent is actually owned by a Mexican steel company. Frankly, one with whom we have had trades actions before for antidumping and countervailing duties. Their complaint is that we're putting tariffs on Mexican steel and that's what's making them less competitive. So that particular story is a little more complicated than is the overall picture.Further, they have put in a request for exception from the tariffs and that decision is before Commerce right now.BARTIROMO: You are deciding whether or not they could get excluded from aluminum, steel tariffs then what is metric to decide whether or not somebody can get excluded.Metric is very simply if no the domestic capability to supply quantity quality of material needed we routinely grant the exemptions. We have been excluding over 1,000 products already and every day we're adding more to the list. So this is not a hip-shooting exercise. This is a very carefully thought through one with a very open and transparent process for people requesting exclusions for those companies who feel they can meet the need to protest the request.Prove that they can supply the material and then we make a judgment who's right.BARTIROMO: Let me ask you about judgments that came out of the meeting with Mr. Juncker from the European Union, Mr. Secretary, the President talks about wanting to get to know tariffs, wanting to get to free trade, really truly free trade with Europe. Where does that stand?ROSS: Well, there are scoping exercises being put together to take very general statements that were made at the meeting between President Trump and President Juncker and trying to transfer on those into a set of discussions that will lead to finite results.BARTIROMO: But while you're doing that, looking to get there, the aluminum and steel tariffs are still in place, right?ROSS: Yes. The understanding was that those would not be changed nor would we cease working on the potential 232 action on automobiles.BARTIROMO: Right.ROSS: We are continuing that work but the agreement was not to impose the automotive tariffs until and unless the overall negotiations failed.BARTIROMO: So the auto tariffs are not in this agreement at all? There is -- there is no the intention to go to zero tariffs as it relates to it autos then.ROSS: I didn't say that. What I said was the agreement that was reached was that we would complete our research work into the question of what to do about automotive tariffs but we would not take action as a government on auto tariffs until and unless President decided that the negotiations were going nowhere.BARTIROMO: Where are wings on Mexico? I think markets are unsettled, Secretary, because they want to see a deal on the books. I know you've done one with South Korea but in terms of Mexico, do you expect you will get a deal done before the midterms for example?ROSS: Well, it's difficult to set an exact date on negotiations that are under way. But what we do know is that the new Mexican President has acted very speedily to appoint his trade representatives to the negotiations and has organized it so that there is an overlap between the outgoing administration's people and the Labrador appointees. And he is doing this even though he hasn't formally been inaugurated yet.That's a hopeful sign that he is interested in getting these matters resolved quickly, hopefully before his inauguration even occurs.BARTIROMO: Because --ROSS: So --BARTIROMO: Yes.ROSS: So, what we've also seen is indications that they're not going to try to undo all the various chapters that already had been resolved before the election and instead going to focus on the few remaining ones. So given that it's a relatively small number, important ones but a small number of them, we're optimistic that something could be worked out very quickly.BARTIROMO: Let me ask you this, Secretary, because I know markets are hopeful that we will see a deal with China, what you -- what do you want to say to Google? Google basically saying look, we are going to test a new mobile version of the search engine that would adhere to China's control over content. The web giant working on this censored search engine for China after leaving eight years ago in its protest of censorship and online hacking.This reversal expected to filter Web sites and search items that are blacklisted by the Chinese government. And I have to also point out that Google of course we know has already said it will not renew its military A.I. contract. So it's not -- doesn't want to work with the U.S. government but it's OK putting the search engine on a censored bases in China?ROSS: Well, I don't know all the details of Google's position. What I do know is that if the press reports are true this is another sign of China using government intervention to influence what should be really commercial's decision.BARTIROMO: Right. Great point. Secretary, good to -- yes.ROSS: That's exactly --BARTIROMO: Early fewer customers are at Pizza Hut and Taco Bell chains. Same-store sales at parent company Yum! Brands fell short of Wall Street expectations. Nicole Petallides is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange looking at that stock and others. Nic, good morning.NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria. So, when we talk Yum! Brands we're talking about KFC, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut. So, the break down was that as you noted fewer people eating at Pizza Hut and also Taco Bell. The overall same -- the same-store sales was miss worldwide. Overall, it rose one percent. The estimates were 1.92 percent.But when you break it down and you look at each individual, KFC did well, that was up two percent. That was the best of the bunch. Taco Bell sales raise two percent but Pizza Hut same-store sales were down one percent. So you need the people in there and you need them eating.Then we take a look here at Cigna. So the profit, we did see it better- than-expected, higher quarterly profit, higher enrollment but they are bracing for the battle with Carl Icahn obviously, a big shareholder, less than five percent stake on the $52-billion acquisition of Express Scripts. And so he's going to move forward with that and say that Cigna is paying too much. And when you look at the insiders, the shareholders are a little bit disappointed with this.And Evercore ISI said there are things that should happen with Cigna instead, that they should have a buyback which would be better, seven to 10 billion buy smaller farmer managers. And also get government-paid business and that's how it helped that company. We're also seeing -- we're watching Apple, not near the trillion dollars yet, we're watching for 207.43. And just to give you some vibes of what's happening, the idea here that we're hearing is one tech is not dead.In fact, people are feeling back and bullish about tech once again like a big few moment. And then the run into the financials which are not really a loved group but they are pushing at the high point of the BKX, and if they could break out, they're running chasing those rates and we'll wait for your jobs report tomorrow which are the key to the Fed which I'm even hearing rate hikes for September, December and maybe January too. That will be three? Back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Nic. Thank you so much. We'll watch that. Coming up. AlphaOne Capital Partners founding partner Dan Niles joins me roughly 15 minutes to weigh in on Apple, the tech sector and a lot more. You'll want to hear his take on technology. Stay with us on that. Then getting inside the mind of Elon Musk. We break down the business magnets' latest endeavors including Tesla and SpaceX right after this.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. From Tesla to SpaceX. We are going inside the mind of Elon Musk this morning. Tesla shares are up this morning by almost nine percent in the premarket amid promising profit and our smaller cash burn. The company still losing money however. Tesla's loss was wider than Wall Street's expectations while revenue came in higher than expectations.As you can see, four billion in revenue loss of $3.06 a share. Investors are also watching the company's language on the conference call. Elon Musk's language. Even Tesla chief himself realized he had some apologizing to do.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ELON MUSK, CEO, TESLA: Yes. I would like to apologize for being impolite on the prior call. Obviously I think there's really no excuse for bad manners and I was violating my own rule in that regard. There are reasons for it and I got no sleep and, you know, been working sort of 120 hour weeks, but nonetheless, there is still no excuse, so my apologies for not being polite on the prior call.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Yes. And at one point he apologized specifically to analysts Toni Sacconaghi. Joining us right now is Michael Nunes. He is Mashable deputy technology editor. Michael, good to see you.MICHAEL NUNES, DEPUTY TECHNOLOGY EDITOR, MASHABLE: Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: Your reaction to that. What we just heard Elon Musk.NUNES: Well, I mean, aside from the mumbling, I think, you know, one thing that Elon has been really good at has been -- has been making an event out of these earnings reports. So, you know, there is a lot of -- there's a lot of talk on Twitter prior to these earnings reports and a lot of feuds. And so it just makes everyone want to tune in. You know, everyone wants to see whether he's going to be erratic.Whether he's going to have answers to all of these questions that everyone is asking. And so, it really just gets people to dial in on what would otherwise be a rather boring earnings call.ROSCHELLE: Was his tone less --(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: Well, actually people dialed in to this earnings call because they're worried about amount of cash they have. And even people invested in the company wanted some reassurances that the company wasn't going to basically on the brink of bankruptcy.NUNES: That's absolutely true. But, you know, the one thing that Elon I think did very well yesterday was address those concerns, right? You know, the stock is up, I think he showed that he's been able to reduce the amount of expenditure from the company, so I think, you know, the Elon strategy seems to be make big promises then deliver later and he, you know, he's able to generate a lot of excitement around.Or a lot of interest or concern maybe around whether he's able to hit these big targets.ROSCHELLE: Yes. And how much of the cash burn is about making more money as opposed to spending less? Is it -- is it really about production and getting cars out the door and making more really about spending less?NUNES: Yes. I think it's a great question. You know, Elon said during the call that his top priority is to turn a profit, right? And at the end of the day, he is seems like a very rational numbers based person. So I think, inevitably yes, profitability is what -- is what he wants.(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: The Model -- the Model 3 -- correct me if I'm wrong is actually turning an operating profit now, is it not?NUNES: I believe that's true. Yes.MCDOWELL: And so they're -- if they can go through this 5,000 Model 3s per week during the entire third quarter they will be cash flow positive and profitable for the whole company.NUNES: Yes. I think the one asterisk to add to that is they're not selling baseline Model 3s at this point or at least they haven't for a long period of time. They were selling, you know, they had a high margin on the Model 3s because they were selling ones with accessories and with a lot of add-on features. So the margins per unit was actually much higher than it would be in the long run.MCDOWELL: Right.FREEMAN: Yes. I think like a lot of people I don't applaud the Federal and state subsidies to electric car ventures but it's kind - it is an interesting story here where he seems to just gained a lot of credibility. He was talking a lot, tweeting a lot, I think people were sort of maybe waiting for him to self destruct here. He comes with the apology, it's kind of lot of mumbling but the results here suggest maybe this is going to work out, right?He's hitting the production targets, he's maybe not going to have to borrow a ton of money real soon.NUNES: That's exactly right, yes. At the end of the day, you know, people are only concerned about one thing whether this company is going to go make money or not and he's proven that it's at least trending in the right direction, right? So there is still a lot of questions to answered I think but ultimately the erratic behavior isn't much of a concern as long as he delivers on the goods.MCDOWELL: Well, I think it's a reminder maybe he realizes, he is the CEO of a car company and if you are the chief of a car manufacturer, you got to sell some cars and you have to be a salesman all day long every day and you can't be a jerk because you haven't slept. Hey, we never sleep, we're not jerks.BARTIROMO: I wish I had enough sleep.(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: Right. And we're never jerks. Maria Bartiromo never, ever, ever a jerk.BARTIROMO: I could use more sleep. Michael, it's good analysis. Thanks for joining us.NUNES: Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: Appreciate it. Michael Nunes there. Coming up. AlphaOne Capital Partners founding partner Dan Niles joins me to weigh in on Apple, the tech sector and a lot more. Wait until you hear Dan Niles' analysis. Then, don't mess with Texas, we're headed live to the Lone Star State breaking down the oil boom. Back in a minute.JESSICA VILCHIS, HOST, TENNIS CHANNEL: Welcome back to another Tennis Channel Court Report, a special presentation for Fox Business. I'm Jessica Vilchis.

The technology giant may not hit a trillion dollars in market value today. Stock is pulling back, fractionally, it's $200.6 7 a share. It needs to go to 207 in order to see a $1-trillion market value, first time ever for any company.It is back to school time, can you believe it? That means reading writing arithmetic, student loans as well. Some schools say, they will take some of your salary instead as a way to pay back your student loan. We've got the details on that, coming up.But first this, our top story this half an hour, the oil boom in Texas as the Lonestar State becomes a major oil player. It needs vital pipelines to carry all of the crude oil. Connell McShane is coming to us this morning from Hector (ph), Texas. He's covering the story right now. Good morning to you, Connell.CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Hey, good morning to you, Maria. It really is a boom, almost to the extent that folks here in the Permian Basin have become victim of their own success that they've enjoyed over the last couple of years which we'll be talking about in a rare opportunity, really, for a television crew to get inside, and on top of one of these drilling rigs you see behind me. Let me start by showing you a map of where we are in the world right along the border with New Mexico and West Texas. The folks at Fasken Oil have invited us in today, tell us the way things ranked, you think about it, it is Saudi Arabia, it's Russia, and then it's the Permian Basin here.And without any further ado, let me introduce you to Tommy Taylor from Fasken who is kind enough to invite us here to spend our day with you. Thanks a lot for that, Tommy. Tell us before we talk about the pipeline issue that Maria brought up, what we're looking at behind us? What's going on here?TOMMY TAYLOR, DIRECTOR OF OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT, FASKEN OIL & RANCH: OK. Connell, welcome to the Permian Basin in midland Odessa, Texas, and today, we're out just northwest of midland, northeast of Odessa, Texas. And we're on a drilling location, and we brought this rig in. This is Trinidad rig 433, and this is the first part of drilling our wells is to bring the rig in, they drill the bore hole and case it, and move off, and in the next phase would be the completion phase, where to bring in the fracturing crew.MCSHANE: And we're going to show people that live a little bit later onto the day, but as Maria said, the issue here is after you do that, getting the oil out of here, you had so much, it's really been a boom here in the last few years, you can't build the pipelines fast enough, right? How is that going to resolve itself?TAYLOR: Well, there's lots of midstream companies working on that right now. You know, the differential in the oil price, midland (INAUDIBLE) differential is about $5.00 today. And so, that's money that we're not getting, that's a trade difference. And so, a lot of midstream companies are working to build out that pipeline. The Permian today is making 3.4 million barrels a day in almost 11 BCF of natural gas every day.MCSHANE: And that's amazing. That's expected to go up real quick, a lot over the next few years, right? How much?TAYLOR: Projections in the next five years, we're going to be at 6 million barrels a day.MCSHANE: Wow.TAYLOR: So, what we think is going to happen by the end of next year, 2019, we think we're going to have enough pipeline capacity, but if things work like we think they're going to, we're going to bump up against that again.MCSHANE: Right.TAYLOR: So, this is going to be a continual process of building out these takeaway capacities.MCSHANE: And that's almost the issue. Thank you, Tommy. We'll have more on this, Maria, throughout the day on Fox Business. We'll get on top of the rig and show people how it's done. But you have so much success, a boom like this takes place, and as Tommy says, you get the pipelines built, next thing you know you're hitting up against them again. It's a story we're going to be covering really it sounds like for the next few years.BARTIROMO: Wow. Really incredible stuff there, Connell. And of course, that means so much in terms of the price of oil, in terms of the revenue coming to the United States with Texas doing so well. We'll follow you all day, Connell, thank you so much. We look forward to you getting up on that rig. Connell McShane joining us there this morning.Now, to the markets, shares of big technology firms, including Google Parent, Alphabet, and Apple are down this morning along with Futures, on renewed trade concerns between the U.S. and China. This coming amid reports that Google is working on a censored search engine for China. The search giant withdrew from the country eight years ago if you remember in protest over censorship and online hacking. Joining us right now by telephone is AlphaOne Capital Partners founding partner Dan Niles. And Dan, it's always great to talk with you, thanks very much for joining us.DAN NILES, FOUNDING PARTNER, ALPHAONE CAPITAL PARTNERS (via telephone): My pleasure, Maria.BARTIROMO: Can you basically give us the 30,000 feet of what's going on within tech right now. Apple looked to have a good quarter, Facebook obviously recently under pressure, you were a big holder of Facebook, but you sold some of your position, right?NILES: Yes, we actually gotten rid of about or hedged out about two-thirds of the Facebook position. We were kind of concerned going into the prints that expenses were too low. We were clearly surprised by the issues that they had with the revenue were as bad as they were. We thought the general data protection scheme out of Europe would have impact. Currency, obviously, had an impact, and in some of the things that they did for themselves with advertising stories which make less than money than the newsfeed that they have, probably about half as much, that also caused issues.So, you know, for us, Facebook was already risky having bounced so much, and that's why we had hedged out of a portion of that. And we believe Google would do better which, in fact, they did. So, I think people sort of tend to lump tech together. I think what you're seeing with this earnings season in particular as you -- as you pointed out is Facebook didn't do well, Google did do well. You know, Amazon did really well, but Netflix, which we were also short into their print, you know, (INAUDIBLE) they actually missed, so it's really starting to bifurcate, and I think you really need to think of them, individually.BARTIROMO: Yes. Let's talk about some individuals because Apple is also taking a slight hit this morning, it's continuing to march to what people are looking like maybe is $1-trillion market value for this company, first time ever. Now, you follow and own companies that pay into Apple. Tell us about the story with Apple and where you see the growth there, and why you think Google is in a better position right now than all of them.NILES: Well, and you brought up this morning, Maria, the big issue right now is tariffs, and so, if you think about that, Google doesn't do any business in China. Either does, really, Amazon, or Netflix. And so, when you're talking about them or Facebook, there's no Chinese risk, there's no tariff risk, these companies are going to protectively locked out of China. If you talk about Apple, however, Apple gets about 20 percent of their revenues from China, and has been growing well. So, if this trade spat continues to increase which it seem like it will, you definitely got to look at the risk of what happens if there's some tariffs put on iPhone coming into China or you know, the components, et cetera. So, this is a much bigger risk for Apple than it is for these other companies.The good news for Apple is that, you know, their services revenues are doing very well. But even there, we think that's going to start to slow down going forward, because it really accelerated because of the money being paid to them, to large part by Google, when they struck new search deal with Apple back in September of 2016. So, for us, the big thing is to reintroduce the T.V. service to compete with like a Netflix. I think that would really help the perception of this company, but you know, we've been waiting a couple of years. They sort of teased that on a conference call, but you know, again, for us, Apple has got a lot more risk at these levels when you've got 20 percent of your revenue is in China versus a Google or Facebook or, you know, Amazon that has nothing --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: And you think Google is well-position. I mean, the story today, obviously, top story in the journal is that it's testing a mobile version of its search engine that would adhere to China's control over content. As an investor, are you comfortable with that, that they're going to now test this search engine in China just to placate the Chinese government? Is it better to just have a foothold in this large country as opposed to, you know, sticking to your values?NILES: Yes, that's always a tough question. The way I always look at it is you can't have any influence if you're not there. So hopefully, if Google does end up there, they can have some influence over censorship having some positive impact going forward. Do I believe in censorship? Absolutely not. But I think it's a start and hopefully that can move things forward. Just to be clear on it, China came out overnight and denied that this was going on, you know, this is sort of part and parcel of you may have seen last week, how Facebook had sort of opened up an office there, and then immediately got shut down in China. So, this is the issue right now of dealing with China. It's the way it's always been. I think, you know, forcing China to negotiate in good -- faith is a good thing, that's why you've seen their stock market has over 20 percent correction. It got hit by a couple of percent last night. And when this rallied over into their markets, our markets were barely down.BARTIROMO: Yes.NILES: So, I think we need to protect our intellectual property. Yes, will there be some short-term pain? Of course, but it's much better than what will happen to us in the long run if we don't deal with this.BARTIROMO: Right. Real quick, Dan, are these growth levels slowing down, overall? I don't want to lump them altogether like you said. I know these are individual stories, but do you worry that the growth numbers are coming down?NILES: Well, yes, I do. I mean, I think you bring up a good point and that the economy is very, very strong right now. And so, growth is very, very good. But you are seeing some signs of slowing and I think as you look into next year in particularly, you get 2019, some of the things going on today like higher interest rates, that will affect growth. Higher energy prices that will affect growth. Some of the stimulus we've got from the tax cuts, those are (INAUDIBLE) so I think you are seeing fairly high growth levels which will start to slow as you get into next year and expenses will be higher because people are getting paid more.BARTIROMO: All right. Great analysis, Dan. As always, we'll see you soon. Thanks so much.NILES: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Dan Niles, AlphaOne, we'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Markets are looking down today. Futures indicating a lower opening, down 150 points on the Dow Industrials as trade concerns between the U.S. and China escalate. Joining us now, the host of "VARNEY & COMPANY" Stuart Varney to weigh in. And Stu, you say the strong economy gives President Trump some leverage here.STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: I think so. And we do have a strong economy. I mean, those numbers this morning out of 8:30, initial jobless claims, that really is the layoff rate, pretty close to a historic low. Yesterday, ADP 219,000 new jobs, four percent growth in the economy, strong report coming up tomorrow very probably. That's a strong economy. And that is President Trump's leverage, because China is beginning to slow down, export orders slowing down, China's market down, all in the face of this pressure that's coming from the strong economy led by President Trump.Long run, I suspect that the President is going to win on this one. I don't know how big the win will be, but sooner or later, somebody is going to blink, and I think it's going to be, and I think come out ahead of the game. Now, having said that, I think today is more like a one-day blip. I think the computers read that one-day headline -- they read the headline, a negative headline on trade, the sell orders go out, the Dow comes down. We've seen this before. It usually bounces back again. I think that's what's happening today, but longer term, I think President Trump wins this one.BARTIROMO: Yes. We'll see about. I mean -- yes.VARNEY: Oh, we will. You sound skeptical, Maria.BARTIROMO: No, I'm not. And I think what he's doing with China is right because of the -- of this theft of intellectual property.VARNEY: That's right.BARTIROMO: But I just -- I'm questioning whether or not it's ever going to actually change their behavior. Because they won't even admit they're doing it. So, it's -- he's trying all he can do, and this administration is trying all they can do to get the change in behavior, I don't know.VARNEY: Well, he's a -- he's a -- he's a tough guy, obviously.BARTIROMO: Yes.VARNEY: And I think he will stay with that tough line, and it's a long- running proposal, but I think he wins.BARTIROMO: All right. We'll see you in 10 minutes, so I know you'll have a lot more on that, Stu. Thanks so much. "VARNEY & COMPANY" begins top of the hour at 9:00 a.m. Eastern right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Join Stuart in the next 10 minutes. But first, there's this, forget loans, why some colleges are now asking for the salary of future graduates instead of paying back the loan, next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)VINCE PASSIONE, CEO, LENDKEY: 100 billion of them are private student loans, and about two percent of the folks there are struggling a bit making their payments. The balance, the 1.4 trillion, is the federal loans, and those are showing up on your award letter, but 70 percent of the people who apply to school will see that loan on their award letter. And there's about -- roughly about 20 percent of those folks, they're having difficulty paying back those student loans, right? And those folks have gone to either community college or potentially a for-profit school, and it's not the size of the loan that's the problem for those folks, it's the fact they didn't graduate, right? Now, while the folks are defaulting on those loans have probably a loan that's less than $10,000. So, the focus here has to be on outcome.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is there still this confusion that if you don't graduate, you don't have to pay back the loan?PASSIONE: I think in the federal side, there is, and I think what happens here, it's all about education, right? And it starts with the parents sitting down with the student at the point when they get that award letter and really reviewing that letter and saying, look, here is my expected family contribution. If you're going to turn around and take out a $5500- loan, let's understand what it's going to cost to pay that back. And then, not just playing for year, but playing for all four years or if there's an advanced degree, could be five or six years. And understand what that payment is, right size the payment for whatever the career is going to be, right?BARTIROMO: Right.PASSIONE: Right. So, the average -- the average salary for a graduating senior is $50,000 a year. The good rule of thumb is don't borrow more than that, you're going to have difficulty paying that back.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's a really good point. So, now, there's this new push to avoid saddling students with loan debt, some schools want to offer income-sharing program, ISP, where students pay back the school a percentage of their future salaries. How would that work, Vince? What do you think about this movement?PASSIONE: So, look, we're big fans of (INAUDIBLE) and Purdue, right? He has a Back a Boiler Program, so if you need money to attend Perdue, the school will lend you $20,000. And what they expect is when you graduate, you offer them 10 percent of your salary for a fixed period of time, whatever it is.BARTIROMO: Wow.PASSIONE: So, if you make nothing, they get nothing back. Now, what it does, though, is does it line the interest of the school with the outcome, which is to ensure you graduate and you could find employment, right? Because we all know at the end, college used to be about experience, but at $46,000 per year for a private education.BARTIROMO: At least.PASSIONE: It's about education, it's about an outcome, you need to graduate to pay those loans back.MCDOWELL: And especially right now, I think students getting out of high school because the job market is so good, they have the option of going right into the workforce, and experimenting with what they might want to do with the rest of their lives before they commit to a four-year university and go into debt.PASSIONE: Look, that's a great point, and it's never too early to expose your child, your son, your daughter to what do you want to be when you grow up?MCDOWELL: Right.PASSIONE: I hear this all the time when I talk to CEOs and credit union folks, they'll say, well, how will a child, a teenager know what they want to be? And the answer is, look, we put them on a soccer field when they're very young. How do we know they want to be a division one soccer player? It's never too early to start talking about their careers.FREEMAN: I think most taxpayers are sitting down right now. How much of a loss are they going to take on that 1.4 trillion?PASSIONE: So, if you take a look at the default rates right now and you look at these income-based payment programs, it's probably about $20 billion a year is what it costs today. And that's where I think it needs to flip. When we see this free flow of credit, we need to slow it down because there is a relationship between free flowing of credit and the increase in tuition costs.BARTIROMO: Sobering numbers, Vince, it's great to have you, thanks so much.PASSIONE: Thanks. Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: Vince Passione there. We'll be right back. Thank you so much. That was great.BARTIROMO: Great to see everybody this morning, thank you.MCDOWELL: You rock, Maria Bartiromo!(CROSSTALK)(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: We covered a lot. It was a great show.FREEMAN: Yes, we covered a lot.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Yes, all right. We will keep doing it then. "VARNEY & COMPANY" begins now. Have a great day, everybody. Stuart, take it away. Go seize that day!VARNEY: Sorry, I did not hear that. I think I unplugged my --BARTIROMO: I said, seize the day, Stu. Seize the day, I said.VARNEY: But, yes, I did. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I unplugged it.(LAUGHTER)VARNEY: Good morning, Maria.BARTIROMO: Come on, Stu.VARNEY: Yes.Load-Date: August 2, 2018End of Document

Trump&#39;s fragile arguments against ChinaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 9, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1238 wordsBody       Trump&#39;s trade war will not lead China to abandon its aspiration to reach advanced economies. China is ready to wage a war of attrition. Unfortunately, both sides - just like the rest of the world - will suffer heavy losses during the process. No one wins in a trade war. However, US President Donald Trump seems determined to pursue such a war with China, which he accuses of being responsible for the United States trade deficit, violating World Trade Organization rules and using unfair practices to acquire foreign technology. While most economists are shocked by Trump&#39;s ignorance of trade balances, many agree broadly with their accusations of intellectual property. But the evidence supporting these claims is also weak, at best.  The so-called Section 301 trade investigation, launched by the Trump administration last year, accused China of acquiring foreign technologies using discriminatory licensing restrictions, unfair technology transfer agreements, targeted investment, unauthorized intrusions into US commercial computer networks, and theft intellectual property rights. &"The weight of evidence,&" the report concludes, shows that China uses restrictions on foreign ownership to force US companies to provide their technologies to Chinese entities.  But the arguments are not as strong as the report says. To begin with, because Chinese companies are not hungry for capital - thanks to China&#39;s growing savings, access to foreign technology is their primary motivation for attracting direct investment from abroad. Under WTO rules, they are free to resort to technology transfers from their foreign partners on a commercial and voluntary basis.  Fortunately for China, foreign companies are more than willing to enter their market, mainly because of the preferential treatment of direct investment. Indeed, for decades, foreign and domestic companies have willingly accepted China&#39;s &"market access for technology&" strategy, which required foreign investors to &"import&" advanced technology in exchange for entry into the Chinese market.  Whatever the disadvantage they may see in this approach, the truth is that foreign companies - including wholly foreign companies and foreign partners of Chinese companies - have benefited greatly from their investments in China. A 2006 World Bank report put the average return rate of foreign multinationals in China at 22%. According to a report compiled by the Conference Board of World Enterprises, the average capital return rate for US multinationals in China in 2008 was 33%.  That said, the EBIT of foreign companies in China has been getting worse since 2009, but in 2017 the situation has improved. This is an issue that the Chinese government should take seriously. In any case, no one can claim that foreign companies were forced to operate in the Chinese market. The argument that US companies were compelled to shift their technology to China is not significant.  In fact, this argument was never supported by persuasive evidence. Although the USTR, who compiled the Section 301 report, claims to have conducted much research, all respondents are anonymous and their statements are little more than rumors - nothing admissible in a court of law. And even if they are considered to be true, such allegations would not definitively prove that forcing foreign companies to transfer their technology isprevalent in China.  The allegations in the Section 301 report on foreign investment - that is, China uses &"government capital and highly opaque investor networks to facilitate high tech acquisitions abroad&" - are equally fragile. The USTR assumes that the Chinese government not only has a clearly defined investment strategy, but also an army of compliant companies willing to carry it out.  However, the American Enterprise Institute reports that from 2005 to 2016, Chinese companies made only 202 investments, including mergers and acquisitions, in the US, of which only 16 - totaling $ 21 billion - in the technology sector. Chinese investors spent much more than this - $ 94 billion - on real estate in the US between 2013 and 2016.  The sectoral distribution of foreign investment by Chinese companies indicates that there is no effective market mechanism to conduct rational investments of Chinese companies. Instead, companies are making independent - and often irrational - investment decisions that sometimes lead to heavy losses.  The last issue raised by the Section 301 report refers to cybernetic theft of intellectual property and sensitive commercial information, which the United States claims to be conducted by the Chinese government. The report acknowledges that since 2015 - when China and the US agreed that neither country would &"consciously carry out or support cyber theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential business information to gain commercial advantage&" - the number of incidents of Chinese cyber-espionage detected declined. However, some US officials insist that this probably reflects a move to more centralized, sophisticated, and more experienced attacks by a smaller number of actors.  The truth is that China has made steady progress in protecting property rights. As Nicholas Lardy of the Peterson Institute of International Economics points out, &"Chinese license fee payments for the use of foreign technology have increased in recent years, reaching almost $ 30 billion last year, almost four times more than in In fact, Lardy continues, &"China probably ranks second in the world in terms of rights paid for technology used within national boundaries.&"  It seems clear that the Section 301 report was based on rumors, imagination and half truths. The obvious question is how the Trump administration can base a political decision with such significant consequences as commercial tariffs - which could trigger a catastrophic trade war - on such weak evidence. The obvious answer is that the report was intended to justify rather than inform policy.  This is not to say that the issues raised by the Section 301 report are pure fantasy, or that China&#39;s compliance with its WTO commitments has been flawless. On the contrary, China has much scope to improve its WTO compliance, especially with regard to the opening up of its financial services sector and the strengthening of intellectual property protections.  But trade-related issues need to be addressed within the WTO, with the United States using the WTO&#39;s settlement mechanisms to deal with its claims. In the absence of such an approach by the Trump administration, China should consider launching a new round of WTO negotiations in cooperation with Australia, Canada, the European Union, Japan, Mexico and New Zealand. Omultilateralism must be preserved, with or without the US.  Trump&#39;s trade war will not lead China to abandon its aspiration to reach advanced economies. China is ready to wage a war of attrition. Unfortunately, both sides - just like the rest of the world - will suffer heavy losses during the process. Yu Yongding, a former president of the Chinese Society of World Economics and director of the Institute of World Economy and Policy at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, was a member of the Monetary Policy Committee of the People&#39;s Bank of China from 2004 to 2006. Copyright: Project Syndicate, 2018.  www.project-syndicate.org  Translation: Rita Faria Load-Date: July 9, 2018End of Document

Rights groups to Google: No censored search in ChinaAssociated Press InternationalAugust 29, 2018 Wednesday 6:49 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 652 wordsByline: By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN, Associated PressDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - More than a dozen human rights groups are urging Google not to offer censored internet search in China, amid reports it is planning to again provide the service in the giant market.A joint letter Tuesday calls on CEO Sundar Pichai to explain what Google is doing to safeguard users from the Chinese government's censorship and surveillance.It describes the company's secretive plan to build a search engine that would comply with Chinese censorship as representing "an alarming capitulation by Google on human rights.""The Chinese government extensively violates the rights to freedom of expression and privacy; by accommodating the Chinese authorities' repression of dissent, Google would be actively participating in those violations for millions of internet users in China," the letter says.In a statement, Google said it has "been investing for many years to help Chinese users, from developing Android, through mobile apps such as Google Translate and Files Go, and our developer tools. But our work on search has been exploratory, and we are not close to launching a search product in China."In the U.S., President Donald Trump and other conservatives have lobbed charges of censorship at Google and other U.S. tech companies, though they haven't provided evidence. On Tuesday, Trump claimed that Google had rigged search results about him "so that almost all stories & news is BAD." A top adviser said the White House is "taking a look" at whether Google should face federal regulation. The companies deny the accusations.Meanwhile, Apple announced plans last year to open a data center in mainland China with ties to the country's government, raising concerns about the security of iCloud accounts that store personal information from Apple customers who live in mainland China, even when they're traveling outside the country. Other major technology companies, including Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM, already had similar deals to run data centers in mainland China to remain in the good graces of the country's Communist government.The rights groups' expression of concern over a Chinese search engine from Google follows a letter earlier this month from more than a thousand Google employees protesting the China plans. The letter called on executives to review ethics and transparency at the company.Google had previously complied with censorship controls starting in 2006 as it sought a toehold in the booming Chinese economy. But it exited the Chinese search market in 2010 under unrelenting pressure from human rights groups and some shareholders.Tuesday's letter, signed by groups including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Reporters Without Borders, said China's controls over the internet have only strengthened since then amid an overall crackdown on civil liberties and freedom of expression. The letter said it would be difficult for Google to relaunch a search engine "in a way that would be compatible with the company's human rights responsibilities under international standards, or its own commitments."According to online news site The Intercept, Google created a custom Android app that will automatically filter out sites blocked by China's so-called "Great Firewall."Google co-founder Sergey Brin was born in the Soviet Union in 1973 and lived there until age 6 when his family fled.

Rights groups to Google: No censored search in ChinaAssociated Press Financial WireAugust 29, 2018 Wednesday 6:49 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 652 wordsByline: By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN, Associated PressDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - More than a dozen human rights groups are urging Google not to offer censored internet search in China, amid reports it is planning to again provide the service in the giant market.A joint letter Tuesday calls on CEO Sundar Pichai to explain what Google is doing to safeguard users from the Chinese government's censorship and surveillance.It describes the company's secretive plan to build a search engine that would comply with Chinese censorship as representing "an alarming capitulation by Google on human rights.""The Chinese government extensively violates the rights to freedom of expression and privacy; by accommodating the Chinese authorities' repression of dissent, Google would be actively participating in those violations for millions of internet users in China," the letter says.In a statement, Google said it has "been investing for many years to help Chinese users, from developing Android, through mobile apps such as Google Translate and Files Go, and our developer tools. But our work on search has been exploratory, and we are not close to launching a search product in China."In the U.S., President Donald Trump and other conservatives have lobbed charges of censorship at Google and other U.S. tech companies, though they haven't provided evidence. On Tuesday, Trump claimed that Google had rigged search results about him "so that almost all stories & news is BAD." A top adviser said the White House is "taking a look" at whether Google should face federal regulation. The companies deny the accusations.Meanwhile, Apple announced plans last year to open a data center in mainland China with ties to the country's government, raising concerns about the security of iCloud accounts that store personal information from Apple customers who live in mainland China, even when they're traveling outside the country. Other major technology companies, including Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM, already had similar deals to run data centers in mainland China to remain in the good graces of the country's Communist government.The rights groups' expression of concern over a Chinese search engine from Google follows a letter earlier this month from more than a thousand Google employees protesting the China plans. The letter called on executives to review ethics and transparency at the company.Google had previously complied with censorship controls starting in 2006 as it sought a toehold in the booming Chinese economy. But it exited the Chinese search market in 2010 under unrelenting pressure from human rights groups and some shareholders.Tuesday's letter, signed by groups including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Reporters Without Borders, said China's controls over the internet have only strengthened since then amid an overall crackdown on civil liberties and freedom of expression. The letter said it would be difficult for Google to relaunch a search engine "in a way that would be compatible with the company's human rights responsibilities under international standards, or its own commitments."According to online news site The Intercept, Google created a custom Android app that will automatically filter out sites blocked by China's so-called "Great Firewall."Google co-founder Sergey Brin was born in the Soviet Union in 1973 and lived there until age 6 when his family fled.

Google prepares a "censored" search engine to return to ChinaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 2, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 645 wordsBody Google is preparing an experimental version of its search engine adapted to the demands of Chinese censorship to return to the country, which was withdrawn a few years ago.  Faced with the pressure of censorship and cyber attacks, Google withdrew its search engine from China in 2010 and most of its services are blocked in the second world economy.  But the Californian giant is now working on a new version, dubbed "Dragonfly" ("Dragonfly"), modified specifically to censor web pages and keywords banned by the Chinese government, said internal source of the US multinational.  The source code of this search engine can be consulted and tested on the internal computer networks of Google, says an employee under anonymity, confirming information published in the US press.  The news caused discomfort among many employees of Google. "Some are outraged by what is being done," acknowledges the same source.  Google spokesman in Asia, Taj Meadows, did not want to confirm or deny the existence of this project.  "We already propose several applications for mobile phones in China, such as Google Translate [translator] or FilesGo [document delivery] and we make significant investments in Chinese companies such as JD.com," an electronic commerce giant in China, Meadows said.  "But we will not comment on speculation of our future projects," he added. Censored democracy The digital newspaper The Intercept, which revealed the existence of this program, said that this search engine is intended for the Android operating system for smartphones, owned by Google.  According to the US publication, founded by investigative journalist Glenn Greenwald, the new search engine has a 'blacklist' with words related to human rights, democracy, religion or demonstrations.  This application also censors websites forbidden by the Chinese communist authorities.  China has a complex system of censorship on the Internet, known as the "Great Electronic Wall", which prevents access to Google, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and numerous Western media.  Chinese platforms such as Weibo (the equivalent of Twitter) or WeChat (Chinese WhatsApp) are also censored and forced to regulate their most sensitive content, such as critical voices against the regime, health scandals or rap music.  In this context, Western technology groups face the dilemma of making concessions to the Chinese government or renouncing a gigantic market.  Microsoft is already present in China with its Bing search engine.  For its part, Amnesty International asked the company not to accept Chinese censorship.  "It will be a black day for freedom on the Internet if Google submits to the extreme rules of Chinese censorship to access its market," warned Patrick Poon, an NGO researcher, who lamented that "priority is given to profits in place of human rights. " Thaw According to The New York Times, Google made a demonstration in front of Chinese leaders but this does not mean that the start-up of its search engine in China is imminent.  "The search engine project is not finished," says the Wall Street Journal.  The information that points to a return of Google to the Chinese market "is not adapted to reality," the official Chinese newspaper Zhengquan Ribao said on Thursday.  Although the Google search engine stopped working in 2010 in the Asian giant, the Californian company did not completely abandonthis market.  Google, a subsidiary of Alphabet, has three offices and 700 employees in China, where it achieves important advertising benefits.  During the past few years, there have been signs of melting ice between the California group and the Chinese authorities. Last year they authorized for example access to the Google Translate application, which until then was blocked in China.  The Google entry prepares a "censored" search engine to return to China was first published in La Tercera. Load-Date: August 2, 2018End of Document

What they're saying about the trade war at China's 'Davos'CNN WireSeptember 18, 2018 Tuesday 2:52 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 698 wordsByline: By Daniel ShaneDateline: TIANJIN, China (CNNMoney) BodyTIANJIN, China (CNNMoney) --  Business leaders and officials in China say that Beijing is ready to dig in for a war of attrition with the United States on trade.The Trump administration launched its biggest barrage of tariffs yet just as top executives and policymakers were gathering for the start of a World Economic Forum event in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin on Tuesday. China said later it would retaliate with more tariffs of its own.The trade war dominated discussions at the "summer Davos," as the event is known, and few participants predicted a swift resolution to the conflict."China is growing concerned that the US motivation is now trying to keep China down and contain it," said Timothy Stratford, a managing partner at law firm Covington & Burling in Beijing. "I expect that we're going to have a deadlock for some time." The US government wants China to change practices that it says disadvantage American businesses, accusing Beijing of overseeing the theft of US intellectual property and boosting Chinese companies through aggressive industrial policies. The Chinese government dismisses the criticism as groundless, even though American and European firms operating in China frequently complain about the issues.'This is a test for us'Chinese government officials speaking in Tianjin insisted that the country can weather the tariff battle even though it has shaken the country's financial markets."The trade frictions don't have a huge direct impact on China's economy, but they may impact people's expectations," said Liu Shijin, a Chinese government adviser and member of the monetary policy committee at the People's Bank of China.A slump in Chinese stocks and the yuan showed investors had "overreacted" to trade fears, he added."This is a test for us and we should stick to our direction and never stop," Liu said of the trade war.Fang Xinghai, vice chairman of China's securities regulator, said that the new US tariffs wouldn't make Beijing back down. He said he hoped the two governments would soon talk again and strike a deal. One of China's most prominent entrepreneurs is doubtful that will happen anytime soon. The trade war is "going to last long, it's going to be a mess," Jack Ma, the founder and executive chairman of top Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba, said Tuesday at a separate event in the eastern city of Hangzhou. He predicted the conflict could drag on for as long as 20 years.US companies operating in China say the waves of tariffs are already hurting their business. Casualties also include American chipmaker Qualcomm, whose $44 billion deal to buy Dutch rival NXP Semiconductors was blocked by Chinese regulators in July.Other companies could get caught in the crossfire. JPMorgan Chase wants to take advantage of China's efforts to open up its financial industry and recently applied to launch a brokerage in the country. Asked if he was worried Beijing could withhold approval for the venture because of the trade war, JPMorgan China CEO Mark Leung said in Tianjin that it's "not within our control."He added that the bank is "working constructively" with regulators.US economy could overheatWhile China appears to be suffering more pain right now, it may not be in the US government's interests to leave tariffs in place for too long. "We've seen a heating up of the US economy," said Helen Zhu, head of China equities at investment manager Blackrock. "If tariffs were to go to 25% later this year on $200 billion of imports, that would work into inflationary pressure and damage the US consumer." "There's an increasing incentive for both sides to work out something in the coming months," she said.If they don't, the fallout will be felt around the world. "Every time we get into a trade war, it doesn't end up well," said Carlos Moedas, the European Union's commissioner for research, science and innovation."Each time we've done protectionism, people get worse off," he added, referring to the global trade slump in the 1930s. "Economically, politicians seem not to have learned their lessons." -- Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

The Chinese government dismisses the criticism as groundless, even though American and European firms operating in China frequently complain about the issues.'This is a test for us'Chinese government officials speaking in Tianjin insisted that the country can weather the tariff battle even though it has shaken the country's financial markets."The trade frictions don't have a huge direct impact on China's economy, but they may impact people's expectations," said Liu Shijin, a Chinese government adviser and member of the monetary policy committee at the People's Bank of China.A slump in Chinese stocks and the yuan showed investors had "overreacted" to trade fears, he added."This is a test for us and we should stick to our direction and never stop," Liu said of the trade war.Fang Xinghai, vice chairman of China's securities regulator, said that the new US tariffs wouldn't make Beijing back down. He said he hoped the two governments would soon talk again and strike a deal.One of China's most prominent entrepreneurs is doubtful that will happen anytime soon.The trade war is "going to last long, it's going to be a mess," Jack Ma, the founder and executive chairman of top Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba, said Tuesday at a separate event in the eastern city of Hangzhou. He predicted the conflict could drag on for as long as 20 years.US companies operating in China say the waves of tariffs are already hurting their business. Casualties also include American chipmaker Qualcomm, whose $44 billion deal to buy Dutch rival NXP Semiconductors was blocked by Chinese regulators in July.Other companies could get caught in the crossfire. JPMorgan Chase wants to take advantage of China's efforts to open up its financial industry and recently applied to launch a brokerage in the country.Asked if he was worried Beijing could withhold approval for the venture because of the trade war, JPMorgan China CEO Mark Leung said in Tianjin that it's "not within our control."He added that the bank is "working constructively" with regulators.US economy could overheatWhile China appears to be suffering more pain right now, it may not be in the US government's interests to leave tariffs in place for too long."We've seen a heating up of the US economy," said Helen Zhu, head of China equities at investment manager Blackrock. "If tariffs were to go to 25% later this year on $200 billion of imports, that would work into inflationary pressure and damage the US consumer.""There's an increasing incentive for both sides to work out something in the coming months," she said.If they don't, the fallout will be felt around the world."Every time we get into a trade war, it doesn't end up well," said Carlos Moedas, the European Union's commissioner for research, science and innovation."Each time we've done protectionism, people get worse off," he added, referring to the global trade slump in the 1930s. "Economically, politicians seem not to have learned their lessons."-- Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.Load-Date: September 19, 2018End of Document

China's 'Big Brother' surveillance technology isn't nearly as all-seeing as the government wants you to thinkBusiness Insider USJuly 15, 2018 Sunday 09:01 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1197 wordsByline: hjacobs@businessinsider.com,  (Harrison Jacobs)Highlight: The Chinese government is working to combine its 170+ million security cameras with artificial intelligence and facial recognition to create a vast surveillance state. But recent reports suggest the technology is not as ubiquitous or as useful as the government wants citizens to believe.BodyREUTERS/Bobby Yip• The Chinese government is working to combine its 170+ million security cameras with artificial intelligence and facial recognition technology to create a vast surveillance state.• The government isn't quiet about its efforts, often playing up technological successes in state media to convince the populace of its impressive capabilities.• But recent reports suggest that the technology is not as ubiquitous or useful as the government wants its citizens to believe.• For example, an exec at one of the main Chinese artificial intelligence startups powering the surveillance technology told Business Insider that its platform cannot handle searching for more than 1,000 people at a time due to technological limitations.The Chinese government is working to create a techno-authoritarian state powered by artificial intelligence and facial recognition to track and monitor its 1.4 billion citizens.The government has big plans to have a ubiquitous surveillance network, leading the country to becoming the biggest market in the world for video surveillance - $6.4 billion in 2016, according to estimates from IHS Markit Ltd. China already            has 170 million security cameras in use for its so-called Skynet surveillance system, with            400 million more on the way in the coming years.Far from hiding its wide-reaching abilities from the public, the government has frequently touted its high-tech surveillance successes in recent months.AFP/Getty ImagesLast September, English-language state newspaper China Daily touted how police in Qingdao used facial recognition technology to catch 25 would-be criminals. In March, Beijing police            began using facial recognition and AI-powered glasses to catch criminals - just a couple months after police in Henan and Zhengzhou began testing the glasses at train stations.In Xiangyang, a giant screen was set up over a crosswalk to display the names and faces of jaywalkers and other lawbreakers that cameras caught at the intersection. And in December, China demonstrated its sophisticated "Skynet" system by having it track down a BBC reporter in just 7 minutes.But all of these successes belie a simple reality: the surveillance tech is not nearly as pervasive or effective as the government or the media purports it to be.Face++ isn't all-powerful yetHarrison Jacobs/Business InsiderOn a recent visit to the offices of Megvii, a leading artificial intelligence startup and one of the main providers behind the facial recognition tech used by Chinese police, I met with Xie Yinan, the company's vice president.Despite notions that Chinese police's facial recognition capabilities can track down anyone, anywhere, that's simply not what the technology is capable of, according to Xie.He said Megvii's Face++ platform, which numerous police departments in China have used to help them arrest 4,000 people since 2016, has serious technological limitations.For example, even if China had facial scans of every one of its citizens uploaded to its system, it would be impossible to identify everyone passing in front of a Face++-linked camera. While the Face++ algorithm is more than 97% accurate, it can only search a limited number of faces at a time.In order to work, police would have to upload the faces they want to track to a local server at the train station or command center where they intend to look. Face++ would then use its algorithm to match those faces to the ones it encounters in the real world.Harrison Jacobs/Business InsiderXie said it wouldn't be feasible to have the system search for more than 1,000 faces at a time - the data and processing power required for an operation larger than that would require a supercomputer. Plus, Xie said they can't run the system 24/7 today. It's the kind of thing police will have to activate proactively when a situation is underway.While it is possible that the system could be connected to a supercomputer over the cloud to amplify computing power, it would be too dangerous from a security perspective. The system has to stay offline and local.When I asked whether Xie or the company have any concerns over how police could misuse the Face++ platform, he essentially said it's up to the government to write the legal framework on when and how law enforcement can use it."We don't have access to the data," he said. "What we do is sell them a server [loaded with Face++]. That's all."Exaggerating technological advancementsFacial recognition isn't the only area where China's techno-authoritarian capabilities have been exaggerated, by both the media and the government.At the crosswalk in Xiangyang, there is a 5- to 6-day delay between when someone commits crime and when their face appears on the billboard. Local officials told The New York Times that humans, not an algorithm, look through the photos the crosswalk camera captures to match them with people's identities.Meanwhile, the smart glasses police are using in Beijing and Zhengzhou only work if a target stands still for several seconds. It's less being used to spot criminals than to verify travelers' identifications.AFP/AFP/Getty ImagesBut, in some ways, it hardly matters. Those nuances are often lost on the public, particularly when state media has gone to such lengths to convince its populace of its technological prowess.In Zhengzhou, a heroin smuggler confessed after police showed the suspect their smart glasses and said it could incriminate him, The Times recently reported."The whole point is that people don't know if they're being monitored, and that uncertainty makes people more obedient," Martin Chorzempa, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told The Times.Of course, it's likely only a matter of time before the technology gets better. The Chinese government and the country's tech investors are pouring money into facial recognition startups like Megvii.Megvii raised $460 million last November, much of which came from a state-owned venture fund. While the valuation hasn't been disclosed, it's likely that it is close to or tops $2 billion. Two smaller Chinese companies include DeepGlint, and Yitu Technology, which raised $380 million last year.SenseTime, a competitor, became the world's highest valued AI startup after raising $600 million in April and            $620 million in June. It now has a valuation of $4.5 billion.NOW WATCH: London's riverside pods have been revamped for summer - and they received 9,000 bookings in a single daySee Also:• Inside the lives of Mongolia's 'millennial monks,' who play basketball, pray for 12 hours a day, and visit the outside world only twice a year• A sex therapist says many people feel so guilty about cheating that they passive-aggressively try to get caught• I asked 3 relationship experts for the best ways to cut off arguments before they startSEE ALSO: Inside the creepy and impressive startup funded by the Chinese government that is developing AI that can recognize anyone, anywhereDON'T MISS: Alibaba's futuristic supermarket in China is way ahead of the US, with 30-minute deliveries and facial-recognition payment - and it shows where Amazon is likely to take Whole FoodsLoad-Date: February 11, 2019End of Document

Now it's changing business in China, too.For the first time, China will let a foreign automaker open up shop without a Chinese company as its partner.Tesla has plans to open a plant in Shanghai that will one day crank out 500,000 vehicles a year - enough to rival the company's main plant in Fremont, California.Tesla said it will be the sole owner of the factory. Until now, China has always required foreign companies to enter joint ventures with domestic companies.Tesla expects to begin construction in the near future, after it gets the necessary government approvals. From there, the plant will take about two years to build and two to three more years to produce 500,000 vehicles a year.CEO Elon Musk was in Shanghai on Tuesday for a ceremony with local government authorities."Tesla is deeply committed to the Chinese market, and we look forward to building even more cars for our customers here," said a company spokesman. "Today's announcement will not impact our US manufacturing operations, which continue to grow."China is now the largest market for new car sales, as more Chinese consumers buy them for the first time. The world's automakers have been rushing to build plants there for the last two decades. Those automakers have always been required to enter joint ventures and share their technology - and their profit - with Chinese partners. But the Chinese government has been under pressure from the United States and European countries on forced joint ventures and China's alleged theft of intellectual property. That was the justification used by the Trump administration for the tariffs imposed by the United States on $50 billion of Chinese imports.China has denied it steals trade secrets. But in April, it announced it would start loosening its joint venture requirements for foreign automakers, with the restrictions on electric car manufacturing being removed this year.The cost of the Tesla plant was not immediately disclosed. The local government said it will be the largest manufacturing project in Shanghai's history funded at least partly by foreign investment.It was also not immediately clear how independent the new Tesla plant would be.The government said Tesla would wholly own the factory, but it also said the agreement with Tesla would include an "investment agreement" between Tesla and the local authorities. The government also said Tesla and the city of Shanghai would cooperate on technology and research and development. A Tesla spokesperson said he could not give more details about the investment or agreement on technology cooperation.Shares of Tesla closed up 1.2% Tuesday.Tesla long has been interested in expanding production into China, but it wanted to keep control over its manufacturing. It had already disclosed general plans to build a factory in Shanghai, without announcing any details."As we try to make cars more and more affordable, it's going to be important to localize production," Musk said at the company's annual meeting in June. He said at that time the company expected to announce details of its plans as soon as this month.Automakers like to build cars close to where they will sell those cars.

Google s prototype Chinese search engine reportedly links searches to phone numbersiCrowdNewswire (English)September 20, 2018 Thursday 11:40 AM GMTCopyright 2018 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 617 wordsBody                   Google is reportedly building a prototype system that would tie Chinese users  Google searches to their personal phone numbers, as part of a new search service that would comply with the Chinese government s censorship requirements. The Intercept writes that the  Dragonfly  Android app, a secret project revealed by a whistleblower last month, could be linked to a user s phone number   Continue reading Google s prototype Chinese search engine reportedly links searches to phone numbersGoogle is reportedly building a prototype system that would tie Chinese users  Google searches to their personal phone numbers, as part of a new search service that would comply with the Chinese government s censorship requirements. The Intercept writes that the  Dragonfly  Android app, a secret project revealed by a whistleblower last month, could be linked to a user s phone number   making it simple to track individual users  searches.This tracking would be in addition to Dragonfly s blacklisting of terms like  human rights,   student protest,  and  Nobel Prize,  which might normally pull up news about Chinese activist and Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo. Sources have also told The Intercept that it s  essentially hardcoded  to replace weather and air pollution results with potentially doctored data from a source in China.Google hasn t confirmed the existence of Dragonfly, and it s mostly declined to comment on reports about the project. (It didn t immediately respond to a request for comment on this latest news.) It s previously said that it s only doing  exploratory  work on a search service in China and that it s  not close to launching a search product  in the country.A handful of Google employees have reportedly resigned over DragonflyBut these reports have drawn opposition inside and outside the company. Around 1,400 Google employees have allegedly signed a letter demanding more information about the project, which has been shrouded in secrecy and reportedly runs in partnership with a Chinese company. Earlier today, a bipartisan group of House representatives asked Google to answer questions about its plans for a Chinese search app, saying Congress has  a responsibility to ensure that American companies are not perpetuating human rights abuses abroad.  And The Intercept reported yesterday that Google senior research scientist Jack Poulson resigned to protest the decision, saying a total of five employees have left because of Dragonfly.Google pulled out of mainland China in 2010 after discovering a phishing attack targeting human rights activists. As it s pointed out in previous statements, it offers apps like Google Translate in China, but search remains blocked   although if Google launches a service that complies with China s censorship regime, that might change. China s government has only tightened its reins over the internet since 2010, while expanding a regime of high-tech social control that includes  social credit  scores (which can determine things like citizens  travel rights) and a sophisticated surveillance apparatus for watching its Muslim minority population in Xinjiang.Even without links to a phone number, searches on Dragonfly wouldn t be secure. Poulson and others have expressed concern about simply having user data hosted in China, where government agencies could access it. But the reported feature would add yet another layer of control, and signal Google s willingness to make surveillance easy.See Campaign:https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/14/17861962/google-china-dragonfly-censorship-search-engine-phone-number-link-reportContact Information:Adi RobertsonTags:,            Wire,            Artificial Intelligence Newswire,            United States,            EnglishLoad-Date: September 20, 2018End of Document

But President Donald Trump's measures targeting Chinese medical, construction and factory equipment hit exporters that say price-conscious American customers have stopped buying.The general manager of a medical device exporter that makes 15 to 20 percent of its sales to the United States said he plans to fly there this week to negotiate with customers who stopped ordering its syringes and other equipment.Wuxi Yushou Medical Devices Co., Ltd., with a workforce of 500, stands to lose 30-40 million yuan ($4.5 to $6 million) in annual revenue, according to the manager, Miao Liping.Without new orders, "I will suspend making the products," said Miao. "It is not easy for us to compete with low-end products in other countries."Other exporters of goods from kitchen appliances and lighting to toys and tools have reported similar drops in U.S. orders.The state press tried to downplay the impact on China, emphasizing what Beijing says will be the bigger blow to American consumers who will pay more for Chinese goods.China can find other suppliers for soybeans and other American goods hit by its own retaliatory tariffs, state media said."Added tariffs basically have no effect on companies," the chairman of one of China's biggest chemical companies, state-owned Sinochem Group, Ning Gaoning, told the website aweb.com.Despite official bravado, the conflict adds to mounting economic challenges for Beijing.Growth already was cooling after regulators tightened controls last year on bank lending to cool surging debt. That spooked investors, who have driven the main stock market index down 21 percent from its Jan. 24 peak.Trump raised tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods in response to complaints Beijing steals or pressures foreign companies to hand over technology.More broadly, American officials worry Chinese government plans such as "Made in China 2025," which calls for creating competitors in robots, biotech, artificial intelligence and other fields, might erode U.S. technology leadership and prosperity.Beijing retaliated for the U.S. move by hiking tariffs on American goods including soybeans, whiskey and electric cars. Regulators appeared to be trying to minimize the cost to China by picking goods available from Brazil, Russia, Southeast Asia or other suppliers."It won't be difficult for Chinese companies to find replacements for U.S. goods," said Bai Ming, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, quoted by the newspaper Global Times.Alternative suppliers such as Europe, Australia and Brazil "will be likely winners," Rajiv Biswas of IHS Markit said in a report.A Commerce Ministry statement said Beijing will use revenue from the higher import duties to "alleviate the impact on enterprises and employees" but gave no details. It said importers would be encouraged to shift to buying soybeans and other farm goods from countries that aren't affected by the tariffs.The United States buys about 20 percent of China's exports, but trade has shrunk as a share of the Chinese economy.Still, the impact could spread as Chinese factory demand for components from Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Southeast Asia slumps.That could cut next year's Asia-Pacific economic growth by up to 1 percentage point, according to Biswas.Meanwhile, China's entirely state-controlled media have been ordered to avoid "aggressive language" in describing Trump, the South China Morning Post newspaper in Hong Kong reported, citing unidentified sources.It said that might be intended to avoid antagonizing the American leader and hindering negotiations.Other exporters including makers of solar panels already were stepping up marketing in Asian and other markets. They are trying to make up for the loss of U.S. and European sales following higher tariffs imposed over complaints they sell at improperly low prices.Solar exporter Jiangsu Akcome Science & Technology Co. makes about 15 percent of its sales to the United States, while Japan and South Korea are 25 to 30 percent, its general manager, Hu Jingnang, told the newspaper Wuxi Daily."The ability to increase global resource allocation can effectively offset foreign trade risks," Hu was quoted as saying.___AP researcher Yu Bing contributed.Load-Date: July 11, 2018End of Document

It said importers would be encouraged to shift to buying soybeans and other farm goods from countries that aren't affected by the tariffs.The United States buys about 20 percent of China's exports, but trade has shrunk as a share of the Chinese economy.Still, the impact could spread as Chinese factory demand for components from Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Southeast Asia slumps.That could cut next year's Asia-Pacific economic growth by up to 1 percentage point, according to Biswas.Meanwhile, China's entirely state-controlled media have been ordered to avoid "aggressive language" in describing Trump, the South China Morning Post newspaper in Hong Kong reported, citing unidentified sources.It said that might be intended to avoid antagonizing the American leader and hindering negotiations.Other exporters including makers of solar panels already were stepping up marketing in Asian and other markets. They are trying to make up for the loss of U.S. and European sales following higher tariffs imposed over complaints they sell at improperly low prices.Solar exporter Jiangsu Akcome Science & Technology Co. makes about 15 percent of its sales to the United States, while Japan and South Korea are 25 to 30 percent, its general manager, Hu Jingnang, told the newspaper Wuxi Daily."The ability to increase global resource allocation can effectively offset foreign trade risks," Hu was quoted as saying.___AP researcher Yu Bing contributed.Load-Date: July 11, 2018End of Document

Continue reading Hair Loss Products Market Trends in China Price, Consumption, Production and RevenueThis study focuses on China's Hair Loss Products market trends. In the two past decades, the market has been growing at a fast pace. The dramatic expansions of the manufacturing capabilities and rising consumer consumptions in China have transformed China's society and economy. China is one of the world's major producers for industrial and consumer products. Far outpacing other economies in the world, China is the world's fastest growing market for the consumptions of goods and services. The Chinese economy maintains a high speed growth which has been stimulated by the consecutive increases of industrial output, imports & exports, consumer consumption and capital investment for over two decades. Rapid consolidation between medium and large players is anticipated since the Chinese government has been encouraging industry consolidation with an effort to regulate the industry and to improve competitiveness in the world market. Request A Sample Copy of this Market Report @: https://www.radiantinsights.com/research/hair-loss-products-market-trends-in-china/request-sampleAlthough China has enjoyed the benefits of an expanding market for production and distribution, the industry is suffering from minimal innovation and investment in R&D and new product development.

Google may help China censor sitesStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeAugust 3, 2018 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: MARKETS; Pg. 1Length: 516 wordsByline: Jean GarciaBodyThe report adds that Google is likely to roll out this censored search engine through a Chinese android app in the next six months, and this search engine would block all things unwanted by the Chinese government: Services already outlawed in China, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Wikipedia, sensitive news such as the Tiananmen Square massacre and Liu Xiaobo, and worldwide media outlets like the BBC and the New York Times.Google is planning to relaunch a search service in mainland China, complete with government censorship, according to The Intercept.Academics, university students and other researchers relied heavily on Google's search services to access information not available through Chinese search engines like Baidu.The move would mark an abrupt about-face by the Alphabet Inc. unit and a win for China's communist government, which suppresses free speech online.Google has been making a series of strategic investments into Chinese businesses as a way to indirectly gain access to one of the world's largest markets, but now may be taking a more direct approach.There was no guarantee the project would result in Google search returning to China.Some staff members of Google told Bloomberg that this project, code-named Dragonfly, would make Google a "censorship engine". "In puttingprofits before human rights, Google would be setting a chilling precedent and handing the Chinese government a victory".The dynamic changed in January 2010, when Google charged that Chinese hackers had targeted Google and more than 20 other Western companies and compromised the email accounts of Chinese dissidents living overseas. Given the size of its audience, this represents a potential missed opportunity for Google's revenue and brand awareness.South Africa's ruling ANC plans to allow land expropriation without compensationRamaphosa also spoke about the "serious challenges" faced by the economy and said that levels of unemployment in the country were worrying.The service was said to have been shown to Chinese officials. Two different versions of the app called "Maotai" and "Longfei" have been developed and is pending approval from government officials.The censorship will be embedded in image search, spell check, and even suggested search.Human rights activists denounced Google's possible reversal.Code-named Dragonfly, this project has reportedly been in the works since the spring season a year ago, and apparently started moving quicker after a meeting in December between Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, and a top Chinese government official. "I'm committed to engaging more in China", he said.Google did not respond to a request for comment. On a chat group used by Googlers, one employee called the situation "the new Maven", a reference to the controversy inside the company earlier this year over Google's work with the U.S. military.The company withdrew from providing search tools to the Chinese market in 2010, and its worldwide search engine is blocked by the country's so-called "Great Firewall".The Intercept revealed some details about how the app might work.Load-Date: August 6, 2018End of Document

Chi-Med Reports 2018 Interim Results and Updates Shareholders on Key Clinical ProgramsGlobeNewswireJuly 26, 2018 Thursday 11:00 PM PTCopyright 2018 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: EARNINGS RELEASES AND OPERATING RESULTSLength: 27937 wordsBodyLONDON, July  27, 2018  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hutchison China MediTech Limited ("Chi-Med") (AIM:HCM) (Nasdaq:HCM) today announces its unaudited financial results for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and updates shareholders on key clinical programs.• Fruquintinib made substantial progress through China New Drug Application ("NDA") process, aiming for approval and launch for colorectal cancer ("CRC") this year; we also target to report Phase III top-line results for non-small cell lung cancer ("NSCLC") in Q4 2018;  • Savolitinib has two registration studies underway, global Phase III in papillary renal cell carcinoma ("PRCC") and China registration intent Phase II in MET exon 14 mutation/deletion NSCLC; also Tagrisso®/savolitinib combination studies in NSCLC indications are in planning, and set to start in late 2018 and early 2019;  • Expansion of U.S. and international operations firmly underway, including recruitment of U.S. Chief Medical Officer and Head of International Operations; and  • Video webcast presentation at 9:00 a.m. BST and additional conference call at 9:00 a.m. EDT.FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTSThe points below are selected financial data for the six months ended June 30, 2018. For more details, please refer to "Financial Review", "Operations Review" and "Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" below.Overall Group  ¢   Group revenue of $102.2 million (H1 2017: $126.6m).  ¢   Net loss attributable to Chi ‘Med of $32.7 million (H1 2017: net profit $1.7m).  ¢   Cash resources of $416.9 million at Group level as of June 30, 2018 ($479.6m as of December 31, 2017), including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and unutilized bank facilities.Innovation Platform: increased investment in Research and Development ("R&D") driven by initiation of new trials and ongoing enrollment in existing Phase III programs  ¢   Consolidated revenue was $13.6 million mainly from service fee payments from AstraZeneca AB (publ) ("AstraZeneca"), Eli Lilly & Company ("Lilly") and Nutrition Science Partners Limited ("NSP"), our 50/50 joint venture with NestlÃ© Health Science S.A. ("NestlÃ©") (H1 2017: $22.7m, which included $9.5m in milestone payments from AstraZeneca and Lilly).   ¢   R&D expenses on an as adjusted (non-GAAP) basis increased to $66.7 million (H1 2017: $37.5m), primarily driven by rapid expansion of operations and increased clinical trial expenses on all eight clinical drug candidates.   ¢   Net loss attributable to Chi-Med of $52.9 million (H1 2017: -$14.8m).Commercial Platform: strong net income growth amid shift in revenue model and over-the-counter ("OTC") logistics divestment ¢   Total consolidated sales fell 15% to $88.6 million (H1 2017: $103.9m) due to the implementation of the Two-Invoice System ("TIS") in China, a new government policy that has led to a shift in our revenue recognition for certain third-party drugs from gross sales consolidation to a fee-for-service revenue model.  ¢   Total sales of non-consolidated joint ventures, on an as adjusted (non-GAAP) basis excluding the effects of the divestment of certain non-core operations, up 21% to $271.7 million (H1 2017: $224.2m). Strong growth across main product categories.  ¢   Total consolidated net income attributable to Chi-Med, unaffected by the TIS implementation, up 19% to $26.9 million (H1 2017: $22.7m), on an as adjusted (non-GAAP) basis which exclude one-time gains in H1 2017.INNOVATION PLATFORM   OPERATING HIGHLIGHTSThe points below summarize some of the pipeline development highlights so far this year. For more details, please refer to "Operations Review    Innovation Platform" below.Fruquintinib    Highly selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor ("TKI") of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ("VEGFR") 1/2/3: ¢   FRESCO China Phase III in third-line CRC, potentially best-in-class in terms of both efficacy and safety: • China NDA - substantial progress towards approval: nearing the end of the pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities stage of the NDA process, one of the last stages of the NDA process, and aiming to receive an approval in the second half of 2018;• JAMA publication: in June 2018, the full results were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association ("JAMA"), which we believe to be the first China-based novel oncology therapy trial to be published in the JAMA, another landmark achievement.• Two further analyses of FRESCO data presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology ("ASCO") in June 2018: subgroup analysis by prior anti-VEGF or anti-EGFR target therapy showed that fruquintinib had clinically meaningful benefits regardless of prior target therapy ("PTT") without observed cumulative toxicity; ad-hoc analysis of quality-adjusted time without symptoms or toxicity ("Q-TWiST") showed relative improvement of Q-TWiST with fruquintinib, representing a potentially clinically important quality-of-life benefit for patients; ¢   FALUCA China Phase III in third-line NSCLC: completed enrollment of 527 patients; expect to reach median overall survival ("OS") endpoint maturity and report top-line results in late 2018. ¢   FRUTIGA China Phase III in second-line gastric cancer: recruiting for clinical study in combination with Taxol® (paclitaxel) proceeding as planned, with an interim analysis intended in 2019. ¢   U.S. Phase I trial: enrolling as planned and intending to complete at the end of 2018, which would allow us to explore multiple innovative combination studies of fruquintinib and other TKIs, chemotherapy and immunotherapy agents in the U.S.Savolitinib    Highly selective TKI of mesenchymal epithelial transition factor ("c-MET")    Global Phase III studies underway or in planning: ¢   In MET Exon 14 mutation/deletion first-line NSCLC: while continuing to enroll patients in Phase II in China, we have reached an agreement with regulators regarding the conditions under which the existing trial could be sufficient for an NDA submission in China.  ¢   In EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC, following ongoing encouraging data in the TATTON Phase Ib/II trials of combinations with Tagrisso®, AstraZeneca is proceeding to:• In third-generation EGFR TKI-refractory (principally second-line and third-line after Tagrisso®) NSCLC: initiate the next stage of global clinical trials around the end of 2018;• In first-/second-generation EGFR TKI-refractory (principally second-line after Iressa®/ Tarceva®) NSCLC: initiate the next stage of global clinical trials in early 2019. ¢   SAVOIR global Phase III study in c-MET-driven PRCC enrolling patients at all sites now following its initiation in June 2017. ¢   PRCC molecular epidemiology study ("MES") progressing: 200+ patient tissue-sample diagnostic analysis likely to yield data by end of 2018, which we hope will highlight for regulatory authorities an unmet medical need in c-MET-driven PRCC. ¢   CALYPSO Phase II combinations with Imfinzi® programmed death-ligand 1 ("PD-L1") inhibitor: enrolled rapidly in H1 2018 and may complete enrollment in late 2018 and in mid-2019 in PRCC and clear cell renal cell carcinoma ("ccRCC") patients, respectively.Sulfatinib    Unique angio-immuno kinase inhibitor of VEGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor ("FGFR") 1, and colony stimulating factor-1 receptor ("CSF-1R"): ¢   Phase IIIs in neuroendocrine tumor ("NET"): enrollment continuing in the two Phase III studies in NET patients in China, with interim analysis expected for 2019; if results are positive, this could potentially be our first novel drug candidate to be launched by our own commercial team. ¢   U.S. Phase Ib/IIa expansion: enrolling pancreatic NET and biliary tract cancer ("BTC") patients, following the completion of the U.S. dose escalation stage and based on preliminary efficacy and safety data observed in these two indications in China.Further progress in early/proof-of-concept clinical trials, including: ¢   Epitinib Phase Ib/II in EGFR gene amplified glioblastoma: trial initiated in China in the first quarter of 2018 with epitinib, our unique EGFR inhibitor that has demonstrated the ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. ¢   HMPL-523 U.S. investigational new drug ("IND") clearance: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") approved our highly selective spleen TKI ("Syk") to progress into clinical trials in June 2018, which we plan to initiate in early 2019. ¢   HMPL004-6599 Australia Phase I initiated: proprietary botanical drug being developed by our 50/50 joint venture with NestleÌ initiated and completed the single ascending dose study in the first half of 2018. Phase II enabling non-clinical studies are being initiated.Expansion of U.S. and international operations, and recruitment of key personnel: ¢   New office in New Jersey: U.S./ex-Asia operations expanded to support our unpartnered compounds through proof-of-concept, registration trials, and market launch in territories outside of Asia. ¢   Key personnel recruited, including the U.S. Chief Medical Officer and Head of International Operations.Key potential pipeline milestones anticipated in the next 6-12 months ¢   Savolitinib: • Third-generation (Tagrisso®) EGFR-TKI refractory, c-MET gene amplified, NSCLC (both second-line and third-line): initiation of global study of savolitinib in combination with Tagrisso® in this rapidly growing patient population.• First-/second-generation (Iressa®/Tarceva®) EGFR-TKI refractory, c-MET gene amplified, T790M negative NSCLC (second-line): initiation of a global randomized, controlled study of savolitinib in combination with Tagrisso® along with multiple supporting clinical studies.• Presentation of preliminary Phase II data for savolitinib monotherapy in c-MET gene amplified gastric cancer and first-line MET Exon 14 mutation/deletion NSCLC.• Release of results of global PRCC MES and review of the potential Breakthrough Therapy opportunity in c-MET-driven PRCC.  ¢   Fruquintinib: • Aim to receive NDA approval in advanced CRC and launch in China, with our partner Lilly.• Release of top-line results for the FALUCA Phase III study in third-line NSCLC. ¢   Epitinib:  initiation of Phase III China registration study in first-line NSCLC patients with EGFR activating mutations and brain metastasis. ¢   HMPL-523:  presentation of preliminary safety and efficacy data from Phase I dose escalation study in hematological cancer in Australia and China. ¢   Immunotherapy combinations:  aim to take first steps to develop our VEGFR inhibitors, fruquintinib and sulfatinib, in combination with various programmed cell death protein-1 ("PD-1") antibodies in several solid tumor settings.COMMERCIAL PLATFORM   OPERATING HIGHLIGHTSThe points below summarize some of the operational and financial highlights of our Commercial Platform in the first half of 2018. For more details, please refer to "Operations Review   Commercial Platform" below.Scaled, high-performance drug marketing and distribution platform covering ~300 cites/towns in China with approximately 3,400 sales personnel. Targeting multiple indications with many household-name brands: ¢   Sales of our non-consolidated Prescription Drugs joint venture, Shanghai Hutchison Pharmaceuticals Limited ("SHPL") grew by 18% to $152.7 million (H1 2017: $129.7m). SHPL's main product, She Xiang Bao Xin ("SXBX") pill, an oral vasodilator and pro-angiogenesis prescription therapy approved to treat coronary artery disease, saw sales increase by 18% to $129.8 million.  ¢   Our consolidated Prescription Drugs business, operated through Hutchison Whampoa Sinopharm Pharmaceuticals (Shanghai) Company Limited ("Hutchison Sinopharm"), saw sales decrease by 21% to $68.0 million (H1 2017: $85.8m) as a result of the Chinese government's implementation of the new TIS, pursuant to which we had converted to earning service fees from the commercialization of certain third-party products instead of recognizing the gross sales from these products in our revenue as we had done prior to implementation of TIS in October 2017; despite the TIS change, service fees earned from key third-party products, such as anti-psychotic Seroquel®, grew rapidly, up 75% to $9.6 million (H1 2017: $5.5m). ¢   Sales of our non-consolidated Consumer Health joint venture, Hutchison Whampoa Guangzhou Baiyunshan Chinese Medicine Company Limited ("HBYS"), grew by 26% to $119.0m (H1 2017: $94.4m, excluding divested operations), driven by the elimination of production capacity constraints. ¢   Our consolidated Consumer Health sales increased by 14% to $20.6 million (H1 2017: $18.1m), resulting from higher volume in infant nutrition products.Simon To, Chairman of Chi-Med, said: "Chi-Med continues to deliver on its clear strategy of developing its broad pipeline and cultivating and growing its capabilities in global drug discovery and development, while maintaining an over a decade-and-a-half long track record of earnings growth in its Commercial Platform.During the first half of 2018, we have focused on navigating the China NDA process for fruquintinib, which we believe is now nearing completion. We are optimistic that we will see fruquintinib approved and launched by year end. We also look forward, around year end, to reporting the top-line results for the pivotal Phase III, the FALUCA study, of fruquintinib in third-line NSCLC in China.Our collaboration with AstraZeneca continues to gather momentum, and we are currently enrolling registration studies in both kidney and lung cancer indications for savolitinib monotherapy. We are also in the process of planning and preparing to initiate multiple additional studies in lung and gastric cancers, which we believe may ultimately serve as registration studies.Our un-partnered assets have also made good progress, with sulfatinib in two Phase III studies in China that could produce readout next year in NETs. In addition, we have worked with key opinion leaders and the regulatory authorities in China to agree on a Phase III pathway for epitinib and aim to initiate a pivotal study around year end. On our Syk, phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta ("PI3KÎ´") and FGFR compounds, all of which are in proof-of-concept, we have made meaningful progress in enrollment thereby acquiring a preliminary understanding of efficacy and safety for each compound. We expect to present some of these data at scientific conferences over the next twelve months.We are now looking closely into multiple opportunities to combine our highly selective TKIs with both PD-1 and PD-L1 immunotherapy agents and will strive to make progress during the second half of 2018, via collaboration, in this very high potential arena.We have expanded our U.S./ex-Asia operations, including our office in New Jersey, and continue to recruit seasoned talent to manage the progress of our unpartnered compounds through proof-of-concept, registration trials, and market launch in territories outside of Asia.Chi-Med has a clear and ambitious aim to bring three of our drugs through approval over the next approximately three years. We believe we are adequately structured and resourced to support this aim. In the longer term, we intend to continue to emerge as a world-class innovator based in China, bringing our assets to both the China and global markets. We have confidence in our ability to achieve these aims."Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures    References in this announcement to adjusted R&D expenses, adjusted consolidated net income attributable to Chi-Med from our Commercial Platform, adjusted consolidated operating profit from our Commercial Platform, adjusted consolidated net income attributable to Chi-Med from our Prescription Drugs business and adjusted revenue of HBYS and non-consolidated joint ventures are based on non-GAAP financial measures. Please see the "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliation" below for further information relevant to the interpretation of these financial measures and reconciliations of these financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, respectively.FINANCIAL GUIDANCE:Our updated guidance for 2018, compared to the most recent guidance in our full year results announcement for the year ended December 31, 2017 dated March 12, 2018, includes a $20 million increase in expected full year Innovation Platform R&D expense to $130-140 million. This increase reflects a rise in clinical trial spending as well as broadening of organizational scale and new middle management share-based incentive grants. These costs are all driven by the heightened competitive environment in China biotech, resulting from the step-change increase interest and investment in the sector over the past two years.

Revenue from the Commercial Platform decreased to $88.6 million (H1 2017: $103.9m) driven by the adoption of the TIS policy which caused our consolidated joint venture Hutchison Sinopharm to cease recognizing gross sales from certain third-party products and instead earn service fees from such sales in the first half of 2018. Revenue from the Innovation Platform decreased to $13.6 million in the first half of 2018 (H1 2017: $22.7m), reflecting similar levels of service fee payments from our partners as was received in the first half of 2017 but, no milestone payments were received in the first half of 2018 (H1 2017: $5.0m from AstraZeneca and $4.5m from Lilly). It should be noted that Group revenues do not include the revenues of our two large-scale, 50/50 joint ventures in China, SHPL and HBYS, since these are accounted for using the equity method.In the first half of 2018 our Commercial Platform, which continues to be an important profit and cash source for Chi-Med, grew operating profit by 22% to $31.0 million (H1 2017: $25.3m on an as adjusted (non-GAAP) basis excluding one-time gains of $2.5m) as a result of strong growth in SHPL's coronary artery disease Prescription Drug business, service fees on Seroquel® and Concor® and elimination of production capacity constraints on our Consumer Health businesses. The Innovation Platform incurred an operating loss of $53.1 million (H1 2017: -$14.8m) as a result of expansion of practically all aspects of our R&D organization and operations as well as clinical development of our pipeline of eight drug candidates.Net corporate unallocated expenses, primarily Chi-Med Group overhead and operating costs, declined to $4.9 million (H1 2017: $6.7m) mainly due to higher interest income from short-term investments.Consequently, Chi-Med Group's operating loss was $27.0 million (H1 2017: operating profit of $6.3m).The aggregate of interest and income tax expenses of Chi-Med Group, as well as net income attributable to non-controlling interests was $5.7 million (H1 2017: $4.6m) mainly due to higher profit taxes and an increase in the share of net income attributable to a non-controlling interest in the Commercial Platform.The resulting total Group net loss attributable to Chi-Med was $32.7 million (H1 2017: net income $1.7m).As a result, Group net loss attributable to Chi-Med in the first half of 2018 was $0.49 per ordinary share / $0.245 per American depositary share ("ADS"), compared to net income attributable to Chi-Med of $0.03 per ordinary share / $0.015 per ADS, in H1 2017.Cash and FinancingDuring the past two years, we have had a high degree of success in proof-of-concept studies on our eight clinical drug candidates, which has naturally resulted in a significant increase in investment. The scale of our late-stage clinical trial programs has expanded significantly, with a total of seven registration studies, either Phase III or Phase II registration intent studies, either underway or completing. We plan for four additional registration studies to start in late 2018/early 2019 as well as to continue early development Phase Ib/II studies in approximately 20 Target Patient Populations ("TPPs").We have, and will continue to try to partially offset increasing clinical investment with cash generated in our operating activities from dividends paid by our non-consolidated Commercial Platform joint ventures, as well as payments received from AstraZeneca, Lilly, and NSP, our joint venture with NestlÃ©. In aggregate, in the first half of 2018, these helped offset a meaningful portion of the $66.7 million (H1 2017: $37.5m) in R&D expenses on an as adjusted (non-GAAP) basis.As of June 30, 2018, we had available cash resources of $416.9 million (December 31, 2017: $479.6m) at the Chi-Med Group level including cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $322.5 million (December 31, 2017: $358.3m) and unutilized bank borrowing facilities of $94.4 million (December 31, 2017: $121.3m). In addition, as of June 30, 2018, our non-consolidated joint ventures (SHPL, HBYS and NSP) held $62.5 million (December 31, 2017: $67.0m) in available cash resources.Outstanding bank loans as of June 30, 2018 amounted to $26.7 million (December 31, 2017: $30.0m) at the Chi-Med Group level, with a weighted average cost of borrowing in the first half of 2018 of 2.33% (year ended December 31, 2017: 1.90%). As of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, our non-consolidated joint ventures had no outstanding bank loans.In summary, we believe that the cash resources that we currently hold are sufficient to fund all our near-term activities, including the full development of our clinical drug pipeline into 2020.OPERATIONS REVIEWINNOVATION PLATFORMThe Chi-Med pipeline of drug candidates has been created and developed by the in-house R&D operation which was started in 2002. Since then, we have built a large team of about 390 scientists and staff (June 30, 2017: 330) based in China and are operating a fully-integrated drug discovery and development operation covering chemistry, biology, pharmacology, toxicology, chemistry and manufacturing controls for clinical and commercial supply, clinical and regulatory and other functions. Looking ahead, we plan to continue to build and leverage this platform, as we have in the past decade, to produce a stream of novel drug candidates with global potential.Innovation Platform revenue in the first half of 2018 was $13.6 million (H1 2017: $22.7m) reflecting generally similar levels of service fees and clinical cost reimbursements received from AstraZeneca and Lilly to those received in the first half of last year. Revenue in the first half of 2017 also included milestone payments from AstraZeneca and Lilly for the start of the savolitinib Phase III clinical trial in PRCC ($5.0m) and the submission of the first fruquintinib NDA ($4.5m). We did not receive any milestone payments in the first half of 2018.In the first half of 2018 we granted options to purchase on over 870,000 ordinary shares to over 40 members, primarily of the Innovation Platform middle management team, an important step to broaden equity participation among the future leaders of the company. The non-cash expense for these grants totaled $20.4 million and will be amortized over four years, with $7.1 million expected to be expensed in 2018.Net loss attributable to Chi-Med increased to $52.9 million (H1 2017: -$14.8m) mainly from increased R&D expenses of $66.7 million (H1 2017: $37.5m) on an as adjusted (non-GAAP) basis driven by expansion of clinical development activities, the aforementioned organization growth and new share-based incentives, as well as further investment in the expansion of small molecule manufacturing operations.Since inception, the Innovation Platform has dosed over 4,000 patients/subjects in clinical trials of our drug candidates with over 400 dosed in the first half of 2018 primarily as a result of enrollment in the seven registration studies that we had underway during the period.U.S. and International Operations Expanded In the second quarter of 2018, we commenced operations of Hutchison MediPharma (US) Inc. at our new U.S. offices in Florham Park, New Jersey. While we have been conducting clinical and non-clinical development in North America and Europe for over a decade, the activities conducted by this new U.S. office will support our growth strategy outside of China and significantly broaden and scale our non-Asia clinical development and international operations. As part of this strategy, we recruited two experienced senior personnel, namely the U.S. Chief Medical Officer, and the Head of International Operations. They will support our expansion of clinical development and regulatory activities outside Asia, including initiating and managing Phase II trials of fruquintinib, sulfatinib and HMPL-523 in the U.S. and preparing for the commercial launch of fruquintinib and sulfatinib outside of mainland China, if approved.Product Pipeline ProgressSAVOLITINIB (AZD6094)Savolitinib is a potential first-in-class inhibitor of c-MET, an enzyme which has been shown to function abnormally in many types of solid tumors. We designed savolitinib to be a potent and highly selective oral inhibitor, which, through chemical structure modification, addresses human metabolite-related renal toxicity, the primary issue that halted development of several other selective c-MET inhibitors. In clinical studies to date, involving over 700 patients, savolitinib has shown promising signs of clinical efficacy in patients with c-MET gene alterations in PRCC, NSCLC, CRC and gastric cancer with an acceptable safety profile. We are currently testing savolitinib in partnership with AstraZeneca in multiple Phase Ib/II studies, both as a monotherapy and in combinations. Two registration studies, one in kidney and one in lung cancer, are underway and several additional studies, that we believe could ultimately serve as registration studies, are expected to start over the next 6-12 months.Savolitinib    Kidney cancer:  High proportion of MET-driven patients. The table below shows a summary of the clinical studies that we have underway for savolitinib in kidney cancer patients.TPPName, Line, Patient FocusTherapySitesPhaseStatus1SAVOIR: 1L/2L c-MET-driven PRCCSavolitinib monotherapyGlobalIIIInitiated Q2 2017Est. enrolled YE 2019N/AMES: PRCC epidemiology studyN/A    diagnosticGlobalN/AEst. completed YE 20182PAPMET: PRCCSavolitinib vs. sunitinib vs. cabozantinib vs. crizotinibUS(NCI)IIEst. enrolled YE 20193CALYPSO: PRCCSavolitinib and Imfinzi®UK/SpainIIEst. enrolled YE 20184CALYPSO: 2L ccRCC (VEGFR TKI refractory)Savolitinib monotherapyUK/SpainIIEst. enrolled H1 20195CALYPSO: 2L ccRCC (VEGFR TKI refractory)Savolitinib and Imfinzi®UK/SpainIIEst. enrolled H1 2019 TPP 1    Enrolling (NCT03091192)    Phase III PRCC savolitinib once daily ("QD") monotherapy (Global)    A global Phase III registration study, the SAVOIR study, of savolitinib versus Sutent® in c-MET-driven metastatic PRCC patients was initiated in June 2017. The primary endpoint for efficacy in the SAVOIR study is median progression free survival ("PFS"), with secondary endpoints of OS, objective response rate ("ORR"), duration of response ("DoR") and disease control rate ("DCR"). All clinical trial site initiations in six countries were completed early this year, and we expect enrollment to complete around the end of 2019.The MES is ongoing, whereby archived tissue samples from over 200 PRCC patients are being screened using our companion diagnostic to identify c-MET-driven disease. We expect this global MES to contribute to developing a more comprehensive understanding of the role of c-MET-driven disease in PRCC. Historical medical records from these patients will then be used to determine if c-MET-driven disease is predictive of worse outcome, in terms of PFS and OS, in PRCC patients. If this is proven to be the case, we will consider engaging in discussions regarding Breakthrough Therapy potential with the FDA. We expect to have the full MES data by the end of 2018, and could present it at a major scientific conference in 2019.TPP 2    Enrolling (NCT02761057)    Phase II study of multiple TKIs in metastatic PRCC (U.S.)    A Phase II study, sponsored by the U.S. National Cancer Institute, and named the PAPMET study, to assess the efficacy of multiple TKIs in metastatic PRCC including Sutent®; Cabometyx® (cabozantinib); Xalkori® (crizotinib) and savolitinib. PAPMET began enrolling patients in 2016, and is expected to enroll about 180 patients in over 70 locations in the U.S. The savolitinib arm of the study is over a third enrolled and is expected to complete enrollment in 2019.TPP 3, TPP 4 and TPP 5    Enrolling (NCT02819596)    Phase II study of savolitinib monotherapy and in combination with Imfinzi® (anti-PD-L1) in both PRCC and ccRCC patients (U.K./Spain)    A dose finding study began in 2016, named the CALYPSO study, at St. Bartholomew's Hospital in London, to assess safety/tolerability of savolitinib and Imfinzi® combination therapy as well as preliminary efficacy of savolitinib as a monotherapy or combination therapy in several c-MET-driven kidney cancer patient populations. During 2016, the dose-finding phase of the CALYPSO study successfully established the combination dose of savolitinib and Imfinzi® and the study moved onto the Phase II expansion stage in PRCC and ccRCC patients in the U.K. and Spain to further explore efficacy. Patient recruitment moved rapidly in the first half of 2018. Enrollment for PRCC patients is expected to complete in the second half of 2018 and for ccRCC patients in the first half of 2019.Savolitinib    Lung cancer:  We believe this is Savolitinib's largest market opportunity. The table below shows a summary of the clinical studies that we have underway for savolitinib in lung cancer patients.TPPName, Line, Patient FocusTherapySitesPhaseStatus6TATTON: NSCLC 1st/2nd-gen EGFR TKI refractorySavolitinib and Tagrisso®GlobalIb/IINext trial est. start H1 20197TATTON: NSCLC 3rd-gen EGFR TKI refractorySavolitinib and Tagrisso®GlobalIb/IINext trial est. start YE 201882L NSCLC, EGFR TKI refractorySavolitinib and Iressa®ChinaIb/IINext trial in discussion with partner AstraZeneca91L NSCLCSavolitinib monotherapyChinaIIEnrollment complete10MET Exon 14 mutation/deletion NSCLCSavolitinib monotherapyChinaIIRegistration intent. Enrolling Tagrisso® combinations: In 2016, we initiated a global Phase Ib/II expansion study in NSCLC, the TATTON (Part B) study, aiming to recruit sufficient c-MET gene amplified patients, who had progressed after prior treatment with a first/second-generation TKI (e.g. Iressa®/Tarceva®), to support a decision on global Phase II/III registration strategy. In this first/second-generation EGFR TKI refractory NSCLC population, we estimate that c-MET gene amplification occurs in 15-20% of patients, while the T790M mutation occurs in approximately 45-70% of patients. TATTON (Part B) also included patients who subsequently developed resistance to third-generation EGFR TKIs (primarily Tagrisso®). Preliminary data was presented in October 2017 at World Conference on Lung Cancer ("WCLC") (as described below). TATTON (Part B) continued to enroll and further data, including PFS, is expected to be presented at a scientific conference in the future. Other parallel studies, TATTON (Part C) and TATTON (Part D), were initiated in 2017 and will further broaden our data set in the 400mg (Japan only) and 300mg QD dose, respectively, over the balance of 2018 and early 2019. Earlier this year, AstraZeneca decided to progress onto the next stage of development of two separate indications, and planning for each is underway as described below (TPP 7 & TPP 6).TPP 7    Enrolling (NCT02143466)    Phase Ib/II NSCLC (second- or third-line 3rd-generation EGFR TKI- (primarily Tagrisso®) refractory), savolitinib (600mg QD) in combination with Tagrisso® (Global)    Data presented in June 2017 at ASCO, by Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center ("HMS/MGH"), showed that about 30% (7/23 patients) of Tagrisso® resistant NSCLC patients harbor c-MET gene amplification. This patient population is generally heavily pre-treated and highly complex from a molecular analysis standpoint, with the HMS/MGH study showing that more than half the c-MET gene amplification patients also harbored additional genetic alterations, including but not limited to EGFR gene amplification. At the 2017 WCLC, preliminary TATTON (Part B) study data included 30 evaluable patients previously treated with third-generation T790M-directed EGFR inhibitors, primarily Tagrisso®. Confirmed partial response ("PRs") were observed in 10/30 (ORR 33%) of these patients, which was as expected given the additional driver genes at work post Tagrisso® monotherapy failure. We believe that the savolitinib/Tagrisso® combination is an important treatment option for these late-stage c-MET gene amplified patients who have no remaining targeted treatment alternatives. Moreover, the FDA and the European Commission approved Tagrisso® for first-line treatment of EGFR-mutation NSCLC in April and June 2018, respectively, and as such the need for treatment following Tagrisso® is expected to increase.Encouraged by the above-mentioned data and recent approvals of Tagrisso®, AstraZeneca has decided to prioritize proceeding with development of savolitinib in NSCLC for patients that are refractory to third-generation EGFR TKI by the end of 2018. This will start out as a single-arm, Phase II study for savolitinib (600mg, 300mg if <55kg QD) and Tagrisso® (80mg QD).TPP 6    Enrolling (NCT02143466)    Phase Ib/II expansion NSCLC (second-line 1st/2nd-generation EGFR TKI-refractory), savolitinib in combination with Tagrisso® (Global)    At the 2017 WCLC, preliminary TATTON (Part B) study data included 34 evaluable patients who showed confirmed PRs in 14/23 (ORR 61%) of T790M mutation negative patients, as well as confirmed PRs in 6/11 (55% ORR) of T790M mutation positive patients.Planning is now underway for a global randomized controlled study of the savolitinib plus Tagrisso® combination in this TPP 6, first/second-generation EGFR TKI-refractory (Iressa®/Tarceva®), c-MET-driven, T790M mutation-negative NSCLC patients. This will also start out as a Phase II study and is currently targeted to start in H1 2019.Other lung cancer populations:TPP 8    Completed (NCT02374645)    Phase II NSCLC (second-line), EGFR TKI-refractory, savolitinib in combination with Iressa® (China)    We continue to discuss how this combination can be further developed.TPP 9 and TPP 10    Enrollment Completed and Enrolling (NCT01985555 / NCT02897479)    Phase II c-MET-driven NSCLC, savolitinib monotherapy (China)    Phase II studies of savolitinib are ongoing in NSCLC focusing on patients with c-MET-driven disease. These are NSCLC patients with MET Exon 14 mutation/deletion who have failed prior systemic therapy, or are unwilling or unable to receive chemotherapy. Following recent regulatory dialogue and a subsequent protocol amendment, we expect that this study, if successful, would be sufficient to support an NDA submission in China. Preliminary data in these TPPs may be presented at a major scientific conference in 2019.Savolitinib    Gastric cancer:  multiple Phase II studies underway in Asia in c-MET-driven patients.Phase II gastric cancer studies are ongoing in China as well as the VIKTORY umbrella study, being run at the Samsung Medical Center in South Korea, in which savolitinib is represented in three out of the twelve treatment arms. As at the latest report in 2017, a total of over 850 gastric cancer patients had been screened in these studies and those patients with confirmed c-MET-driven disease are being treated with either savolitinib monotherapy or savolitinib in combination with Taxotere®. Presentations of preliminary data from these studies were made in 2017 at the annual meetings of the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology ("CSCO") (China Phase II, 441 patients screened) and ASCO (VIKTORY Phase II, 438 patients screened), with about 5.1% of patients determined to have c-MET gene amplification. The table below shows a summary of the clinical studies that we have underway for savolitinib in gastric cancer patients.TPPName, Line, Patient FocusTherapySitesPhaseStatus11Gastric cancer (c-MET gene amplification) and VIKTORY (in South Korea)Savolitinib monotherapyChina & South KoreaIIEnrolling12VIKTORY: Gastric cancer (c-MET over-expression)Savolitinib and Taxotere®South KoreaIIEnrolling13VIKTORY: Gastric cancer (c-MET gene amplification)Savolitinib and Taxotere®South KoreaIIEnrolling TPP 11    Enrolling (South Korea (NCT02449551) / China (NCT01985555))    Phase II gastric cancer, savolitinib monotherapy, patients with c-MET gene amplification (South Korea/China)    Preliminary results were presented at the CSCO 2017 conference for the efficacy evaluable c-MET gene amplified patients in China. This China study concluded that savolitinib monotherapy demonstrated promising anti-tumor efficacy in gastric cancer patients with c-MET gene amplification, and the potential benefit to these patients clearly warrants further exploration, including continuing enrollment for a Phase II study in China. The VIKTORY Phase II study is ongoing in c-MET gene amplified patients in South Korea, and preliminary data may be presented at a major scientific conference in the second half of 2018 or in 2019.TPP 12 and TPP 13    Enrolling (NCT02447380 / NCT02447406)    Phase II studies of savolitinib in combination with Taxotere® in c-MET over-expression or c-MET gene amplification gastric cancer (South Korea)    Phase II studies are underway to assess safety/tolerability of savolitinib and Taxotere® combination as well as preliminary efficacy of the combination therapy in both c-MET gene amplified patients and, the approximately 40% of gastric cancer patients who harbor c-MET over-expression. The VIKTORY Phase II is ongoing in South Korea in TPP 12 and 13, with preliminary data may be presented at a major scientific conference in the second half of 2018 or in 2019.Savolitinib    Prostate cancer: The table below shows a summary of the clinical study that we have underway for savolitinib in prostate cancer patients.TPPName, Line, Patient FocusTherapySitesPhaseStatus14Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate CancerSavolitinib monotherapyCanadaIIEnrolling TPP 14    Enrolling (NCT03385655)    Phase II study in patients with metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer ("mCRPC") (Canada)    study sponsored by the Canadian Cancer Trials Group is designed to determine the effect of savolitinib on prostate-specific antigen ("PSA") decline and time to PSA progression, ORR as determined by RECIST 1.1 criteria, the safety and toxicity profile of savolitinib in mCRPC patients, as well as any potential predictive and prognostic factors. The umbrella study targets to enroll around 500 patients into six treatment arms based on molecular status, with one treatment arm being patients with aberrant c-MET activation who will receive savolitinib. High levels of c-MET over-expression can be prevalent in prostate cancer patients.FRUQUINTINIB (HMPL-013)Fruquintinib is a highly selective and potent oral inhibitor of VEGFR 1/2/3 that was designed to be a global best-in-class VEGFR inhibitor for many types of solid tumors. Fruquintinib's unique kinase selectivity has been shown to reduce off-target toxicity thereby allowing for better target coverage, as well as possible use in combination with other agents such as chemotherapies, targeted therapies and immunotherapies. We believe these are points of meaningful differentiation compared to other approved small molecule VEGFR inhibitors, such as Sutent®, Nexavar® (sorafenib) and Stivarga®, and can potentially significantly expand the use and global market potential of fruquintinib.We believe that fruquintinib is the first home-grown, China-discovered and developed drug candidate in a mainstream oncology indication to succeed in a pivotal Phase III registration trial. There are three pivotal Phase III trials (the FRESCO, FALUCA and FRUTIGA studies) currently underway or completing in China. Our first ever NDA in China for third-line CRC (the FRESCO study) is near the end of the approval application process. We have also completed enrollment in third-line NSCLC (the FALUCA study) and are enrolling patients in a study in combination with Taxol® in second-line gastric cancer (the FRUTIGA study). Furthermore, a Phase II study in combination with Iressa® in first-line EGFR activating mutation NSCLC is ongoing, following encouraging preliminary results presented at the 2017 WCLC. We also expect a Phase I study of fruquintinib in the U.S. to complete by the end of 2018, which will represent the first step in the development of fruquintinib outside China. In China, fruquintinib is jointly developed with Lilly, our commercial partner. The table below shows a summary of the clinical studies that we have underway for fruquintinib.TPPName, Line, Patient FocusTherapySitesPhaseStatus15FRESCO: 3L CRCFruquintinib monotherapyChinaIIIPending NDA approval16FALUCA: 3L NSCLCFruquintinib monotherapyChinaIIIEnrollment completeTop-line data YE 2018171L NSCLCFruquintinib and Iressa®ChinaIIEnrollment complete18Solid tumorsFruquintinib monotherapyUSIEst. complete YE 201819FRUTIGA: 2L gastric cancerFruquintinib and Taxol®ChinaIIIInitiated Oct 2017 TPP 15    NDA submitted June 2017 (NCT02314819)    Phase III study in CRC (third-line), fruquintinib monotherapy (China)    Since completing submission of the NDA to the China National Drug Administration ("CNDA", formerly the China Food and Drug Administration) in June 2017, we have engaged the CNDA's Center for Drug Evaluation to conduct reviews in the areas of pharmacology and toxicity, clinical data and statistical analysis, and chemistry, manufacturing and control of standards and process. We have also facilitated the conduct of clinical site visits including Good Clinical Practice and Good Laboratory Practice inspections, and the pre-approval inspections ("PAIs") for our active pharmaceutical ingredient contract manufacturer as well as the PAI and Good Manufacturing Practice ("GMP") certification process for our Suzhou formulation facility. We hope to receive an approval from the CNDA on our NDA in the second half of 2018.Following the initial presentation of FRESCO, a pivotal Phase III study in 416 patients with locally advanced or metastatic CRC disease that progressed following at least two prior systemic chemotherapies, at the 2017 ASCO annual meeting, two further analyses were subsequently presented at the 2018 ASCO annual meeting. Firstly, the results of a subgroup analysis by prior anti-VEGF or anti-EGFR target therapy in FRESCO showed that fruquintinib had clinically meaningful benefits in third-line metastatic CRC patients regardless of PTT without observed cumulative toxicity. This subgroup analysis result is consistent with the previously reported FRESCO intent-to-treatment population result. Secondly, an ad-hoc analysis aiming to compare the quality-adjusted survival between the two arms of the FRESCO study using Q-TWiST showed that the relative improvement of Q-TWiST observed represents a clinically important quality-of-life benefit for metastatic CRC patients.In addition, in June 2018, the JAMA published the full results of the FRESCO study. We believe that this is the first time that the JAMA has ever published novel oncology therapy results from China, a testament to the quality of the FRESCO study design, execution, and result.TPP 16    Enrollment complete (NCT02691299)    Phase III study of fruquintinib monotherapy in third-line NSCLC (China)    Following a positive Phase II study comparing fruquintinib with placebo in advanced non-squamous NSCLC patients who have failed two prior systemic chemotherapies, we initiated a Phase III registration study, the FALUCA study, in December 2015. Results of the Phase II study were presented at the 2016 WCLC and have been published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. In February 2018, we completed enrollment of the FALUCA study in China, in which a total of 527 patients were randomized at a 2:1 ratio to receive either fruquintinib or placebo plus best supportive care. The primary endpoint for the FALUCA study is OS, with secondary endpoints including PFS, ORR, DCR and DoR. We expect to reach median OS endpoint maturity and report top-line results in late 2018.TPP 17    Enrollment complete (NCT02976116)    Phase II study of fruquintinib in combination with Iressa® in first-line NSCLC (China)    In early 2017, we initiated a multi-center, single-arm, open-label, dose-finding Phase II study of fruquintinib in combination with Iressa® in the first-line setting for patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR activating mutations. We have enrolled about 50 patients in this study with the objective to evaluate the safety and tolerability as well as efficacy of the combination therapy. Preliminary data was presented at the 2017 WCLC, showing an encouraging efficacy and safety profile.Fruquintinib's unique safety and tolerability profile, resulting from its high kinase selectivity, combined with better flexibility to manage treatment emergent toxicities due to its shorter half-life than monoclonal antibody anti-angiogenesis therapies, makes it a very high potential combination partner for EGFR-TKIs.TPP 18    Enrolling (NCT03251378)    Phase I fruquintinib monotherapy in advanced solid tumors (U.S.)    In December 2017, we initiated a multi-center, open-label, Phase I clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics ("PK") of fruquintinib in U.S. patients with solid tumors. Upon completion, likely at the end of 2018, our intention is to begin exploring multiple innovative combination studies of fruquintinib and other TKIs, chemotherapy and immunotherapy agents in the U.S.Recent innovations in solid tumor drugs have focused on targeted therapies and immunotherapies which, as monotherapies, have both delivered improved outcomes for patients. Our proof-of-concept studies have already demonstrated the benefits of TKI combinations with other TKIs or with chemotherapy, and immunotherapy combinations will also be included. As unique next-generation anti-angiogenesis VEGFR TKIs, fruquintinib (with its uniquely selective profile) and sulfatinib (with its inhibition of tumor-associated macrophages, facilitating PD-1 induced immune response) represent ideal candidates for combination with immunotherapy agents such as PD-1/L1 inhibitors to extend the duration of these benefits and expand them to more patients. This hypothesis was recently demonstrated at this year's ASCO annual meeting relating to the combination of Inlyta® (axitinib) and Keytruda® (pembrolizumab) in first-line ccRCC in 52 patients, which yielded an ORR of 73% vs. 34% and 38% for Inlyta® or Keytruda® monotherapy, respectively.TPP 19    Enrolling (NCT03223376)    Phase III study of fruquintinib in combination with Taxol® in gastric cancer (second-line) (China)    In October 2017, we initiated the FRUTIGA study, a randomized, double-blind, Phase III study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fruquintinib combined with Taxol® compared with Taxol® monotherapy for second-line treatment of advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, in patients who had failed first-line standard 5-flourouracil-based chemotherapy. A total of over 500 patients are expected to be enrolled into the FRUTIGA study at a 1:1 ratio. The primary endpoint is OS, with secondary endpoints including PFS, ORR, DCR and quality-of-life score. Biomarkers related to the anti-tumor activity of fruquintinib will also be explored. We intend to conduct an interim analysis of the FRUTIGA study for futility, sometime during mid-2019.SULFATINIB (HMPL-012)Sulfatinib is an oral drug candidate with a unique angio-immuno kinase profile which provides both effects on anti-angiogenesis and effects on enhancing the body's immune system, specifically T-cells. In addition to suppressing angiogenesis through inhibiting VEGFR and FGFR1, sulfatinib is a potent inhibitor of CSF-1R, a signaling pathway involved in blocking the activation of tumor-associated macrophages. Sulfatinib is the first oncology candidate that we have taken through proof-of-concept in China and subsequently started clinical development in the U.S. We are currently conducting studies in six TPPs on sulfatinib and retain all rights to sulfatinib worldwide. A summary of these clinical studies is shown in the table below.TPPName, Line, Patient FocusTherapySitesPhaseStatus20SANET-p: Pancreatic NETSulfatinib monotherapyChinaIIIEst. enrolled 201921SANET-ep: Non-pancreatic NETSulfatinib monotherapyChinaIIIEst. enrolled 201922Pancreatic NET and BTCSulfatinib monotherapyUSIb/IIEnrolling23Thyroid cancer (Recurrent/refractory MTC)Sulfatinib monotherapyChinaIIEnrollment complete24Thyroid cancer (RAI-refractory DTC)Sulfatinib monotherapyChinaIIEnrollment complete25Chemotherapy refractory BTCSulfatinib monotherapyChinaIIEnrolling TPP 20    Enrolling (NCT02589821)    Phase III in pancreatic NET patients (China)    In 2016, we initiated the SANET-p study, which is a pivotal Phase III study in patients with low- or intermediate-grade, advanced pancreatic NET. Patients are randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either sulfatinib or placebo, on a 28-day treatment cycle. The primary endpoint is PFS, with secondary endpoints including ORR, DCR, time to response, DoR, safety and tolerability. We expect to complete enrollment in 2019 and present top-line results thereafter.TPP 21    Enrolling (NCT02588170)    Phase III in non-pancreatic NET patients (China)    In December 2015, we initiated the SANET-ep study, which is a pivotal Phase III study in patients with low or intermediate grade advanced non-pancreatic NET. Patients are randomized at a 2:1 ratio to receive either sulfatinib or placebo, on a 28-day treatment cycle. The primary endpoint is PFS, with secondary endpoints including ORR, DCR, time to response, DoR, safety and tolerability. We expect to complete enrollment in 2019 and present top-line results thereafter.TPP 22    Enrolling (NCT02549937)    Phase Ib/II in pancreatic NET and BTC patients (U.S.)    A Phase I dose escalation study in advanced solid tumor patients in the U.S. completed at the end of the first half of 2018, having confirmed the 300mg QD recommended Phase II dose. Earlier in July 2018, we initiated a U.S. multi-arm Phase Ib/II study to explore efficacy and safety in both pancreatic NET and BTC patients.TPP 23 and TPP 24    Enrollment complete (NCT02614495)    Phase II study in recurrent/refractory thyroid cancer patients (China)    In 2016, we began an open-label, Phase II proof-of-concept study in patients with recurrent/refractory medullary thyroid cancer ("MTC") or radioactive iodine ("RAI")-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer ("DTC") in China where there are few safe and effective treatment options. In June 2017, we presented preliminary Phase II data at ASCO 2017 conference showing that at the time of data cut-off, a total of 18 patients had been enrolled, and treated with sulfatinib, with preliminary data showing that confirmed PRs were reported in 3/10 (30.0% ORR) RAI-refractory DTC patients and 1/6 (16.7% ORR) MTC patients, and all other patients were reported as stable disease.TPP 25    Enrolling (NCT02966821)    Phase II study in chemotherapy refractory BTC patients (China)    In early 2017, we began a Phase II proof-of-concept study in patients with BTC, a heterogeneous group of rare malignancies arising from the biliary tract epithelia and the gallbladder. We see a major unmet medical need for patients who have progressed while on chemotherapy, and believe that sulfatinib may offer a new targeted treatment option in this tumor type. Planning for a Phase III pivotal study in China in this TPP is now underway.EPITINIB (HMPL-813)A significant portion of NSCLC patients, estimated at approximately 10-15%, have developed brain metastasis by the time of first diagnosis and eventually approximately 50% of NSCLC patients are estimated to develop brain metastasis. Patients with brain metastasis have a dismal prognosis and a poor quality of life with limited treatment options. Epitinib is a potent and highly selective oral EGFR inhibitor which has demonstrated brain penetration and efficacy in both pre-clinical and clinical studies. EGFR inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of NSCLC with EGFR activating mutations. However, approved EGFR inhibitors such as Iressa® and Tarceva® cannot penetrate the blood-brain barrier effectively, leaving the majority of patients with brain metastasis without an effective targeted therapy. We currently retain all rights to epitinib worldwide. The table below shows a summary of the clinical studies that we have underway for epitinib.TPPName, Line, Patient FocusTherapySitesPhaseStatus26EGFR-mutation NSCLC with brain metastasisEpitinib monotherapyChinaIbEnrollingPh.

For EGFR TKI naÃ¯ve patients treated with epitinib 160mg QD dose, ORR was in the range of 60-70% (including confirmed and unconfirmed PRs), with a tolerable safety profile. During the first half of 2018, we continued to enroll patients in this Phase Ib study and, as a result of our recent dialogue with regulators, are planning to initiate a Phase III study in late 2018.TPP 27    Enrolling (NCT03231501)    Phase Ib/II study in glioblastoma    Glioblastoma is a primary brain cancer that harbors high levels of EGFR gene amplification. In March 2018, we initiated a Phase Ib/II study multi-center, single-arm, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of epitinib as a monotherapy in patients with EGFR gene amplified, histologically confirmed glioblastoma. The primary endpoint is ORR.THELIATINIB (HMPL-309)Theliatinib is a novel molecule EGFR inhibitor under investigation for the treatment of solid tumors. Tumors with wild-type EGFR activation, for instance, through gene amplification or protein over-expression, are less sensitive to current EGFR TKIs, Iressa® and Tarceva®, due to their sub-optimal binding affinity. Theliatinib has been designed with strong affinity to the wild-type EGFR kinase and has been shown to be five to ten times more potent than Tarceva®. Consequently, we believe that theliatinib could benefit patients with tumor-types with a high incidence of wild-type EGFR activation. This is notable in certain cancer types such as esophageal cancer, where 8-30% of patients harbors EGFR gene amplification and 30-90% EGFR over-expression. We currently retain all rights to theliatinib worldwide. The table below shows a summary of the clinical studies that we have underway for theliatinib.TPPName, Line, Patient FocusTherapySitesPhaseStatus28Solid tumorsTheliatinib monotherapyChinaICompleted29Esophageal cancerTheliatinib monotherapyChinaIbEnrolling\TPP 28    Completed (NCT02601274)    Phase I study of theliatinib monotherapy in solid tumors (China)    At the 2017 CSCO conference, we presented results from the Phase I study of the safety and preliminary anti-tumor activity of theliatinib. Results showed that doses up to 500mg QD were determined to be safe and well-tolerated, with no dose limiting toxicities or maximum tolerated dose established. The study concluded that further development of theliatinib 400mg QD amongst esophageal cancer patients with EGFR over-expression was warranted (TPP 29).TPP 29    Enrolling (NCT02601274)    Phase Ib expansion theliatinib monotherapy in esophageal cancer (China)    In early 2017, we began a Phase Ib proof-of-concept expansion study of theliatinib in esophageal cancer patients with EGFR protein over-expression or gene amplification. This study is now in the process of expanding through the opening of additional clinical sites in China.HMPL-523HMPL-523 is a potential best-in-class oral inhibitor targeting Syk, a key protein involved in B-cell signaling. Modulation of the B-cell signaling system has proven to have significant potential for the treatment of certain chronic diseases in immunology, such as rheumatoid arthritis, immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) or lupus, as well as hematological cancers where it is a potential first-in-class compound. We currently retain all rights to HMPL-523 worldwide. The table below shows a summary of the clinical studies that we have underway for HMPL-523.TPPName, Line, Patient FocusTherapySitesPhaseStatus30Immunology (healthy volunteers)HMPL-523 monotherapyAustraliaICompleted31Immunology (healthy volunteers)HMPL-523 monotherapyChinaIInitiating32Hematological cancersHMPL-523 monotherapyAustraliaIEnrolling33LymphomaHMPL-523 monotherapyChinaIEnrolling TPP 30 and TPP 31    Completed (NCT02105129)    Phase I study (healthy volunteers) (Australia/China)    We believe HMPL-523, as an oral drug candidate, has advantages over intravenous monoclonal antibody immune modulators in rheumatoid arthritis in that small molecule compounds can be taken orally and have shorter half-lives, thereby reducing the risk of infections from sustained suppression of the immune system. The Phase I dose escalation study showed HMPL-523 exhibited a tolerable safety profile, with data presented in full at the 2016 American College of Rheumatology conference. Off-target toxicities such as diarrhea and hypertension, seen with the first-generation Syk inhibitor fostamatinib, were not observed. In addition to tolerable safety, this Phase I dose escalation study evaluated the PK and pharmacodynamic ("PD") profile of HMPL-523.TPP 32 and TPP 33    Enrolling (NCT02503033 / NCT02857998)    Phase I study of HMPL-523 in hematological cancers (Australia/China)    In early 2016, we initiated a Phase I dose escalation study of HMPL-523 in Australia in hematological cancer patients and have completed seven dose cohorts. China Phase I began in early 2017 and completed five dose cohorts. Recommended Phase II doses have been determined and dose expansion studies have initiated in both Australia and China. Since early 2018, we have been increasing the number of active clinical sites, now totaling 13, in Australia and China to support a large dose expansion program in a broad range of hematological cancers. These include, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, small lymphocytic lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We target to present dose escalation results, including preliminary proof-of-concept data, at a major scientific conference later in 2018 or in 2019. Our U.S. IND application for HMPL-523 was cleared by the FDA at the end of June 2018 and we are now planning Phase II development.HMPL-689HMPL-689 is a novel, potential best-in-class, highly selective and potent small molecule inhibitor targeting the isoform PI3KÎ´, a key component in the B-cell receptor signaling pathway. We have designed HMPL-689 with superior PI3KÎ´ isoform selectivity. HMPL-689's PK properties have been found to be favorable with good oral absorption, moderate tissue distribution and low clearance in preclinical PK studies. We also expect that HMPL-689 will have low risk of drug accumulation and drug-to-drug interaction. We currently retain all rights to HMPL-689 worldwide. The table below shows a summary of the clinical studies that we have underway for HMPL-689.TPPName, Line, Patient FocusTherapySitesPhaseStatus34Healthy volunteersHMPL-689 monotherapyAustraliaICompleted35LymphomaHMPL-689 monotherapyChinaIInitiated August 2017 TPP 34 and TPP 35    Enrolling (NCT026316 / NCT03128164)    Phase I dose escalation (Australia/China)    In 2016, we completed a Phase I dose escalation study in Australia in healthy adult volunteers to evaluate HMPL-689's PK and safety profile following single oral dosing. Results were as expected with linear PK properties and tolerable safety profile. We subsequently initiated a Phase I dose escalation and expansion study in patients with hematologic malignancies in China in August 2017.HMPL-453HMPL-453 is a novel, potentially first-in-class, highly selective and potent small molecule inhibitor that targets FGFR 1/2/3, a sub-family of receptor tyrosine kinases. Aberrant FGFR signaling has been found to be a driving force in tumor growth, promotion of angiogenesis and resistance to anti-tumor therapies. To date, there are no approved therapies specifically targeting the FGFR signaling pathway. In pre-clinical studies, HMPL-453 demonstrated excellent kinase selectivity as well as strong anti-tumor potency. Abnormal FGFR gene alterations are believed to be the drivers of tumor cell proliferation in several solid tumor settings. We currently retain all rights to HMPL-453 worldwide. The table below shows a summary of the clinical studies that we have underway for HMPL-453.TPPName, Line, Patient FocusTherapySitesPhaseStatus36Solid tumorsHMPL-453 monotherapyAustraliaIDiscontinued37Solid tumorsHMPL-453 monotherapyChinaIEnrolling TPP 36 and TPP 37    Enrolling (NCT02966171 / NCT03160833)    Phase I dose escalation (Australia/China)    In early 2017, we initiated first-in-human Phase I dose escalation studies in both Australia and China to evaluate safety, tolerability, PK, PD and preliminary anti-tumor activity in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. In July 2018 we discontinued the Australian Phase I study due to the emergence of certain serious, though non-life threatening, FGFR target related toxicities. The China Phase I continues, with additional measures designed to minimize risk to patients, due to the overall greater tolerance and lower toxicities experienced in Chinese patients.HMPL004-6599The table below shows the clinical study that we have underway for HMPL004-6599.TPPName, Line, Patient FocusTherapySitesPhaseStatus38Healthy volunteersHMPL004-6599 monotherapyAustraliaIInitiated April 2018 TPP 38    Enrolling (NCT03597971)    Phase I dose escalation (Australia)    HMPL004-6599 is a proprietary botanical drug for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, which we are developing through NSP, our 50/50 joint venture with NestlÃ©. We initiated Phase I clinical studies in Australia in April 2018 and completed the single ascending dose stage. Phase II enabling non-clinical studies are being initiated. HMPL004-6599 is an enriched/purified re-formulation of HMPL-004, our drug candidate that reported positive Phase II results in ulcerative colitis in 2010, but later proved futile in an interim analysis of the subsequent Phase III study in 2014.COMMERCIAL PLATFORMThe Commercial Platform, which has been built over the past 17 years, is focused on two business areas. First is our core Prescription Drugs business, a higher-margin/profit business operated through our joint ventures SHPL and Hutchison Sinopharm, in which we nominate management and run the day-to-day operations. Our Prescription Drugs business is a platform that we plan to use to launch our Innovation Platform drugs once approved in China. Second is our Consumer Health business, which is a profitable and cash flow generating business selling primarily market-leading, household-name OTC pharmaceutical products through our non-consolidated joint venture HBYS.In the first half of 2018, the Commercial Platform delivered strong net income growth despite a change in the way we recognize certain sales resulting from the implementation of the TIS and the divestment of a non-core OTC logistics business. Consolidated sales of our Commercial Platform's subsidiaries decreased by 15% to $88.6 million (H1 2017: $103.9m) as TIS caused us to shift from a gross sales revenue model to a service fee revenue model with respect to sales of certain third-party products. The sales of our Commercial Platform's non-consolidated joint ventures, SHPL and HBYS, grew by 21% to $271.7 million (H1 2017: $224.2m excluding divested operations). These resulted in adjusted (non-GAAP) consolidated net income attributable to Chi-Med from our Commercial Platform up 19% to $26.9 million (H1 2017: $22.7m) when one-time gains were excluded (H1 2017: $2.5m, R&D-related subsidies to SHPL).Prescription Drugs businessIn the first half of 2018, sales of our Prescription Drugs subsidiaries decreased as expected by 21% to $68.0 million (H1 2017: $85.8m) as a result of the implementation of TIS. Sales of our non-consolidated Prescription Drugs joint venture (SHPL) grew by 18% to $152.7 million (H1 2017: $129.7m). The consolidated (non-GAAP) net income attributable to Chi-Med from our Prescription Drugs business was up 23% to $20.8 million (H1 2017: $16.9m, excluding one-time gains from R&D-related subsidies to SHPL). The Prescription Drugs business represented 77% of our overall Commercial Platform net income in the first half of 2018.SHPL:  Our own-brand Prescription Drugs business, operated through our non-consolidated joint venture SHPL, is a well-established and stable-growth business. In the first half of 2018, SHPL delivered sales growth of 18% at $152.7 million (H1 2017: $129.7m) as a result of both volume and price growth on SXBX pill.SXBX pill:  SHPL's main product is SXBX pill, an oral vasodilator and pro-angiogenesis prescription therapy approved to treat coronary artery disease, which includes stable/unstable angina, myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death. There are over one million deaths due to coronary artery disease per year in China, with this number set to rise due to an aging population with high levels of smoking (34% of adults), increasing levels of obesity (28% of adults are overweight) and hypertension (26% of adults). SXBX pill is the third largest botanical prescription drug in this indication in China, with a market share of 15% nationally and 47% in Shanghai. Sales of SXBX pill have grown more than twenty-fold since 2001 due to continued geographical expansion of sales coverage, including 18% to $129.8 million in the first half of 2018 (H1 2017: $110.4m).SXBX pill is protected by a formulation patent that expires in 2029 and is one of less than two dozen proprietary prescription drugs represented on China's National Essential Medicines List, which means that all Chinese state-owned health care institutions are required to carry the drug. SXBX pill is a low-cost drug, fully reimbursed in all provinces in China, listed on China's Low Price Drug List with a 2017 average daily cost of RMB4.00 (2016: RMB3.30), or approximately $0.60. In the coming years, we anticipate stable growth in sales and profit for SXBX pill given the strength of its proposition and the expected expansion of the coronary artery disease market in China driven by an aging population and trends in diet leading to increasing obesity.The SHPL operation is large-scale in both the commercial and manufacturing areas. The commercial team now has about 2,400 medical sales representatives which allows for the promotion and scientific detailing of our prescription drug products not just in hospitals in provincial capitals and medium-sized cities, but also in the majority of county-level hospitals in China. SHPL's new, GMP-certified factory located 40 kilometers south of Shanghai in Fengpu district holds 74 drug product manufacturing licenses and is operated by about 550 manufacturing staff. This new factory, opened in 2017, has approximately tripled SHPL's capacity and therefore positions us well for continued long-term growth.Concor®:  Concor® (Bisoprolol tablets) is a cardiac beta1-receptor blocker, relieving hypertension and reducing high blood pressure. Concor® is the number two beta-blocker in China with an approximately 18% national market share in China's beta-blocker drug market and 70% of China's generic bisoprolol market. SHPL is now the exclusive marketing agent in six provinces, markets that contain over 360 million people. We have created synergy with SHPL's existing cardiovascular medical sales team by detailing Concor® alongside SXBX pill. In the first half of 2018, we grew Concor® sales by 25%, resulting in service fees of $2.2 million (H1 2017: $1.1m). We expect growth in these fees will continue to be driven by cardiovascular market expansion.Hutchison Sinopharm:  Our Prescription Drugs commercial services business, which is operated through Hutchison Sinopharm, focuses on providing logistics services to, and distributing and marketing prescription drugs manufactured by, third-party pharmaceutical companies in China. In the first half of 2018, Hutchison Sinopharm sales decreased 21% to $68.0 million (H1 2017: $85.8m) as a result of the TIS implementation, as described below.Regulatory reform in the China pharmaceutical distribution system    The new TIS, a mandatory government policy, has now been rolled-out across China. In principle, the purpose of the TIS is to restrict the number of layers in the drug distribution system in China and to improve transparency, compliant business conduct, and efficiency and thereby lower the cost of drugs. The impact to us is that, starting in October 2017, the Seroquel® sales model, in which our consolidated revenues historically reflected total gross sales of Seroquel®, shifted to a fee-for-service model similar to that used with respect to Concor®. This change reduced the top-line revenues that Hutchison Sinopharm records from sales of Seroquel® as well as several of our other third-party products. Importantly, however, this drop in reported sales has had no impact on profitability, the service fees paid to Hutchison Sinopharm, or our commercial team operations and expansion plans.Seroquel®:  Seroquel® (quetiapine tablets) is an anti-psychotic therapy approved for bi-polar disorder and schizophrenia, conditions that are under-diagnosed in China. Seroquel® holds a 5.6% market share in China's approximately $0.9 billion atypical anti-psychotic prescription drug market, and 45% of China's generic quetiapine market, primarily as a result of being the first-mover and original patent holder on quetiapine. Seroquel® is the only brand in China to have an extended release (XR) formulation, which in 2017 was included on the National Drug Reimbursement List (NDRL), thereby providing us with major competitive advantage over quetiapine generics.Hutchison Sinopharm is the exclusive marketing agent for Seroquel® tablets in China and operates through a team of about 110 dedicated medical sales representatives. As stated throughout, the new TIS has had no effect on profitability, with service fees paid to Hutchison Sinopharm for marketing Seroquel® during the first half of 2018 increasing 75% to $9.6 million (H1 2017: $5.5m).In June 2018, AstraZeneca sold and licensed rights to Seroquel® to Luye Pharma Group, Ltd., including the transfer of contracts entered into by AstraZeneca with third parties. The terms of our agreement with AstraZeneca were assigned to Luye Pharma Hong Kong Ltd. and remain unchanged following this transaction, and this transaction has not affected our 2018 financial guidance.Subject to Hutchison Sinopharm's continued performance of marketing services, and delivery of approximately 22% in-market sales growth in 2018 and 15% per year thereafter, we will continue to retain exclusive commercial rights to Seroquel® in China until 2025. Growth in Seroquel in-market sales during the first half of 2018 was 36% due to overall strong execution. We expect Hutchison Sinopharm to have a reasonable chance to meet these annual Seroquel® sales targets over the next several years, although such sales are subject to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including potential changes in government pricing policies in China.Consumer Health business:During the first half of 2018, sales of our Consumer Health subsidiaries increased by 14% to $20.6 million (H1 2017: $18.1m) and sales of our non-consolidated Consumer Health joint venture (HBYS) were $119.0 million, a 26% increase (H1 2017: $94.4m on an as adjusted (non-GAAP) basis, excluding divested operation sales of $29.0m). Consolidated net income attributable to Chi-Med from our Consumer Health business grew by 7% to $6.1 million (H1 2017: $5.8m). The Consumer Health business represented 23% of our overall Commercial Platform net income in the first half of 2018.HBYS:  Our OTC business operated through our non-consolidated joint venture, HBYS, focuses on the manufacture, marketing and distribution of OTC pharmaceutical products. Its Bai Yun Shan brand is a market-leading, household name, established over 40 years ago, and is known by the majority of Chinese consumers. In addition to about 1,000 manufacturing staff in Guangdong and Anhui and 189 drug product licenses, HBYS has a commercial team of about 1,000 sales staff that covers the national retail pharmacy channel in China. The increased available production capacity as detailed below, and a decline in the prices of certain key raw materials, resulted in the above strong revenue and net income growth in the first half of 2018.New Bozhou factory: In August 2017, HBYS transferred the majority of production to our new GMP-certified low-cost factory in Bozhou, Anhui. Capacity until this point had been constrained and production had to be supplemented by third-party contract manufacturers. These production capacity constraints were eliminated in the second half of 2017 once the Bozhou factory began production.Fu Fang Dan Shen ("FFDS") tablets and Banlangen granules:  FFDS tablets (angina) and Banlangen granules (anti-viral cold/flu), the two main products of HBYS, are generic OTC drugs with leading national market share in China of 38% (2016: 32%) and 53% (2016: 51%), respectively. The first half of 2018 saw the combined sales of these products increased by 10% to $70.7 million (H1 2017: $64.3m). This was largely due to the reversal of several headwinds affecting Banlangen during the same period in 2017. Banlangen sales grew 34% to $37.9 million in the first half of 2018 due to a moderate to severe flu season and the elimination of manufacturing capacity constraints. This increase was offset in part by a decline in sales of FFDS which fell 9% to $32.8 million as a result of price increases and a reduction in distribution channel inventory ahead of the approval and label expansion of FFDS for use in certain early-stage dementia indications, which is expected in the second half of 2018.Nanyang Baiyunshan Hutchison Whampoa Guanbao Pharmaceutical Company Limited ("Guanbao") divestment: In September 2017, HBYS divested its 60% shareholding in Guanbao for a consideration approximately equal to its carrying value. Guanbao was a Good Supply Practice distribution company which had been established via a joint venture in 2012. This low margin, primarily third-party OTC logistics business, with operations limited mainly to Henan province, had proven to be a business with no strategic value to Chi-Med. Sales reported under HBYS for Guanbao were nil in the first half of 2018 (H1 2017: $29.0m).HBYS property update: HBYS's vacant Plot 2 (26,700 sqm.) in Guangzhou has been listed for sale as part of the Guangzhou municipal government's urban redevelopment scheme plan since 2016. The date of this public auction will be determined by the Guangzhou government, while we are actively working to facilitate the process, external factors have to-date hampered progress. Land prices however continue to rise in Guangzhou, and based on precedent land transactions in the vicinity, we expect the auction value for Plot 2 to be well over $100 million of which 40 to 50% would be paid to HBYS as compensation for return of the land use rights. In addition, the move away from HBYS's larger Plot 1 (59,400 sqm.) will be contingent on how the Bozhou factory develops, but, when auctioned, we anticipate that based on recent precedent land transactions, Plot 1 could bring HBYS compensation per square meter comparable to Plot 2.Hutchison Healthcare Limited ("HHL") and Hutchison Hain Organic Holdings Limited ("HHOH"):  HHL, HHOH and other minor entities are subsidiaries involved in the commercialization of health-related consumer products. Sales of such products in the first half of 2018 grew by 14% to $20.6 million (H1 2017: $18.1m) driven in part by growth of the Zhi Ling Tong® and Earth's Best® infant nutrition products.Commercial Platform dividends: The profits of the Commercial Platform continue to pass on to the Chi-Med Group through dividend payments primarily from our non-consolidated joint ventures, SHPL and HBYS. Dividends of $23.5 million (H1 2017: $.6m) were paid from these joint ventures to the Chi-Med Group level in the first half of 2018. Dividends in the first half of 2017 were unusually high as the proceeds of one-time land compensation from SHPL were paid out. Net income from SHPL and HBYS have totaled over $500 million since 2005, of which $355 million has been paid in dividends to Chi-Med and its partners, with the balance retained by the joint ventures as cash or used primarily to fund factory upgrades and expansion. As of June 30, 2018, SHPL and HBYS held in aggregate $41.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, with no outstanding bank borrowings.  Christian Hogg Chief Executive Officer July 27, 2018USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND RECONCILIATIONIn addition to financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, this announcement also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures based on management's view of performance including: ¢   Adjusted R&D expenses; ¢   Adjusted consolidated operating profit from our Commercial Platform; ¢   Adjusted consolidated net income attributable to Chi-Med from our Commercial Platform; ¢   Adjusted consolidated net income attributable to Chi-Med from our Prescription Drugs business; and ¢   Adjusted revenues of HBYS and non-consolidated joint ventures.Management uses such measures internally for planning and forecasting purposes and to measure the Chi-Med Group's overall performance. We believe these adjusted financial measures provide useful and meaningful information to us and investors because they enhance investors' understanding of the continuing operating performance of our business and facilitate the comparison of performance between past and future periods. These adjusted financial measures are non-GAAP measures and should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Other companies may define these measures in different ways. The following items are excluded from adjusted financial results:Adjusted R&D expenses: We exclude the impact of the revenue received from external customers of our Innovation Platform, which is reinvested into our clinical trials, to derive our adjusted R&D expense. Revenue received from external customers of our Innovation Platform consists of milestone and other payments from our collaboration partners. The variability of such payments makes the identification of trends in our ongoing R&D activities more difficult. We believe the presentation of adjusted R&D expenses provides useful and meaningful information about our ongoing R&D activities by enhancing investors' understanding of the scope of our normal, recurring operating R&D expenses.Adjusted consolidated operating profit from our Commercial Platform, adjusted consolidated net income attributable to Chi-Med from our Commercial Platform and adjusted consolidated net income attributable to Chi-Med from our Prescription Drugs business: We exclude the impact of one-time gains which were triggered by the payment of R&D-related subsidies from the Shanghai government to SHPL.Adjusted revenues of HBYS and non-consolidated joint ventures: we exclude the sales of Guanbao because Guanbao was divested by HBYS in September 2017.Reconciliation

Organization and Nature of BusinessHutchison China MediTech Limited (the "Company") and its subsidiaries (together the "Group") are principally engaged in researching, developing, manufacturing and selling pharmaceuticals and healthcare products. The Group and its equity investees have research and development facilities and manufacturing plants in the People's Republic of China (the "PRC") and sell their products mainly in the PRC and Hong Kong.LiquidityAs at June 30, 2018, the Group had accumulated losses of US$140,890,000, primarily due to its significant spending in drug research and development ("Drug R&D") activities. The Group regularly monitors current and expected liquidity requirements to ensure that it maintains sufficient cash balances and adequate credit facilities to meet its liquidity requirements in the short and long term. As at June 30, 2018, the Group had cash and cash equivalents of US$75,329,000, short ‘term investments of US$247,165,000 and unutilized bank borrowing facilities of US$94,359,000. Short ‘term investments comprised of bank deposits maturing over three months. As at December 31, 2017, the Group had cash and cash equivalents of US$85,265,000, short ‘term investments of US$273,031,000 and unutilized bank borrowing facilities of US$121,282,000. The Group's operating plan includes the continued receipt of dividends from certain of its equity investees. Dividends received from equity investees for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 were US$23,526,000 and US$,617,000 respectively.Based on the Group's operating plan, the existing cash and cash equivalents, short ‘term investments and unutilized bank borrowing facilities are considered to be sufficient to meet the cash requirements to fund planned operations and other commitments for at least the next twelve months (the look ‘forward period used).2. Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesBasis of PresentationThe accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. The interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual audited consolidated financial statements, except for the adoption of Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ("ASC 606") as described below. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair statement of results for the periods presented, have been included. The results of operations of any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the full year or any other interim period.The comparative year-end condensed balance sheet data was derived from the annual audited consolidated financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP.The interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures have been prepared with the presumption that users have read or have access to the annual audited consolidated financial statements for the preceding fiscal year.The preparation of these interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP required management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as at the end of the reporting period and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates are used in determining items such as useful lives of property, plant and equipment, write-down of inventories, allowance for doubtful accounts, share-based compensation, impairments of long-lived assets, impairment of other intangible asset and goodwill, income tax expense, tax valuation allowances and revenues from research and development projects. Actual results could differ from those estimates.Revenue Recognition ASC 606Summary of impact of applying ASC 606The Group applied ASC 606 to all contracts at the date of initial application of January 1, 2018. As a result, the Group has changed its accounting policy for revenue recognition as detailed below. The Group applied ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method by recognizing the cumulative effect as an adjustment to opening accumulated losses at January 1, 2018. The comparative information prior to January 1, 2018 has not been adjusted and continues to be reported under Accounting Standard Codification 605, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) ("ASC 605").The Group assessed its license and collaboration contracts under ASC 606. Refer to Note 16. As a result of this assessment, the Group recorded an aggregate US$1.1 million deferral of revenue as a cumulative adjustment to opening accumulated losses upon adoption.For sales of goods and services, the Group applied a portfolio approach to aggregate contracts into portfolios whose performance obligations do not differ materially from each other. In its assessment of each portfolio, the Group assessed the contracts under the new five-step model under ASC 606 and determined there was no significant impact to the timing or amount of revenue recognition under the new guidance.Under the Group's previous accounting policy, deferred revenue comprised deferred upfront payments from the Group's license and collaboration contracts. Under ASC 606, advance payments from customers preceding an entity's performance are considered contract liabilities; therefore, advance payments from customers from the Group's Commercial Platform have been reclassified from other payables, accruals and advance receipts to deferred revenue. Expected rebates for sales of goods remain in other payables, accruals and advance receipts.The following tables summarize the impact of adopting ASC 606 on the Group's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as at and for the six months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to the amounts as if applying ASC 605:  As reported   As if applied  ASC 606 Adjustments ASC 605            (in US$'000)Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet      Current assets 394,676    394,676 Non-current assets 183,267    183,267 Total assets 577,943    577,943 Liabilities and shareholders' equity      Current liabilities      Other payables, accruals and advance receipts 49,669  1,754  51,3 Deferred revenue 3,753  (2,434) 1,319 Other current liabilities 31,162    31,162 Total current liabilities 84,584  (680) 83,904 Deferred revenue 924  (267) 657 Other non-current liabilities 34,590    34,590 Total liabilities 120,098  (947 ) 119,151 Company's shareholders' equity      Accumulated losses (140,890) 916  (139,974)Accumulated other comprehensive income 8,571  28  8,599 Other shareholders' equity 564,050    564,050 Total Company's shareholders' equity 431,731  944  432,675 Non-controlling interests 26,114  3  26,117 Total shareholders' equity 457,845  947  458,792 Total liabilities and shareholders' equity 577,943    577,943          As reported   As if applied  ASC 606 Adjustments ASC 605            (in US$'000)Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations      Total revenues 102,189  (164) 102,025 Total operating expense (155,872)   (155,872)Loss from operations (53,683) (164 ) (53,847)Total other income 3,188    3,188 Loss before income taxes and equity in earnings of equity investees (50,495) (164 ) (50,659)Income tax expense (2,680)   (2,680)Equity in earnings of equity investees, net of tax 23,050    23,050 Net loss (30,125) (164) (30,289)Less: Net income attributable to non-controlling interests (2,566)   (2,566)Net loss attributable to the Company (32,691) (164) (32,855)         As reported   As if applied  ASC 606 Adjustments ASC 605            (in US$'000)Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Loss      Net loss (30,125) (164) (30,289)Other comprehensive income 3,445  28  3,473 Total comprehensive loss (26,680) (136) (26,816)Less: Comprehensive income attributable to non-controlling interests (2,870)   (2,870)Total comprehensive loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company (29,550) (136 ) (29,686) There are no adjustments to net cash (used in)/generated from operating activities, investing activities or financing activities in the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows.Updated accounting policyRevenue is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer, and excludes any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by the Group from a customer, are also excluded from revenue. The Group recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a good, service or license to a customer.Nature of goods and servicesThe following is a description of principal activities, separated by reportable segments, from which the Company generates its revenue:(i)     Innovation PlatformThe Innovation Platform reportable segment principally generates revenue from license and collaboration contracts. The license and collaboration contracts generally contain multiple performance obligations including (1) the license to the drug compound and (2) the research and development services for each specified treatment indication, which are accounted for separately if they are distinct, i.e. if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the arrangement and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer.The transaction price generally includes fixed and variable consideration in the form of upfront payment, research and development cost reimbursements, contingent milestone payments and sales-based royalties. Contingent milestone payments are not included in the transaction price until it becomes probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur, which is generally when the specified milestone is achieved. The allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation is based on the relative standalone selling prices of each performance obligation determined at the inception of the contract. The Group estimates the standalone selling prices based on the income approach. Control of the license to the drug compounds transfers at the inception date of the collaboration agreements and consequently, amounts allocated to this performance obligation are generally recognized at a point in time. Conversely, research and development services for each specified indication are performed over time and amounts allocated to these performance obligations are generally recognized over time using cost inputs as a measure of progress. The Group has determined that research and development expenses provide an appropriate depiction of measure of progress for the research and development services. Changes to estimated cost inputs may result in a cumulative catch-up adjustment. Royalty revenues are recognized as future sales occur as they meet the requirements for the sales-usage based royalty exception.Deferred revenue is recognized if allocated consideration is received in advance of the Group rendering research and development services. Accounts receivable is recognized based on the terms of the contract and when the Group has an unconditional right to bill the customer, which is generally when research and development services are rendered.(ii)     Commercial PlatformThe Commercial Platform reportable segment principally generates revenue from (1) sales of goods, which are the manufacture or purchase and distribution of drug, healthcare and consumer products, and (2) sales of services, which are the provision of sales, distribution and marketing services to pharmaceutical manufacturers. These contracts include prescription drug products and consumer health products.Revenue from sales of goods is recognized when the customer takes possession of the goods. This usually occurs upon completed delivery of the goods to the customer site. The amount of revenue recognized is adjusted for expected sales incentives as stipulated in the contract, which are generally issued to customers as direct discounts at the point ‘of ‘sale or indirectly in the form of rebates. Sales incentives are estimated using the expected value method. Additionally, sales are generally made with a limited right of return under certain conditions. Revenues are recorded net of provisions for sales discounts and returns.Revenue from sales of services is recognized when the benefits of the services transfer to the customer over time.Deferred revenue is recognized if consideration is received in advance of transferring control of the goods or rendering of services. Accounts receivable is recognized if the Group has an unconditional right to bill the customer, which is generally when the customer takes possession of the goods or services are rendered. Payment terms differ by subsidiary and customer, but generally range from 45 to 180 days from the invoice date.Recent Accounting PronouncementsRefer to the recent accounting pronouncements in the annual audited consolidated financial statements for the preceding fiscal year. The following includes updates and new accounting pronouncements since the issuance of the annual audited consolidated financial statements.In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU 2016 ‘02, Leases (Topic 8) ("ASU 2016 ‘02"). The core principle of ASU 2016 ‘02 is that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases. A lessee should recognize in the balance sheet a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right ‘of ‘use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. ASU 2016 ‘02 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2018. The Group expects to adopt the new standard using the modified retrospective method on January 1, 2019 with a retrospective adjustment to comparable periods starting from January 1, 2017, subject to further implementation guidance issued by the FASB. The Group is continuing to evaluate the impact of the new guidance, but expects a gross up to the consolidated balance sheets on the date of adoption primarily related to the Group's various factories and offices under non-cancellable lease agreements (Note 13) and are currently accounted off-balance sheet as operating leases under Accounting Standard Codification 840, Leases (Topic 840). Additionally, the Group expects limited impact to the consolidated statements of operations after adoption as the pattern of rental expense recognition should not change materially for such operating leases.In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting ("ASU 2018-07"), which simplifies the accounting for share-based payments granted to nonemployees for goods and services. Under the ASU, most of the guidance on such payments to nonemployees would be aligned with the requirements for share-based payments granted to employees. ASU 2018-07 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2018. The Group shall adopt the guidance on January 1, 2019, but does not expect a significant impact upon adoption as there have been no nonemployee stock option grants during any periods presented.Other amendments that have been issued by the FASB or other standards ‘setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements upon adoption.3.

No outstanding share options will be exercisable or subject to vesting after the expiry of a maximum of eight to ten years from the date of grant.A summary of the Company's share option activity and related information is as follows: Number of share options Weighted averageexercise price in £ per share Weighted averageremaining contractual life (years) Aggregate intrinsic value (in £'000)Outstanding at January 1, 20171,039,596  15.00 6.77 7,900Granted150,000  31.05    Exercised(56,309) 5.16    Cancelled(6,875) 6.10    Outstanding at December 31, 20171,126,412  17.69 6.29 43,158Granted949,626  46.78    Exercised(85,646) 6.10    Outstanding at June 30, 20181,990,392  32.07 7.72 28,530Vested and exercisable at December 31, 2017951,412  15.52 5.81 38,508Vested and exercisable at June 30, 2018928,266  17.13 5.46 26,702 In estimating the fair value of share options granted, the following assumptions were used in the Polynomial model for awards granted in the periods indicated: Year Ended December 31,  Six Months Ended June 30, 2011  2013  2016  2017 2018Weighted average grant date fair value of share options (in £ per share)1.84  3.15  8.99  12.69  16.71 Significant inputs into the valuation model (weighted average):         Exercise price (in £ per share)4.41  6.10  19.70  31.05  46.78 Share price at effective date of grant (in £ per share)4.33  6.10  19.70  31.05  46.57 Expected volatility (note (a))46.6% 36.0% 39.0% 36.3% 37.7%Risk ‘free interest rate (note (b))3.13% 3.16% 1.00% 1.17% 1.47%Contractual life of share options (in years)10  10  8  10  10 Expected dividend yield (note (c))0% 0% 0% 0% 0% Notes:(a)  The Company calculated its expected volatility with reference to the historical volatility prior to the issuances of share options.(b)  The risk ‘free interest rates used in the Polynomial model are with reference to the sovereign yield of the United Kingdom because the Company's ordinary shares are currently listed on AIM and denominated in £.(c)  The Company has not declared or paid any dividends and does not currently expect to do so in the foreseeable future, and therefore uses an expected dividend yield of zero in the Polynomial model.The Company will issue new shares to satisfy share option exercises.

Vesting will depend upon continued employment of the award holder with the Group and will otherwise be at the discretion of the Board of Directors of the Company. Additionally, some awards are subject to change based on annual performance targets prior to their determination date.LTIP awards prior to the determination datePerformance targets vary by award, and may include targets for shareholder returns, free cash flows, revenues, net profit after taxes and the achievement of clinical and regulatory milestones. As the extent of achievement of the performance targets is uncertain prior to the determination date, a probability based on management's assessment on the achievement of the performance target has been assigned to calculate the amount to be recognized as an expense over the requisite period with a corresponding entry to liability.LTIP awards after the determination dateUpon the determination date, the Company will pay a determined monetary amount, up to the maximum cash amount based on the actual achievement of the performance target specified in the award, to the Trustee to purchase the Awarded Shares. Any cumulative compensation expense previously recognized as a liability will be transferred to additional paid ‘in capital, as an equity ‘settled award. If the performance target is not achieved, no Awarded Shares of the Company will be purchased and the amount previously recorded in the liability will be reversed through profit or loss.Granted awards under the LTIP are as follows:On December 15, 2017, the Company granted awards up to a maximum cash amount per annum of US$0.5 million that stipulated annual performance targets. Shares under such LTIP awards will cover each financial year from 2018 to 2019. The annual performance target determination date is the date of the announcement of the Group's annual results for the covered financial year and vesting occurs two business days after the announcement of the Group's annual results for the financial year falling two years after the covered financial year to which the LTIP award relates.On March 15, 2017 and August 2, 2017, the Company granted awards up to a maximum cash amount per annum of US$6.0 million that stipulated annual performance targets. Shares under such LTIP awards will cover each financial year from 2017 to 2019. The annual performance target determination date is the date of the announcement of the Group's annual results for the covered financial year and vesting occurs two business days after the announcement of the Group's annual results for the financial year falling two years after the covered financial year to which the LTIP award relates.On March 15, 2017, the Company granted awards up to a maximum cash amount of US$0.4 million in aggregate that did not stipulate performance targets. Shares under such LTIP awards vested one business day after the publication date of the annual report for the 2017 financial year.The Trustee has been set up solely for the purpose of purchasing and holding the Awarded Shares during the vesting period on behalf of the Group using funds provided by the Group. On the determination date, if any, the Company will determine the cash amount, based on the actual achievement of each annual performance target, for the Trustee to purchase the Awarded Shares. The Awarded Shares will then be held by the Trustee until they are vested.The Trustee's assets include treasury shares and funds for additional treasury shares, trustee fees and expenses. The number of treasury shares (in the form of ordinary shares or ADS of the Company) purchased and held by the Trustee are as follows: Number of treasury shares Cost in US$'000As at January 1, 201762,921  2,390 Purchased35,095  1,367 Vested(,038) (1,800)As at December 31, 201755,978  1,957 Purchased79,500  5,451 Vested(23,375) (731)As at June 30, 2018112,103  6,677  For the six months ended June 30, 2018, US$93,000 of the determined LTIP awards have been forfeited.The following table presents the share ‘based compensation expenses recognized under the LTIP awards: Six Months Ended June 30, 2018 2017     (in US$'000)  Research and development expenses878 691Selling and administrative expenses723 578 1,601 1,269Recorded with a corresponding credit to:   Liability789 594Additional paid ‘in capital812 675 1,601 1,269 For the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, US$1,770,000 and US$451,000 was reclassified from liability to additional paid ‘in capital respectively upon LTIP awards reaching the determination date. As at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, US$1,260,000 and US$2,241,000 was recorded as liability respectively for LTIP awards prior to the determination date.As at June 30, 2018, the total unrecognized compensation cost was approximately US$6,679,000, which considers expected performance targets and the amount expected to vest, and will be recognized over the requisite periods.16.

Under the terms of the Lilly Agreement, the Group is entitled to receive a series of payments up to US$86.5 million, including upfront payments and development and regulatory approval milestones. Should fruquintinib be successfully commercialized in China, the Group would receive tiered royalties from 15% to 20% on all sales in China. Development costs after the first development milestone are shared between the Group and Lilly.Upfront and milestone payments in the Lilly Agreement are summarized as follows: (in US$'000)Upfront payment6,500Development milestone payments achieved as at June 30, 201825,000Remaining development and regulatory approval milestone payments55,000 86,500 In addition, the Group also signed an option agreement which grants Lilly an exclusive option to expand the fruquintinib rights beyond Hong Kong and China. The option agreement further sets out certain milestone payments and royalty rates that apply in the event the option is exercised on a global basis. However, these are subject to further negotiation should the option be exercised on a specific territory basis as opposed to a global basis. The option was determined at the inception of the contract to have minimal value. As at June 30, 2018, the option has not been exercised.The Group adopted ASC 606 on January 1, 2018 and reassessed the Lilly Agreement under the new standard, which resulted in US$0.1 million recognition of previously deferred revenue as a cumulative adjustment to opening accumulated losses as at January 1, 2018, summarized as follows (in US$ millions).  ASC 605   ASC 606  December 31, 2017 Opening Adjustments January 1, 2018Cumulative amounts recognized to accumulated losses from:      Upfront payment (note (a)) 5.7 0.5  6.2Milestone payments (note (b)) 23.7 (0.4) 23.3  29.4 0.1  29.5 Notes:(a)  Upfront payment amounts deferred under ASC 605, but was allocated to the license to fruquintinib transferred at inception under ASC 606, resulting in additional revenue recognition on adoption.(b)  Milestone payments had been fully recognized under ASC 605's milestone method, but was allocated to the portion of research and development services that had not been performed under ASC 606, resulting in deferral of revenue on adoption.Under ASC 606, the Group identified the following performance obligations under the Lilly Agreement: (1) the license to fruquintinib and (2) the research and development services for the specified indications. The transaction price includes the upfront payment, research and development cost reimbursements, milestone payments and sales-based royalties. Milestone payments were not included in the transaction price until it became probable that a significant reversal of revenue would not occur, which is generally when the specified milestone is achieved. The allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation was based on the relative standalone selling prices of each performance obligation determined at the inception of the contract. Based on this estimation, proportionate amounts of transaction price to be allocated to the license to fruquintinib and the research and development services were 90% and 10% respectively. Control of the license to fruquintinib transferred at the inception date of the agreement and consequently, amounts allocated to this performance obligation were recognized at inception. Conversely, research and development services for each specified indication are performed over time and amounts allocated are recognized over time using the prior and estimated future development costs for fruquintinib as a measure of progress.Under ASC 606, the Group recognized US$5.7 million, US$0.1 million and US$0.2 million revenue during the six months ended June 30, 2018 for research and development cost reimbursements, the amortization of the upfront payment and the amortization of the milestone payments respectively.Under ASC 605, the Group recognized US$6.0 million, US$0.5 million and US$4.5 million revenue during the six months ended June 30, 2017 for research and development services, amortization of the upfront payment and the achievement of the milestone in relation to the acceptance of a new drug application by the China Food and Drug Administration (now the China National Drug Administration) for fruquintinib as a treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer respectively.License and collaboration agreement with AstraZenecaOn December 21, 2011 (as amended on August 1, 2016), the Group and AstraZeneca ("AZ") entered into a global licensing, co ‘development, and commercialization agreement for savolitinib ("AZ Agreement"), a novel targeted therapy and a highly selective inhibitor of the c ‘Met receptor tyrosine kinase for the treatment of cancer. Under the terms of the AZ Agreement, the Group is entitled to receive a series of payments including upfront payments and development, first-sale and commercial sale milestones. Should savolitinib be successfully commercialized outside China, the Group would receive tiered royalties from 14% to 18% on all sales outside of China. After total aggregate sales of savolitinib have reached US$5 billion, this royalty will step down over a two-year period to an ongoing tiered royalty rate from 10.5% to 14.5%. Should savolitinib be successfully commercialized in China, the Group would receive fixed royalties of 30% based on all sales in China. Development costs for savolitinib in China will be shared between the Group and AZ, with the Group continuing to lead the development in China. AZ will lead and pay for the development of savolitinib for the rest of the world, except for Phase III clinical trial costs related to developing savolitinib for papillary renal cell carcinoma which the Group shall pay for up to a maximum of US$50 million.Upfront and milestone payments in the AZ Agreement are summarized as follows: (in US$'000)Upfront payment20,000Development milestone payments achieved as at June 30, 201825,000Remaining development and first-sale milestone payments (note)95,000 140,000 Note:  The AZ Agreement also contains possible significant future commercial sale milestones.The Group adopted ASC 606 on January 1, 2018 and reassessed the AZ Agreement under the new standard, which resulted in US$1.2 million deferral of previously recognized revenue as a cumulative adjustment to opening accumulated losses as at January 1, 2018, summarized as follows (in US$ millions).  ASC 605   ASC 606  December 31, 2017 Opening Adjustments January 1, 2018Cumulative amounts recognized to accumulated losses from:      Upfront payment (note (a)) 19.6 (0.3) 19.3 Milestone payments (note (b)) 24.9 (0.9) 24.0  44.5 (1.2 ) 43.3 Notes:(a)  Upfront payment amounts allocated to research and development services recognized under ASC 606 differed from ASC 605 due to a different basis in measuring progress on adoption, resulting in deferral of revenue.(b)  Milestone payments had been fully recognized under ASC 605's milestone method, but was allocated to the portion of research and development services that had not been performed under ASC 606, resulting in deferral of revenue on adoption.Under ASC 606, the Group identified the following performance obligations under the AZ Agreement: (1) the license to savolitinib and (2) the research and development services for the specified indications.

Based on this estimation, proportionate amounts of transaction price to be allocated to the license to savolitinib and the research and development services were 95% and 5% respectively. Control of the license to savolitinib transferred at the inception date of the agreement and consequently, amounts allocated to this performance obligation were recognized at inception. Conversely, research and development services for each specified indication are performed over time and amounts allocated are recognized over time using the prior and estimated future development costs for savolitinib as a measure of progress.Under ASC 606, the Group recognized US$2.4 million, US$0.1 million and US$0.1 million revenue during the six months ended June 30, 2018 for research and development cost reimbursements, the amortization of the upfront payment and the amortization of milestone payments respectively.Under ASC 605, the Group recognized US$1.8 million, approximately US$0.1 million and US$5.0 million revenue during the six months ended June 30, 2017 for research and development services, amortization of the upfront payment and the achievement of the milestone in relation to the Phase III initiation for the secondary indication papillary renal cell carcinoma respectively.17.

Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law (the "EIT Law"), the standard enterprise income tax rate is 25%. In addition, the EIT Law provides for, among others, a preferential tax rate of 15% for companies which qualify as HNTE. HMPL qualifies as a HNTE up to December 31, 2019. Pursuant to the EIT law, a 10% withholding tax is levied on dividends declared by PRC companies to their foreign investors. A lower withholding tax rate of 5% is applicable under the China ‘HK Tax Arrangement if direct foreign investors with at least 25% equity interest in the PRC companies are Hong Kong tax residents, and meet the conditions or requirements pursuant to the relevant PRC tax regulations regarding beneficial ownership. Since the equity holders of the major subsidiaries and equity investees of the Company are Hong Kong incorporated companies and Hong Kong tax residents, and meet the aforesaid conditions or requirements, the Company has used 5% to provide for deferred tax liabilities on retained earnings which are anticipated to be distributed. As at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the amounts accrued in deferred tax liabilities relating to withholding tax on dividends were determined on the basis that 100% of the distributable reserves of the major subsidiaries and equity investees operating in the PRC will be distributed as dividends.The reconciliation of the Group's reported income tax expense to the theoretical tax amount that would arise using the tax rates of the Company against the Group's loss before income taxes and equity in earnings of equity investees is as follows: Six Months Ended June 30, 2018  2017        (in US$'000)  Loss before income taxes and equity in earnings of equity investees(50,495) (16,738)Tax calculated at the statutory tax rate of the Company(8,332) (2,762)Tax effects of:   Different tax rates available in different jurisdictions893  537 Tax valuation allowance10,231  3,881 Preferential tax deduction(1,763) (845)Expenses not deductible for tax purposes690  261 Utilization of previously unrecognized tax losses(2) (97)Withholding tax on undistributed earnings of PRC entities1,323  1,307 Others(360) (436)Income tax expense2,680  1,846  (ii)     Deferred tax assets and liabilitiesThe significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows: June 30, December 31, 2018  2017        (in US$'000)Deferred tax assets   Tax losses41,647  31,028 Others1,448  1,267 Total deferred tax assets43,095  32,295 Less: Valuation allowance(,414) (31,662)Deferred tax assets681  633 Deferred tax liabilities   Undistributed earnings from PRC entities4,937  4,332 Others115  120 Deferred tax liabilities5,052  4,452  The movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows: 2018  2017        (in US'000)  As at January 1(3,819) (4,989)Utilization of previously recognized withholding tax on undistributed earnings788  2,140 (Charged)/Credited to the consolidated statements of operations   Withholding tax on undistributed earnings of PRC entities(1,323) (1,307)Deferred tax on amortization of intangible assets10  9 Deferred tax on provision for assets36  51 Exchange differences(63) (96)As at June 30(4,371) (4,192) The deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.The table below summarizes changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance: 2018  2017        (in US$'000)  As at January 131,662  20,145 Charged to consolidated statements of operations10,231  3,881 Utilization of previously unrecognized tax losses(2) (97)Others259  (965)Exchange differences264  280 As at June 30,414  23,244  The Group recognizes interest and penalties, if any, under income tax payable on its condensed consolidated balance sheets and under other expenses in its condensed consolidated statements of operations.

Segment ReportingThe Group determines its operating segments from both business and geographic perspectives as follows:(i)  Innovation Platform: Drug R&D focuses on discovering and developing innovative therapeutics in oncology and autoimmune diseases, and the provision of research and development services; and(ii)  Commercial Platform: comprises of the manufacture, marketing and distribution of prescription and over ‘the ‘counter pharmaceuticals in the PRC as well as consumer health products through Hong Kong. The Commercial Platform is further segregated into two core business areas:• Prescription Drugs: comprises the development, manufacture, distribution, marketing and sale of prescription pharmaceuticals; and  • Consumer Health: comprises the development, manufacture, distribution, marketing and sale of over ‘the ‘counter pharmaceuticals and consumer health products.Innovation Platform and Prescription Drugs businesses under the Commercial Platform are primarily located in the PRC. The locations for Consumer Health business under the Commercial Platform are further segregated into the PRC and Hong Kong.The performance of the reportable segments is assessed based on three measurements: (a) losses or earnings of subsidiaries before interest income, interest expense, income tax expense and equity in earnings of equity investees, net of tax ("Adjusted (LBIT)/EBIT" or "Adjusted LBIT"), (b) equity in earnings of equity investees, net of tax and (c) operating (loss)/profit.The segment information is as follows: Six Months Ended June 30, 2018 Innovation Platform Commercial Platform     Drug R&D Prescription Drugs Consumer Health         PRC PRC PRC Hong Kong  Subtotal Unallocated Total                          (in US$'000)    Revenue from external customers13,624  67,950 6,559 14,056 88,565   102,189  Adjusted (LBIT)/EBIT(50,718) 3,457 456 1,584 5,497 (7,619) (52,840) Interest income26  23 7 32 62 2,701  2,789  Equity in earnings of equity investees, net of tax(2,349) 19,408 5,991  25,399   23,050  Operating (loss)/profit(53,041) 22,888 6,454 1,616 30,958 (4,918) (27,001) Interest expense    39 39 405  444  Income tax expense20  813 124 264 1,201 1,459  2,680  Net (loss)/income attributable to the Company(52,930) 20,768 5,497 649 26,914 (6,675) (32,691) Depreciation/amortization1,584  68 12 10 90 14  1,688  Additions to non ‘current assets (other than financial instrument and deferred tax assets)1,564  5 7 14 26 5  1,595     June 30, 2018 Innovation Platform Commercial Platform     Drug R&D Prescription Drugs Consumer Health          PRC PRC PRC Hong Kong  Subtotal  Unallocated Total                       (in US$'000)    Total assets95,668 133,674 65,482 14,882 214,038 268,237 577,943 Property, plant and equipment14,147 135 57 33 225 44 14,416 Leasehold land1,264      1,264 Goodwill 2,949 407  3,356  3,356 Other intangible asset 403   403  403 Investments in equity investees25,167 74,276 62,146  136,2  161,589   Six Months Ended June 30, 2017 Innovation Platform Commercial Platform     Drug R&D Prescription Drugs Consumer Health        PRC PRC PRC Hong Kong Subtotal Unallocated Total                           (in US$'000)    Revenue from external customers22,726  85,759 4,3  13,676 103,858   126,584  Adjusted (LBIT)/EBIT(12,467) 1,523 99  1,519 3,141 (6,846) (16,172) Interest income19  17 5  3 25 207  251  Equity in earnings of equity investees, net of tax(2,363) 18,871 5,761   24,632   22,269  Operating (loss)/profit(14,811) 20,411 5,865  1,522 27,798 (6,639) 6,348  Interest expense     32 32 785  817  Income tax expense14  441 (179) 243 505 1,327  1,846  Net (loss)/income attributable to the Company(14,790) 19,1 5,093  644 25,158 (8,686) 1,682  Depreciation/amortization1,232  52 6  9 67 13  1,312  Additions to non ‘current assets (other than financial instrument and deferred tax assets)3,017  6 1  1 8 20  3,045    December 31, 2017 Innovation Platform Commercial Platform     Drug R&D Prescription Drugs Consumer Health        PRC PRC PRC Hong Kong Subtotal Unallocated Total                       (in US$'000)    Total assets63,268 122,665 58,961 13,794 195,0 339,244 597,932 Property, plant and equipment13,917 160 61 30 251 52 14,220 Leasehold land1,261      1,261 Goodwill 2,901 407  3,308  3,308 Other intangible asset 430   430  430 Investments in equity investees19,512 69,417 55,308  124,725  144,237  Revenue from external customers is after elimination of inter ‘segment sales.

LitigationFrom time to time, the Group may become involved in litigation relating to claims arising from the ordinary course of business. The Group believes that there are currently no claims or actions pending against the Group, the ultimate disposition of which could have a material adverse effect on the Group's results of operations, financial position or cash flows. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and the Group's view of these matters may change in the future. When an unfavorable outcome occurs, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the Group's financial position and results of operations for the periods in which the unfavorable outcome occurs, and potentially in future periods.24. Subsequent EventsThe Group evaluated subsequent events through July 27, 2018, which is the date when the interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were issued.Load-Date: July 28, 2018End of Document

They ask Google not to offer censored searches in ChinaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 29, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 375 wordsBody More than a dozen human rights groups sent a letter to Google in which they asked the company to stop offering censored searches in China, while reports are emerging that the company is planning to offer the service again in the gigantic Chinese market.  The joint letter dated Tuesday asks CEO Sundar Pichai to explain what Google is doing to protect users from censorship and surveillance by the Chinese government.  The letter says that the search engine, nicknamed "Dragonfly", represents an "alarming capitulation of Google in terms of human rights."  "The Chinese government broadly violates the rights of freedom of expression and privacy, and adapting to the repression of the Chinese authorities against dissent, Google would be actively participating in these violations for millions of Internet users in China," the letter said.  In a statement, the company said that "it has been investing for many years to help Chinese users, from the development of Android, through mobile applications such as Google Translate and Files Go and our tools for developers, but our work on search It has been exploratory and we are not close to launching a search product in China. "  The letter from human rights groups follows another letter signed earlier this month by more than a thousand Google employees, where they protest the secret plan of the company to build a search engine that can meet the requirements of censorship China. In the letter they ask the directors to review the ethics and transparency in the company.  Google was complying with Chinese censorship controls in 2006 when it sought to set foot in the growing Chinese economy, but left that market in 2010 due to the incessant pressure from human rights groups and some shareholders.  Tuesday's letter was signed among other groups by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Reporters Without Borders.  Google co-founder Sergey Brin was born in the Soviet Union in 1973 and lived there until he was 6 years old when his family fled. He has said that his experience with a repressive regime shaped his vision and that of the company.  However, Pichai, who became CEO in 2015 when Google became part of Alphabet, has said he wants Google to be in China to serve Chinese users. Load-Date: August 29, 2018End of Document

Rapid consolidation between medium and large players is anticipated since the Chinese government has been encouraging industry consolidation with an effort to regulate the industry and to improve competitiveness in the world market.Although China has enjoyed the benefits of an expanding market for production and distribution, the industry is suffering from minimal innovation and investment in R&D and new product development.

Chinese community opposes placing embassy in AmadorCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 15, 2018 SaturdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 681 wordsBody        As a place that contains an important meaning, not only for the Chinese community but for the rest of the ethnic groups that make up the Panamanian 'melting pot', and that therefore it should not be destined to any embassy, ??in these terms it was referred the businessman Fermín Chan, president of the Chinese-Panamanian Cultural Center, to the Calzada de Amador.  The site in question has been at the center of an intense debate throughout the week, as a result of the diplomatic frictions generated between the governments of the United States and Panama for the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Isthmus and China and the possible location of an embassy in a land granted in Amador.  'I do not think it was the most appropriate ... Panama has beautiful areas, much more accessible ...', said Chan, who recalled that he had initially considered the alternative of establishing the embassy in a field near the Colegio Chino Panameño .  "As Panamanians of Chinese descent we share the nationality and sovereignty of our country ... Personally I do not think that Amador is the place for any embassy," he said. LEGAL FRAMEWORK In the controversy, fueled by the decision of Washington to call in consultation to the charge d'affaires of its embassy in Panama and by the exhortation made by the State Department to the Panamanian Government to conduct its foreign relations with greater 'transparency', Mayor José Isabel Blandón and former Chancellor Jorge Eduardo Ritter also participated.  Both questioned the way in which the issue of land uses in the reverted areas has been administered. "In the Amador Causeway there is no approved land use that allows the construction of an embassy, ??whatever country it may be," the presidential candidate published on behalf of Panamanians in his Twitter account.  Blandón pointed out that in case of proposing otherwise, it would be up to the Municipal Planning Board to call a public consultation.  "That area had no specific assignment to make an embassy," said Ritter, in an interview with TVN. Who was the first president of the Board of Directors of the Canal Authority said that it is necessary to know fully what were the options that were presented to the Chinese Government to establish its diplomatic headquarters. "I think China would make a mistake in initiating a relationship with a conflict, not in front of the government but with a feeling against the Panamanians for occupying that place."  The lawyer expressed his misgivings about the possibility that President Donald Trump could force an interpretation of the canal treaties that allows him to invoke "a major intervention" or "a diplomatic offensive that does not suit anyone."  'One is thinking that it enters a Canal, which - by treaty is international - is a neutral one and the first thing you see is the flag of a country that is a world power, which in some way casts doubt about whether it is neutral or not that Channel, "Ritter added.  For his part, the presidential candidate for Democratic Change, Rómulo Roux, stressed that the 'Government can not be delivered to the Chinese government.' 'Relations with China are important, but the way this government is handling them is incorrect. The hasty negotiation of the FTA and the location of the Chinese embassy in Canal areas are irresponsible measures that do not consider the best interests of Panama as a priority, "the former foreign minister said on his Twitter account.  In another twe the constitutionalist lawyer Miguel Antonio Bernal asked President Juan Carlos Varela to comply with numeral 9 of Article 184 of the Constitution, which obliges you to submit that decision to the Assembly and not to your personal interests! '  Yesterday the president manifested himself before themedia pressure and tweeted that "the Government of the Republic of Panama will officially communicate the site assigned to the People's Republic of China after having responsibly evaluated the existing options."  For today, starting at 4:00 p.m., an act of planting flags in Amador has been called. Load-Date: September 15, 2018End of Document

RUBIO CHAIRS CHINA COMMISSION HEARING ON XINJIANG'S HUMAN RIGHTS CRISISStates News ServiceJuly 26, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1433 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Florida Senator Marco Rubio:U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), chair of the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), convened a hearing on the serious and deteriorating human rights situation faced by Uyghur Muslims and members of other Muslim ethnic minority groups and highlighted that U.S. and multi-national corporations are selling products to the Chinese government that assist in its repression and human rights violations in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR).Witnesses at the hearing testified to the existence of political reeducation centers or camps throughout Xinjiang where upwards of 800,00 to 1 million people are held and subjected to torture, medical neglect and maltreatment, solitary confinement, sleep deprivation, and other forms of abuse resulting in the death of some detainees. Rubio pointed to Google Earth image clearly depicting the construction of the camps over a several month period. Expert witnesses also testified to the data-driven surveillance in Xinjiang assisted by iris and body scanners, voice pattern analyzers, DNA sequencers, and facial recognition camera in neighborhoods, on road, and in train stations.In February, Rubio raised concerns with Thermo Fisher Scientific, an American company supplying DNA sequencing equipment to Xinjiang police. Amid reports detailing Chinese authorities mandatory data-banking efforts in the XUAR, the letter urged Thermo Fisher Scientific to ensure its products are not being misused, especially given that China lacks the kinds of legal safeguards that other countries implement to manage their DNA databases. In May, Rubio, and CECC cochair Rep. Smith, also wrote Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross seeking answers about the sale by U.S. companies of surveillance and crime control technology used by Chinese security forces and police. The letter posed a series of questions regarding export controls and raised the possibility restricting the end-users of such technologies, in this case Xinjiang Public Security and related entities.Members of the Commission also urged the Administration to consider the application of Global Magnitsky Sanctions against senior government and Party officials in Xinjiang responsible for these rights violations, including Party Secretary Chen Quanguo. In April, Rubio and Smith wrote U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad and urged him to begin collecting information on senior officials involved with the mass detention of Uyghurs, for possible Magnitsky sanctions.A partial and rough transcript of Rubios remarks is below:What we are going to hear today is stuff from like a horrible movie. I mean just these are crazy things. Things that we've read about that used to happen thousands of years ago or things that happen under these regimes in a science fiction novel. I mean talking about forcing people to eat certain foods that violate their dietary laws of their religion, controlling what people name their children, trying to strip their identity from them both religious and ethnic. The list goes on. These are some of the most horrifying things that are happening in the world today. That it doesn't lead newscasts in the country and around the world in and of itself is problematic. And then in this free country that we have this is what I was alluding to at the beginning - we have multinational corporations who have every right, and I dont criticize them for this, they have every right to be involved civically in our countryWhen things happen in America and they dont like it, they stop selling products, they boycotted cities and towns. Theyve done all sorts of things and its their right to do so. These are the same companies that are up here every day in Washington, D.C. lobbying for us not to raise these issues so they can have access to Chinas 1.3 billion person marketplace. And I just think its hypocritical for American corporations and multinationals doing business in China, who are fully prepared to boycott American cities and American communities because they dont like things that are happening here, to be okay to turn a blind eye to whats happening and not criticize the government of China and the Communist Party because they dont want to jeopardize their ability to sell products in that country. Its an outrage. Its an embarrassment.Again, I doubt this is going to make it on the CBS Evening News or any of the cable news shows tonight. But this is outrageous and its hypocritical. And the international organizations that stand by and say nothing. Why? Because China went into someones country and built a road or a bridge. Or maybe bribed them and gave them a billion dollars to be quiet and go along. This is sick. And I just dont understand why there isnt more coverage of this and why there isnt more understanding of who we are dealing with, and what theyre up to, and what they do.And the next time someone comes to me and says, well you dont understand China, their peaceful rise. I have no problem I have tremendous admiration for the ancient culture and history of China and its people.I want China to be a key player in the world. We would love to have some help in dealing with all of the challenges on this planet. It would be great to have another superpower to partner with. But this is what these people with the power they have now. Imagine what they will do when that power grows militarily, economically, and geopolitically. Because if this is how you treat your own people, how do you expect them to treat people in some other part of the world? And I hope people wake up and understand what we are confronting here the grave crisis that it presents..Representative Smith and I wrote a letter, its dated May 9th, 2018, to [Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross]. We were asking for answers about the sale by U.S. companies selling surveillance and crime control technology that's being used by Chinese security forces and by their police. We specifically raised concerns about a company named Thermo Fisher Scientific which is a company in Massachusetts, which reportedly is selling DNA sequencers with advanced micro processors to the Chinese Ministry of Public Security and its public security bureaus across China. The reply we got from Commerce noted that these DNA sequencers have a legitimate end use. Which I'm sure they have a legitimate end use but they also have an illegitimate end useAnd so what other recourse do we have if we know that this material is being used in this manner? What other recourse do we have other than to restrict their sale despite the fact that they may have some legitimate use? Theoretically there's legitimate use for any product that's sold abroad but we don't sell these products because they are misused by the people who are buying them. Why do we continue to allow the sale of American technology to be used to commit these level of atrocities?It sounds like [Commerce Departments] answer was these companies may have legitimate business interests and make money in China selling these DNA sequencers in the whole country and most of those things they sell in the country are used legitimately and we don't want to unnecessarily burden their ability to make a profit just because a small but significant percentage of their sales might be being used in this way. And if that is the direction we're going I just find that to be unacceptable. It is true. They can buy this from other countries and other companies want to sell it to them. I think for us it comes down to the purpose of whether or not we want companies housed in the United States benefiting from American research, from our freedom, from the protection of our rule of law to somehow be complicit in whats happening here and how their technology is being used . And the fact that they are making some money in China is, in my mind, not something that should counterbalance that concern. I know you don't make the decisions but hope [this is] reported back out.The administration had an opportunity to sanction ZTE they did, basically issuing a death penalty. Allowed them to come back into business by allowing them to buy chips from Qualcomm. Qualcomm had a pending deal in China and the response of the Chinese government after the ZTE thing got finalized is to continue to slow dance Qualcomm, an American company, until the point where they have abandoned their hopes of doing business in China. Basically ,they continue to sustain their pressure while we have given concessions on some things. I hope that was enlightening for the administration.Load-Date: July 27, 2018End of Document

Continue reading Chinese AI Startups Overtake American Peers for Venture Capital Investments, Taking Away US$5 Billion   ABI Research  www.abiresearch.com (PRNewsFoto/ABI Research)SINGAPORE,    Chinese AI startups raised US$5 billion in venture capital funding in 2017 and overtook their U.S. counterparts, found ABI research, a market-foresight advisory firm providing strategic guidance on the most compelling transformative technologies. This shows that investors are confident with the technologies developed by Chinese startups, their business strategies, and market potential.The overall investment values for AI startups increased year on year by a staggering 150% globally in 2017, growing from US$4 billion in 2016 to US$10.7 billion in 2017. Contrary to their U.S. counterparts who raised US$4.4 billion of investment from 155 investments, Chinese startups raised US$4.9 billion from merely 19 investments, indicating a sharp focus by the investors on mature AI applications with strong commercial viability and successful use cases. In addition, the influence of the Chinese government plays a key role in attracting investment in AI startups.  The bullish sentiment shared among Chinese investors is a clear sign that China is going all-in in artificial intelligence (AI). The government of China is setting clear policy guidelines for the future development of AI and startups are responding with cutting edge AI technologies across many industries,  said Lian Jye Su, a Principal Analyst at ABI Research.In contrast, Europe seems to have long-term strategic objectives as far as AI investments are concerned. Startups in the region have diversified interests across different industries and verticals, mainly for use cases such as cybersecurity, digital ID, public safety, healthcare, and IoT. The United States, on the other hand, takes a more balanced approach between short-term investments that could translate into immediate commercial opportunities and long-term transformative technologies targeting key sectors such as automotive, agriculture, finance, cloud robotics platform and insurance.Among all the Chinese startups, Bytedance walks away with the highest funding. The creator of Toutiao, a personalized news aggregation app, and Douyin, a personalized video clip app, has raised over US$3 billion in investment and is enormously popular among Chinese youth, due to its content personalization and curation algorithms. Another sector that received a lot of attention was facial recognition. SenseTime and Face++ managed to raise significant funding due to the adoption of facial recognition technologies by various public agencies, payment and e-commerce companies.Chinese startups are not merely focusing on software development only as it is the case in many other industry sectors but are also deeply involved with AI chipset innovation. Cambricon Technologies and Horizon Robotics have raised US$100 million in Series A funding respectively to design and manufacture purpose-built AI chipset for machine vision. The aim to launch a  Made in China  chipset is one of the key priorities of the Chinese government. Previous attempts have been futile, but the technologies developed by Cambricon Technologies and Horizon Robotics seem to be promising. Cambricon's chipset IP has been integrated into Huawei's premium smartphones, while Horizon Robotics focuses heavily on machine vision in the automotive industry. Such a multi-prong AI investment approach in both hardware and software will ensure that the Chinese AI ecosystem continues to flourish, innovate, and stay ahead of the competition. While 2017 was a roaring success for Chinese startups, the real fruits and impact will be felt in 2018 and beyond. Already we are seeing a few startups launching new products, venturing into new business, or being acquired in 2018,  says Su. Unisound, for instance, released one of the first Made in China AI chipsets for natural language processing in 2018; Xilinx, a U.S.-based field programmable gate array (FPGA) vendor, acquired DeePhi Tech, a Beijing-based startup focusing on deep learning optimization.These findings are from ABI Research's AI Investment Monitor 2017. This report is part of the company's AI & Machine Learning research service, which includes research, data, and Executive Foresights. About ABI ResearchABI Research provides strategic guidance for visionaries needing market foresight on the most compelling transformative technologies, which reshape workforces, identify holes in a market, create new business models and drive new revenue streams.

AMBASSADOR ZHOU PINGJIAN:BLATANT TRADE BULLYING WILL ONLY BACKFIREStates News ServiceJuly 28, 2018 SaturdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1310 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: BEIJING, China BodyThe following information was released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China:From Chinese Embassy in NigeriaNigerian leading newspaper Authority, Peoples Daily and Leadership published an article written by Ambassador of China to Nigeria Dr.ZHOU Pingjian. The full text goes as follows: On July 20, The United States threatened to impose tariffs on all US$500 billion worth of Chinese imports. Earlier on July 6, the U.S. announced to impose 25 percent tariffs on US$34 billion worth of Chinese goods. On July 11, the U.S. further escalated by announcing a tariff list of Chinese products worth US$200 billion. Where the trade war waged by the U.S. against China is heading to? The world is wondering. China's position regarding the trade war willfully ignited by the U.S. remains firm and clear. China doesn't want a trade war, but is not afraid of and will fight one when necessary. Threats and intimidation will never work on China. China is capable of and confident in safeguarding the interests of the Chinese people. The U.S. should be advised to remain calm and handle the relevant issue with a rational attitude. Trade bullying will only backfire. The main criticism that the U.S. makes against China centers around the trade deficit America runs with China. However, when it comes to trade, imbalance does not mean unfairness as the flow of trade is determined by the market. China has never deliberately sought a trade surplus. Having a trade deficit does not mean the U.S. is "losing". It is an erroneous accusation that China has been long engaging in unfair trade practices which have benefited itself and shortchanged the United States. Let me take the daily Apple here. When an iPhone assembled in China arrives in the U.S., it is recorded as an import at its factory cost of about US$240, which is added to the U.S.-China trade deficit by the U.S. side. China, however, earns just about US$8.46, or 3.6 percent of the total factory cost or less than 1 percent of the value in terms of retail price in the transaction, while most of the profits go straight to the coffers of Apple Inc. and high-tech enterprises of other countries on relevant industrial supply chains. Or take the Made-in-China suit. When China exports a US$450 worth of business suit to the U.S., China gets 5 percent of the profit while the U.S. gets 84 percent. Can these figures be cited to prove that the U.S. is shortchanged in its trade deals with China and China is playing a zero-sum game here with the U.S.? The main reasons for the deficits do not lie on the Chinese side. Generally, they result from how resources are allocated in an interconnected global economy and are natural reflections of the global value chain and international division of labour. In particular, there are certain factors inevitably lead to trade deficits. The savings rate in the U.S. remains too low while consumption rate remains too high. The U.S. dollar serves as the international reserve currency. And, the U. S. government imposes restrictions on high-tech exports to China. The United States has further accused China of so-called "theft of intellectual property" and "forced technology transfer," charges which are neither fair nor objective. The Chinese government has codified a robust IPR protection legal system, including setting up IPR courts and dedicated tribunals that enhance the dominant role of the judiciary in IPR protection. Meanwhile, in 2017 the intellectual property royalties paid by China reached US$28.6 billion, a 15-fold increase from 2001 when it joined the WTO, running a deficit of more than US$20 billion. US$7.13 billion went to the US with a yearly increase of 14 percent. More importantly, China is emerging as a leader in global innovation and brand-building. According to the latest Global Innovation Index (GII) released by the WIPO, China has been the only mid-income economy on the list of the world's 20 most innovative economies. The growth miracle of China's economic development has never been achieved by stealing from anyone, and never will be. The accusation of "forced technology transfer" is also pointless and groundless. China does not have laws and policies that compel foreign companies to transfer technology to Chinese companies when investing in China. When it comes to technology or any other cooperation between Chinese and foreign companies, it is purely a matter of voluntary contracts. One is willing to buy, and the other is willing to sell, which is mutually beneficial. In the world of today, all countries have been economically integrated into the global industrial and value chain to varying degrees. 40 percent of China's commodity exports and two thirds of its high-tech exports are manufactured by foreign enterprises in China. We are all interdependent and our interests are closely intertwined. Clinging to the outdated zero-sum game mindset and willfully provoking a trade war will harm the interests of not only the two parties involved but also all other parties in the global industrial chain. It will produce no winners. By launching a trade war not only with China, but also with the world, the United States is dragging the world economy into a treacherous zone. The trade war dampens the growth momentum of global trade. The trade war shakes everyone's confidence in the world economy. The trade war jeopardizes the well-being of all mankind. Last but not least, initiating a trade war to serve domestic political needs and selfish interests is a typical act of unilateralism and zero-sum game. It marks a full-blown regression of international rules and global governance since the end of the Second World War, which, if unchecked, will cut so deep to the world economy that everybody should be alarmed by this. The U.S. is firing at the whole world as well as itself, and will only end up hurting itself and the world. President of the European Council Donald Tusk, who just wrapped up the 20th China-EU Summit in Beijing, said in June that the rules-based international system is under threat, and to everyone's surprise, the threat comes from no one but the U.S. who built up this system. Many prominent international economists including President Adam Posen of the US Peterson Institute for International Economics also publicly said that today's US government constitutes the biggest threat to the current world economic order. China has never imposed unilateral measures on others, nor has it acted against the basics of the WTO, namely free and open trade, non-discrimination, tariff constraints and special and differential treatment, and China has not the slightest intention of doing these things in the future. Openness brings progress. China will continue to press ahead with trade reform and opening up its markets, and work with the rest of the world to uphold free trade and the multilateral trading system. President Xi Jinping announced four major initiatives to further open the Chinese market at the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference in April. Subsequently, the Chinese government introduced specific measures, including drastically reducing tariffs on a range of imported goods. Tariffs on 1,500 types of consumer goods have been lowered considerably. The import tariff on automobiles has been cut from 25 percent to 15 percent. The revised negative list for foreign investment released late June substantially eased market access restrictions for foreign investors. In November, China will host the ever first China International Import Expo in Shanghai. China will only become more and more open. China is willing to work together with Nigeria to further open our respective markets to each other, uphold the multilateral trading system and oppose acts of unilateralism, in a bid to safeguard the common interests of human development and prosperity.Load-Date: July 30, 2018End of Document

China Unicom & China Telecom Potential Merger Reports Oita Sumitomo CorporatePR NewswireSeptember 5, 2018 Wednesday 11:34 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 406 wordsDateline: TOKYO, Sept. 5, 2018 Body Oita Sumitomo Corporateanalysts have suggested that China is considering the option of combining the nation's two wireless carriers.This is because of the urge to develop 5G Internet and takeover the US to dominate mobile technology. A proposal review is ongoing to look at the possibilities of combining these companies but an agreement is yet to be reached on the matter.However, the importance of 5G technology cannot be overemphasized, as it has the power to effect a positive revolution on how we use everything ranging from household appliances to cars."The most important task to China right now is the achievement of success in 5G and merger is the perfect strategy" said Matthew Andrews, Head of Corporate Trading atOita Sumitomo Corporate.As several speculations were being made by the Chinese media, on the possibilities of combining these companies, executives at Unicom and China Telecom have debunked this at their recent earnings briefing last month.The two companies made it clear that they were not aware of the merger. Even the state owned asset supervision and administration commission together with the ministry of industry and information technology has refused to make a statement on this.There have been several reasons that have made China government to consider a merger between the two carriers for years. One of which is the escalating tension between China and the US."A major effect of this on China, is that the Chinese government would have to sacrifice the advantages of local competition over the speed of 5G adoption by reducing its phone operators to two whereas most markets in the world have three to four." Added Callum Price, Senior Vice President atOita Sumitomo Corporate.The Qualcomm Broadcomm deal, which the US opposed would have left a big opportunity for the Chinese government to expand its 5G standard setting process. According to several reportsOita Sumitomo Corporateresearch analysts commented saying that China holds a narrow lead over the US and South Korea in its readiness in 5G revolution.This is as a result of President XI Jinping's "Made In China" 2025 agenda to make the country a leader in a range of high tech industries, which has led proactive government policies and industry momentum. View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/china-unicom--china-telecom-potential-merger-reports-oita-sumitomo-corporate-300707252.htmlSOURCE Oita Sumitomo CorporateCONTACT: Media - Michael Yukichi, m.yukichi@oscinternational.comLoad-Date: September 6, 2018End of Document

EU does not hesitate: the trade war against China will escalateCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 11, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 450 wordsBody The United States published a list of products imported from China for 200,000 million dollars per year, which would impose a tariff of 10%, as a result of the commercial reprisals established by the government of Chinese President Xi Jinping on US merchandise.  The White House Trade Representation (USTR) published the list of assets on Tuesday and set a schedule for a public hearing and comments that end on August 30 before the rates are imposed, on a date to define.  Among the products listed are some types of pork and beef, fish, crustaceans, butter, eggs, vegetables, fruits, cereals, food, minerals, chemicals, fabrics, clothing, metals, machines and auto parts.  "As a result of China&#39;s reprisals and lack of change in its practices, the president (Donald Trump) ordered the USTR to begin the process of imposing tariffs of 10% over 200 billion additional dollars of Chinese imports," he said on Tuesday. Robert Lighthizer, commercial representative of the White House, in a statement.  "This is an appropriate response under the authority of Section 301 to achieve the elimination of China&#39;s harmful industrial policies," he said.  On March 22, the USTR released the results of an investigation of Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 on the practices of the Chinese government regarding the transfer of technology and intellectual property.  The report details four methods that the Chinese government uses to unfairly advance its industrial policy objectives: forced transfer of intellectual property or technology; discriminatory licensing restrictions; acquisition of technology and assets coordinated or supported by the State, and use of cyber intrusions to obtain unauthorized access to confidential corporate information. Consequently, the United States imposed tariffs as of last Friday on imported Chinese products worth 36,000 million dollars, to which China replied with equivalent measures.  Trump reported last Thursday that will apply import taxes for another 14,000 million dollars to Chinese goods in a couple of weeks, to add 50,000 million dollars.  Additionally, Trump warned that if China responded with retaliation to the United States (which it did) it would fix more tariffs on Chinese imported products, first for 200,000 million dollars and then for another 300,000 million dollars.  "We have been very clear and detailed with regard to the specific changes that China should undertake. Unfortunately, China has not changed its behavior, a behavior that puts the future of the US economy at risk. Instead of addressing our legitimate concerns, China has begun to retaliate against American products, "said Robert Lighthizer.  rmorales@eleconomista.com.mx  Load-Date: July 11, 2018End of Document

CHINA: WHERE ARE THEY: TIME FOR ANSWERS ABOUT MASS DETENTION IN THE XINJIANG UIGHUR AUTONOMOUS REGIONStates News ServiceSeptember 25, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1339 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, NY BodyThe following information was released by Amnesty International USA:China must end its campaign of systematic repression and shed light on the fate of up to one million predominantly Muslim people arbitrarily detained in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR), Amnesty International said in a new briefing published today.The past year has seen an intensifying government campaign of mass internment, intrusive surveillance, political indoctrination and forced cultural assimilation against the region's Uighurs, Kazakhs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic groups. Most of the detainees' families have been kept in the dark about their loved ones' fate and are often too frightened to speak out."The Chinese government must not be allowed to continue this vicious campaign against ethnic minorities in northwest China. Governments across the world must hold the Chinese authorities to account for the nightmare unfolding in the XUAR," said Nicholas Bequelin, Amnesty International's East Asia Director."Families have suffered enough. Hundreds of thousands of families have been torn apart by this massive crackdown. They are desperate to know what has happened to their loved ones and it is time the Chinese authorities give them answers."In a new briefing, China: Where are they? Time for answers about mass detentions in Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, Amnesty International highlights the anguish of people who have lost touch with relatives and friends inside the XUAR and who fear they have been detained.The organization interviewed more than 100 people outside of China whose relatives in XUAR are still missing, as well as individuals who were tortured while in detention camps there.Mass detentionThe internment of predominantly Muslim ethnic groups in the XUAR has intensified since March 2017, when a "Regulation on De-extremification" was adopted in the region. Open or even private displays of religious and cultural affiliation, including growing an "abnormal" beard, wearing a veil or headscarf, regular prayer, fasting or avoidance of alcohol, or possessing books or articles about Islam or Uighur culture can be considered "extremist" under the regulation.Travel abroad for work or education, particularly to majority Muslim countries, or contact with people outside China are also major reasons for suspicion. Male, female; young, old; urban, rural, all are at risk of being detained.The ubiquitous security checks that are now a routine part of daily life for all in the XUAR provide ample opportunity to search mobile phones for suspicious content or check people's identities using facial recognition software.Individuals might come under suspicion through routine monitoring of messages sent on social media apps like WeChat, which does not use end-to-end encryption. Use of alternative messaging apps with encryption, such as WhatsApp, can also be a cause for detention.The authorities label the camps as centres for "transformation-through-education", but many simply call them "re-education camps". Those sent to detention camps are not put on trial, have no access to lawyers or right to challenge the decision. Individuals could be left to languish in detention for months, as it is the authorities who decide when an individual has been "transformed".Kairat Samarkan was sent to a detention camp in October 2017, after he returned to the XUAR following a short visit to neighbouring Kazakhstan. Police told him he was detained because he was accused of having dual citizenship and had betrayed his country. He was released in February 2018.Kairat told Amnesty that he was hooded, made to wear shackles on his arms and legs and was forced to stand in a fixed position for 12 hours when first detained. There were nearly 6,000 people held in the same camp, where they were forced to sing political songs and study speeches of the Chinese Communist Party. They could not talk to each other and were forced to chant "Long live Xi Jinping" before meals. Kairat told Amnesty that his treatment drove him to attempt suicide just before his release.Those who resist or fail to show enough progress reportedly face punishments ranging from verbal abuse to food deprivation, solitary confinement, beatings and use of restraints and stress positions. There have been reports of deaths inside the facilities, including suicides of those unable to bear the mistreatment.The authorities justify the extreme measures as necessary for counter terrorism purposes and to ensure national security. However, measures to protect citizens from attacks must be necessary and proportionate and as narrow and targeted as possible to address a specific threat."The mass detention camps are places of brainwashing, torture and punishment. A simple act of messaging your family abroad can get you detained highlights how ludicrous, unjustified and completely arbitrary the Chinese authorities' actions are," said Nicholas Bequelin.Families torn apartFor months, relatives of the missing kept their anguish to themselves. They hoped the loss of contact with loved ones back home would be temporary. They feared making things worse if they sought outside help. Now, with no clear end in sight for their torment, more and more are willing to speak up.Bota Kussaiyn, an ethnic Kazakh student studying at Moscow State University, last spoke with her father, Kussaiyn Sagymbai, over WeChat in November 2017. Originally from the XUAR, their family had re-settled in Kazakhstan in 2013.Bota's father had returned to China in late 2017 to see a doctor, but the authorities confiscated his passport after he arrived in the XUAR. Bota subsequently learnt from relatives there that her father had been sent to a "re-education camp".Her relatives in the XUAR were so afraid that further contact might put them under suspicion that they stopped communicating with her after that.Bota told Amnesty: "My father is an ordinary citizen. We were a happy family before he was detained. We laughed together. We can't laugh any more, and we can't sleep at night. We live in fear every day. It has done great harm to my mother. We don't know where he is. We don't even know if he's still alive. I want to see my father again."Many relatives and friends abroad report feelings of guilt, because it seems to be precisely these overseas connections that in many cases are causing their loved ones in the XUAR to fall under suspicion. The authorities accuse them of having ties to outside groups the Chinese government alleges promote "extremist" religious views or plot "terrorist activity".To avoid arousing such suspicion, Uighurs, Kazakhs and others inside the XUAR have reportedly been cutting all ties with friends and family living outside China. They warn acquaintances not to call and delete outside contacts from social media applications. Unable to get reliable information from home, many living abroad inevitably fear the worst.When parents are taken away, children are left to suffer, with many families experiencing economic hardship. Older children might be sent to state-run vocational training centres, while younger ones can wind up in one of the massive "welfare centres" that have been constructed since 2017.SpyingAdding to the pressure on those living abroad are aggressive efforts by Chinese security officials to recruit spies in overseas communities. Those targeted are reportedly threatened that if they do not cooperate, family members back in the XUAR will be detained. If they do cooperate, on the other hand, they receive promises that their loved ones will be treated leniently.Not knowing who among the community living overseas might be reporting back to security authorities in China plants seeds of suspicion and distrust that take root and further feed the sense of isolation and fear."The Chinese authorities' systematic campaign of suppression is having a devastating toll on the lives of millions of people. It's time the authorities come clean about the camps and let families be reunited," said Nicholas Bequelin.Load-Date: September 26, 2018End of Document

Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us this Wednesday.I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Wednesday, August 1st. Your top stories right now 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.Escalating trade tensions once again -- the Trump administration reportedly looking to make the tariffs on China even tougher, raising them to 25 percent, up from the expected 10 percent. The President slamming China at a rally just last night.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We've taken the toughest ever actions in response to China's abusive trade practices. This has been too many years of abuse, $500 billion a year.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Well, the uncertainty has markets basically stalled. The Dow Industrials down 50 points right now, a quarter of a percent lower; S&P 500 is flat, down just 3 points; but the Nasdaq is up this morning, up about 11.25 points. We've got Apple on the move.Investors are also watching the Federal Reserve decision. No changes expected from the Fed later today. We are waiting for any signal about future interest rate hikes and the environment right now in terms of inflation.The sector gained across the board yesterday on Wall Street -- take a look. Dow Industrials picking up 108 points at the close, up almost one-half of 1 percent; S&P 500 also up a half a percent; as was the Nasdaq with a move of 42 points higher on Nasdaq.Global markets this morning are lower. FT100 really worsening in the last half an hour, down 111 points right now, that's 1.5 percent lower on the FT100; the CAC 40 is down 6 points; and the DAX index in Germany down a third of a percent, 50 points lower there.In Asia overnight mixed performances there as well. China was the worst performer. Shanghai composite down almost 2 percent.Earnings still in focus on Wall Street, Apple is set to open at an all-time record high this morning after beating expectations last night with its quarterly numbers. The stock is up almost 4 percent.We're also watching Tesla. It is going to be reporting after the close tonight. Investors are focused on the burn rate of cash. How much is this company burning of cash every quarter?Meanwhile, there's this -- honoring our heroes today, Vice President Mike Pence arriving in Hawaii where he will participate in a ceremony to receive the remains of those service men and women killed in action during the Korean War.A legal battle over blueprints for weapons -- a judge blocking the release of software that would allow people to print 3D guns.Plus, a new take on an American classic, one artist re-imagines "Washington Crossing the Delaware", with "Trump crossing the Swamp". The painting is going viral this morning.All those stories coming up this Wednesday morning. And joining me to break it all down -- Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; the CEO of Rosecliff and managing partner Mike Murphy; and national security analyst Morgan Ortagus. Good morning. Great to see you.MORGAN ORTAGUS, NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Good morning. The shots of Vice President Pence getting the remains are just really moving I think for all Americans, but especially those of us who have served and had, you know, had our friends and colleagues pass away overseas.It's really beautiful I think that if you died last week or a month ago in Iraq or Afghanistan or you died decades ago, how much America values our service members' lives.BARTIROMO: You're right. And it's real emotional for Vice President Pence as his father served in the Korean War and actually got the Bronze Star.Lots of stuff happening.MIKE MURPHY, MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL: Yes. Making progress, for sure.ORTAGUS: And I believe his son is in the Marines as well.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: It helps refocus our attention on what was a brutal conflict, a brutal war. And those people who have been forgotten. It's one war that we fought so valiantly that people sadly don't remember it as well as others.ORTAGUS: You're right.BARTIROMO: We're also watching Apple this morning. Looks like you're going to win that bet with Kevin Kelly.MCDOWELL: So here's the price we're watching for -- $203.45 a share. When Apple breaks through that mark it will be the first $1 trillion market cap U.S. company, so I'm watching for that. But it was an incredible quarter.And I think that we were talking about the iPhone sales, so it's about how much Apple can still charge for an iPhone. And the average selling price for one of its phones was $724 a phone which was above analyst expectations. So those numbers they've got to keep going up in order to really help drive this business and then services.BARTIROMO: So the services revenue.MURPHY: Services -- and I think you're going to see as Wall Street analysts get up and start going through these numbers, I think you're going to see upgrades. I think you're going to see recommendations to put new money to work in Apple, gets it to $203 for Dagen.MCDOWELL: And overall earnings are up almost 24 percent. We have about 63 percent of companies in the S&P 500 have reported -- really incredible quarter, much better than analysts were anticipating as we started this.BARTIROMO: Yes, earnings very solid. And you've got to look at the tax cut plan and the rolling back of regulations that has really empowered S&P 500 in terms of their earnings.But one thing that you said earlier which was really interesting is the way Apple trades because even though the earnings are up strong, double-digit earnings growth, the stock is trading at what?MURPHY: It's trading 15 times earnings. So it's trading like a value stock -- not a high growth company that it is.BARTIROMO: The broader markets 17?MURPHY: Yes -- 17. But then if you look at the tech companies -- the Amazon and the Googles of the world -- they're trading at a much higher -- or Netflix, much higher multiples. So if Apple traded even remotely like one of those high growth tech companies, which it should -- it's a higher stock.BARTIROMO: Yes. I think Netflix is trading at like more than a hundred times cash flow.MURPHY: Yes.BARTIROMO: Or something just like that.All right. We've got all of that coming up but first, we want to talk about a trade standoff with China which continues. Some White House advisors are proposing that the President apply tariffs as high as 25 percent on $200 billion of imported Chinese goods, according to the "Wall Street Journal". That would be an increase from the original proposal which was a 10 percent tariff.The President weighed in on the economic relationship between the U.S. and China last night during a rally in Florida.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We've taken the toughest ever actions in response to China's abusive trade practices. And we're doing very well with China, very well. And I have a lot of respect for China and I have tremendous respect for President Xi of China.But this has been too many years of abuse -- $500 billion a year, $500 billion. We've helped rebuild China. We can't do that anymore.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is the author of "The Coming Collapse of China", Gordon Chang. Gordon -- good to see you. Thanks very much for joining us.We knew this wasn't going to go away any time soon. But your thoughts on the potential of an even escalating issue where he goes to 25 percent from 10 percent on Chinese goods.GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR: I think the President's got to do that, as regrettable as it is. You know, the President gave relief to ZTE, the embattled Chinese telecom equipment manufacturer. That was undeserved. But that really was an olive branch to the Chinese. What do they do? Well, a week ago today they did not give approval to Qualcomm's take over of NXP.BARTIROMO: Right.CHANG: And remember the regulators, the state administration of market regulation in China actually approved this deal. Xi Jinping, the Chinese ruler says no, I'm not going to do it which means you really can't negotiate with the Chinese at this particular time. Xi Jinping is in trouble at home and this means that you just got to pile on the pressure.ORTAGUS: Yes. And speaking of him being in trouble at home, "The New York Times" had a story out yesterday just about this, about him facing criticism at home for the economic state of China and the amount of control. "The Financial Times" over the weekend had a piece talking about how the Chinese actually view the President as a master strategist -- very different from how he's viewed here.CHANG: Yes.ORTAGUS: What do you take on what we're seeing being reported out of Asia, about Xi Jinping having quite a bit of criticism at home over the economy?CHANG: Yes. This is -- there are a lot of symptoms of Xi Jinping's problems at home. And it's not being reported in the "People's Daily" as much as you would expect. You have a lot of criticism now in the open. This was unprecedented.And so I think that essentially what we're seeing -- we don't know exactly what's going on because it is an extremely opaque system. But the point is that Xi Jinping is in stress. And that --ORTAGUS: But the criticism is unprecedented?CHANG: The criticism is more than we've ever seen of Xi Jinping.ORTAGUS: Wow.CHANG: And it's sort of natural because remember, he took control of the economy. As the general secretary of the Communist Party, he didn't have the economics portfolio. He took it over from the premier. Now things are going badly. And so of course, he owns it.(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: I just want to add one thing. The "Wall Street Journal" editorial page today writes about this very thing. Be careful claiming victory in this trade fight over China with the Chinese economy is slowing. Chinese stocks have lost about a fifth of their value since January.BARTIROMO: And the yuan -- don't forget about the yuan.MCDOWELL: But this is because of China's policies. They were trying to deleverage that started two years ago because of the rapid buildup in corporate debt and they're reopening the monetary spigots in China.So again, this is a narrative that's starting to develop here at home that the U.S. is winning. The U.S. is slowing China's economy. It's worth noting that nobody wins a trade war. You just get hurt a little bit less.And China, the reason they're in this pickle, is because of their own doing. And now they're reversing it.BARTIROMO: What I worry about is, are tariffs really the answer? Are tariffs really going to get the Chinese to change their behavior? I mean the big problem here is the constant theft of intellectual property and the forced transfer of technology that China continues to engage in. They don't even admit that they're engaging in it and they are.Just because they're going to be paying a 25 percent tariff on $200 billion goods, does that really change a culture of theft?CHANG: No, it doesn't because this is embedded in the Chinese system --BARTIROMO: Right.CHANG: -- and it's also embedded in Xi Jinping who actually believes that there should be more state control of the economy, that China should close up its markets and demand access to the American and other markets. So, you know, tariffs are not the only answer.BARTIROMO: So what is? Then we will stop it.CHANG: Well, I think that you know --BARTIROMO: Is there any way to stop it?CHANG: Now. We're in an all-out fight.BARTIROMO: Right.CHANG: And this means, you know, implications that no one really wants to think about but clearly, you know, Xi Jinping is not letting this go which means that we're going to have to probably go beyond tariffs. We're going to maybe even have to have import bans, you know -- all sorts of things that now are inconceivable.ORTAGUS: The CFIUS bill.CHANG: And CFIUS. It is going to be --BARTIROMO: Well yes -- CFIUS is getting strong but there are a lot of things that CFIUS can't do even though they're making CFIUS stronger.MURPHY: So Gordon -- if the Chinese government -- if the tariffs bring them to the table to just have a fair trade deal with the U.S. isn't that the very important -- a vital step one to having -- as Maria pointed out -- a step?So if we don't get them to the table for a fair trade deal, we're never going to be able to talk to them about stopping theft. So I think what we're doing right now, what the President is doing right now is a vital first step to solving this.CHANG: Absolutely. I mean because everything else doesn't work. You know, people say well, let's go to the WTO -- World Trade Organization. We've won every case against China since 2004 and China's behavior has just gotten worse. And before 2004 we were winning most of the cases anyway.You know, also, you know when Steve Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary says let's go talk to them -- well, that just does not work.BARTIROMO: Right.(CROSSTALK)CHANG: So clearly --BARTIROMO: There's a -- they don't believe in patents. There's a mentality that they just -- everything is open, you know, just take it. You know, I like that idea, I'm going to take it.CHANG: Yes.BARTIROMO: It's just crazy, actually. There's an op-ed this morning in the "New York Times" from Stephen Moore, Art Laffer and Steve Forbes. They're calling on President Trump to end the tariffs by taking a page from President Reagan's strategy for nuclear disarmament.The article reads this in part, "Just as no one ever thought Mr. Reagan would stem nuclear proliferation, if Mr. Trump aggressively pursues this policy, he could build a legacy as the President who expanded world commerce and economic freedom by ending trade barriers rather than erecting them."This is what the President is trying to do. He walked away from the E.U. the other, saying yes, we're moving towards no tariffs, no subsidies.CHANG: Yes. Last Wednesday was a landmark, you know, because before that, everyone was saying you know, Trump is bringing down the global trading system. Well, no, he's not. What' he's doing is he's actually reducing tariff barriers because if that deal with the E.U. actually gets implemented, and it probably will, there's not going to be any tariffs on non-automotive products.MCDOWELL: But if he believes that then he should stop bragging about how awesome the steel industry is in this country because of the tariffs that he's put on steel and aluminum. Again it's a handout to that union. That steelworkers union has been pushing the Democrats for this kind of deal for years and he brags about the steel industry.Well, the steel industry employs about 140,000 to 170,000 people. Steel consuming industries that are getting hurt that are raising prices, that are seeing disruption and chaos in their businesses -- they employ 6.5 million people. So again you're saving the few and rescuing the few and sacrificing the many.BARTIROMO: And even the whole idea of no tariffs, I mean -- is the E.U. going to give up $150 billion?MCDOWELL: They already pushed back.MURPHY: They might have to, right.MCDOWELL: They already --BARTIROMO: That's what I'm saying. Are all these countries going to say ok, no tariffs, forget it, even though we've been making $100 billion on the U.S. for years.MURPHY: But if it opens up trade to them it could actually be beneficial and they may not have a choice.BARTIROMO: Ok. Yes. Good point.MCDOWELL: They already pushed back on agricultural products. They said we're not talking about agricultural products.BARTIROMO: And they're not talking about autos.CHANG: Yes.MCDOWELL: No.(CROSSTALK)CHANG: The important point is 4.1 percent growth in Q2, you know, China is growing in reality less than half that. Everyone needs the U.S. market. And so that's the reason why you're absolutely right, we are going to have a much lower tariff environment because people need to sell to America.BARTIROMO: That's his stick -- very strong economy, $19 trillion economy and they want this market.Gordon -- good to see you.CHANG: Thanks -- Maria.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much.Stay with us for our "Jobs in America" coverage this Friday, 8:00 a.m. Eastern. We've got more economic news. The jobs numbers will be out and we will identify where the jobs are.First though plans for printing 3D guns put on hold -- the latest legal battle after a judge temporarily halts the release of blueprints for the firearms, next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.A sheriff's deputy in Missouri rushed to a hospital after being attacked by a dog.Cheryl Casone with the details now -- Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Yes -- Maria.Take a look at this. The Jefferson County Sheriff's Department in Missouri released this photo showing a deputy's blood-soaked uniform. The pit bull bit the deputy in the face and arm when the deputy approached a side door of a home while serving a civil summons.The deputy was able to reach his weapons and he shot the dog. He was then rushed to the hospital where he had to go -- he underwent surgery to repair injuries in particular to his face and especially his lip. The pit bull survived its wound. It's up to animal control now what happens next.Meanwhile in Massachusetts, a small town is losing its entire police force of four members. The Blandford police department have quit. They're blaming unsafe working conditions. Among their complaints -- ill-fitting bulletproof vests that are outdated, they need to be replaced; malfunctioning radios; and occasionally they have to drive their own cars if they want to respond to calls and forget backup.Well there's a new food recall to tell you about. Federal health officials warning consumers not to buy more than two dozen salads and wraps that are distributed to Kroger, Walgreen's and Trade Joe stores. The food might be contaminated with a parasite. The products have sell by dates from July 18th to July 23rd. Shares of Walgreens' parent company are actually down 4 percent this year. That's Boots Alliance.And then speaking of Kroger, a subsidiary of the company in California will no longer accept Visa credit and debit cards at its 21 grocery stores. Kroger and Visa are in a dispute over swipe fees right now.And then one more note on Kroger. They're launching a grocery delivery service as a bid to take on Amazon and Wal-Mart. Take a look at Kroger shares, that stock is actually up 8 percent so far this year. We'll see how the delivery service goes.And then finally there is this, if you like sugar, take a look at this -- the world's largest gummy pizza. This is all made of gummy bears. Foodies at Vat 19 came up with this. It's a gummy pizza. It weighs 225 pounds. And then for the flavor, they've got orange gummies for the crust, strawberry and banana is the cheese.And then they're actually selling the slices for $150 each -- huge slices for $150 each. I mean that's a lot of sugar. I have a sweet tooth, Maria, but I don't know.BARTIROMO: That's not pizza. That's not even pizza. It's sugar.MCDOWELL: I wish we had the camera on your face when you saw that dude take a bite of the gummy pizza for the first time. It was hilarious.MURPHY: I'm with you -- Maria.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: You want tomato sauce, you want the cheese, mozzarella -- I mean, come on.ORTAGUS: You're offending this Italian-American woman here.BARTIROMO: Gummy pizza -- not.MCDOWELL: All right. That's why you watch this program, because you just heard Maria Bartiromo say mozzarella. There's just nothing better --BARTIROMO: Mozzarella. Ok. Thank you -- Cheryl.Coming up, a major shakeup at Southwest, how the company is changing a long-standing policy in the skies. You'll want to hear this.Then turning a campaign slogan into art -- check this out -- how one painter is taking inspiration from President Trump's 2016 election campaign later this hour.And I'll speak exclusively with the CEO of Hologic, Steve MacMillan is here. We're getting his take on where the company's quarterly earnings are, the health of the health care industry. They make those 3D mammography machines. You'll want to hear from him.Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Earnings alert -- global women's health giant Hologic reporting third quarter earnings last night. The company reporting earnings 58 cents a share on $824 million in revenue -- both above analyst expectations for the quarter. The medical technology company also raising its full year earnings and revenue guidance.And joining me right now in a Fox Business Exclusive is the CEO of Hologic -- Steve MacMillan. Great to see you Steve. Thanks very much for joining us.STEVE MACMILLAN, CEO, HOLOGIC: Great to see you again -- Maria. Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: What drove the quarter from your standpoint?MACMILLAN: I think the best part was really the standout in our breast health business as well as our international business. And breast health just e continues to be very strong with our 3D mammography. We continue to get more clinical claims.You know, we're now approved for dense breasts. We're the only ones that have 3D for dense breasts. And we just keep gaining market share in the U.S.And then internationally where we made a lot of investments a couple years ago also really paying off. We've had seven straight quarters of double digit international growth.BARTIROMO: I want to talk about international growth for sure. And I also want to get your take on the tariffs conversation we're having.But in terms of the breast health and the 3D mammography machines, this is a really important product. It's really driven your business for the last couple years I would say.Tell us about the false positives. When you having something so specific like that, 3D mammography, are there more false positives for women than not?MACMILLAN: No. I'm so glad you asked that. The great part about the 3D is it's dramatically reducing the number of false positives. So what we have going on is we're both finding more cancers earlier, but we've been dramatically reducing the false positives.And as you know, that's one of the big problems with, you know, 2D and the older technologies and then the result of that is you're asking women to go in and have biopsies that don't even need them.So I think the great part about 3D, and it's probably the hidden gem, while it was designed to detect cancers better, it's actually reduced the false positives by large percentage. So we've got a lot fewer women having to get biopsies that don't need them.BARTIROMO: There's been a feeling that you have to get a mammography when you're 50? Is that still the line that doctors are prescribing?MACMILLAN: Well very much -- and really --BARTIROMO: Even lower -- younger.MACMILLAN: Mostly 40, unless you have a history of breast cancer in your family.BARTIROMO: Usually 40, unless you have a history, then you do it at 50.MACMILLAN: No, then you should even come younger if there's a history in the family because, you know, there are women in their 20s and 30s that we are often diagnosing depending on if they had a history.BARTIROMO: But is there a danger to getting a mammography too soon?MACMILLAN: You know, there's always some concerns about radiation exposure. The reality is the radiation exposure is less than a cross- country airplane flight.BARTIROMO: Ok.MACMILLAN: You know, so I think it's one of those myths that's a lot bigger.BARTIROMO: Interesting. That's an important myth.MACMILLAN: You never want to overdo it.BARTIROMO: I mean --MACMILLAN: Well, yes. You hear people talk about it and in fact it's very little exposure.BARTIROMO: Tell me about the international business. Where was the growth? And what are you expecting to be the big drivers in the coming years?MACMILLAN: Sure. I think what we're really excited about is actually both our European and our Asian business -- but our European business is showing some really strong growth behind really all of our franchises -- our breast health business, our diagnostics business, as well as our surgical business.And we put new leadership into our European business a few years ago. They've really gotten their sea legs and are really driving the business behind all of our products.BARTIROMO: So do you think that you're going to get tariffed on your mammography machines?MACMILLAN: We are a little worried about that, you know. We'll see where this goes. As were you talking earlier, you know, I'm not sure tariffs are really the great way to fight some of these battles.China has now talked about putting tariffs on mammography machines. You know, we're actually one of the rare companies that still produces 100 percent of our mammography machines are actually made in Danbury, Connecticut -- right up the road. We're probably the last people that actually produce in Connecticut of all things. But you know.So we are a net exporter of our machines because of the quality, everything else. We've made it. So it is that uncertainty as we go into next year. The analysts, of course are trying to figure out what would be the impact. So, you know, we would prefer that the tariff stuff kind of dies down here and gets settled.BARTIROMO: How has your business been with China? Do you have to partner up with a Chinese company? And did you feel that you were having to force technology and innovation to the Chinese?MACMILLAN: It's always been that challenge. We had actually made a couple of small acquisitions there that, frankly, didn't pan out very well. It's the classic you buy them and then the people leave and kind of start up a competitor.BARTIROMO: Exactly, after you transferred your technology. That's what the President is trying to stop.MACMILLAN: Exactly. So that's -- as you were talking earlier, it's the intellectual property theft that's probably the bigger issue there --BARTIROMO: Right. Sure.MACMILLAN: -- and it's the harder issue to address. So we're now building our business more steadily with our own employees there we can monitor the practices. It's a little slower build but it's much more enduring and should prevail over time.BARTIROMO: Tell us about Cynosure -- this was sort of the blow-up that everybody was worried about in the last quarter. Have things stabilized? What can you tell us about Cynosure right now?MACMILLAN: Sure. You know, this is clearly an acquisition we did a little over a year ago to get into the medical aesthetics space. Culturally it's been a bigger transition for us. You know, for a company that's deeply rooted in science and strong clinical evidence, we thought we could bring that to the medical aesthetics industry. And it's exactly what we are bringing to it.The cultural shift right at the beginning, we lost some salespeople as we clamped down on some practices. But I think the great part about this quarter was the team that stayed plus the new team really starting to deliver. And I think that was the real excitement in the report last night that we exceeded the estimates for the quarter on that business.And I think it's taken us a year but we've got it on track now and feeling really good that we can bring more science to that part of the industry.BARTIROMO: You've also announced that you're acquiring Faxitron Bioptics for $85 million, along with a shift in the corporate management structure. At this point, are there more holes to fill in terms of acquisitions? Tell us what this acquisition does.MACMILLAN: Sure, this is a great one. You know, part of -- as we're identifying cancers earlier in women, we're able -- one of the growth areas is actually what we call breast conserving surgery. So instead of women having to have full-blown mastectomies as we confine cancer smaller and earlier; one of the key areas is to be able to go in and just remove the cancer and not have to take out the whole breast.So Faxitron actually has some of the localization technology that help the surgeons mark it and be able to just go in and get just the cancer. You know, in the old days, you think about surgery, how it's evolved and everything -- whether it's hips, knees, you know, breast, anything. We'd just go in and -- you know, carve out as much as we can. And everything is trying to get smaller and smaller. So, Faxitron is going to fit beautifully into that space for us.BARTIROMO: That's fantastic. The House voted to repeal the medical device tax last week. If this tax ends up being implemented in 2020, what effect does it have on the company? We've talked about this medical device tax for a while. Tell -- give us the status check.MACMILLAN: Yes, you know, we were very pleased with the House vote. We love -- we would love to see the senate come along and do the same thing.As you know, the medical device industry is very different say than most industries. And that, it's characterized by a lot of small startup companies. And that 2.3 percent sales tax, you know, it's an excise tax, it's not an income tax, it's a huge barrier to innovation in the industry.So, you know, I think all of us when that tax first went away boosted our R&D spending, everything else, and putting it into innovation which is where we want to see and that's what's fueling the innovation in the industry. So, we would love to get that more permanently repealed and we were very pleased with the House action.BARTIROMO: Between that and the tariffs, are you poised to raise prices?MACMILLAN: You know, increasingly it's a tougher market to raise prices. You know, we've got to look at some of those things, particularly if the tariffs go into effect in China, you know, it's probably going to have to be some higher pricing over there. You know, if the tax came back, we're going to have to pass some of that on. We can't absorb all of it ourselves. So, you know, those -- you know, we were big winners from the tax cuts earlier in the year and that's been great because we used that to fuel additional investments.BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there. Steve, great to see you.MACMILLAN: Great, thanks Maria. Thanks for having us.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much. We'll be watching the developments. Steve MacMillan a Hologic CEO.Coming up, a judge temporarily halts plans for printing 3D guns. Judge Andrew Napolitano breaks down the latest legal developments on that, right here.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo.

We'll tell you all about it.First, our top story this half an hour, and that is this, 3-D printed guns, a judge blocking the plan to release a 3-D printed gun blueprint yesterday. Just hours before they were expected to hit the internet. Defense distributed, the company that makes the designs, planned to make them available online for virtually anybody to see them and to download. The judge siding with at least eight states, plus D.C., that are suing to halt publication of these designs.Joining us right now is Judge Andrew Napolitano. Fox News senior judicial analyst. Judge, good to see you.JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Good morning.BARTIROMO: So, it's just the plans to make a 3-D gun.NAPOLITANO: Yes, this is even though the right to keep and bear arms is protected by the second amendment, this is a first amendment case. This is a case about the freedom of speech because you have a document, which is truthful and accurate and scientific, which the State Department inexplicably it's a head scratcher told the young man that created it, that he could posting on the internet. So, it's an expression of an idea and the court is stopping him from doing so.BARTIROMO: When did State Department say that it was a good idea?NAPOLITANO: Gosh, within the past month or so.See, he originally posted it and people were buying it overseas. That's make it regulable (ph) by the Federal Government. Are you selling something overseas without a license? He persuaded -- his lawyers persuaded State Department lawyers that he wasn't selling it, that he was just posting plans for it. He doesn't provide you with the -- with the gun. He just provides you with the plans.So, the Mike Pompeo State Department said, even though it's a federal statute that prohibits owning, possessing, transporting or manufacturing a gun without a piece -- without metal in it, it's called the Undetectable Weapons Act of 1988, Reagan era, there was no impediment to posting this.So, he posts it. It was downloaded by about a thousand people. I think it was downloaded by more people. There is actually more than one version out. Eight attorneys -- state attorneys general filed a lawsuit in Seattle. And the Seattle judge said, I think there's potentially a reparable harm here. So, I'm going to stop you from posting it. And the young man stopped immediately.BARTIROMO: Yes.NAPOLITANO: I don't know where this is going to go, I don't think -- I just read the judge's opinion a few minutes ago. I don't think he adequately addressed the first amendment issues. First amendment issues are these. Can the government engage in what we call prior restraint?This is not punishing speech after it comes out of your mouth. This is preventing it from coming out of your mouth. This is -- this is something rarely if ever done in American history but this judge has done it. I think he'll be reversed by the Ninth Circuit. I mean, think about it. You can go into a public library, a library owned by the government and find a book telling you how to make a bomb, you can find a book telling you how to make a plastic gun. Why can't you find this on the internet?The problem is, people will use these to harm themselves and to harm others and it's a substantial impediment to law enforcement to trace them. You can use this gun and then just destroy the gun. Because it's just a piece of plastic.BARTIROMO: Does this gun work like any other gun once it's made?NAPOLITANO: If it's made properly. There are many videos out there showing you exploding in people's hands. Because it depends upon whether you craft it properly, the mixture you use to make the -- to make --BARTIROMO: But it could -- it could?NAPOLITANO: Yes.MCDOWELL: And it's hard to detect when you go through security in the airport.NAPOLITANO: Yes.BARTIROMO: Because it's not metal.NAPOLITANO: The fellow who is behind all this, has put two pieces of metal in his. So, when he brings it into a courtroom to show to a judge, it is not unlawful if it has metal on it. Because if it has metal on it, it's detectable. If there's no metal in it, it's not detectable.BARTIROMO: OK.NAPOLITANO: It's illegal everywhere in the U.S.MURPHY: But Judge, with -- in this day and age we live right now, with the internet. Where everybody having access to it. Like you say, you can figure out how to build a bomb there, you can do a lot of bad things that you can learn on the internet.NAPOLITANO: Right.MURPHY: That's not going to change, right?NAPOLITANO: Correct.MURPHY: That's not going away. And that's going to be forever.NAPOLITANO: Correct.MURPHY: Isn't this just another part of that?NAPOLITANO: Yes, I think the injunction is fruitless. Because this is -- this is human knowledge. Now, it could be used for good. It could be used to repel an invader in your house. It could be used for evil. But you can't stop the march of human knowledge by a judge's injunction.BARTIROMO: Cody Wilson, he's the founder of Defense Distributed.MURPHY: That's the guy were talking about.BARTIROMO: He agreed to stop posting any new blueprints online until September, he said, when -- while the lawsuit makes its way through the courts.And in an interview yesterday, he explained the reason behind his decision to post the instructions online. Here's what he says.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CODY WILSON, FOUNDER, DEFENSE DISTRIBUTED: I believe that I'm championing the second amendment in the 21st century. I think access to the firearm is a fundamental human dignity, it's a fundamental human right.(END VIDEO CLIP)NAPOLITANO: Well, you know who called it the fundamental human right? Justice Scalia in a famous opinion called Heller versus the District of Columbia which basically found that the second amendment protects a personal, pre-political. Meaning they existed before the government human right to keep and bear arms. So, what he's saying is not radical. And it's perfectly consistent with the -- with the Supreme Court.BARTIROMO: Well, the president signaled yesterday that he's on defense. He tweeted this, he said I'm looking into 3-D plastic guns being sold to the public, already spoke to NRA, doesn't seem to make much sense, Dagen. That's what the --NAPOLITANO: The NRA actually championed the 1988 law which prohibited guns that don't have any metal in them. This is the Reagan era law that I mentioned -- that I mentioned earlier. I don't know that this made its way up the food chain in the State Department. I don't know that Mike the Secretary of State knew about this.BARTIROMO: Yes.NAPOLITANO: Because it is a real head-scratcher that a decision like this could be made without the broad consensus of the Trump administration behind it. So, I don't know where it's going to go. But let me scare you a little bit. This is in the Ninth Circuit.BARTIROMO: All right, here we go.NAPOLITANO: They're going to reverse -- they're going to reverse the Seattle judge probably this afternoon.BARTIROMO: Yes.NAPOLITANO: If there's an appeal. And I don't know if there's going to be an appeal.MCDOWELL: So where would --NAPOLITANO: Because Cody Wilson, the young man you just plays it, I'm going to obey the court's order. I'm not going to do anything until September.BARTIROMO: The Ninth Circuit always goes against President Trump, we knew that.NAPOLITANO: Yes.MCDOWELL: Where would Scalia stand on this you think? Because, again, wasn't it in Heller that he wrote that American people have the right to arm themselves the way that the government does.NAPOLITANO: I think Justice Scalia would be in favor of the free speech argument, which is that you cannot suppress an idea and you cannot suppress technology.BARTIROMO: But does this go all the way up to the Supreme Court?NAPOLITANO: Yes, it does -- yes, it does, probably after Judge Kavanaugh is there. And he's a fierce defender of the second amendment.MCDOWELL: You jump ahead there, judge.NAPOLITANO: Where is he on the first?BARTIROMO: They're trying to have Judge Kavanaugh in place by October One.NAPOLITANO: Yes.BARTIROMO: Judge, good to see you.NAPOLITANO: Pleasure.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much Judge Andrew Napolitano.Coming up, a new policy for Southwest Airlines takes flight. We will tell you about the shakeup, next.And then, a painting getting patriotic, the new art inspired by President Trump coming up right here, that's going viral right now.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Southwest Airlines says good-bye to peanuts for good. Cheryl Casone with the details, Cheryl.CASONE: End of an era, Maria. It's been a tradition on Southwest for decades. But starting today, peanuts are going to be grounded at the airline. Yesterday, the last day that the company offered them to passengers. Southwest says it's concerned about peanut allergies. Taking a look at shares of Dallas, Texas based Southwest Airlines, stocks down 11 percent this year.All right, speaking of Dallas, thankfully nobody was hurt when a two-story parking garage partially collapsed there yesterday. Fire Department says its rescue team along with K-9's confirmed nobody was inside any of the smashed cars. 21 cars were damaged. Images show the gaping hole in the garage and vehicles piled against one another. An investigation under way to determine what happened.Well, White House chief of staff John Kelly agreed to stay in his job through the 2020 election at President Trump's request. Kelly told his senior aides decision on Monday which marked his first anniversary in the role. There was months of speculation that the chief of staff was on his way out. But no, he is staying put.Take a look at this, a painting meant to depict President Trump and his team navigating the Washington swamp has touched off a social media frenzy. This is from artist Jon McNaughton. He shared his painting called Crossing the Swamp on Twitter. The painting of course, a ref on Washington crossing the Delaware, very famous painting (INAUDIBLE).Those on Twitter were quick to mock it though. Some point it out that Donald Trump Jr. didn't make the crew? And Carson looks like he's rowing backwards. Also, Melania Trump wouldn't be caught dead wearing camo. Just some of the fun comments coming from that one. I kind of agree with the Melania thing. That's -- yes, (INAUDIBLE) Anyway, get back to you.BARTIROMO: I love this picture.CASONE: The artist is a big President Trump supporter, we should say. He loves President Trump and loves his agenda, so.MURPHY: It's a great picture. I do think Ben Carson is rowing backwards though.ORTAGUS: Well, my dad texted this to me this last night. He thought it was great. My dad's not a prolific texter. So that's like -- you know it's going viral when Ronnie Ortagus and (INAUDIBLE) Florida is texting it.BARTIROMO: These Sarah Sanders.ORTAGUS: But I think my dad loves the camo because he's a big hunter. I have to say like, holding the gun correctly (INAUDIBLE).BARTIROMO: I don't know why people say she wouldn't wear that jacket, Cheryl. Because she had that other jacket on that says who cares, right?ORTAGUS: She's got the smolder, the Dagen McDowell smolder.MCDOWELL: Now, that's just great, that's just unbridled resting you know what face. By the way, I have love this stuff, because anything to make people on the left lose their minds.BARTIROMO: Well, yes, they already have Trump syndrome, so.MCDOWELL: Exactly. And by the way, they don't even know that like conservatives and even the president himself, they're taunting you, they're trying to make you even more upset.BARTIROMO: Yes, you're right.MCDOWELL: And you give in.BARTIROMO: Right.MCDOWELL: That's what's so genius.BARTIROMO: They're going insane over the outcomes.

So get this, a 10-year-old boy breaks Michael Phelps' long-standing record. But first we begin with a historic night in baseball. Jared Max with all the details. Jared, good morning.JARED MAX, FOX SPORTS NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria. We saw things we had never seen before. Question: what do the New York Mets have in common with Serena Williams? Both suffered their most lopsided losses ever on Tuesday.While Serena was beaten 6-1-6 love in the Silicon Valley Classic the Mets dipped into a valley of unchartered depths. They trailed the nationals 7-0 after one inning, 19-0 after five innings. Haven't seen such a score since 1876. It was 19-1 nationals in the eighth inning.When the Mets brought infielder Jose Reyes in to pitch for the first time in his career. Reyes, gave up two home runs and then on a 54 mile per hour fast ball he also hit Ryan Zimmerman who would pretend to charge the mound.The final score last night, well, the Mets' official Twitter can't even look, see no evil. As the New York post says today, it was bad as it Mets.Final score Nationals 25, the Mets four. The worst loss ever for the Mets. And the biggest win for the Nationals (INAUDIBLE) ball card.Atlanta marked a day in sports all around. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver announced last night, the NBA and WNBA have become north America's first major pro sports league to form a relationship with a sports gambling house, MGM Resorts.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)Adam Silver, Commissioner NBA: We said let's take advantage of this opportunity to do something historic. And that is to enter into the first commercial partnership between a gaming establishment and the NBA. Integrity provisions, to protect our fans, to protect those who choose to engage and bet on the NBA.(END VIDEO CLIP)MAX: The deal reported to be worth at least $25 million. MGM is allowed to market itself using NBA highlights, names, logos and direct data feed from the league.With a name like Clark Kent you figure one is bound for superstardom. 10- year-old swimming phenom, Clark Kent Apuada swims for the Monterey County Aquatic Team. Now, this was his time Saturday at the 100-meter butterfly Far West International Championship. Now, this is the time that Michael Phelps set a record in back in 1995. More than a full second slower than Clark Kent Apuada whose nickname is Superman.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLARK KENT APUADA, SWIMMER, MONTEREY COUNTY AQUATIC TEAM: Always have fun and never give up on your dreams no matter what anybody says and, yes, that was one of my dreams, to beat Michael Phelps.(END VIDEO CLIP)MAX: With a name like Clark Kent, how could you go wrong? So, Michael Phelps foreseeing his records --BARTIROMO: I love this kid.MURPHY: Great stuff. So, the NBA gambling things are really big deal. A $25 million deal though -- I mean, that's like a backup power ford in the NBA, right now.MAX: Yes.MURPHY: I mean, shouldn't there be more money there?MAX: Yes, that surprised me a little bit that it was that little of couple things here. Commissioner Adam Silver has been vocal publicly from the start about the when they legalize why spread gambling start to reach with New Jersey about this integrity fee. That they want a cut of the action, essentially. So, they're moving in here, at least in this regard, with MGM.But boy, you think of the irony. It was just a decade ago that Tim Donaghy, the former NBA referee disgraced ref who went to jail for betting on games and making calls to work in his favor on the points spread, who would have -- what would have been the odds that the NBA would become the first league to get in bed with sports casinos.MURPHY: Right.MCDOWELL: (INAUDIBLE) is cheating and gambling is money.MAX: Yes. I wonder also that does as this days go on, Pete Rose. What does this do for him? As they start to see, boy, things are changing. You know, I can never get in the Hall of Fame but they're doing. What's Tim Donaghy thinking this morning?MURPHY: Yes.BARTIROMO: It's true. Jared, thank you. Jared Max.

Chinese AI Startups Overtake American Peers for Venture Capital Investments, Taking Away US$5 BillionPR NewswireAugust 27, 2018 Monday 9:25 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 900 wordsDateline: SINGAPORE, Aug. 27, 2018 Body Chinese AI startups raised US$5 billion in venture capital funding in 2017 and overtook their U.S. counterparts, found ABI research, a market-foresight advisory firm providing strategic guidance on the most compelling transformative technologies. This shows that investors are confident with the technologies developed by Chinese startups, their business strategies, and market potential.The overall investment values for AI startups increased year on year by a staggering 150% globally in 2017, growing from US$4 billion in 2016 to US$10.7 billion in 2017. Contrary to their U.S. counterparts who raised US$4.4 billion of investment from 155 investments, Chinese startups raised US$4.9 billion from merely 19 investments, indicating a sharp focus by the investors on mature AI applications with strong commercial viability and successful use cases. In addition, the influence of the Chinese government plays a key role in attracting investment in AI startups. "The bullish sentiment shared among Chinese investors is a clear sign that China is going all-in in artificial intelligence (AI). The government of China is setting clear policy guidelines for the future development of AI and startups are responding with cutting edge AI technologies across many industries," said Lian Jye Su, a Principal Analyst at ABI Research.In contrast, Europe seems to have long-term strategic objectives as far as AI investments are concerned. Startups in the region have diversified interests across different industries and verticals, mainly for use cases such as cybersecurity, digital ID, public safety, healthcare, and IoT. The United States, on the other hand, takes a more balanced approach between short-term investments that could translate into immediate commercial opportunities and long-term transformative technologies targeting key sectors such as automotive, agriculture, finance, cloud robotics platform and insurance.Among all the Chinese startups, Bytedance walks away with the highest funding. The creator of Toutiao, a personalized news aggregation app, and Douyin, a personalized video clip app, has raised over US$3 billion in investment and is enormously popular among Chinese youth, due to its content personalization and curation algorithms. Another sector that received a lot of attention was facial recognition. SenseTime and Face++ managed to raise significant funding due to the adoption of facial recognition technologies by various public agencies, payment and e-commerce companies.Chinese startups are not merely focusing on software development only as it is the case in many other industry sectors but are also deeply involved with AI chipset innovation. Cambricon Technologies and Horizon Robotics have raised US$100 million in Series A funding respectively to design and manufacture purpose-built AI chipset for machine vision. The aim to launch a 'Made in China' chipset is one of the key priorities of the Chinese government. Previous attempts have been futile, but the technologies developed by Cambricon Technologies and Horizon Robotics seem to be promising. Cambricon's chipset IP has been integrated into Huawei's premium smartphones, while Horizon Robotics focuses heavily on machine vision in the automotive industry. Such a multi-prong AI investment approach in both hardware and software will ensure that the Chinese AI ecosystem continues to flourish, innovate, and stay ahead of the competition."While 2017 was a roaring success for Chinese startups, the real fruits and impact will be felt in 2018 and beyond. Already we are seeing a few startups launching new products, venturing into new business, or being acquired in 2018," says Su. Unisound, for instance, released one of the first Made in China AI chipsets for natural language processing in 2018; Xilinx, a U.S.-based field programmable gate array (FPGA) vendor, acquired DeePhi Tech, a Beijing-based startup focusing on deep learning optimization.These findings are from ABI Research's AI Investment Monitor 2017. This report is part of the company's AI & Machine Learningresearch service, which includes research, data, and Executive Foresights. About ABI ResearchABI Research provides strategic guidance for visionaries needing market foresight on the most compelling transformative technologies, which reshape workforces, identify holes in a market, create new business models and drive new revenue streams.

Chinese Tech Isn't the EnemyAtlantic OnlineAugust 1, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1467 wordsByline: Anja ManuelBodyOn a recent tour of an enormous, impressive set of artificial-intelligence labs in Beijing, I saw a scene straight out of Silicon Valley: Bright 20-something Chinese researchers with hipster glasses and pink streaked hair sat at row after row of open tables, headphones in, working hard. Projects ranged from innocuous applications like the AI-enabled bicycle share Mobike or the online education portal VIPKid, to ones the U.S. government may find worrying, like Face ++, which is widely believed to be the world's most powerful facial-recognition software. It can be used to sort photos, but the Chinese security services also use it to ensure they can find any potential "troublemakers" on any street corner in Beijing.After years of being relatively naive about China's "all of society" push to catch up and dominate key technology sectors, the U.S. government was jarred awake recently, with the Obama administration sounding alarms about Chinese advances in semiconductors in its waning days, the Pentagon's Silicon Valley            outpost warning about Chinese tech investments in the U.S., and President Donald Trump then taking up a steady anti-China drumbeat.              China's artificial-intelligence boomWell beyond President Trump and Peter Navarro's trade war, the U.S. is cracking down. Lawmakers have            proposed sweeping expansions to powers of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the government body that reviews foreign purchases of U.S. assets for potential national-security risks. The legislation would broaden the scope of deals up for review to include all that have foreign investor involvement in so-called "critical technologies" (so far undefined) and non-public technical information. Even before any changes to the law, CFIUS            blocked or discouraged approximately 20 Chinese deals in 2017. Members of Congress have            asked Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to investigate the Chinese technology company Huawei's partnerships with more than 50 U.S. universities, and the administration            is exploring sweeping visa restrictions for Chinese researchers in science and technology. Investment has responded accordingly:            Chinese foreign direct investment fell 35 percent in 2017, while Chinese mergers and acquisitions in the U.S. declined 90 percent in the same time period.But is the administration solving the right problem? For years, the U.S. was unsuccessful in stopping the Chinese government's blatant stealing of U.S. intellectual property and its industrial policy that seeks to make the country world-class in key technologies like artificial intelligence and semiconductors-in part for China's own growing and menacing military to use. The U.S. thereby inadvertently helped China, including its People's Liberation Army, accelerate its development of these technologies. But in correcting this, the U.S. now risks cutting off too much technology cooperation with the world's second-largest economy, which would harm U.S. interests more than China's. The goal should be to protect a few key technologies and come down hard on China's illegal practices, rather than cutting off technology cooperation generally.A few examples demonstrate the point:While Silicon Valley has led the pack in purely digital technologies like social networks, innovation in robotics, drones, and other hardware-heavy technologies requires access to advanced manufacturing. Shenzhen, in China, is the undisputed leader in this. As the journalist Matt Sheehan has            argued, Chinese private investors in American start-ups often provide access to this fast-evolving, humming, manufacturing ecosystem-and as one U.S. entrepreneur put it, a week working on manufactured product design in Shenzhen is worth four in the U.S., because one can tinker with physical designs so much more quickly.  Google and Microsoft are two of the world's leading AI research entities. Recently, they have both been criticized on            Fox News and            elsewhere for opening research facilities in China, because, as the argument goes, some of the innovations made by their Chinese researchers will "leak" to the Chinese government. That is indeed possible, and those companies should put strong controls on employees and invest in cybersecurity to prevent this. But severely curtailing this kind of cooperation, which would be implied as the logical end point of these critiques, makes no sense. Even if U.S. and Chinese researchers can't collaborate, Google has a large AI team in Europe, which the U.S. government cannot prevent from working with its Chinese colleagues.For their part, Chinese technology companies like            Baidu and NIO happily locate research centers in Silicon Valley, a practice from which the American economy benefits in both insight and jobs.This kind of cooperation is only going to grow more important as technology gets more complex. As the analyst            Paul Triolo notes, the upcoming buildout of 5G telecom networks will require supply-chain contributions from a variety of countries-including China-and restricting work with China in this area will only serve to undercut American competitiveness. "Going it alone" in spaces like 5G would also mean that the world would adopt someone else's (likely China or the EU) governance standards, which would be bad both for U.S. consumers and for the security America is belatedly trying to protect.Finally, long-term innovation happens because U.S. companies participate in markets all over the world. A senior U.S. semiconductor-company executive told me recently that U.S. companies' sales to and investments in China give them access to Chinese efforts on cloud computing, AI, and autonomy, and thus make U.S. products much better at responding to a changing world market. Balkanization will likely harden the Chinese desire to be self-reliant, and so lead to inefficiency, higher costs, and less innovation among U.S. firms. He added that to prepare for more U.S. CFIUS and export control scrutiny, U.S. firms will have to spend additional money on compliance red tape, which could be better used for research and development.The Chinese AI lab I visited            perfectly demonstrates the problem-and benefit-of interconnectedness. Its founder is a Taiwanese national, educated in the U.S., with deep ties both to the U.S. and China. Many U.S. investors participate in his funds. Most of the technology they incubate is innocuous-making it easier for all of us to share bikes in cities or to educate our children. Some of it helps the Chinese government spy on its own citizens. Should U.S. investors be prohibited from investing in his funds so no American capital flows to Face++? Should he be prohibited from investing in U.S. companies, even though the money he is investing comes in large part from U.S. investors?Many U.S. analysts are writing about a new "space race" in AI. But this Cold War analogy isn't the right one. In the case of the current technology competition between the U.S. and China, there aren't two nicely defined "blocs" of countries pitted against each other on behalf of national "teams." Instead, a web of interconnected universities, researchers, supply chains, and capital flows take the best microchips from America and Korea, embed them in the best hardware from China, and use AI researchers of all nationalities who often work far from their country of origin and publish their research for all to see on open-source platforms.Chinese intellectual-property poaching is a genuine problem, and U.S. government officials are right to work valiantly to stop it, and to slow the technical advances of the Chinese military. Yet without being clear about the problem they are solving, they risk overcorrecting and stifling positive cooperation on benign technologies, while imposing more burdens on U.S. companies.If the concern is illegal technology transfer to the Chinese government and military, then U.S. regulation can be both more narrow, and more broad. More narrow in that the U.S. can carefully scrutinize Chinese investment that seeks access to U.S. technology that helps the Chinese military (rather than discouraging all Chinese investment), and carefully vet Chinese students to make sure they are not intelligence assets, rather than effectively discouraging all of China's best minds from studying here. In fact, the U.S. could encourage them to stay by issuing H-1B visas to the most promising grads, and thus taking advantage of this Chinese resource. Broader, in that countries from Europe to Japan and Korea are also concerned about Chinese technology mercantilism and theft, and America can lead a united front against it.Building a wall to keep America's technology in and others' out is not the right analogy-rather, America should snip the few bad strands in the otherwise positive web of international tech innovation.Load-Date: August 2, 2018End of Document

Why they fight: US and China brawl over high technologyAssociated Press State & LocalJuly 3, 2018 Tuesday 8:20 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 1000 wordsByline: By PAUL WISEMAN, AP Economics WriterDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - To understand why the United States and China stand on the brink of a trade war, consider the near-death experience of American Superconductor Corp.The company, known as AMSC and based in Massachusetts, was reeling after a Chinese partner stole its technology - the electronic brains that run wind turbines. The loss was devastating: AMSC's stock shed $1 billion in value, and the company cut 700 jobs, more than half its workforce."Attempted corporate homicide" is what CEO Daniel McGahn called it. In January, its Chinese partner, Sinovel Wind Group, was convicted in a U.S. court of stealing AMSC's trade secrets.To the Trump administration, Sinovel's predatory practices are hardly isolated. Beijing, it charges, is orchestrating a brass-knuckles campaign to supplant U.S. technological dominance and over the next few decades make Chinese companies global leaders in such fields as robotics and electric vehicles.According to a report by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, Beijing's tactics include coercing American companies to hand over trade secrets in return for access to the Chinese market; forcing U.S. businesses to license technology in China on unfavorable terms; using state funds to buy up American technology; and sometimes outright theft.Critics have long asserted that China runs roughshod over intellectual property rights. But President Donald Trump, who ran for the White House on a vow to force China to reform its trade policies, is the first U.S. leader to risk a trade war between the world's two biggest economies."We've been in a trade war for a long time, but we weren't participating," said Richard Ellings, president of the National Bureau of Asian Research. "We've awakened. ... This is a fundamental change. It's a historic moment."Critics argue, though, that while Trump has picked the right fight, he has chosen the wrong weapon. They predict China will defy an array of U.S. tariffs set to take effect Friday and will retaliate immediately. And they warn that the escalating trade war will slow global growth and jeopardize the second-longest economic expansion in U.S. history.Many analysts say the United States should have enlisted key allies like Japan and the European Union - which share U.S. complaints about Chinese trade policies - to impose unified pressure on Beijing. Instead, the U.S. is engaging in trade disputes with its friends over imported steel, aluminum and autos."There is no way to meaningfully influence Chinese behavior on intellectual property without coordination among like-minded advanced nations, and presently there is almost none," said Daniel Rosen of the economic research firm Rhodium Group.Barring a last-minute breakthrough, the Trump administration will impose tariffs this week on $34 billion in Chinese products that have benefited from China's strong-arm policies.Once Beijing responds with retaliatory tariffs, as it has said it will, the combat could escalate. Trump has said he is prepared to slap taxes on up to $450 billion in Chinese imports, or nearly 90 percent of the goods China shipped to the United States last year.Peter Navarro, the White House trade adviser, has said the United States needs to protect its high-tech "crown jewels" from predatory Chinese practices.The stakes go beyond the economy. Many of today's advanced technologies - the ability to collect and analyze vast amounts of data, for instance - have military uses."Today, the acquisition of a Silicon Valley startup or even a health care provider may raise just as serious concerns from a national security perspective as the acquisition of a defense or aerospace company," Assistant U.S. Treasury Secretary Heath Tarbert told Congress in April.That's why the United States in January effectively blocked the acquisition of the money transfer service MoneyGram by China's Ant Financial. Concerns were raised that the deal would give China access to the financial records of millions of Americans, including members of the military.The U.S. says the Chinese government blurs the lines between state and private companies by bankrolling deals like Geely's 2010 purchase of Volvo Cars and appliance manufacturer Media's 2016 acquisition of German robotics maker Kuka.In 2017, Trump vetoed the sale of a U.S. semiconductor manufacturer to a Chinese investor as a threat to national security after Washington concluded the financing came from China's government.U.S. officials see a threat in Beijing's long-range development plan, called Made in China 2025. The plan calls for creating powerful Chinese players in such areas as information technology, robotics, aerospace equipment, electric vehicles and biopharmaceuticals. Foreign business groups argue that Made in China 2025 is unfairly forcing them to the sidelines in those industries.Whatever the reasons, China has been gaining traction. Stephen Ezell, director of global innovation policy at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation think tank, said China has raised its share of global output in 18 high-tech manufacturing industries from 8 percent in 2003 to 27 percent now. It is now the world's largest exporter of high-tech products.Tim Tangredi, CEO of Dais Analytic in Odessa, Florida, supports Trump's aggressive moves, likening the U.S. tariff threat to America's "shock and awe" military campaign against Iraq in 2003.About four years ago, Dais had lined up a Chinese company to help develop its business in nanotechnology that helps produce clean water. But the partnership imploded.

The loss was devastating: AMSC's stock shed $1 billion in value, and the company cut 700 jobs, more than half its workforce."Attempted corporate homicide" is what CEO Daniel McGahn called it. In January, its Chinese partner, Sinovel Wind Group, was convicted in a U.S. court of stealing AMSC's trade secrets.To the Trump administration, Sinovel's predatory practices are hardly isolated. Beijing, it charges, is orchestrating a brass-knuckles campaign to supplant U.S. technological dominance and over the next few decades make Chinese companies global leaders in such fields as robotics and electric vehicles.According to a report by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, Beijing's tactics include coercing American companies to hand over trade secrets in return for access to the Chinese market; forcing U.S. businesses to license technology in China on unfavorable terms; using state funds to buy up American technology; and sometimes outright theft.Critics have long asserted that China runs roughshod over intellectual property rights. But President Donald Trump, who ran for the White House on a vow to force China to reform its trade policies, is the first U.S. leader to risk a trade war between the world's two biggest economies."We've been in a trade war for a long time, but we weren't participating," said Richard Ellings, president of the National Bureau of Asian Research. "We've awakened. ... This is a fundamental change. It's a historic moment."Critics argue, though, that while Trump has picked the right fight, he has chosen the wrong weapon. They predict China will defy an array of U.S. tariffs set to take effect Friday and will retaliate immediately. And they warn that the escalating trade war will slow global growth and jeopardize the second-longest economic expansion in U.S. history.Many analysts say the United States should have enlisted key allies like Japan and the European Union - which share U.S. complaints about Chinese trade policies - to impose unified pressure on Beijing. Instead, the U.S. is engaging in trade disputes with its friends over imported steel, aluminum and autos."There is no way to meaningfully influence Chinese behavior on intellectual property without coordination among like-minded advanced nations, and presently there is almost none," said Daniel Rosen of the economic research firm Rhodium Group.Barring a last-minute breakthrough, the Trump administration will impose tariffs this week on $34 billion in Chinese products that have benefited from China's strong-arm policies.Once Beijing responds with retaliatory tariffs, as it has said it will, the combat could escalate. Trump has said he is prepared to slap taxes on up to $450 billion in Chinese imports, or nearly 90 percent of the goods China shipped to the United States last year.Peter Navarro, the White House trade adviser, has said the United States needs to protect its high-tech "crown jewels" from predatory Chinese practices.The stakes go beyond the economy. Many of today's advanced technologies - the ability to collect and analyze vast amounts of data, for instance - have military uses."Today, the acquisition of a Silicon Valley startup or even a health care provider may raise just as serious concerns from a national security perspective as the acquisition of a defense or aerospace company," Assistant U.S. Treasury Secretary Heath Tarbert told Congress in April.That's why the United States in January effectively blocked the acquisition of the money transfer service MoneyGram by China's Ant Financial. Concerns were raised that the deal would give China access to the financial records of millions of Americans, including members of the military.The U.S. says the Chinese government blurs the lines between state and private companies by bankrolling deals like Geely's 2010 purchase of Volvo Cars and appliance manufacturer Media's 2016 acquisition of German robotics maker Kuka.In 2017, Trump vetoed the sale of a U.S. semiconductor manufacturer to a Chinese investor as a threat to national security after Washington concluded the financing came from China's government.U.S. officials see a threat in Beijing's long-range development plan, called Made in China 2025. The plan calls for creating powerful Chinese players in such areas as information technology, robotics, aerospace equipment, electric vehicles and biopharmaceuticals. Foreign business groups argue that Made in China 2025 is unfairly forcing them to the sidelines in those industries.Whatever the reasons, China has been gaining traction. Stephen Ezell, director of global innovation policy at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation think tank, said China has raised its share of global output in 18 high-tech manufacturing industries from 8 percent in 2003 to 27 percent now. It is now the world's largest exporter of high-tech products.Tim Tangredi, CEO of Dais Analytic in Odessa, Florida, supports Trump's aggressive moves, likening the U.S. tariff threat to America's "shock and awe" military campaign against Iraq in 2003.About four years ago, Dais had lined up a Chinese company to help develop its business in nanotechnology that helps produce clean water. But the partnership imploded. Tangredi said the Chinese company persuaded a long-time Dais employee to defect with trade secrets."They just stole it, and they are using it against us," he said.Tangredi said he hopes the threat of a trade war will force China to rethink its practices: "You've got to do something to get their attention."___AP Business Writer Joe McDonald in Beijing contributed to this report.___Follow Paul Wiseman on Twitter at https://twitter.com/PaulWisemanAPLoad-Date: July 4, 2018End of Document

US, China Exchange New Round of Tariffs in Trade WarStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeSeptember 25, 2018 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: MARKETS; Pg. 1Length: 556 wordsByline: Jean GarciaBodyThe US and China imposed another round of tariffs on each other on Monday, further escalating the trade war between the two countries.The US on Monday imposed duties on another US$200 billion (S$273 billion) of Chinese imports, prompting China to respond by slapping tariffs of its own on US$60 billion of US goods.Imports of American goods previous year totalled $153.9 billion while the United States bought Chinese goods worth $429.8 billion, according to Chinese customs data. Modems, routers, and switching and networking gear have not been exempted from this latest round of tariffs, a move that will hurt consumers, as the U.S. Customs and Border Control agency will not draw a distinction between equipment meant for consumer use and that meant for commercial use.The two countries have already slapped tariffs on $50 billion worth of each other's goods earlier this year.The white paper blames US President Donald Trump's "America First" policy for torpedoing years of progress in settling differences through bilateral forums and exchanges.Economists warn that a protracted dispute will eventually stunt growth not just in the United States and China but across the broader global economy. The Chinese tariff, though smaller than the dutyBeijing threatened to levy earlier this year, makes US gas a bit more expensive and less competitive in the world's second-largest LNG market.The report by the Chinese government said: "It has brazenly preached unilateralism, protectionism and economic hegemony, making false accusations against many countries and regions, particularly China".Beijing's vice premier Liu He was proposed to meet with the Trump administration in Washington to have mid-level trade talks.As China has said that step is certain, the stage appears set for yet another escalation of the trade war.Sirius XM to Buy Pandora in $3.5 Billion DealWe'll have to see how Pandora plans on competing with the major streaming services such as Apple Music and Spotify . PANDORA CEO ROGER LYNCH said, "We've made tremendous progress in our efforts to lead in digital audio".The new restrictive measures against China would also result in an inflation rise in the US, Goldman warns.This week the United States sanctioned a Chinese military procurement organisation, drawing a sharp protest fromBeijing and a decision to postpone planned military talks.One project in particular seems caught in the crosshairs of the trade war: a $43 billion project to pipe natural gas from the North Slope of Alaska across the state to an LNG export facility near Anchorage. This latest round of tariffs is no exception."The US-China trade war has no clear end in sight"."With generic polls favouring the Democrats, they may feel that the trade environment will be less hostile after November 6". Expectations that China will need to buy more and more cleaner-burning gas, and especially dirt-cheap US gas, underpin the gas business for many upcoming USA export projects.China imports far less from the United States, making a dollar-for-dollar match on any new U.S. tariffs impossible.Trump earlier this month accused China of targeting rural voters who support his presidency by hitting agricultural goods.Some analysts say there is also a risk that China could allow its yuan currency to weaken again to cushion the blow to its exporters.Load-Date: September 25, 2018End of Document

UT must cut ties with Confucius InstitutesThe Daily Texan: University of Texas - AustinAugust 30, 2018 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: OPINION; Pg. 1Length: 713 wordsBodyRussia hacked into American energy facilities and attempted to infiltrate states' voting systems in the 2016 election.While many see Russia's bold attacks as the face of a national security dilemma, few know that China stands poised to strengthen its covert influence operations within the United States. China runs state-funded cultural, historical and lingual learning centers called Confucius Institutes. These centers operate on over 100 university campuses in the U.S., including University of Texas institutions.Two UT schools - UT-Dallas and UT-San Antonio - have Confucius Institutes. These institutes state that they promote Chinese language, cultural appreciation and historical understanding. However, this masks their ulterior motives: to disseminate propaganda, enforce censorship and build Chinese Communist influence overseas.The UT System has potentially compromised our academic integrity through this partnership.Confucius Institutes link back to Hanban, a division of China's Ministry of Education directly overseen by the executive heads of 12 Chinese ministries. These include the state media and propaganda arm as well as China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.This might explain why Confucius Institute curricula and professors get screened and vetted for Chinese government approval. In effect, universities with Confucius Institutes concede academic control to China.If we don't let the Department of Education screen UT courses and professors, we shouldn't let the Chinese Ministry of Education veto certain courses, choose textbooks and vet professors at Chinese institutes on our university campuses.Joshua Busby, an associate professor at Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs and distinguished scholar at the Strauss Center, wrote in an email that "there are legitimate fears that the Confucius Institute, given Chinese government support, might be an avenue for limiting wider communication of themes and ideas" that the Chinese do not want to discuss.Free inquiry and intellectual independence remain central to the purpose of higher education. Confucius Institutes undermine both by teaching topics such as the "One China" policy - which argues that Taiwan is not independent from mainland China ­­- and by avoiding unfavorable topics such as Tibet's contentious history with China. Hanban also prohibits the instruction or discussion of the Dalai Lama, the Tiananmen Square massacre, or dissident Liu Xiaobo.John Paul Pope, an LBJ school professor and senior fellow at the Intelligence Studies Project, wrote in an email that "Chinese involvement and funding for these institutes represents, at minimum, a conflict of interest with the objectives and values of a university" and its academic freedom. Pope said that at their worst, Confucius Institutes represent an avenue for China to secure intellectual property with or without rightful compensation. They represent a way in which the Chinese government can obtain easy cover for espionage or gather intelligence on students that even the U.S. government cannot. Pope wrote that universities "specifically should not allow these institutes on their campuses."Limiting scholarship while broadening foreign government intelligence contrasts with American values and national interests.Many government officials have sounded the alarm on Confucius Institutes from both sides of the aisle, including U.S. Reps. Michael McCaul and Henry Cuellar, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio and FBI Director Christopher Wray.The 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, signed by the president Aug. 13, prohibits Pentagon resources from all Confucius Institute programs.Fostering a positive relationship with China and learning Chinese language and culture should be top priorities. But Confucius Institutes are not the ways we accomplish this.A March 2018 joint letter from Reps. Michael McCaul and Henry Cuellar said in part that Confucius Institutes "are a threat to our nation's security by serving as a platform for China's intelligence collection and political agenda."As a result of this letter, the Texas A&M System cut ties with its two Confucius Institutes that same month.It's time the UT System follow suit.Verses is an environmental engineering and Plan II sophomore from San Antonio.Load-Date: August 31, 2018End of Document

IDC: Impact of China-U.S.Trade War on Chinese Economy, ICT MarketTargeted News ServiceAugust 3, 2018 Friday 7:11 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 892 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: BEIJING, China BodyInternational Data Corp., a provider of market intelligence and advisory services, issued the following news release:On July 6, 2018, the United States tariffs on US$34 billion worth of Chinese imports took effect, and the Chinese government immediately fought back by announcing its own version of retaliatory duties on U.S. goods, officially setting off a trade war between the world's two largest economies.The list of US$34 billion Chinese products targeted by the U.S. tariffs include robotics, aviation and aerospace, industrial machinery, automobiles, vaping devices, rare earth metals and LED light bulbs. Of the 1,102 categories of products targeted, only 1% are consumer goods, with the rest being mainly products in the secondary sector and related to the areas identified and encouraged by the "Made in China 2025" initiative.The list of US$34 billion U.S. goods targeted by China's retaliatory tariffs is composed of 545 items, including agricultural produce, automobiles and aquatic products, mainly concentrated in the primary sector of the U.S. economy.The trade war will negatively impact both economies, particularly the Chinese economy in view of its massive trade surplus with the U.S. According to IDC China's research, the imposition of tariffs by the U.S. and China on US$34 billion worth of products from each side will bring down China's GDP growth in 2018 by 0.2 percentage points (from 6.7% to 6.5%) by affecting approximately US$25 billion of GDP (US$1=RMB6.7). Specific to China's ICT market, the overall growth in 2018 will decline by 0.6 percentage points (from to 9.0% to 8.4%), with approximately US$4 billion of market being affected.The trade war's impact on the Chinese economy and the ICT market in particularThe trade war's impact on China will mainly play out in three dimensions: 1) impact of the U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods and industries; 2) impact of exchange rate changes on Chinese industries if RMB depreciates; and 3) impact on China from U.S. goods affected by Chinese tariffs. The impact is shown in Figure 1.To view the chart, click here: https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prCHE44194118The trade war's degree of impact on the overall Chinese economy and the Chinese ICT market in particularBased on the above analysis, IDC China further drills down the impact estimating that China's GDP growth in 2018 will be reduced by 0.2 percentage points (from 6.7% to 6.5%) and the growth of China's overall ICT market in 2018 to decline by 0.6 percentage points (from 9.0% to 8.4%).Figure 2 Impact of Trade War on China Economy and ICT MarketTo view the chart, click here: https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prCHE44194118Industries and ICT segments most affected by the trade warThe impact of the trade war on the Chinese economy will directly and indirectly involve almost all industries. The manufacturing industry will be hit the most, especially in those areas related to the "Made in China 2025" industrial policy, and the services sector, especially technology services. The Chinese ICT market is expected to suffer a greater negative impact from the trade war than China's national GDP because the outlook of a lower GDP growth will affect ICT purchase and a cheaper Renminbi will significantly increase the overall cost of China's ICT industry that rely heavily on imported technologies. The specific impact is shown in Figure 3.To view the chart, click here: https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prCHE44194118Advice to ICT vendors and end users:1. Closely follow the latest developments of the China-U.S. trade war and their impact on the industries: whether the U.S. will follow through on the proposed tariffs on US$200 billion worth of Chinese goods and when; what retaliatory actions China will take and when; what industries will be involved and the specific impact.2. Make proper adjustment to the export and globalization strategy: make full use of national policy related to globalization and increase market expansion in the EU and countries along the "Belt and Road".3. Appropriately control the overall cost: For companies that rely on U.S. imports for core components, the depreciation of RMB will increase their cost. Therefore, appropriate cost control will be a key measure in response to the crisis.4. Continuously invest in core technologies and digital transformation: The digital economy will maintain high-speed growth in China and globally. Increasing investment in strategic areas at a time when the overall economy is facing challenges will build foundation for future growth."While the China-U.S. trade war has some negative impact on the Chinese economy and the Chinese ICT market, globalization will remain in the mainstream in the long run, and so will China-U.S. complementarity and cooperation, and digital transformation of economy," said Kitty Fok , Managing Director of IDC China. "ICT vendors and industry users should take the current challenge as an opportunity by creating appropriate strategies of response and continuously investing in digital transformation enabled by new technologies to achieve technology-driven multiplication of insights, of development, of trust and, ultimately, of innovation."Contact: Lianfeng Wu, lwu@idc.com; Kitty Fok, kfok@idc.com; Maggie Xie, mxie@idc.comCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6396183 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: August 4, 2018End of Document

Outrage in China over thousands of faulty vaccines for childrenCNN WireJuly 23, 2018 Monday 11:32 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 997 wordsByline: By Ben Westcott and Serenitie Wang, CNNDateline: (CNN) Body (CNN) --  Hundreds of thousands of vaccines provided for Chinese children have been found to be faulty, inciting widespread fury and prompting the country's President, Xi Jinping, to describe the incident as "vile and shocking."China's Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) has launched an investigation into vaccine manufacturer Changchun Changsheng Biotechnology, revoking its license for human rabies vaccines and beginning a recall of all unused vaccines produced by the company.Five senior executives of the company, including the chairwoman, were taken into custody for questioning by Changchun police, who announced they had begun an official criminal investigation into the company.In Chinese, the term Changsheng is a play on words meaning "long life."Online message boards have been inundated with hundreds of thousands of comments since the news broke Sunday, with parents and consumers using the hashtag "#Changsheng bio-tech vaccine incident," to post reactions on Weibo, a Chinese platform likened to Twitter. "My home country, how can I trust you? You just let me down again and again," one user said. "Our trust has been overdrawn again and again, it's so irresponsible for everyone's life," said another.Many of the defective vaccines were already on the market and being given to Chinese children, as part of the mandatory national vaccination program. A number have now been recalled, but there is no information at this stage as to how they could affect the health of those children who have already been injected.One mother, surnamed Zhen from Baoding, Hebei province, told CNN she had found out since the announcement her six-year-old daughter was vaccinated with a Changsheng product."I'm kind of at loss. I have to wait for official conclusions," she said over Wechat.Zhen said she'd been supportive of products made in China, unlike a number of her contemporaries who "worship" foreign products."But this incident ... it also made me deeply concerned. It will be really hard to rebuild people's confidence in our national brands. After all, children are parents' lifeblood," she said.'Thorough' investigation promisedAt least two different vaccines -- rabies, and diphtheria and tetanus (DPT) -- manufactured by Changchun Changsheng Biotechnology are known to be defective. State-run Xinhua news agency reports that at least 113,000 doses of the company's rabies vaccine are affected. In a statement, the Jilin Provincial Food and Drug Administration said a total of 253,338 doses of Changsheng's DPT vaccine were faulty. This batch was sold to the Shandong Provincial Disease Prevention and Control Center.It follows an earlier incident, in November 2017, when at least another 400,000 doses of the same vaccine, produced by a different, second company, the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products, were found to be substandard.Eight provinces or cities immediately announced they would be stopping or suspending the use of human rabies vaccine from Changsheng, while another four claimed they had never used it.It is not known whether other regional disease control agencies have been affected.The Changsheng vaccine issues first became public following an official government inspection of the company's facilities on July 15, in which authorities found that the company had fabricated production and testing records, falsified production specifications and equipment, CFDA officials said in a briefing on Sunday. Despite being overseas on Monday on a visit to Africa, President Xi was briefed on the vaccine crisis and said ensuring the safety of drugs was the responsibility of the government and the Communist Party.He called for authorities to "scrape the poison off the bone" in their efforts to rectify the vaccine problems.On Sunday, Premier Li Keqiang, the country's number two leader, announced a "thorough" investigation of China's vaccine production and sales process, saying the incident had "broke people's moral bottom line.""Those involved will be resolutely punished with zero tolerance. (The government) will resolutely crack down on all illegal and criminal acts that endanger the safety of people's lives," a statement released by China's Central Government said.The vaccine crisis will undermine attempts by authorities to rebuild the public's trust in Chinese food and medicines after a series of wide-scale controversies in the past decade.In a statement released to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, the management of Changsheng said it felt "very ashamed and guilty" over the vaccines."The company will learn a lesson and take practical corrective measures and rectify thoroughly," the statement said.For their mistake, Changsheng was fined 3,442,887 yuan ($507,843) by the Chinese government.'A test of a modern country's governance'State-run tabloid the Global Times said in an unusually blunt editorial Sunday the provision of safe vaccines for the population was "a test of a modern country's governance."Another state media publication, China Daily, said in an editorial the same day transparency was needed if the public was going to be satisfied."The authorities need to release whatever information they know about the incident to the public as soon as possible," the article said.The vaccine scandal is just the latest in a series of controversies surrounding fake or defective products produced in China.In 2008, about 300,000 Chinese infants became sick after drinking tainted milk formula, triggering a countrywide rush to buy internationally-produced baby products in Hong Kong and abroad.Years later, almost half of Chinese food-processing plants still failed to meet internationally acceptable standards, according to a 2015 report. Even condiments such as soy sauce and spice mix haven't escaped the fake goods scares, after authorities in northern China busted several factories making counterfeit versions of the popular products in 2017.TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

This batch was sold to the Shandong Provincial Disease Prevention and Control Center.It follows an earlier incident, in November 2017, when at least another 400,000 doses of the same vaccine, produced by a different, second company, the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products, were found to be substandard.Eight provinces or cities immediately announced they would be stopping or suspending the use of human rabies vaccine from Changsheng, while another four claimed they had never used it.It is not known whether other regional disease control agencies have been affected.The Changsheng vaccine issues first became public following an official government inspection of the company's facilities on July 15, in which authorities found that the company had fabricated production and testing records, falsified production specifications and equipment, CFDA officials said in a briefing on Sunday.Despite being overseas on Monday on a visit to Africa, President Xi was briefed on the vaccine crisis and said ensuring the safety of drugs was the responsibility of the government and the Communist Party.He called for authorities to "scrape the poison off the bone" in their efforts to rectify the vaccine problems.On Sunday, Premier Li Keqiang, the country's number two leader, announced a "thorough" investigation of China's vaccine production and sales process, saying the incident had "broke people's moral bottom line.""Those involved will be resolutely punished with zero tolerance. (The government) will resolutely crack down on all illegal and criminal acts that endanger the safety of people's lives," a statement released by China's Central Government said.The vaccine crisis will undermine attempts by authorities to rebuild the public's trust in Chinese food and medicines after a series of wide-scale controversies in the past decade.In a statement released to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, the management of Changsheng said it felt "very ashamed and guilty" over the vaccines."The company will learn a lesson and take practical corrective measures and rectify thoroughly," the statement said.For their mistake, Changsheng was fined 3,442,887 yuan ($507,843) by the Chinese government.'A test of a modern country's governance'State-run tabloid the Global Times said in an unusually blunt editorial Sunday the provision of safe vaccines for the population was "a test of a modern country's governance."Another state media publication, China Daily, said in an editorial the same day transparency was needed if the public was going to be satisfied."The authorities need to release whatever information they know about the incident to the public as soon as possible," the article said.The vaccine scandal is just the latest in a series of controversies surrounding fake or defective products produced in China.In 2008, about 300,000 Chinese infants became sick after drinking tainted milk formula, triggering a countrywide rush to buy internationally-produced baby products in Hong Kong and abroad.Years later, almost half of Chinese food-processing plants still failed to meet internationally acceptable standards, according to a 2015 report.Even condiments such as soy sauce and spice mix haven't escaped the fake goods scares, after authorities in northern China busted several factories making counterfeit versions of the popular products in 2017.Load-Date: July 25, 2018End of Document

China Mice & Keyboards Market Trends & Forecasts to 2027 - ResearchAndMarkets.comBusiness WireJuly 30, 2018 Monday 11:45 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Business Wire, Inc.Distribution: Business Editors; Hardware WritersLength: 418 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "Mice & Keyboards Market Trends in China" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.This study focuses on China's Mice & Keyboards market trends. In the two past decades, the market has been growing at a fast pace. The dramatic expansions of the manufacturing capabilities and rising consumer consumptions in China have transformed China's society and economy. China is one of the world's major producers for industrial and consumer products. Far outpacing other economies in the world, China is the world's fastest growing market for the consumptions of goods and services. The Chinese economy maintains a high speed growth which has been stimulated by the consecutive increases of industrial output, imports & exports, consumer consumption and capital investment for over two decades. Rapid consolidation between medium and large players is anticipated since the Chinese government has been encouraging industry consolidation with an effort to regulate the industry and to improve competitiveness in the world market.Although China has enjoyed the benefits of an expanding market for production and distribution, the industry is suffering from minimal innovation and investment in R&D and new product development. The sector's economies of scale have yet to be achieved. Most domestic manufacturers lack the autonomic intellectual property and financial resources to develop their own brand name products.This new study focuses on market trends and forecasts with historical data (2007, 2012 and 2017) and long-term forecasts through 2022 and 2027 are presented.The primary and secondary research is done in China in order to access up-to-date government regulations, market information and industry data.

OPEN LETTER TO GOOGLE ON REPORTED PLANS TO LAUNCH A CENSORED SEARCH ENGINE IN CHINAStates News ServiceAugust 28, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1610 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:Dear Mr Pichai(cc: Ben Gomes and Kent Walker)Like many of Google's own employees, we are extremely concerned by reports that Google is developing a new censored search engine app for the Chinese market. The project, codenamed "Dragonfly", would represent an alarming capitulation by Google on human rights. The Chinese government extensively violates the rights to freedom of expression and privacy; by accommodating the Chinese authorities' repression of dissent, Google would be actively participating in those violations for millions of internet users in China.We support the brave efforts of Google employees who have alerted the public to the existence of Dragonfly, and voiced their concerns about the project and Google's transparency and oversight processes.In contrast, company leadership has failed to respond publicly to concerns over Project Dragonfly, stating that it does not comment on "speculation about future plans". Executives have also refused to answer basic questions about how the company will safeguard the rights of users in China as it seeks to expand its business in the country.Since Google publicly exited the search market in China in 2010, citing restrictions to freedom of expression online, the Chinese government has strengthened its controls over the internet and intensified its crackdown on freedom of expression. We are therefore calling on Google to:Reaffirm the company's 2010 commitment not to provide censored search engine services in China;Disclose its position on censorship in China and what steps, if any, Google is taking to safeguard against human rights violations linked to Project Dragonfly and its other Chinese mobile app offerings;Guarantee protections for whistle-blowers and other employees speaking out where they see the company is failing its commitments to human rights.Our concerns about Dragonfly are set out in detail below.Freedom of expression and privacy in China and Google's human rights commitmentsIt is difficult to see how Google would currently be able to relaunch a search engine service in China in a way that would be compatible with the company's human rights responsibilities under international standards, or its own commitments. Were it to do so, in other words, there is a high risk that the company would be directly contributing to, or complicit in, human rights violations.The Chinese government runs one of the world's most repressive internet censorship and surveillance regimes. Human rights defenders and journalists are routinely arrested and imprisoned solely for expressing their views online. Under the Cybersecurity Law,[1] internet companies operating in China are obliged to censor users' content in a way that runs counter to international obligations to safeguard the rights of access to information, freedom of expression and privacy. Thousands of websites and social media services in the country remain blocked, and many phrases deemed to be politically sensitive are censored.[2] Chinese law also requires companies to store Chinese users' data within the country and facilitate surveillance by abusive security agencies.According to confidential Google documents obtained by The Intercept, the new search app being developed under Project Dragonfly would comply with China's draconian rules by automatically identifying and filtering websites blocked in China, and "blacklisting sensitive queries". Offering services through mobile phone apps, including Google's existing Chinese apps, raises additional concerns because apps enable access to extraordinarily sensitive data. Given the Cybersecurity Law's data localization and other requirements, it is likely that the company would be enlisted in surveillance abuses and their users' data would be much more vulnerable to government access.Google has a responsibility to respect human rights that exists independently of a state's ability or willingness to fulfil its own human rights obligations.[3] The company's own Code of Conduct promises to advance users' rights to privacy and freedom of expression globally. In Google's AI Principles, published in June, the company pledged not to build "technologies whose purpose contravenes widely accepted principles of international law and human rights". The company also commits, through the Global Network Initiative, to conduct human rights due diligence when entering markets or developing new services. Project Dragonfly raises significant, unanswered questions about whether Google is meeting these commitments.Transparency and human rights due diligenceGoogle's refusal to respond substantively to concerns over its reported plans for a Chinese search service falls short of the company's commitment to accountability and transparency.[4]In 2010, the human rights community welcomed Google's announcement that it had "decided we are no longer willing to continue censoring our results on Google.cn", citing cyber-attacks against the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists and attempts by the Chinese government to "further limit free speech on the web".If Google's position has indeed changed, then this must be stated publicly, together with a clear explanation of how Google considers it can square such a decision with its responsibilities under international human rights standards and its own corporate values. Without these clarifications, it is difficult not to conclude that Google is now willing to compromise its principles to gain access to the Chinese market.There also appears to be a broader lack of transparency around due diligence processes at Google. In order to "know and show" that they respect human rights, companies are required under international standards to take steps to identify, prevent and mitigate against adverse impacts linked to their products and communicate these efforts to key stakeholders and the public.[5] The letter from Google employees published on 16 August 2018 demonstrates that some employees do not feel Google's processes for implementing its AI Principles and ethical commitments are sufficiently meaningful and transparent.[6]Protection of whistle-blowersGoogle has stated that it cannot respond to questions about Project Dragonfly because reports about the project are based on "leaks".[7] However, the fact that the information has been publicly disclosed by employees does not lessen its relevance and rights impact.In relation both to Project Dragonfly and to Google's involvement in the US government's drone programme, Project Maven, whistle-blowers have been crucial in bringing ethical concerns over Google's operations to public attention. The protection of whistle-blowers who disclose information that is clearly in the public interest is grounded in the rights to freedom of expression and access to information.[8] The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises recommend that companies put in place "safeguards to protect bona fide whistle-blowing activities".[9]We are calling on Google to publicly commit to protect whistle-blowers in the company and to take immediate steps to address the concerns employees have raised about Project Dragonfly.As it stands, Google risks becoming complicit in the Chinese government's repression of freedom of speech and other human rights in China. Google should heed the concerns raised by human rights groups and its own employees and refrain from offering censored search services in China.Signed, the following organizations:Access NowAmnesty InternationalArticle 19Center for Democracy and TechnologyCommittee to Protect JournalistsElectronic Frontier FoundationHuman Rights in ChinaHuman Rights WatchInternational Service for Human Rights (ISHR)PEN InternationalPrivacy InternationalReporters Without Borders (RSF)WITNESSSigned in individual capacity (affiliations for identification purposes only):Ronald DeibertProfessor of Political Science and Director of the Citizen LabUniversity of TorontoRebecca MacKinnonDirector, Ranking Digital RightsXiao QiangResearch ScientistFounder and Director of the Counter-Power LabSchool of Information, University of California at BerkeleyLokman TsuiAssistant Professor at the School of Journalism and CommunicationThe Chinese University of Hong Kong[1] See Cybersecurity Law of the People's Republic of China (2016), unofficial translation, https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/bilingual-2016-cybersecurity-law/?lang=en and Human Rights Watch, "China: Abusive Cybersecurity Law Set to be Passed," November 6, 2016,            https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/11/06/china-abusive-cybersecurity-law-set-be-passed.[2] See GreatFire.org, Online Censorship In China, https://en.greatfire.org/analyzer.[3] UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/GuidingPrinciplesBusinessHR_EN.pdf.[4] For example, the Global Network Initiative Principles on Freedom of Expression and Privacy, https://globalnetworkinitiative.org/gni-principles/.[5] UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.[6] Kate Conger and Daisuke Wakabayashi, "Google Employees Protest Secret Work on Censored Search Engine for China," New York Times, August 16, 2018, https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/16/technology/google-employees-protest-search-censored-china.html.[7] Amnesty International meeting with Google, August 2018.[8] UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression, Report to the General Assembly on the Protection of Sources and Whistleblowers, September 2015, https://www.ohchr.org/en/issues/freedomopinion/pages/protectionofsources.aspx.[9] OECD Guidelines, para 13, https://globalnetworkinitiative.org/gni-principles/.Load-Date: August 28, 2018End of Document

The just demand of Donald Trump to China&#39;s tradeCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 28, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 661 wordsBody        Although the analysis of the commercial war has materialized in the critics to the protectionism of Donald Trump, the certain thing is that part of the demands that the president of the USA makes to China makes sense. Washington claims for the damages suffered by US companies operating in the Asian country, due to the theft of intellectual property or forced transfer of technology, a complaint to which the European Union joins.  American firms, as well as other foreign firms, face risks once they arrive in China. When initiating the investment they must join joint ventures or local companies, several of them state-owned, being forced to share their intellectual property and production secrets. There is even documentation about companies that have been expelled or that have seen the joint ventures disarmed after having provided the valuable information.  Additionally, Western corporations must invest billions of dollars to address potential brand infractions or copyright infringement, another of the common forms of intellectual property infringement that occur in the Asian giant.  The claims in the matter have been presented to the WTO. When the commercial war was still incipient, the Trump administration went to the multilateral organization to ask for consultations on the case. "China denies foreigners holding patents the ability to assert their rights," says the document presented on March 26 this year.  Along the same lines, the European Union addressed the WTO on June 6 of this year, stating that Chinese legislation "imposes mandatory contractual conditions that discriminate against foreigners."  In that context, Trump's complaint "is valid," says Juan Carlos Hidalgo, an analyst at the Cato Institute who has closely followed the tariff dispute, telling PULSO that although it is a matter that "occurs at all levels, it is the large American companies that have been most commonly confronted with this problem. "  In fact, the most recent report of the United States Intellectual Property Commission estimates that the annual cost to the country's economy exceeds US $ 225,000 million in counterfeit products, pirated software and theft of trade secrets and could even reach US $ 600,000. millions.  "The theft of intellectual property by thousands of Chinese actors continues to be rampant, and the United States constantly buys its inventions and those of other states from Chinese offenders. China (including Hong Kong) represents 87% of the seized counterfeit products that enter the United States, "said the report.  The defense of Beijing  After the lawsuit filed by the European Union, in one of its white papers the Chinese government said it has fulfilled its commitments in terms of protection of intellectual property rights, investing in 2017 a total of US $ 28,600 million for foreign rights, as consigned by the state news agency Xinhua.  The document adds that the advances in the field "not only serve China's development needs, but also help cultivate a business environment based on laws, internationalized and favorable to business."  However, there are other arguments on the table. "China says that this is a practice that has historically been incurred by rising powers. The US during its emergence as an industrial power also stole intellectual property to countries like the United Kingdom. China accuses hypocrisy on the part of Europeans and Americans in this issue "says Hidalgo, who points out that, unfortunately for Beijing, the rules have changed in our days.  On the other hand, James Andrew Lewis,Vice President of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, maintains a column published by the think tank that although "disagrees with the style that this administration (Trump's) faces China", the truth is that the Asian power "will not change its behavior in the absence of external pressure. "  The entry Donald Trump's just demand for Chinese trade was first published in La Tercera. Load-Date: September 28, 2018End of Document

REC posts loss, but CEO still optimisticColumbia Basin Herald, Moses Lake, Wash.July 20, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 Columbia Basin HeraldDistributed by Tribune Content AgencySection: BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWSLength: 609 wordsByline: Charles H. Featherstone, Columbia Basin Herald, Moses Lake, Wash.BodyJuly 20--Print ArticleMOSES LAKE -- Norway-based REC Silicon posted a loss of $9.6 million on revenue of $58.9 million for the second quarter of 2018 (April-June).And if the international market for polysilicon doesn't improve in the next year, REC Silicon will have to consider suspending operations at its Moses Lake facility, according to company President and CEO Tore Torvund."We will evaluate suspension in Moses Lake," Torvund said during a conference call late Wednesday night (Thursday morning in Oslo). "A shut down is a possibility, and it might happen if there is no improvement in (the third and fourth quarters).""I don't think it is very likely," Torvund continued. "We have sufficient liquidity, strong Butte operations. This can keep the company going until PV (photovoltaics) comes back.""Butte is doing very well, silane is strong. It's the most important part of the business now," Torvund said.REC Silicon recently laid off roughly 100 employees and reduced production of polysilicon at its Moses Lake facility to 25 percent of capacity after China slapped tariffs on polysilicon -- used to make silicon wafers for solar panels -- preventing U.S. polysilicon makers from selling to the Chinese market.China produces roughly 90 percent of the world's silicon wafers.Torvund and REC Chief Financial Officer James May said the company is being kept afloat by strong sales from its silicon gas unit in Butte, Mont. Silicon gas, or silane, is used to make semiconductors, display panels, and other electronic devices, and is not affected by the 2011 Chinese tariffs or the ongoing trade war."We have sufficient liquidity to maintain operations for 12 months at 25 percent capacity," May said.In addition to the Moses Lake and Butte facilities, REC also has a 15 percent stake in polysilicon facility in Yulin, China.Torvund also said REC is not in discussions with anyone about selling the Moses Lake facility."That would not be advantageous to our shareholders," Torvund said of a sale.Torvund is somewhat optimistic about future demand for polysilicon. He said the Chinese government stopped subsidizing its solar industry and around 30-40 percent of Chinese polysilicon production has shut down."China's government has taken away subsidies to force consolidation in the solar industry," Torvund said.In fact, across the world, as production and installation costs for solar power products have fallen, governments have stopped subsidizing solar production and have begun taxing it, Torvund said."It's a strange development, and a lot of change," he said.Average world prices for polysilicon have fallen to around $11.13 per metric ton in July from over $15 per metric ton at the beginning of 2018, according to REC. The company expects prices to remain at this level for the rest of the year, though as the Chinese industry consolidates and as some of the tariffs fall, Torvund expects prices to eventually begin to rise.In fact, Torvund said he's already beginning to see signs.In the short term, Torvund said the company is talking with its customers in Taiwan to "find a competitive price" and "undercut the market to get customers as long as the trade war continues."If REC can hold on long enough, Torvund believes the company is well positioned as one of the world's lowest cost producers of polysilicon to take advantage of the market when it recovers."Our job is to survive as a company," he said. "Focus on the short term to still be viable in the long term."Print Article___ (c)2018 the Columbia Basin Herald, Wash.

China Calling: Why Alphabet, Starbucks Can't Keep Their Eyes Off ChinaRealMoneyAugust 27, 2018 Monday 4:15 PM EDTCopyright 2018 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 765 wordsByline: Daria SolovievaHighlight: Trade war is not deterring these U.S. companies from pushing into China.BodyDespite unproductive trade talks in Washington, China's market is proving an irresistible magnet for American companies looking to grow.For many of these companies, the wheels to expand in China have been in motion for some time, but recent trade tension and uncertainty have not dissuaded them, so far.Starbucks along with Yum! Brand, Inc.  , Nike  and Tapestry Inc  , the umbrella brand for Coach and Kate Spade, are all looking to developing markets to provide growth on the international level, says Brian Yarbrough, an analyst for Edward Jones, in an interview with Real Money.Yum! China plans to more than double its number of Kentucky Fried Chicken and Pizza Hut restaurants."For most consumer discretionary companies, there are not a lot of growth opportunities domestically," says Yarbrough, noting "trade concerns have of course thrown a little bit of cold water on China's market right now."Still, the alluring combination of demographics and projected growth is too strong to ignore for many of U.S. brands.Starbucks' Partnership with AlibabaLast week, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd  , China's Internet giant, shared more details about its partnership with Starbucks Corporation  Alibaba CEO  its American partner plans to "transform Starbucks China into a digital operation."For Starbucks, China represents its most digitally advanced, profitable stores in the world. Starbucks has a 58.6% share of the market in China, according to Euromonitor data, and is opening a store there every 15 hours."Starbucks' newest class of stores in China are delivering the highest average unit volumes, return on investment and profitability of any of the market's prior store classes in its history," according to the company.And China's middle class is projected to keep growing and to keep spending.China's middle class could spend $3 trillion more by 2022, one of the fastest-growing n the world, according to a  on the global middle class.With Starbucks' growth slowing in the U.S., China simply presents too good of an opportunity to pass on.Over the next five years, the Starbucks ready-to-drink business in China is expected to expand to more than 400 major Chinese cities.Alphabet's PushWaymo, Alphabet's  driverless car unit opened a China subsidiary in Shanghai back in May, according to a filing to China's National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System. Chinese news site Guancha first reported the news, also saying the company may bring self-driving taxi service to China by the end of 2018, in addition to designing and testing autonomous vehicle parts in China.Before that, Alphabet launched AI research lab in Beijing last year. The company also launched an AI-powered game called 'Caihua Xiaoge', in which the user draws and the AI guesses what it is. The game became a hit.And most recently, Alphabet is also planning to relaunch a friendly version of Google search engine, which is code-named Dragonfly and is facing criticism from Google employees.Slow Trade TalksNot much has come out of the talks in Washington, with new series of tariffs looming on the horizon.Meanwhile, the Chinese government has taken a proactive approach to supporting the yuan. This month the banks resumed adjustment of the yuan pricing against the dollar to ward off devaluation."If the guidance is not heeded by the market, there might be follow-up policy actions to imprint the guidance on the market," said Goldman Sachs in a research note on Saturday.How long can the Chinese government prop up the yuan against the dollar and avoid further devaluation and outflow of capital?China's retaliation against U.S. tariffs is another risk that all U.S. companies operating in China face.As Duncan Clark points out in his book Alibaba: The House That Jack Ma Built, the last time China suffered a major economic crisis in 2008, it actually worked out well for companies like Alibaba, with a major market share."China's traditional export markets were thrown into a tailspin," he wrote. "Taobao pried open the factory gates to consumers in China instead."Together with Tmall, e-commerce site Taobao makes up  .The U.S. companies are counting that the Chinese government will do whatever it takes to keep the economy churning along and its fast-growing consumer base happy.In 2008, the Chinese government policies ended up boosting e-commerce companies like Alibaba."It became clear that the much-needed rebalancing of the Chinese economy toward consumption could no longer be postponed," Clark wrote. "And Alibaba is one of the biggest beneficiaries."- Martin Cassidy contributed to this article.Load-Date: August 28, 2018End of Document

This massive increase over the previous year doesnt include detainees in re-education centers.China has detained as many as one million people in camps. While Chinese authorities deny that such camps exist, satellite images show the recent construction of massive structures in Xinjiang. Research from China scholar Adrian Zenz details Chinese government procurement and construction bids for new re-education facilities and upgrades and enlargements to existing ones.Security personnel subject camp detainees in Xinjiang to torture, medical neglect, solitary confinement, sleep deprivation and other deadly forms of abuse. They also force detainees to submit to daily brainwashing sessions and hours of exposure to Communist Party propaganda. The prisoners overseers require recitation of party slogans before eating.Outside the camps, Chinese authorities aggressively suppress expressions of religious identity. Xinjiang residents face daily intrusions in their home life, including home stays where Communist Party officials live with local families. Chinese authorities prohibit abnormal beards and veils in public, as well as some Islamic names. Standard religious practicesabstaining from alcohol, tobacco and pork, or fasting during Ramadanprovoke the authorities suspicions.The government has embraced tools Mao only could have dreamed of: big data, iris and body scanners, voice-pattern analyzers, DNA sequencers (including some sold by an American company) and facial-recognition cameras. Authorities use hand-held devices to search smartphones for encrypted messaging apps and require residents to install monitoring software in their smartphones.Radio Free Asia leads in reporting on this crisis. In retaliation, Chinese authorities have detained dozens of family members related to Uyghur journalists working for RFA in the U.S. In recent testimony before the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, RFA journalist Gulchehra Hoja lamented, Its a cruel irony that we as journalists can find out so much about whats happening inside Chinas Northwest, yet so little about our own families and loved ones. We are afraid to ask our friends and others there, because any contact and communication could endanger them as well. China also has used Uyghurs living in the country as leverage to gather information about exiled Uyghurs activitiesor to compel some to return to China.China largely has avoided consequences for this reprehensible behavior. It no longer should.Load-Date: August 10, 2018End of Document

Duke professor takes his 'supercamera' manufacturing to China, sparking questions about the technology's useThe Duke Chronicle: Duke UniversitySeptember 4, 2018 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 874 wordsBodyIt's a sweeping photo of downtown Durham. But you can see the boat shoes a man pedaling a bike is wearing and a poster hanging on a store window declaring love for public schools. Lettering and windows on a building blocks away are clear when enlarged.This is not some hyperbolic virtual reality experience. It is the front page of the technology company Aqueti's website, and the scene of Downtown Durham offers a taste of the crispness and detail captured by their "supercameras."Such high-resolution capabilities are a double-edged sword. The same perfectly smooth pixels that can catch a speeding driver can also be used for inappropriate surveillance.It's a conundrum David Brady, co-chair of Aqueti China Technology, Inc.'s board of directors, and Michael J. Fitzpatrick professor of photonics, acknowledges. The Duke professor has moved his high-resolution camera production to China, where he was able to establish a partnership and sell them commercially. Rights activists have criticized China's use of cameras to surveil its citizens."China is a major technological center, and to work in technology you really have to work with China in some way or another. In the same way, our cameras can be used in good or bad ways," Brady said. "That's true of computers [and] all information technology products. It's not possible, or really appropriate, for companies to control how their things are used."Brady, who specializes in computational imaging systems and works with Aqueti China Technology, Inc., worked under a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency grant to develop a gigapixel camera. His work, which was considered basic research and was not classified or sensitive, was tested by the U.S. Navy. The prototype saw five times better than a human eye with perfect 20/20 vision.In 2014 and 2015, Brady's cameras were being used for broadcasting, and he needed to produce them in high volume. After looking for partners in Japan, Taiwan and China, he established a partnership in China to manufacture the cameras.Michael Schoenfeld, vice president for public affairs and government relations, said that Duke received the necessary approvals when Brady decided to commercialize the camera technology in China. They received a commodity jurisdiction from the State Department and made the proper disclosures to DARPA.He established a lab at Duke Kunshan University, which was announced in January 2017."First of all, my program does not work directly with the Chinese government at all, other than the fact that our laboratory in Kunshan is supported by the Kunshan local government," Brady explained. "Basically our laboratory gets support from the Kunshan Education Bureau."The police department has installed some of the high-resolution cameras in public spaces in Kunshan, Brady said. China's traffic problems kill about 700 people each day-a problem that could be solved by deploying the high-resolution cameras in traffic control.But traffic control is not all that China uses cameras for-other uses including recognizing a heroin smuggler and a fugitive murder suspect. A July article by the New York Times highlighted other implementations for its millions of cameras, the sum of which the news story billed as a "high-tech authoritarian future."The country's central government wants to expand its surveillance network to keep tabs on its 1.4 billion citizens, leveraging its technology industry to monitor its masses. China has four times more surveillance cameras than the United States has, the article said, with an estimated 200 million in total.A Wall Street Journal article outlined the process by which Brady's technology got to China. A federal U.S. grant helped fund research into the technology used for the gigapixel camera. Then he decided to commercialize the technology and take it to Asia to be manufactured. He noted that the specific camera being produced in China now is not the same as the one he was working on under that grant.Brady says the cameras his company is producing are not being used in coordinated nefarious ways."The idea there is some connected, smart, 'Big Brother' project-our cameras are not really used for anything like that," he said.The cameras don't go directly to the government, the professor explained."In terms of selling cameras in China, we don't develop security systems. We don't sell cameras directly to the government anyway. We sell cameras to distributors who sell to other companies," Brady said. "The cameras are designed for public security, like train stations, football stadiums and roadways-like traffic cameras basically. Those are sold to a distributor to sell them to projects or local governments in China."Although the United States and China have a rocky relationship, Brady said that working with China on technological endeavors is imperative and that he hopes to see greater cooperation between the countries.As for the role of high-resolution cameras, he insisted that the net impact is worth it."Cameras can be used in bad ways," Brady said. "But in general, the impact of high-performance cameras in the world is very positive."Correction: Brady is the co-chair of Aqueti China's board of directors, not the president. The Chronicle regrets the error.Load-Date: September 4, 2018End of Document

Google Denies 'Dragonfly' Program in China Amid CriticismRealMoneySeptember 26, 2018 Wednesday 12:37 PM EDTCopyright 2018 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 849 wordsByline: Kevin CurranHighlight: The company is facing criticism from U.S. lawmakers, human rights organizations and even its own employees.BodyGoogle has denied allegations that it is close to a launch of a Chinese search pilot, despite numerous leaks indicating it has development underway.Alphabet, Inc.'s  rumored plans to jump back into China drew a rebuke from U.S. Senator Maggie Hassan, a Democrat from New Hampshire, during a hearing Wednesday before the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.The potential new program to re-enter China since Google's exit in 2010 over censorship concerns, codenamed "Dragonfly" in leaked documents, has received press, regulator, activist, and even employee outcry in recent months.The government compliant search engine that has been documented would store personal phone numbers, user searches, and work towards denoting social credit scores for individuals living under Xi Jinping's rule.Hassan called the potential project a "tool to suppress human rights." She is hardly the first to decry the company's reported interest in the market.Enright Eschews PlansDespite the heated questioning, Google chief privacy officer Keith Enright denied that the company is close to a Chinese launch."I stand by Google's record on human rights," he said in response to Hassan's pointed questioning. "My understanding is that we are not close to launching a search product in China."When asked by Hassan in a follow-up where leaks, reports, and letters are coming from, Enright declined to offer an explanation."I wouldn't speculate, senator." he answered.If the project does move forward, it could create a PR firestorm and lead to the company losing some of its key people, who have threatened to resign over the project.Regulators' WarningsWednesday's meeting was focused on data privacy for consumers, which is certainly a problem if the company is to enter a nation that practices large scale data mining and algorithmic surveillance on the online activity of its citizens.This is especially concerning if the new Dragonfly project forces searchers to log in and have their location tracked, eliminating any chance of privacy.Texas Congressman Will Hurd, chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Subcommittee on Information and Technology, told CNBC this morning that Google risks breaking its principles on privacy."The Chinese do not care about things like privacy," he said.As such, the search engine potentially kowtowing to Chinese government policy would erode any believability in the company's stated commitment to frameworks protecting transparency and privacy.However, more importantly to Hurd, Google risks giving away key information to the Chinese government if Dragonfly takes off.The Chinese government has intensified its focus on AI and high-tech industries in recent years, targeting proprietary secrets of companies that want to enter the consumer-rich countries."Trade secrets remain one of the most vulnerable forms of IP in China, in part because Chinese government authorities jeopardize the value of trade secrets by demanding unnecessary disclosure of confidential information for product approvals," the American Chamber of Commerce in China explained in a 2017 report.The sharing of all-important proprietary information has come to be seen as a "price of entry."Hurd warned that this is a way for China to work toward replacing the U.S. as the world's main superpower."The quickest way to get there is what they've been doing; stealing our technology" he explained.Academics and activists have been forthright with the moral and ethical problems they see with the inroads the company is making."We are extremely concerned by reports that Google is developing a new censored search engine app for the Chinese market," an open letter signed by 14 separate human rights organizations and four professors reads. "The Chinese government extensively violates the rights to freedom of expression and privacy; by accommodating the Chinese authorities' repression of dissent, Google would be actively participating in those violations for millions of internet users in China."Even within Google's own ranks, the decision to re-enter China is a serious concern and has led to organizational disconnect from executives."Currently we do not have the information required to make ethically-informed decisions about our work, our projects, and our employment," an employee letter obtained by The Intercept states.The letter goes on to demand transparency from the company as it built its clandestine Chinese engine."That the decision to build Dragonfly was made in secret, and progressed with the [artificial intelligence] Principles in place, makes clear that the Principles alone are not enough," the letter does on to say. "We urgently need more transparency, a seat at the table, and a commitment to clear and open processes: Google employees need to know what we're building."Bottom Line If Google is in fact launching a Chinese product as the leaks have suggested, it would destroy company credibility with the government and likely with its users as well. That being the case, investors will certainly hope that Enright's understanding is correct.Load-Date: September 27, 2018End of Document

Why Young Chinese Artists Are Avoiding Political ArtAtlantic OnlineJuly 26, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 999 wordsByline: Alec AshBodyHe Xiangyu's breakthrough exhibit took place in 2011, when he was just 25 years old. The Coca-Cola Project was a mound of noxious, gooey residue extracted from 127 tons of Coca Cola, a landfill shrine to consumerism that could be interpreted as an indictment of capitalist China. After that came a giant military tank made out of Louis Vuitton leather, deflated and powerless on the art-gallery floor but charged with political meaning. It was loud,bold art, speaking to a set of political concerns freshly relevant to the post-Tiananmen generation. But since 2013, He's art has been            minimalist to the point of parody: a huge canvas pasted in olive oil; a wall clock set one hour fast; a single sock inside a glass cabinet. Those pieces, and others by He's peers, represent a broader trend among younger Chinese artists, as political-statement art gives way to more abstract, contemporary fare.China's art market first exploded around the early 2000s, with works by Xu Bing, Zhang Xiaogang, and Yue Minjun selling for millions. After decades of art-as-propaganda, these artists created message art that challenged China's socialist past and served as commentary on more recent atrocities. One of Yue's paintings from the nineties that later sold for $5.9 million, "Execution," depicts a firing squad pointing make-believe guns at four men in underwear while both the soldiers and the victims grin maniacally. A famous 1995 artwork by Ai Weiwei, the international darling of Chinese art, depicts him            giving the finger to Tiananmen square and the portrait of Mao Zedong on the Forbidden City. During this period, China's art became synonymous with its politics.Many artists of the new generation are eschewing all that. They include Zhao Zhao, who cuts cubes out of antique Buddhist statues; Cao Fei, a video and digital-media artist concerned with urban decay; and Guo Hongwei, who arranges tiny piles of concrete ash, decorates empty rooms in colorful streaks, and paints intricate collections of birds, rocks, and leaves. This more conceptual art of "post-80s" or "post-90s" Chinese artists, named for the decades in which they were born, tends to reflect 21st-century themes such as urban malaise and the digital era, rather than narrowly Chinese concerns, including political ones.Indeed, the shift coincides with diminishing space for free expression since the late aughts, when government authorities blocked various foreign social-media websites and intensified their cultural censorship. Ai, who the Chinese government has scrutinized for years,            sustained a head injury when harassed by state security officers in 2009, after creating a work that commemorated the thousands of children who died in shoddily-constructed buildings during the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. And the government's heavy-handedness has only increased since Xi Jinping became president in 2013. In late 2014, speaking at a cultural forum in Beijing,            Xi said that art should serve the people and socialism and "be like sunlight in a blue sky" and like "a cool spring breeze." His language evoked a            famous speech by Mao at the 1942 Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, in which Mao said "there is, in fact, no such thing as art for art's sake ... art that is detached from or independent of politics."Ai has            expressed "total disappointment" in the young artists who avoid political art, suggesting that they are caving to government pressure. Those artists insist that's not the case: "In China, everything reflects the circumstances of Chinese society," He told me during a visit together to his hometown, near Dandong, on China's border with North Korea. "But we need to be more thoughtful and flexible about it." (His differences with Ai go back to before his recent artistic evolution: One of his works from 2011, "           The Death of Marat," is a fiberglass sculpture of Ai's corpse lying facedown on an exhibition-hall floor.)To be sure, political pressure from the Chinese government is not the only factor that has influenced Chinese art. Another key element is the market, which drives artistic creation more than some purists would like to imagine. Many Western buyers still favor politically provocative work from China, but many of them have expanded their notion of what Chinese art can be-that is, art for art's sake rather than relevant to China and its politics alone. "Ten years ago there was a tendency to read Chinese art as a direct commentary on Chinese sociopolitical conditions," Philip Tinari, the director of the Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing, said. "Now there is more appetite to look at it as aesthetic practice." New wealth in China has also led to a            rising number of Chinese art collectors who don't want political art about their nation, or are afraid to own it. "There is no Chinese contemporary art," Tinari said. "There is just art made by Chinese artists."The path of many artists has changed as well, with some gaining early exposure to international influences, and many studying abroad or in            art academies that opened in China only in recent decades. "The post-80s generation is very different from the generation of artists who grew up during the Cultural Revolution and then experienced the relative openness of the 1980s and the post-1989 crackdown," said Luise Guest, a manager of the White Rabbit Collection of Contemporary Chinese Art in Sydney, a private collection. While they are "much less interested in politics as it is narrowly defined," she continued, their artistic interests still brush against social issues such as the environment, gender, and urbanization. Making explicitly political art is dangerous, they have learned from example-so they focus on other subjects that they are often more interested in anyway.Last time I saw He, he told me, "I want to change the world's understanding of Chinese artists." He had just unveiled his new exhibit: a series of sculptures reconstructing the inside of his mouth, based on how he felt its contours with his tongue.Load-Date: July 27, 2018End of Document

RIGHTS GROUPS SLAM GOOGLE OVER REPORTS OF CENSORED SEARCH APP FOR CHINAStates News ServiceAugust 30, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 761 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Google shouldn't proceed with a planned search engine tailor-made for China's tightly censored internet, overseas rights groups have said.The New York-based group Human Rights Watch (HRW) and other groups and rights activists called in a letter to the company this week for the company to respect human rights, and to stop collaborating with Beijing to censor potential Chinese users."Google has promised to respect human rights and only develop technology that benefits society," senior HRW internet researcher Cynthia Wong said in a statement."Yet Google has failed to explain how it will shield users from the Chinese government's efforts to monitor and suppress dissent," she said.Writing to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, the groups cite media reports that the company is developing a mobile search app as part of a project code-named Dragonfly that would comply with Chinese censorship and other legal requirements.Signed by more than a dozen groups and individuals, the letter calls on Pichai to clarify Google's approach to China and what steps it is taking to safeguard users from the Chinese government's abusive censorship and surveillance regimes.Google has declined to "speculate" publicly to questions from the media and rights groups about the reports.Meanwhile, BuzzFeed News cited internal employee discussions as saying that several team members had quit Dragonfly over ethical concerns about the project and the surrounding secrecy.China's complex network of blocks, filters and human censorship known collectively as the Great Firewall already ensures that popular foreign websites like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube are hard to access for the majority of Chinese users.Government censors also prevent keyword searches linked to politically sensitive topics, including the 1989 Tiananmen massacre, dissidents and any form of political opposition.Examples cited by The Intercept based on confidential leaked Google documents include U.K. public broadcaster the BBC and the online encyclopedia Wikipedia.For some blacklisted queries, no results will be shown at all, and the blacklists will extend to image searches, spell checks and search suggestions, the report said.The proposed new Google app will comply with current restrictions, removing banned websites from the first page of results.'Launch-ready state'U.S.-based legal scholar Teng Biao said the Dragonfly project was a surprise turnaround for the company."Google said not so long ago in a statement that it had no plans to return to China," Teng said. "The fact that a lot of high-profile rights organizations have written to Google warning it not to provide search engine services to the Chinese government means that Google will return to China sooner or later.""This letter warns Google against collaborating with the Chinese Communist Party and against revealing the personal details of dissidents to the Chinese authorities," he said.The Intercept cited anonymous Google employees who worked on Project Dragonfly as saying that they were told in July to have the project in "launch-ready state" pending approval from Chinese officials.U.S.-based rights activist Liu Qing said the concerted campaign against a censored Google Search for China should wake major corporations up to the knowledge that collaborating with Beijing should be an unthinkable prospect."Naturally, companies can't entirely throw off the allure of the markets and of capital," Liu said. "But I hope that Google doesn't go back to China in the same manner that Yahoo did at the start, and begin turning over the data of dissidents to the Communist Party.""In the end, Yahoo's compliant attitude to the Chinese government led to their leaving the China market entirely, so cooperating with the Chinese Communist Party doesn't always yield the results people hope it will," he said.In 2005, Chinese journalist Shi Tao, who circulated a government order to suppress media commemorations of the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown, was jailed for 10 years after Yahoo handed over his e-mail records to the authorities.Google left China in 2010 after a showdown with China's ruling Communist Party over internet censorship, and currently redirects Chinese language users from the mainland to a search site run from its Hong Kong-based servers.China has blocked access to Google search, YouTube, and Picasa photographs continually since 2009, according to Google's Transparency Report.Reported by Xi Wang for RFA's Mandarin Service.

New ACC Report Projecting Potential Job and Economic Losses Caused By Chinese Retaliatory Tariffs Brings New Urgency to Ending U.S.-China Trade WarTargeted News ServiceSeptember 6, 2018 Thursday 8:33 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 743 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe American Chemistry Council issued the following news release:Punitive measures imposed on China as a result of the U.S. Section 301 investigation have incited retaliatory tariffs on $11 billion in U.S. chemicals and plastics exports and put nearly 55,000 American jobs and $18 billion in domestic activity at risk as a result of reduced demand for those products, according to new economic report published today by the American Chemistry Council (ACC). The release of the new data coincides with ACC's filing of public comments on U.S. 'List 3' and follows on the heels of testimony given in August by ACC Director of International Trade, Ed Brzytwa, in which ACC called on policymakers to remove all 1,505 chemicals and plastics products, valued at $16.4 billion, from List 3."It's unavoidable that China's tariffs on U.S. chemicals and plastics exports will result in reduced demand for those exports," said Emily Sanchez, ACC director of economics and data analytics and chief author of the new report. "Depending on the elasticity of demand for U.S. products in China, the retaliatory tariffs could result in substantial losses for American producers, their employees, and for the communities that depend on the economic activity that workers in the chemicals and plastics industry generate."ACC's analysis presents two potential scenarios: a "baseline case," in which Chinese importers are more challenged to find alternative sources to U.S. products; and a "worst case," where Chinese customers can more readily adjust their supply chains to substitute for U.S.-sourced goods. In the baseline case, ACC estimates that the loss in U.S. chemicals and plastics exports to China would be equivalent to $1.6 billion annually. Losses to U.S. chemical and plastics exports could reach as high as $6.1 billion annually under a worst-case scenario, according to ACC."If numbers are the universal language, then there should be no language barrier preventing the U.S. and China from understanding the damage that tariffs are ready to inflict on one another's economies," Brzytwa said. "Both sides have proven that they have the other's most thriving domestic industries, like chemicals, in their crosshairs. Now, it's time for the U.S. and China to steer this trade war to a sensible, productive, and stable conclusion. For China's part, it must recognize that the path it has followed now for decades - flouting World Trade Organization principles and agreements - is no longer in its best economic interest."At the same time, the data also illustrate that the current U.S. trade actions may lead to severe, unintended consequences that should not be overlooked by the Administration. "As the U.S. Administration continues to erect costly barriers to accessing global supply chains and foreign customer markets, the Chinese government is actively working towards directing industrial capacity expansions in their own domestic economy and eliminating tariff and other barriers to doing business with other (non-U.S.) foreign partners," Sanchez noted. "The loss in demand due to retaliatory tariffs on U.S. chemical exports to China will reduce the competitiveness of chemical manufacturers in the U.S. and, as a result, output and job losses in the chemical industry will accrue due to lost demand for chemistry. This lost manufacturing activity will be felt upstream as suppliers to the industry face reduced demand for their output and it will be felt in the local communities where workers spend their wages," Sanchez added.To that point, ACC's public comments on List 3 also include a growing list of 21 firsthand accounts from companies exposed to the potentially damaging impacts from the Administration's China Section 301 tariffs and Section 232 tariffs and quotas on steel and aluminum imports. The anecdotes forebode significant disruptions to supply chain operations - incentivizing companies to move U.S. production overseas due to the sudden, uneven playing field that tariffs would create in the global marketplace."A trade war will neither achieve a more balanced trading relationship between the U.S. and China nor advance the interests of the U.S. economy, manufacturers, and consumers," Brzytwa reiterated. "We strongly urge the U.S. government to avoid this action, rescind the tariffs currently in effect, and therefore preempt additional retaliation by China."[Category: Chemicals]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6433876 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: September 7, 2018End of Document

US firm: Chinese hackers infiltrate Cambodia ahead of pollsAssociated Press Financial WireJuly 12, 2018 Thursday 2:59 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 912 wordsByline: By GERRY SHIH, Associated PressDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - Last month, the daughter of a jailed Cambodian opposition party leader received an email from a well-seeming activist at a reputed Cambodian non-profit. For weeks, the sender nudged Monovithya Kem to open an attachment described as containing interview questions.Kem suspected a trap set by Cambodian hackers seeking access to her computer. But a monthslong investigation by California security-research firm FireEye revealed that Kem was among several Cambodians likely targeted by a far more formidable actor: China.FireEye said Wednesday it found evidence that a Chinese hacking team it believes is linked to Beijing has penetrated computer systems belonging to Cambodia's election commission, opposition leaders and media in the months leading up to Cambodia's July 29 election. Investigators could not immediately tell what, if any, data had been stolen or altered.The Foreign Ministry in China has rejected these allegations.Although FireEye did not find evidence that the Chinese hackers are working to sway the Cambodian elections in the ruling party's favor, the revelations may cast a murky geopolitical shadow over the elections critics already say will be neither free nor fair.Prime Minister Hun Sen, one of the world's longest-serving rulers and a staunch ally of Beijing, faced what analysts predicted would have been a tight race before he jailed opposition leader Kem Sokha last year, accusing him of treason.After the European Union and the United States withdrew their support for the election, China stepped in to donate $20 million to Cambodia's National Election Committee, said Hang Puthea, a spokesman for the body. China also last year pledged $100 million in military aid.Monovithya Kem, the daughter of Kem Sokha and an official in his now-disbanded Cambodia National Rescue Party, said she has frequently been targeted by Cambodian hackers in the past, but the revelation of potential Chinese involvement shocked her."To know that a foreign group is specifically trying to get information from me - now that's scary," Kem said by phone from Washington, where she is based. "What you're dealing with is suddenly bigger."FireEye's head of cyberspying analysis Benjamin Read said malware-ridden files sent to Cambodian targets were traced by his team to an unsecured server operated by the Chinese hacking group TEMP.Periscope.On the hackers' server, FireEye researchers found records showing that the group had compromised Cambodia's election commission and several Cambodian ministries. The servers' access logs in one instance traced to an IP address in China's southern Hainan island, said Read, who described TEMP.Periscope as the second most active Chinese hacking group FireEye has traced.FireEye says the group appears state-linked because it seems to be seeking information that would benefit the Chinese government."They don't go for credit card numbers of bank account numbers, they go for information that's of use to a government," Read said. "We saw them use the same infrastructure to target the Cambodia government and private companies. It suggests the Chinese government doesn't draw a line between political espionage versus commercial espionage."FireEye has previously found that TEMP.Periscope sought maritime technology from U.S. and European defense firms and other institutions with projects in the contested South China Sea.China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it is not aware of TEMP.Periscope and resolutely opposes cyberattacks as a general principle. "China calls on the international community to combat cybersecurity threats on a respectful, equal and mutually beneficial basis," it said.The Cambodian election commission was aware of Wednesday's reports about the hacking, Hang, the commission's spokesman said, and has filed a legal complaint to the Cambodian government.Government spokesman Phay Sophana said he was not aware of any specific cases of hacking attacks on state agencies. Cambodia would protect its online data, especially relating to national security, the election and financial matters, he added.The scope of FireEye's findings on Wednesday did not include Taiwan.

US firm: Chinese hackers infiltrate Cambodia ahead of pollsAssociated Press InternationalJuly 12, 2018 Thursday 2:59 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 912 wordsByline: By GERRY SHIH, Associated PressDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - Last month, the daughter of a jailed Cambodian opposition party leader received an email from a well-seeming activist at a reputed Cambodian non-profit. For weeks, the sender nudged Monovithya Kem to open an attachment described as containing interview questions.Kem suspected a trap set by Cambodian hackers seeking access to her computer. But a monthslong investigation by California security-research firm FireEye revealed that Kem was among several Cambodians likely targeted by a far more formidable actor: China.FireEye said Wednesday it found evidence that a Chinese hacking team it believes is linked to Beijing has penetrated computer systems belonging to Cambodia's election commission, opposition leaders and media in the months leading up to Cambodia's July 29 election. Investigators could not immediately tell what, if any, data had been stolen or altered.The Foreign Ministry in China has rejected these allegations.Although FireEye did not find evidence that the Chinese hackers are working to sway the Cambodian elections in the ruling party's favor, the revelations may cast a murky geopolitical shadow over the elections critics already say will be neither free nor fair.Prime Minister Hun Sen, one of the world's longest-serving rulers and a staunch ally of Beijing, faced what analysts predicted would have been a tight race before he jailed opposition leader Kem Sokha last year, accusing him of treason.After the European Union and the United States withdrew their support for the election, China stepped in to donate $20 million to Cambodia's National Election Committee, said Hang Puthea, a spokesman for the body. China also last year pledged $100 million in military aid.Monovithya Kem, the daughter of Kem Sokha and an official in his now-disbanded Cambodia National Rescue Party, said she has frequently been targeted by Cambodian hackers in the past, but the revelation of potential Chinese involvement shocked her."To know that a foreign group is specifically trying to get information from me - now that's scary," Kem said by phone from Washington, where she is based. "What you're dealing with is suddenly bigger."FireEye's head of cyberspying analysis Benjamin Read said malware-ridden files sent to Cambodian targets were traced by his team to an unsecured server operated by the Chinese hacking group TEMP.Periscope.On the hackers' server, FireEye researchers found records showing that the group had compromised Cambodia's election commission and several Cambodian ministries. The servers' access logs in one instance traced to an IP address in China's southern Hainan island, said Read, who described TEMP.Periscope as the second most active Chinese hacking group FireEye has traced.FireEye says the group appears state-linked because it seems to be seeking information that would benefit the Chinese government."They don't go for credit card numbers of bank account numbers, they go for information that's of use to a government," Read said. "We saw them use the same infrastructure to target the Cambodia government and private companies. It suggests the Chinese government doesn't draw a line between political espionage versus commercial espionage."FireEye has previously found that TEMP.Periscope sought maritime technology from U.S. and European defense firms and other institutions with projects in the contested South China Sea.China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it is not aware of TEMP.Periscope and resolutely opposes cyberattacks as a general principle. "China calls on the international community to combat cybersecurity threats on a respectful, equal and mutually beneficial basis," it said.The Cambodian election commission was aware of Wednesday's reports about the hacking, Hang, the commission's spokesman said, and has filed a legal complaint to the Cambodian government.Government spokesman Phay Sophana said he was not aware of any specific cases of hacking attacks on state agencies. Cambodia would protect its online data, especially relating to national security, the election and financial matters, he added.The scope of FireEye's findings on Wednesday did not include Taiwan. But Danielle Cave, a cyber policy analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute who is not affiliated to FireEye, said China appears to be testing its cyber and covert influence capabilities on the self-ruled island Beijing claims as its territory.Cave said Taiwan has long been a target of campaigns by China that combine spreading propaganda favoring China with outright hacking to deface websites or pilfer data.In January, Taiwan prosecutors said they found evidence that China's Taiwan Affairs Office promised to pay a Taiwanese politician $500,000 to run a website publishing articles promoting unification.

Continue reading Eye Care Market | Industrial Output, Imports & Exports, Consumer Consumption and Capital InvestmentThis study focuses on China's Eye Care market trends. In the two past decades, the market has been growing at a fast pace. The dramatic expansions of the manufacturing capabilities and rising consumer consumptions in China have transformed China's society and economy. China is one of the world's major producers for industrial and consumer products. Far outpacing other economies in the world, China is the world's fastest growing market for the consumptions of goods and services. The Chinese economy maintains a high speed growth which has been stimulated by the consecutive increases of industrial output, imports & exports, consumer consumption and capital investment for over two decades. Rapid consolidation between medium and large players is anticipated since the Chinese government has been encouraging industry consolidation with an effort to regulate the industry and to improve competitiveness in the world market. Although China has enjoyed the benefits of an expanding market for production and distribution, the industry is suffering from minimal innovation and investment in R&D and new product development. The sector's economies of scale have yet to be achieved. Most domestic manufacturers lack the autonomic intellectual property and financial resources to develop their own brand name products. Request a Free Sample Copy of Eye Care Market Report @ https://www.radiantinsights.com/research/eye-care-market-trends-in-china/request-sampleThis new study focuses on market trends and forecasts with historical data (2005, 2010 and 2015) and long-term forecasts through 2020 and 2025 are presented.

CECC Chairs Urge Commerce Secretary to Limit Technology Sales to Chinese Entities Targeting Uyghur MuslimsTargeted News ServiceSeptember 12, 2018 Wednesday 8:11 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 938 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe office of Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, issued the following news release:U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) and U.S. Representative Chris Smith (R-NJ), Chair and Cochair of the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), urged U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross to extend American export restrictions to include Chinese government and state security entities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), as well as any businesses profiting from the expansion of the region's surge in security spending. Specifically, they wrote that "U.S. companies should not be assisting in the expansion of China's systems for surveillance, detection, and detention, or be complicit in what are gross violations of internationally recognized human rights occurring daily in the XUAR."The letter's recommendations stem from testimony provided by independent experts and U.S. government witnesses at a CECC hearing entitled "Surveillance, Suppression, and Mass Detention: Xinjiang's Human Rights Crisis" and is the second recent initiative of the Chairs to press for a robust U.S. response to the human rights situation in the XUAR. The Chairs sent a bipartisan letter in August urging "Global Magnitsky" sanctions against senior Chinese Government and Communist Party officials engaged in the repression of ethnic minorities in the XUAR.The text of their letter is below:Dear Secretary Ross:Thank you for your response to our May 15, 2018 letter regarding controls on the sale by U.S. companies of surveillance and crime control technology for use by Chinese security forces and police. Our concerns are particularly acute as they relate to the Chinese government's pervasive surveillance and internment system targeting Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR).We appreciated the Department making Mr. Anthony Christino, Director of the Bureau of Industry and Security's Foreign Policy Division, available to testify at a recent Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) hearing focused on the grave and deteriorating human rights situation in the XUAR.Joining Mr. Christino on the hearing's government panel was Ambassador Kelley Currie, U.S. Representative to the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations, who characterized the scope of the campaign against Uyghur Muslims as "truly breathtaking" and described how "over the past year, hundreds of thousands of law-abiding Uighur citizens of China--men, women and even children--have disappeared into state custody..." Ambassador Currie focused specifically on the "highly intrusive, high-tech surveillance system in Xinjiang," which includes:"thousands of surveillance cameras, including in mosques; facial recognition software; obligatory content-monitoring apps on smartphones and GPS devices on cars; widespread new police outposts with tens of thousands of newly-hired police and even Party personnel embedded in people's homes; and compulsory collection of vast biometric datasets on ethnic and religious minorities throughout the region, including DNA and blood samples, 3-D photos, iris scans, and voiceprints."The testimony of Ambassador Currie and other expert witnesses further underscored that the abuses occurring in the XUAR are contrary to the national security interests of the United States. U.S. companies should not be assisting in the expansion of China's systems for surveillance, detection, and detention, or be complicit in what are gross violations of internationally recognized human rights occurring daily in the XUAR.While we believe that longstanding export restrictions on the sale of crime control or detection instruments or equipment to the People's Republic of China should prohibit all U.S. companies from aiding efforts to expand China's high-tech surveillance and detention of ethnic minority populations in China, we urge you to also add Chinese government and state security entities in the XUAR, and any businesses profiting from the expansion of the region's surge in security spending, to the U.S. Government's "Entity List" (Supplement 4, Part 744 of the Export Administration Regulations).During the course of his testimony, Mr. Christino said the Commerce Department, as a result of information provided by the CECC, was reviewing whether there is sufficient evidence to justify additional end-user restrictions for XUAR police and security forces, among others. This was a welcomed acknowledgement. Given the national integration of China's state security apparatus, we believe there should also be a presumption of denial for any sale of technology or equipment that would make a direct and significant contribution to the police surveillance and detection system, including dual-use technology sold or resold to any elements of the Ministry of Public Security. In response to a question at the hearing, Mr. Christino assured the Commissioners that the Commerce Department possesses sufficient authority, within the interagency process, to make such determinations. Therefore, we respectfully request an update as to the status and anticipated timeline of this interagency process.The U.S. government has clearly acknowledged the severity of the abuses in Xinjiang. Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have both voiced public concern about these abuses and have specifically focused on the proliferation of "political reeducation" centers or camps throughout the region. Our export policy must reflect this reality.We look forward to your response.Sincerely,Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6442127 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: September 13, 2018End of Document
