Users spread information and images that they said exposed the company's "true face" -- including listing outlets in mainland China as "overseas stores."The website of its Taiwan-based parent company was reportedly hacked Thursday with unflattering photos of Tsai and mocking captions splashed across the homepage.But the online fury was just the start of the backlash in China -- major food-delivery apps removed 85C from their platforms, causing the parent company's share price to plummet.China's state media also ramped up coverage on 85C's "longstanding problems," ranging from food safety to store hygiene, with government inspectors in at least one Chinese city visiting a local 85C shop and finding the condition there unsatisfactory.Taiwan's presidential spokesman, Alex Huang, described the political pressure from Beijing as "not in line with a civilized society," condemning the forced imposition of one's ideology on a global company as "disrupting market order and freedom of speech."The Taiwanese bakery attempted to curtail the fallout on Wednesday by issuing a statement distancing the company from Tsai's visit and stressing its "firm support" for the "1992 Consensus," political jargon for believing in a unified China that includes Taiwan.But instead of solving the company's problems, it angered customers in Taiwan, while also failing to appease its Chinese mainland audience."We oppose and will never allow any businesses to make money from the mainland while supporting Taiwan independence forces and activities," a senior Chinese official in charge of Taiwan affairs, Long Mingbiao, said Thursday.Beijing's dream of reunificationBeijing has long dreamed of reuniting Taiwan with the Chinese mainland since the two sides split after a bloody civil war in 1949. The Chinese military has recently increased drills around the island as tensions rise across the Taiwan Strait.In a campaign to further isolate the democratic island, the Communist leadership in mainland China has intensified pressure on global companies to drop references to Taiwan as an independent entity -- targeting the world's biggest airlines, hotels and retailers alike.Taipei has criticized companies for giving in to Beijing, saying "such acts send a wrong message to the world." The United States has also slammed China's pressure on businesses, with the White House in May calling the Chinese government's demands "Orwellian nonsense."Back at a busy 85C shop in Beijing, though, both employees and customers appeared unfazed Friday by the ongoing controversy.An employee, who declined to be named as he is not authorized to speak to media, told CNN business had not been impacted."Whether or not the bakery supports Taiwan independence doesn't affect my decision," said a customer surnamed Xu.

Streaming network Twitch is now locked out of ChinaStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeSeptember 22, 2018 SaturdayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: HI-TECH; Pg. 1Length: 320 wordsByline: Sandy MccarthyBodySubsequently, the streaming service rapidly increased in popularity - becoming the third-most popular free app on the App Store. As China is one of the largest gaming markets in the world, being shut out from operating there is a big blow indeed.What just happened? Another major website has been banned in China.Video streaming platform Twitch has suddenly hit a wall in China, as the Twitch website is now inaccessible in the country and the Twitch iOS app has been removed from Apple's regional App Store. The surge was largely due to the inclusion of e-sports in Asian Games, which was not telecast by the state-run broadcaster CCTV.Telltale Games officially confirms shut downBruner is no longer working for the studio, but he cites very different visions between him and the company's Board of Directors. With a heavy heart, we watch our friends leave today to spread our brand of storytelling across the games industry.There's been a range of speculation over the rationale behind China's Twitch ban. According to a report by CNN, the ban has been confirmed by a spokesperson at Twitch, but neither the company nor the Chinese administration have commented on the events.What makes the situation even stranger is the fact that Twitch has been incredibly popular in China over the last few months. eSports matches were played at the Asian Games, with the streaming service broadcasting them for millions to see. China performed well during the games, winning two gold medals, which no doubt contributed to the number of Chinese Twitch viewers. The most compelling of those is a link to the Chinese government's more general crackdown on gaming in the country.The social media networks Facebook and Twitter were also banned in China and have remained so to this day while Google has not operated in the country for eight years. Stay tuned, because hopefully Twitch will have more to say on the matter in the near future.Load-Date: September 23, 2018End of Document

China Revokes Approval For New Facebook "Innovation Hub"CE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 25, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 263 wordsBody       China has reversed its decision that approved Facebook Inc. (FB) to set up a subsidiary in the country, just one day after the social media giant received a successful permission from the officials. According to New York Times, citing a person with knowledge of the matter, the approval has been withdrawn. The decision to revoke approval was made after a disagreement between officials in Zhejiang and the national internet regulator the Cyberspace Administration of China. The agency did not approve of the decision due to lack of consultation. For few hours, Chinese government database and media had shown that Facebook gained approval to open a subsidiary in the eastern province of Zhejiang. Then the registration disappeared and references to the subsidiary were partially censored in Chinese media. Facebook had planned to set up an innovation hub in China to groom and support the nation's developers and startups. The new hub was planned to be located in Hangzhou, home to Chinese internet giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., the owner of China's two most popular e-commerce sites and a major player in China's mobile internet ecosystem. The hub will offer training and workshops to help developers and entrepreneurs in the region innovate and grow, a Facebook spokeswoman said in a statement, and is similar to centers the company has established in countries including France, Brazil, and India.  Facebook's social network has been blocked in China since 2009, leading the Menlo Park, California-based company to pursue other initiatives to gain a foothold.        Load-Date: July 25, 2018End of Document

Tencent's troubles are far from overCNNMoney.comAugust 20, 2018 Monday 10:09 AM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: TECHNOLOGYLength: 737 wordsByline: Sherisse PhamBodyTencent is having a tough year.Not long ago, the Chinese social media and video game giant was worth more than Facebook, but it has lost roughly $140 billion in market value since its stock hit an all-time high in January, and its latest earnings were a big disappointment.Many of Tencent's recent troubles are linked to the Chinese government, which the company says has stopped approving licenses allowing it to make money from new games. Tencent expects the games to get the green light eventually, but its difficulties reflect an increasingly restrictive environment for tech firms in China.Companies like Tencent and Alibaba "have got their fingers in so many different services -? media and advertising and messaging ? where the content can't be controlled so easily," said Benjamin Cavender, a Beijing-based analyst with China Market Research."The government is trying to send out a pretty broad message to all big tech players ? you've got to watch out and you've got to be careful," he added.Low-profile CEOTencent CEO Pony Ma has kept a low-profile compared with some of China's other top tech leaders. Despite being the head of one of the world's biggest internet companies, the billionaire executive appears in public far less than Alibaba's Jack Ma or Baidu's Robin Li.But Tencent's spectacular rise in social networking apps such as WeChat, mobile payments and online games appears to have rattled Beijing, and Ma's low-key approach didn't spare his company from government censure."He had been so dominant in that [tech] space, he had been under the radar, that I think they did need to send a message," said Ray Wang, founder of advisory firm Constellation Research.Turning off the money tapThe company is now struggling to secure approval from Chinese authorities to make money from some of its most popular mobile games such as PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. Regulators also banned a game called Monster Hunter: World for which big sales were expected.Another game, Honor of Kings, came under particularly intense scrutiny last year for allegedly causing addiction in young people.Steve Weber, a political scientist specializing in technology and international politics at the University of California, Berkeley, said the Chinese government's message to Tencent is clear: "If we want to shut off the money taps, we can shut off the money taps."Besides being the world's largest gaming company, Tencent also created WeChat, China's biggest messaging platform, which has more than 1 billion users.China has a history of censoring digital content. It is also growing increasingly wary ? like Europe and the United States ? of the influence top tech companies wield, according to Weber.Governments are starting to realize "that they probably under-regulated these industries vis-Ã -vis their economic and social impact," he said.Beijing has long blocked major US social networks such as Facebook and Twitter from operating in China. But it's also seeking to keep homegrown equivalents on a tighter leash.Chinese authorities fined Tencent and other companies last year for hosting banned content such as fake news and pornography on social media platforms.Uncertainty over investmentsTencent has other worries on top of the headaches caused by the government.The company has made a name for itself by investing in a huge array of businesses in China and around the world. But some of its biggest investments are looking risky.They include China Literature, an e-books company whose shares plunged more than 25% last week; Tesla, whose stock has been on a wild ride since CEO Elon Musk announced plans to try to take it private; and Snapchat parent Snap, which recently reported a drop in users.Some analysts say if Tencent starts getting licenses for its games again soon, it can bounce back."We remain of the belief that recent pressure remains short term in nature and the fundamental longer term investment case for Tencent remains intact," Douglas Morton, head of Asia research at brokerage Northern Trust Capital Markets, said in a note to investors last week.Tencent has said the halt in government approvals is mainly the result of a reorganization of the official bodies that oversee the process.The company's sheer scale makes it better placed to handle the delays than smaller rivals, which might not have the financial resources to keep waiting."It means no one else can get in the market," said Wang.Load-Date: August 24, 2018End of Document

China is the world leader in drones. US drone makers want to change thatCNNMoney.comSeptember 10, 2018 Monday 4:34 PM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: TECHNOLOGYLength: 826 wordsByline: Matt McFarlandBodyUS drone companies historically have had trouble taking off.But two American startups think they may have created the innovations that will give them a foothold to compete with Chinese powerhouse DJI, which has faced data security questions.Impossible Aerospace, a Silicon Valley-based startup founded by Tesla and SpaceX veterans, announced Monday it's selling a drone with two hours of flight time to fire departments, police departments and search and rescue teams. It's a significant advancement considering most drones typically get about 30 minutes in the air on a single charge.Another startup, Skydio now makes a drone that autonomously follows its users and avoids obstacles in its path, a feat competitors haven't matched. Last week it launched new cinematic features to better record these videos.Impossible Aerospace and Skydio need every edge against DJI, the worldwide leader in drones. DJI, which reported $2.7 billion in revenue last year, is best known for its popular Phantom drone. Introduced in 2013, the drone is most popular commercial drone on the market.It can be used for everything from roof inspections to search and rescue operations. The price point sets it apart: at $1,500, it packs in advanced features such as precise hovering and live video streaming.DJI is so prolific that it's essentially chased away competitors. Earlier this year, GoPro quit the drone market, citing competitive concerns. Meanwhile, 3DR, another American drone company, stopped selling its drone last year.Although it's been an uphill battle for American drone companies, Impossible Aerospace CEO Spencer Gore isn't worried."People say American drone companies can't be competitive because it's hard to manufacture a product here," Gore told CNNMoney. "I would say it's the exact opposite. I don't think they were American enough."Impossible Aerospace will engineer and assemble its drones in the country, breaking from the trend of US tech companies manufacturing overseas.Gore, who previously worked as a battery engineer at Tesla, saw firsthand the benefits of a company manufacturing a product alongside its engineers. He said the proximity makes employees more accountable to each other and boosts innovation.His hardware team, many of whom came from Tesla, has US manufacturing experience. Skydio is taking a similar approach. It makes the R1 drone in California, according to CEO Adam Bry.Impossible Aerospace's drone starts at $7,500. Skydio's R1 goes for $1,999.The companies have another edge on DJI, too: the Chinese company has raised national security concerns. In 2017, the US Army issued a ban on using DJI drones. A government memo alleged the company shared critical infrastructure and law enforcement data with the Chinese government.DJI denied the claim and hired a forensic investigator, which showed that data transmissions to remove servers could be turned off. But US government agencies never lifted restrictions on DJI drones.The ban came as US agencies rapidly expanded their use of drones, leaving some scrambling to find enough American drones."We probably cornered the worldwide inventory of 3DR's Solo drone," Mark Bathrick, who oversees drone programs at the Department of the Interior, told CNNMoney.Bathrick said he needs a replacement for the aging and discontinued Solo, which has created an opportunity for other American companies.The US Department of the Interior embraces drones because they're inexpensive -- generally costing about a few hundred dollars each -- to operate and sub in for humans in dangerous roles. His department flew nearly 5,000 drone missions in 2017, up from 750 in 2016."There isn't a commercial application for drones that I'm aware of that we haven't done or don't plan to do," he said.Bathrick envisions using drones for dropping explosive charges to prevent avalanches and rescuing people in dangerous situations. His team is currently experimenting with two DJI drones, including one on a wildfire prevention mission. They're using a DJI Matrice 600 to drop flammable ping pong balls over a forest. It can carry a heavy payload, making it suited for the job.Traditionally, the department flew helicopters above the treeline for the treacherous mission. But in the past 13 years, two helicopters crashed, killing five people.Government partners, including NASA, the Department of Homeland Security and Defense Department, are working to confirm if new, specialized drones from DJI meet data security standards. Bathrick hopes for a final decision by the end of the year.DJI said it's eager to work with companies with sensitive needs and realized its products must be better customized."It was a lesson learned for us," DJI vice president for North America Mario Rebello told CNNMoney. "In the past year, we've learned the importance of engaging with our customer base, working with our partners and developers to make sure we're addressing the data security and data management issues."Load-Date: September 12, 2018End of Document

Huawei: Australia just banned us from selling 5G techCNNMoney.comAugust 22, 2018 Wednesday 1:00 AM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: TECHNOLOGYLength: 560 wordsByline: Jethro MullenBodyChinese tech company Huawei says the Australian government has blocked it from providing 5G technology for the country's wireless networks.Huawei, one of the world's biggest makers of smartphones and telecommunications equipment, said Thursday that the government had informed it of the decision."This is an extremely disappointing result for consumers," the Chinese company said on Twitter. "Huawei is a world leader in 5G."The announcement follows reports in recent months that Australian national security agencies were concerned about alleged ties between Huawei and the Chinese government.The Australian government said in a statement Thursday that the involvement of telecom equipment suppliers "who are likely to be subject to extrajudicial directions from a foreign government that conflict with Australian law" could mean the country's wireless carriers are unable "to adequately protect a 5G network from unauthorized access or interference."The Australian government's statement didn't mention China or Huawei by name.Huawei has repeatedly rejected the security concerns, insisting that it is a private company owned by employees with no other shareholders.But it has faced scrutiny and restrictions in Australia and other countries previously. In 2012, it was blocked from the bidding for a huge Australian national broadband network.Huawei said Thursday that the Australian government also banned fellow Chinese tech firm ZTE from providing 5G technology for the country's wireless networks.ZTE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company is still struggling to repair the damage inflicted by a crippling US government ban that prevented it from doing business with American companies for months.ZTE's controlling shareholder is Shenzhen Zhongxingxin Telecommunications Equipment, a Chinese state-owned corporation. ZTE has in the past denied that its products pose a security risk.The Chinese government is "gravely concerned" by Australia's decision, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said Thursday."The Australian government should not use various excuses to artificially set barriers," Lu said at a regular news briefing. "We urge the Australian government to abandon ideological prejudices and provide a fair competitive environment for Chinese enterprises operating in Australia."Australia's ban comes amid increased scrutiny in other countries including the United States and the United Kingdom, where officials have warned of potential national security risks from using Huawei or ZTE products.Huawei tweeted Thursday that it "has safely & securely delivered wireless technology" in Australia for close to 15 years.Vodafone and Optus, two of Australia's biggest mobile phone carriers, have supplier relationships with Huawei and had previously tested the company's 5G equipment.Vodafone's chief strategy officer in Australia, Dan Lloyd, criticized the government's announcement, saying it "creates uncertainty for carriers' investment plans.""This decision is a significant change which fundamentally undermines Australia's 5G future, and we will consider what it means for our business," he added.Spokespersons for Optus and Telstra, another major Australian carrier, said in separate statements that the companies "will comply" with the government's decision.-- Angus Watson and Yong Xiong contributed to this report.Load-Date: August 24, 2018End of Document

AI may cause the brutal death of our free speechThe Ticker: Baruch CollegeSeptember 20, 2018 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: OPINION; Pg. 1Length: 505 wordsByline: Daniel TabachBodyThe novel, The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood, takes place in a dystopian society in which women are oppressed and forced to dress and act in a certain way. Most importantly, they are constantly watched.The people of this fictional world are constantly watched by an elite class of members to make sure that they do not dissent or rebel against the government. In the novel 1984 by George Orwell, the nation is plagued by constant government surveillance to ensure that its citizens do not turn against the government. Society today is now reaching a point in time in which this surveillance technology is no longer a myth found in dystopian novels, but a reality.China has recently implemented a system to watch over its citizens with cameras using facial recognition artificial intelligence and software across the major cities in the country. This improves the overall safety of the populace. Police have managed to capture suspected criminals, drug dealers and child traffickers.However, this technology grants the Chinese government unrestricted power. The Chinese government has been known to kidnap journalists, activists and other outspoken individuals of society. Even the internet has been largely censored. Phrases regarding the Tiananmen Square massacre have been ousted from the Chinese internet. Phrases regarding anything to do with Hong Kong protests have been removed.While these cameras bring criminals to justice via facial recognition, what happens if the Chinese government decides to target journalists? What happens if the facial recognition software decides to subject political rivals to the same treatment as criminals?History tends to repeat itself. When governments gain unrestricted and unfiltered power such as this, innocent people and people who speak out against the government are targeted. We have seen this when the Nazis arrested outspoken educators, politicians and civilians in the 1930s. We have seen this when Joseph Stalin carried out mass murders of his own people to cling onto his political power in the 1940s.AI in the United States will be the bane of the freedom of people across the country. Today, we have the privilege to speak out against the U.S. government in the form of protests, media outlets and internet articles without being harmed or prosecuted for our opinions of our own government.This is the basis of our First Amendment rights. But what if the U.S. government were granted access in the same technology that China has? What if your identity as a foul-mouthed individual who speaks against the government is no longer protected by the screen of your computer, but instead basked in the facial recognition software granted to the government? It's already been proven that the government stalks the populace's internet inquiries for the sake of protection. What makes us believe that the power of artificial intelligence can provide protection for us, rather than provide a means for the government to profile us based on political stances, opinions and history?Load-Date: September 20, 2018End of Document

Hawaiian said it will shift planes to other routes that fit its expansion plans.Both airlines said they were keeping alive the possibility of resuming the flights in the future. Hawaiian CEO Peter Ingram said his company still believes "in China's future as a robust market for the Hawaiian vacation experience."Chinese airlines have added flights and destinations in recent years, sometimes undercutting U.S. rivals on prices.Separately, the Chinese government pressured U.S. and other foreign airlines this year to describe the island of Taiwan as part of China on airline websites, a move that the U.S. carriers initially resisted.Meanwhile spot prices for jet fuel have risen nearly 40 percent in the last year, tracking the spike in oil prices.

American Airlines and Hawaiian cutting flights to ChinaAssociated Press Financial WireAugust 23, 2018 Thursday 8:04 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 332 wordsByline: By The Associated PressBodyAmerican Airlines is dropping money-losing flights between Chicago and Shanghai, and Hawaiian Airlines will suspend its only route to China because of low demand.The airlines announced those and other route changes this week. The decisions reflect growing competition from Chinese carriers and rising fuel prices that have made once-marginal routes unprofitable.American, the world's largest carrier, said it will end Chicago-Shanghai service in October. The Fort Worth, Texas-based airline recently decided to cut flights between Chicago and Beijing, also in October.In a podcast on the airline's website, vice president of network planning Vasu Raja said the routes "have been colossal loss makers."American flies to Shanghai and Beijing from both Los Angeles and Dallas-Fort Worth. It disclosed the latest pullback from China and reduced flights between Chicago and Tokyo as it announced additional flights to Europe, most of them limited to the summer peak-travel season.Hawaiian Airlines said in a statement it will suspend its three flights a week between Honolulu and Beijing in October. The carrier started the route in 2014 and had already downgraded it from daily service. Hawaiian said it will shift planes to other routes that fit its expansion plans.Both airlines said they were keeping alive the possibility of resuming the flights in the future.

CRU: China's Commodity VulnerabilityPR NewswireAugust 7, 2018 Tuesday 4:00 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 506 wordsDateline: LONDON, Aug 7, 2018 BodyChina has come a long way from the zì lì geng sheng - "regeneration through one's own efforts" - of Maoist economic policy. The nation that once so steadfastly insisted upon economic self-sufficiency has since opened its markets, and in the 17 years since it joined the World Trade Organisation it has grown considerably from the benefits of global trade.But in an ironic twist, this has left the country vulnerable, as its commanding presence within the global manufacturing production chain -- as well as the demands of its burgeoning middle class -- has come with a heavy footprint in commodity markets. China needs raw materials, the demand for which must necessarily be met through imports. With a general trade war comes the threat of supply constrictions and rising prices.For metals markets, global trade has given Chinese businesses access to higher-quality raw material, as is the case with iron ore, where imports make up 87% of the country's consumption. As illustrated in the chart below, despite having proven reserves of over 7 billion tonnes of contained iron, poor quality ore grades mean that domestic supply cannot substitute for cheaper and better-quality material imported from Australia and elsewhere. Disincentivising domestic production also allows the Chinese government to address the nation's pollution epidemic: by taking steps such as reducing air pollutants from steel plants using lower quality raw materials, revoking mining licences for polluting and unprofitable iron ore mines or forbidding bauxite miners from using conventional mining processes such as the use of pneumatic drilling and dynamite, China was reducing smog levels at the expense of domestic supply; with demand nonetheless remaining strong, the supply gap would be increasingly bridged by imports in these sectors. That, at least, was the plan.Read the full story:https://www.crugroup.com/knowledge-and-insights/insights/2018/china-s-commodity-vulnerability/ Read more about CRU:http://bit.ly/About_CRU About CRUCRU offers unrivalled business intelligence on the global metals, mining and fertilizer industries through market analysis, price assessments, consultancy and events.Since our foundation by Robert Perlman in 1969, we have consistently invested in primary research and robust methodologies, and developed expert teams in key locations worldwide, including in hard-to-reach markets such as China.CRU employs over 260 experts and has more than 10 offices around the world, in Europe, the Americas, China, Asia and Australia - our office in Beijing opened in 2004.When facing critical business decisions, you can rely on our first-hand knowledge to give you a complete view of a commodity market.

During the presentation, he will essentially provide a "state of the industry" analysis of the current e-waste landscape, including the crucial need for data security and destruction.Now in its sixth year, the China International E-Waste Conference provides attendees with the latest intelligence and best practices on the e-waste landscape. With the continuous development of new and improved consumer electronics, the whole world is facing serious problems caused by the flow of e-waste produced every day.

"The event is vitally important because it gives international thought leaders the opportunity to share what they know. There's no greater time to forge international relationships than now. The world is getting smaller and flatter than ever and business leaders need to reach out across continents and communicate if we are to problem-solve and work together to create environmental and data destruction solutions that will benefit our entire planet."Dillon added that ERI is currently developing relationships with organizations and individuals in the recycling industry in Asia and welcomes this trip to China as an opportunity to meet with prospective collaborators.Parties interested in meeting with ERI on this subject are encouraged to contact sales@eridirect.com or +1-800-ERI-DIRECT, where ERI's team is standing by, available to help with electronics recycling, ITAD, and sustainability needs on a global level.ERI is the largest fully integrated IT and electronics asset disposition provider and cybersecurity-focused hardware destruction company in the United States.

The S&P 500 is up six and three-quarters and the NASDAQ is up 28. Markets are responding to the potential for new talks between the U.S. and China on trade. Markets are little changed yesterday on Wall Street.The Dow Industrials are up 27. The S&P up one point and the NASDAQ was lower by 18. Investors in Europe watching Central Bank action this morning. The Bank of England held rates steady. It also warned of the growing threat to global growth because of the China trade tensions. The European Central Bank meanwhile left interest rates unchanged as well. It will move forward with its plan to wind down the stimulus program.Markets are mixed. FT-100 down a quarter of a percent. The CAC quarante in Paris is up a half of a percent as does the DAX Index in Germany. In Asia overnight, gains across the board, best performer Hong Kong as you can see. Elon Musk is apologizing this morning again and it comes as another executive is jumping ship at Tesla. Betting big on health care. How Apple's new watch will help save lives. We've the story there. All those coming up this Thursday morning.And joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the American Conservative Union Chairman, Matt Schlapp, and The Brewer Group CEO, former NFL star, Jack Brewer. Good morning.JACK BREWER, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, THE BREWER GROUP: Yes. This is a lot of fun, Maria.BARTIROMO: Yes. A lot -- a lot going on this morning.BREWER: A lot going on.BARTIROMO: Yes.MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION: Awesome.BARTIROMO: You made a comment earlier that the -- that the Peter Strzok- Lisa Page new texts and it really shocks me that the mainstream media does not cover this story because it's not about Donald Trump. It's about the abuse of power at the leadership of our intelligence agencies.SCHLAPP: Yes. You think about it, the FBI has so much power and 99.9 percent of the men and women who worked there are honorable, patriotic, and do a great job. But when you have a polluted set of corrupt individuals running an organization like the FBI. It is frightening. To me, this is the biggest political scandal we've ever had. Look, Watergate was a little break in. This is about the fact that people who had a political animus used their power at the FBI to try to stop Trump.By the way, if they had used their power to try to stop Hillary Clinton, I think we should be just as outraged. This is --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: I agree with you. That's right.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Watergate wasn't just a little break-in. Watergate was a massive cover-up --(CROSSTALK)SCHLAPP: This is more serious because how did this ever happen and how is it that the country isn't outraged that some of these people are still working there?MCDOWELL: Well, and one thing and this is on you. The Republicans need to realize and messaging this election that if the Democrats take over particularly the House, we'll never get to the bottom of what really went on during 2016 because all investigations, all questioning will end.BARTIROMO: That's right because all of the chairman of these committees will change to the ranking member on the Democratic sides, so you won't have Republicans running intel, judiciary, oversight committee, and so you won't hear another word about this story should the Democrats flip the House in November.SCHLAPP: That's right. But let's go back to what this whole question about collusion is that we've wasted all this time and money on. Remember, a hundred thousand dollars of Facebook address, 50 percent of them ran after the election, 50 percent of them ran in blue states. We have wasted a lot of time on the wrong controversy and the Democrats have helped (INAUDIBLE)BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, the special counsel look at any of this do you think?SCHLAPP: No. The special counsel is not --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Can they not look at it? It's --(CROSSTALK)SCHLAPP: We don't need a special counsel to look at what's happening at the FBI. We simply need DOJ to do its job.BARTIROMO: And the attorney general to actually react. Joining the conversation this morning, House Financial Services Committee Chairman and Texas Congressman, Jeb Hensarling is here, Coastal Carolina Head Football Coach, Joe Moglia is here to tell us what his team is doing in face of Hurricane Florence, and the Host of "VARNEY & COMPANY", Stuart Varney weighs as well. Don't miss a moment of it. But we got a big hour coming up.And we kick it off right here with this. We are bracing for impact this morning. Hurricane Florence is set to slam into the Carolinas and a potentially catastrophic Category Two storm. Kristina Partsinevelos is live on the ground in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina this morning with the latest. Kristina, good morning.KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Thank you, Maria. We're trying to show you right now the fact that this is essentially a ghost town. We are at North Ocean Boulevard. The only people driving near us are reporters and police cars. You can see the strip is completely vacant. There's even a Ferris wheel in the back of the carousel taken off businesses were ordered to close down yesterday at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time.There's been mass evacuation orders in place. Officials are saying roughly 60 percent of the population has left. This morning, we did drive around trying to find a gas station to fill up this truck right now. We've got one spot. The poor guy that was working behind the counter told me he has worked a double shift. He doesn't know when they'll close, but it could be any moment. The winds are expected to hit Myrtle Beach at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time.Once the winds hit 60 miles per hour, officials have said you are on your own. Nobody will be able to come help you which is why they're making sure to patrol right to make sure that there aren't any pedestrians or people hanging around. So I'm going to throw it back to you. We're going to be here all day.BARTIROMO: All right. Kristina, we'll check back. Thanks so much, Kristina Partsinevelos, roaming the streets and as you can see behind her not a soul is out. Joining us now is the Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, Texas Congressman, Jeb Hensarling. Congressman, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us.REP. JEB HENSARLING (R-TX), CHAIR OF THE HOUSE FINANCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE: Hi, Maria.BARTIROMO: Some are calling Hurricane Florence the Harvey of the East Coast or, of course, Hurricane Harvey devastated Houston around this time last year, your thoughts on the impact here?HENSARLING: Well, I must admit as a Texan, I went and visited with families after Harvey. I saw the devastation. Listen, I'm not north car or South Carolina but if my governor told me to leave and seek high ground because I was taking my life in my own hands, I think I would take the advice. I mean I still assume there will be incredible devastation. I just hope and pray that nobody will become a fatality here.BARTIROMO: I want to potential progress on trade this morning. The Trump administration issuing an invitation to Chinese officials for another round of trade talks. National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow commented on the potential breakthrough yesterday. Here's what he said. I'd love to get your reaction as well, sir. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LARRY KUDLOW, DIRECTOR, UNITED STATES NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL: There are some discussions and information that we received that the Chinese government, the top of the Chinese government wished to pursue talks. And so we've -- Secretary Mnuchin who's the team leader with China has apparently issued an invitation. In 20 years, they've made noises about China, but they ever followed through.Why not give President Trump a little credit for doing the right thing?(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Congressman, you had a recent trip to the Asian financial capitals where you discussed the U.S.-Asian trade policy among other issues, your reaction to this invitation and what happens now?HENSARLING: Well, I think it's always good that both sides are talking to each other. But China is a very unique situation. I mean they have been a serial violator of the WTO and as a statist economy through particularly non-tariff barriers to entry and through subsidy policies. It's just not the type of economy that lives with either the spirit of the letter of the law of the WTO. So indeed, I have returned from leading a Congressional delegation to Beijing.I had an opportunity to meet with Vice Premier Liu He who handles the economic and trade portfolio. And the message that we were delivering, it was both Republicans and Democrats, the message was, hey, if you think that this is a Donald Trump phenomena, you're wrong. Don't think you're going to weighed out either a Congressional election on Presidential election, we're very serious that you cannot continue to expropriate by hook or crook our intellectual property and our technology.And so that message was certainly delivered. But, again, you know, you've got a President for life over there, doesn't have to face reelection. The other message that we took to them is that America doesn't want you to be impoverish. We want you to succeed, but you can't do it by taking away our competitive edge which is in intellectual property and technology, so I'm encouraged.I know the President believes in that is a fact that China in some respects has more to lose than we have to lose because their economy is much more trade dependent. But on the other hand, their politics is such they can be very patient. So I encouraged the Chinese to once again, I inform -- I didn't speak for the administration. But I did speak to the administration. And, you know, I was encouraged by things I heard in Beijing.BARTIROMO: What strikes me about this story is, number one, you've got the dictator for life who, you know, the President in China will be the prime minister will be there until the end of his life and he still does not admit that they've been stealing I.P. from America, so how do you change something when they won't even admit it? So there's that.But you also are dealing with a race against the clock, you and your colleagues in Congress working to pass a spending bill before the new fiscal year begins on October 1st and ahead of a potentially catastrophic hurricane set to hit the Carolinas. The Senate approves a hundred and forty-six billion dollar minibus bill yesterday sending over to the House to vote today. Tell us, Congressman, about these three spending packages.It doesn't include funding for border wall, correct?HENSARLING: No, not to the best of my knowledge. So, again, unfortunately, spending bills take a 60 vote threshold in the Senate. It's the bane of the existence of House members like us. It's an anti- majoritarian and so too often on the spending bills which you end up with is something tantamount to status quo government.What we do have in these spending bills is fortunately after the Obama years where we hollowed out our military, I got to tell you, just my recent visit to Asia again convinces me how important it is that the U.S. be able to project both influence and military power worldwide. At least in the spending bills, we are going back to rebuild the military, increase military pay, and to really fill in a lot of the gaps that happened during the Obama years.That's one good thing that has happened. But otherwise, Washington still spends too much and one of these days our children and grandchildren are going to pay that price. But if you have to have Democratic votes, you end up with status quo legislation. That's just the fact that I've been imploring my Senate colleagues to again allow the majority to rule and that's what we need.BARTIROMO: Do you worry that going into the midterm elections the fact that you don't have the funding for the border wall as the President has stressed that he wanted that this will actually impact some of your colleagues' chances in terms of getting reelected?HENSARLING: Well, what I do know is already on a roughly a third of our southern border, we have some kind of either literal wall or figurative wall if you will and I don't have the number that my fingertips, Maria, but I think we've already managed to get about a billion and half of the eight billion I think it is that the President has requested. We continue to work on the rest. But I also know the President said that he didn't want a temporary lapse of appropriations at this time.So this is -- this is a battle that has to be fought. I'm not sure this is the best time to fight it right before an election. But I would say to my colleagues, you know, under the constitution, we have the power of the purse. And unfortunately, we have ceded too much of that power to the other body in some respects over my shoulder that has to have a supermajority for a spending bill. And this is how we enact policies that the people ask us to do. It's power of the purse.Read the Federalist papers really what the founding fathers said. This is what we're supposed to do but we're not doing it.BARTIROMO: What are your policy priorities at this point? I know you're giving the GSEs, the government sponsored-entities reform another try. You're unveiling a sweeping bipartisan housing reform bill that would unwind Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac? Some people are struck that this hasn't happened yet.HENSARLING: Yes. Well, I'm one of them. I must admit there are certain big heavy political lifts around here and reforming the GSEs is one of them. I mean, unfortunately, Maria, in some respects is deja vu all over again. I mean I'm just incredulous that through three administrations, five Congresses, we essentially have status quo, and that is you simply have a housing finance monopoly of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac thinly capitalized once again securitizing mortgages with as little as three percent down.Once again, again, thinly capitalized once again having scandals. Again, as Yogi Bear said, it is deja vu all over again. I don't believe --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: The Obama administration used money from Fannie and Freddie, and put it wherever else they wanted in government.HENSARLING: Well, indeed. It's been a cash cow. The bottom line is we don't want politics determining credit allocation. To sign -- to a great extent, it was the mandated affordable housing goals of the government sponsored-enterprises that helped erode traditional residential mortgage under writing standards that brought us to a race to the bottom that created the second worst financial crisis in our history.So I've tried to get rid of the government guarantee. It's dangerous. It's unneeded. We don't need it to have a healthy housing market. Unfortunately, I have not succeeded. So I'm working on a bipartisan plan with Democratic colleague John Delaney of Maryland that regrettably in my mind maintains the government guarantee, but puts a lot of private capital brings in innovation competition, disperses risk. That's my main focus now, Maria.BARTIROMO: And, of course, 10 years almost to the day to that crisis.HENSARLING: Exactly.BARTIROMO: Congressman, good to see you. Thanks very much.HENSARLING: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Jeb Hensarling, stay with us. Tomorrow morning on MORNINGS WITH MARIA, we will start 5:00 a.m. Eastern one hour earlier. We are tracking Hurricane Florence's path. Join us an hour earlier tomorrow. Up next, trouble for Tesla. Stay right there. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. President Trump is responding, slamming J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon this morning. Cheryl Casone with the details. Cheryl?CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Oh, yes, Maria. President Trump responding to comments that Dimon made to employees yesterday at the time Dimon boasted that he could beat the President in the 2020 election saying he is tough as Trump and smarter. Well, it quickly back tracked those comments. But within the last hour, President Trump tweeted this.The problem with banker Jamie Dimon running for President is he doesn't have the aptitude or as smart and as a poor public speaker and nervous mess otherwise he is wonderful. That made a lot of bankers and others look much smarter than they are with my great economic policy.OK. Well, it is primary day in New York, and Governor Andrew Cuomo's campaign is still answering questions about a controversial flyer sent out about his opponent Cynthia Nixon. Official say a campaign worker created the mailer which question Nixon's support for the Jewish community. Well, the mailer paid by the state Democratic Party hit 7,000 mailboxes in Jewish neighborhoods.Nixon has two Jewish children called and she called the mailers sleazy. She demand an apology from Cuomo. Well, Cuomo is denying, knowing about the mailer. But The New York Post is reporting that Cuomo's closest advisers drafted it and then they approved it.And then Tesla losing another top executive, Justin McAnear, the company's vice President of worldwide finance and operations stepping down to take the CFO role at another company. This latest departure coming just days after Tesla's chief accounting officer quit with less than one month on the job. Meanwhile, CEO Elon Musk is vowing to respond more quickly to address customers' needs saying it's going to be his new priority.Some Model 3 buyers say they're frustrated by lack of communication from Tesla when it comes to delivery delays. OK. Big day for Apple yesterday. They unveiled three new iPhones, their biggest and most expensive lineup ever, they really supersized it, guys. The iPhone Xs max has a bigger screen than the iPhone X. It's going to cost $1100. An updated iPhone X called the Xs stays at 1000. It's got a 5.8-inch OLED display.Apple also showing up a cheaper iPhone called the iPhone Xr. That's going to be 750. That's cheaper. Yes. All three new models of the iPhone X in getting rid of the home button. And the latest version of the Apple watch, lot of buzz. It features -- it allows folks to take high quality heart readings and detects pulse but the EKG, no other smart watch, Maria, has that, not a Fitbit, not a Garmin, a lot of buzz about that.BARTIROMO: No. That's interesting that nobody else has it.CASONE: Yes.BARTIROMO: Cheryl, thank you.CASONE: Yes.BARTIROMO: Coming up. Bracing for impacts. We breakdown how Hurricane Florence is affecting business later this hour. Then a revealing reaction, watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RUTH PORAT, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, ALPHABET: With the massive like kick in the gut that we are going to live. What we all need right now is a hug.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: New video shows Google executives responding to Donald Trump's victory back in '16. It is renewing calls of political bias, next.BARTIROMO: A warning for the market while the economy showing signs of strong growth and corporate profits are on the rise, double digit. Our next guest is raising concerns about a downturn that could have serious political implications going into the midterm elections. Joining us right now is MacroMavens President, Stephanie Pomboy. Stephanie, great to see you.STEPHANIE POMBOY, PRESIDENT, MACROMAVENS: Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: You've been raising the warning signs for a while now. What do you most concerned about.POMBOY: Well, I'm concerned we are seeing just all kinds of fabulous data, so obviously, you know, there is reason to be very excited about what we're seeing on the economic and profit front. But I think my concern about the market is that investors are extrapolating these fabulous numbers infinitely into the future, when the time frame, you know, we're really late in the cycle, we're kind of running toward the end of the road here.And I think that for multiple reasons. Number one is behind-the-scenes, they've had this, you know, tremendous lift from the tax cut in the fiscal side but the Fed is tightening away. And on October 1st, their quantitative tightening program kicks up another notch at the same time that UCB is, you know, start rating things in and in early 2019, global central bank balance sheets actually stop expanding in total.So behind the scenes, we're having the impact of the Fed tightening on housing and autos. The two twin pillars of growth have already slowed sharply. Housing is actually detracted from GDP in four of the last five quarters. Any time we have seen that we've been in a recession. So, my point is that the economy is sort of hitting its peak notes, profits are hitting their peak note and it's not to say we're going over the cliff, it's just that growth is going to be slower, profit growth is going to be slower and for a market that's pricing in a continuation of these phenomenal numbers.There's going to be real downside. The other point I would make related to this is on the profit side. There is a huge disagreement right now between S&P numbers that are all the focus on Wall Street, and the GDP profit numbers which is kind of a little bit wonky and it's something only people like me really look at but the GDP profit numbers are a reflection to the overall economy, not just the top 500 companies that captures so much broader slot.And you think where the tax cut enduring to the benefit of small businesses who were actually paying that 39 percent rate before they cut it where the big businesses weren't paying anything close to that.BARTIROMO: Yes.POMBOY: You would think the GDP profit numbers would be even stronger than the S&P numbers but in fact they are very weak and on a pretax basis, they are down year on year which is stunning to me, and even if they're off, you know, there's the gap between S&P and BEA isn't really that wide. It's a warning sign that something isn't as fabulous as it appears when looking at this --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: We should point out that the Atlanta Federal Reserve cut its growth outlook now to 3.8 percent from 4.4 percent to the third quarter. I want to get in to a short break because we want to get the CPI after this break and then more with Stephanie Pomboy and MATCH Lab's expectation for the midterm elections. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. CPI is out, it is below expectations, up two- tenths of a percent. Good morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. Welcome back. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, September 13th. Your top stories right now 8:31 a.m. on the east coast. Breaking news, August CPI is out. We were expecting an increase of three-tenths of a percent. We have an increase of two-tenths of a percent month-over- month, and an increase of 2.8 percent year-over-year was the estimate. Take a look at markets which are trading higher. This is actually the high of the morning here, on the heels of this CPI which is weaker than expected. It tells you that inflation is not an issue, just yet for the month of August.In Europe, this morning, markets are mixed. Take a look, the FT-100 right now is lower although well off of the lows of the morning, after we did hear the action from central banks in Europe. The CAC Quarante is up a half a percent, and the DAX Index is also up 66 points, one-half of one percent. The Bank of England kept interest rates unchanged at 0.75 percent. The European Central bank also left interest rates unchanged this morning.The Asian markets are -- finished higher overnight across the board. Best performer was Hong Kong, as you can see. And then there's this, Florence's fury, the Category 2 hurricane now closing in on the Carolina Coast. President Trump says the administration stands ready to help.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: My administration is in close coordination with state and local authorities and FEMA, protection of life is the absolute highest priority and that's what we're doing. It's called protection of life.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: We have the very latest in a moment. Again, the inflation numbers are below estimates year-over-year, the CPI up 2.7 percent versus an estimate of 2.8 percent. Meanwhile, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says Facebook is better prepared to deal with election interference. He is out with a new blog post detailing what the social media giant is doing this time around. And another sign of political bias in Silicon Valley. Check this out, a leaked video shows Google founder Sergey Brin lamenting President Trump's election victory. The CFO crying. The backlash coming up this morning.Breaking news first though August CPI coming in up two-tenths of a percent; year-over-year up 2.7 percent. Stephanie Pomboy is with us this morning. And you had some warning signs about growth slowing down. Your reaction to the inflation data.POMBOY: Well, I think this dovetails right into our conversation about profits because from a margin standpoint, you now have the PPI growing somewhat faster than the CPI. Mainly that input prices are going up faster than the ability to pass them on. PPI is up 2.9 year on year, CPI 2.7. So, in terms of what I was looking at with the GDP profit numbers already showing some pressure on margins. This only amplifies that. And I think as it relates to the Fed with their meeting coming up in a couple weeks, this isn't exactly giving them a big come on to have to be aggressive on the inflation front by any stretch, and to the extent that that margin pressure is going to continue to keep the lid on wages -- they don't have to worry about that either.In the beige book which came out yesterday, it -- they talked so much about these labor shortages and how every district was talking about an inability to get labor. And then in the next sentence, talked about how wage growth was still moderate, and that companies, if anything, were trying to increase benefits rather than wages. They were giving more vacation days, et cetera, so clearly, companies are still very reluctant to pass on any price increases as you know --MCDOWELL: Yes, but this is going to make it harder for the Democrats to try and data mine and crunch numbers to fit their narrative that wages are not keeping up with inflation in this country.POMBOY: That's right. Yes.MCDOWELL: I just want to point out in part because the tax cuts real disposable income adjusting for inflation in the most recent month was up 2.9 percent. We found out yesterday that real median household incomes were up 1.8 percent between 2016 and 2017. The poverty rate dropping. Again, the poverty rate for blacks and Hispanics falling to levels not seen since at least 1972. Meantime, you have President Obama trying to take credit for the economic growth that we're seeing now, when in fact this economy in any one calendar year during his entire presidency couldn't even grow at three percent.BARTIROMO: That's right. And I'm glad you brought up the household income numbers because this is important, and I wonder from your standpoint, Matt Schlapp, if this is going to be the story line that invest -- that voters are going to move on, come November for the midterm elections. Give us an update on what you're expecting for the midterms.SCHLAPP: Yes. So, basically, people vote on the pocketbook, right? And they want to know that they have greater economic prospects in the future. And the fact is, is this, what we saw under eight years of America moving towards European socialism is -- the poverty statistic spiked and it hurt people. And the American people, the number one thing I would want you to watch is the right-track, wrong-track figure. It's back up to right around 40 percent, even with the worst political week our President could have had last week. 40 percent of the American people much higher than under the Obama eight years are saying, I feel hopeful about the track the country is on.BARTIROMO: Got more money in the pocket.SCHLAPP: Those folks will vote, Maria, because remember most people vote in these off-year elections, those are the people who will vote and they realized it's their economic future that's at stake, if more socialism goes through a Democratic majority in Congress.MCDOWELL: And people joke about folks like you and even me, using the word 'socialism.' The Wall Street Journal has an editorial today, "Trump's Income Bump" that points out between 2009 and 2014, income stagnated, poverty increased, policies put in place, that put 1-1/2 million workers added to the disability roles. It encouraged people not to work. These were policies that weren't rolled back until more than four years after the end of the recession.BARTIROMO: A really important point, and you won't hear that on anywhere else. You're not going to hear the income bump on the mainstream media. It's incredible, it's such an important story. Very quickly, markets to watch in the midterm, most important for the Republicans.SCHLAPP: We're going to pick up seats on the Senate side. The worst-case scenario is we have three Republican seats that are in danger but we have - - we got the potential to pick up five Republicans on the House side. I'd say it's a jump on most of those difficult seats for Republicans are in the northeast.BARTIROMO: Yes.SCHLAPP: As far as the Senate is concerned, it's all red country, it's Democrats having to win in Trump states. It's going to be hard for them to do that.BARTIROMO: All right. We'll keep talking about that. And before you go, the size of this market sell-off you're expecting, how significant? Real quick.POMBOY: I -- it's significant, you know, greater than 20 percent.BARTIROMO: 20 percent?POMBOY: Which makes me really worried about the midterms. Let's hope if this -- if I'm right, that it doesn't happen until after because this is way -- there's way too much at stake.BARTIROMO: So, you're expecting a 20-percent selloff in stocks this year?POMBOY: I think as the 2019 earnings numbers are forced to be revised lower, and I would expect that to start happening toward the end of this year.BARTIROMO: OK.POMBOY: As people look forward to 2019.BARTIROMO: Stephanie, thank you --(CROSSTALK)POMBOY: Thank you so much.BARTIROMO: Stephanie Pomboy joining us there. She says with a smile.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Hurricane Florence is hurling toward the U.S. coast. It has been downgraded to a Category 2, but a potentially life-threatening storm surge still remains. Fox News Correspondent Griff Jenkins is live in Atlantic Beach, North Carolina right now. Griff?GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: You know, we brought you a shot earlier from the sound side on Atlantic Beach but I want you to see now the storm isn't expected to hit until tomorrow. This is the Atlantic Beach pier. Look at the waves coming in now already starting to pummel. This is not even yet a part of the nine to 13-foot storm surge that is expected. This pier, I'm afraid, is highly unlikely to survive this life-threatening catastrophic event. As we get that surge, look up the beach, I want to show you the houses and how close this water is going to come, as you see those clouds moving in now, conditions clearly starting to deteriorate. Back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Griff, it certainly looks like the surf is getting wild there where you are in Atlantic Beach. Griff Jenkins joining us live in North Carolina.Meanwhile, Coastal Carolina University's football team is already feeling the impact of Hurricane Florence. The team was forced to evacuate of South Carolina campus and move up its Saturday game in North Carolina to yesterday. After that win on the road, the team hit the highway once again heading to Florida where the 100 plus players, coaches, staff, family members, even some pets are waiting out this storm. Joining me right now by telephone is the head coach of the Coastal Carolina University football team, Joe Moglia. Joe, it's great to talk with you this morning. Can you give us a sense of what's happening on the ground and your -- and the impact to the team?JOE MOGLIA, HEAD COACH, COASTAL CAROLINA UNIVERSITY FOOTBALL TEAM (via telephone): Maria, prior to that, though, I can't -- when you were going over what was going on in European markets earlier, I can't tell you how relieved I am and our entire team that the Bank of England left rates unchanged overnight, that's a big deal.BARTIROMO: OK. So, you think it's a big deal that they left rates unchanged. Yes, because the markets actually strengthened after that, Joe.MOGLIA: Maria, I was kidding about that.BARTIROMO: Oh.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: It's too much. You're talk -- exactly, there's just -- we're talking about life-threatening storm here, Joe Moglia, you had to change your whole schedule and move the team. Give us a status check.MOGLIA: Well, on Monday, the -- when the governor said that they were going to shut down schools, literally we had the game (INAUDIBLE) you already talked about it a little bit, and the number one concern we have is making sure we took care -- took care of the safety but not just of our players, but our staff, our operations, our medical staff, our families.And then, as we went through that, everybody -- people raised their hand and talked about, well, we got pets. What are we going to do with the pets? OK. We'll take the pets with us. Then, when I'm talking to the team to explain what's going on, they said, hey, we've got pets. So, we take -- we took their pets with us. So, we had a fifth bus that dominantly had like about 15 pets on the way to Raleigh. Now, I'm allergic to pets, so we got -- the only deal was everybody has got to keep their pets away from me, but other than that, we're OK.BARTIROMO: Wow. So, it sounds like you're really riding this out. You moved the team -- how is the team reacting to having to move and play in different spots, and obviously, you had a win yesterday, despite moving the game from Saturday to yesterday, right?MOGLIA: Yes. Now, one of the things that we talked -- we have a philosophy, we talked about, we have no rules in our program. We (INAUDIBLE) that we have a program in the nation. And we talked about standing up so people take responsibility for yourself. Now, with that, you got to be able to adapt and adjust. And we explained to the guys, this is what's going on. This is going to be terribly inconvenient and it's going to be a real pain for a while, but your safety is our number one -- is our number one priority, and we've got jobs to do, we've got business to do. So, the attitude for the team is very accepting of that. They certainly understand what was going on, I think they appreciate the fact that our priority is them. Yes, we seven-hour bus ride or so for about 160 people last night to go from Raleigh to Jacksonville, Florida where we are now. But we're going to wait out the storm here. (AUDIO GAP)BARTIROMO: And when you left your home, everything in terms of impact, no real impact so far before you left? Joe Moglia --MOGLIA: Can you (INAUDIBLE) what? I (AUDIO GAP) early enough to beat.BARTIROMO: All right. You left early enough to beat it. I think I heard. Joe Moglia, thanks very much for calling in. We appreciate it. Coming up, we are bracing for impact. And take a look at how businesses like Lowe's and Home Depot are faring against Florence. Then, a Google meltdown, an inside look at how employees -- they reacted moments after Donald Trump was elected President. A full report straight ahead. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Wall Street bracing for an economic impact of Hurricane Florence as well. Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Nic, good morning to you.NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Hey, good morning, Maria. So, of course, we're hoping everyone stays safe, to follows all the directions, but the economic impact, the damages is set, estimated about 20 billion. I'll get to that in a moment, but it could be pretty broad. Look at first at all the different stocks that are moving. The first is Home Depot. We've seen Home Depot gaining this week. In fact, it's hit new highs every day this week. According to our senior editor, Home Depot lone was responsible for half of the 82 points that we've seen on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Everybody is running for building materials, supplies in order to protect their property. Tobacco stocks, tobacco fields may also be in jeopardy, and we're seeing names like Philip Morris up 1.8 percent, Altria up four percent.Bring you to the rental car companies, and this is what, to your point, Maria, when you say economic impact, we're seeing the rental car companies, those have moved higher as people are fleeing in rental cars. And then, afterwards, when there's going to be damage to the property owners, right, they're not going to have their cars, they're going to be renting cars. Here's the estimate of the storm damages. They said 20 billion, but, Maria, it's going to be not only the ones that I've shown you, but insurance stocks have been under pressure, cruise lines, airlines. So, let's just make it through this safely and then we're going to look at the economic impact as well. Back to you.BARTIROMO: Yes, that makes sense, Nic, thank you so much. Nicole Petallides on Wall Street. Apple unveiling a slate of new products yesterday. Among them, the redesigned Apple Watch which features more health tracking features including high quality heart readings. Joining us now, the host of "VARNEY & COMPANY," Stuart Varney to weigh in on that. Stu, good morning to you.STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Maria, they designed that watch for me and people of my age. Do you remember that commercial, "Help, I've fallen and I can't get up?"BARTIROMO: Yes.VARNEY: I think the Apple Watch is designed for those people like me. Because if this watch -- well, this watch has a heart monitor and it's got a fall alert on it. In other words, if I slip and fall, tumble down the stairs and I'm wearing an Apple Watch, I'm OK. Well, not necessarily OK, but I can get help. I think they designed this watch with geriatrics like myself in mind. What say you, Maria?BARTIROMO: Yes, I think it's a really good move because we're living longer and health care is certainly the growth story for technology.VARNEY: I'm sorry, I'm trying to keep you out of my age group. You're way out of my age group, OK?BARTIROMO: Yes.VARNEY: I also like the very big screen new Apple phone 6-1/2 inches or whatever it is. I like that. I can read it, I can get the print up large so people of my age can actually read it. It's a T.V., a computer, and a phone. I'm going to buy one.BARTIROMO: You like it. You like it, Stu.VARNEY: Yes, I do.BARTIROMO: Great. Good stuff. All right. I know you'll have more on that in about 10 minutes, Stu. We'll see you at the top of the hour. "VARNEY & COMPANY" begins top of the hour 9:00 a.m. Eastern right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA, join Stuart, coming up.But first, there's this, Facebook ready, how Mark Zuckerberg says the company is better prepared to fight election interference ahead of the 2018 midterms. Back in a moment with that.BARTIROMO: President Trump tweeting this morning about Puerto Rico. Here's what he just wrote: "3,000 people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico. When I left the island after the storm had hit, they had anywhere from 6 to 18 deaths. As time went by, it did not go up by much. Then, a long time later, they started to report really large numbers like 3,000 in Puerto Rico. This was done by the Democrats in order to make me look as bad as possible, when I was successfully raising billions of dollars to help rebuild Puerto Rico. If a person died for any reason like old age, just add them on to the list. Bad politics! I love Puerto Rico!" the President responding to commentary after his comments about Puerto Rico response being very good.Meanwhile, there's this, a leaked video shows Google bosses trashing President Trump just days after the election. This, as Facebook says it actually is better prepared to protect the company site from foreign interference. Lauren Simonetti with the details now. Lauren?LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Pretty explosive stuff, Maria. Let's start with Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg penning a 3300-word blog detailing exactly how his company is working to fight election interference. He frames the problem as an arms race. It's a war between Facebook and fake accounts. This is what he wrote, "The numbers are so large because our adversaries are using computers to create fake accounts in bulk. And while we are quickly improving our ability to detect and block them, it's still very difficult. One of the challenges we face is that the content these pages share often does not violate our community standards. That's why Facebook is throwing more eyeballs and more money at the problem. They are even working with law enforcements. They showed up at that social media hearing on Capitol Hill last week, Google did not. And now, Breitbart releasing this 2015 video. We're going to show you of a Google meeting following the election of Donald Trump, watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SERGEY BRIN, FOUNDER, GOOGLE: I certainly find this election deeply offensive, and I know many of you do, too.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It did feel like a ton of bricks dropped on my chest. What we all need right now is a hug.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Can I move to Canada?(LAUGHTER)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is there anything positive you see from this election result?(LAUGHTER)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Boy, that's a really tough one right now.(END VIDEO CLIP)SIMONETTI: Attorney General Jeff Sessions will be briefed, September 25th, by Republican state attorneys general about social media companies' censorship of conservative voices. That video could be their smoking gun. Google has responded to the video. I will read you their statement: "At a regularly scheduled all hands meeting, some Google employees and executives expressed their own personal views in the aftermath of a long and divisive election season. For over 20 years, everyone at Google has been able to freely express their opinions at these meetings. Nothing was said at that meeting or any other meeting to suggest that any political bias ever influences the way we build or operate our products. To the contrary, our products are built for everyone, and we design them with extraordinary care, to be a trustworthy source of information for everyone, without regard to political viewpoint."Well, human beings make the algorithms, and we don't know much about those algorithms, right? There's a human behind them. What about that?BARTIROMO: It's just extraordinary to see the emotion and the -- and the - - just negative commentary from the leadership at Google. I will say this, one of the concerns on the part of employees was immigration because they have a lot of H-1B Visas.SIMONETTI: Sergey Brin is an immigrant, a refugee, in fact.BARTIROMO: Exactly. But it still is just extraordinary to me to see this display of just hatred for Donald Trump. What are your thoughts?MCDOWELL: Now, let's be clear, these are the people who founded Google and the top leadership at the company, essentially crying, talking about moving to Canada. If they want to have an issue-based conversation about what they're concerned about, that's one thing. But this is just the emotion of Hillary Clinton lost, and it's classic corporate coddling that is taking over big industries like technology.BARTIROMO: Particularly in Silicon Valley.SCHLAPP: Yes, we have to be very mindful of Conservatives and Republicans can't get a fair shake on these platforms. This is the future. That is going to be a big problem.BARTIROMO: And we'll see if these companies will ultimately have to get smaller. Lauren, thank you so much. We'll be right back, final thoughts.BARTIROMO: Have a great day, everybody. Great show! Thanks so much, Dagen McDowell, Matt Schlapp, and Jack Brewer, good to see you. Have a great day, everybody. "VARNEY & COMPANY" begins now. Stuart, take it away.VARNEY: Good morning, Maria. Good morning, everyone. Smartphones with cameras, they are everywhere.Load-Date: September 13, 2018End of Document

Global In-Wheel Motor Market 2018-2025 - Market is Dominated by Protean Electric, Elaphe, ZIEHL-ABEGG, Printed Motor Works and NTNPR NewswireSeptember 4, 2018 Tuesday 1:00 PM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1585 wordsDateline: DUBLIN, Sept. 4, 2018 BodyThe"In-Wheel Motor Market by Propulsion (BEV, HEV, PHEV, and FCEV), Vehicle (PC and CV), Motor (Axial Flux and Radial Flux), Cooling (Air and Liquid), Power Output (Up to 60 KW, 60-90 KW, and Above 90 Kw), and Region - Global Forecast to 2025"report has been added toResearchAndMarkets.com'soffering.The global in-wheel motor market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 35.02% during the forecast period to reach USD 2,641.1 million by 2025 from an estimated USD 322.8 million in 2018.In-wheel motor improves the performance of electric vehicles. It replaces transmission, drive shaft, axles, and differentials. In-wheel motor helps supply torque to its associated tire and generates more power to improve the efficiency of a vehicle.The BEV segment (zero emission vehicles) is set to register the highest growth rate of the in-wheel motor market, followed by HEVs and PHEVs because of the availability of better subsidies and support from governments. Increasing vehicle range has fueled the demand for BEVs. The top 5 selling BEV models in Europe are Renault Zoe, Nissan Leaf, Tesla Model S, BMW i3, and Volkswagen e-Golf. Tesla Model S, Chevy Volt, BMW i3, and Nissan Leaf are equipped with in-wheel motors. Further, NTN developed the Two Motor On-board Drive System for the next-generation electric vehicles, which powers the left and right wheels along with the motors on each wheel.The electric passenger car segment is estimated to be the largest of the global in-wheel motor market in 2018. The market growth of in-wheel motors can be attributed to factors such as improved fuel efficiency, high torque, increased power, and provision of better vehicle handling to both new and existing vehicles. The increasing support from governments in China, Japan France, Norway and the US, and the OEM's efforts to improve the existing EVs models are expected to drive the sales of electric vehicles Passenger Cars (PCs) during the forecast period, which in turn would boost the demand for in-wheel motors for passenger cars.Asia Pacific is the largest in-wheel motor market. China is the largest market because the Chinese government provides huge subsidies for the electrification of vehicles. Increase in sales of electric vehicles will lead to the increase in sales of in-wheel motors as only electric vehicles are equipped with in-wheel motors. For instance, Protean Electric, which is known for its in-wheel motors, will form a joint venture with Weifu High-Technology Group in China, and the company will try to commercialize its ProteanDrive Pd18 Motors on a larger scale.In-Wheel Motor MarketGovernment support for electric vehicles, increased driving range, reliability, and improved vehicle performance are creating opportunities for the growth of the in-wheel motor marketAxial Flux MotorAxial permanent magnet wheel motor is generally used for compact electric vehicles. An electric vehicle is driven directly by 2 wheel motors installed on its rear wheels. An axial flux motor is compact, lightweight, and highly efficient. It is used to increase the output torque and efficiency. It can be used as direct drives in electric vehicles. The manufacturing and assembling processes are simple compared to radial flux motors.Radial Flux MotorRadial flux motor is the most common type of motor adopted for in-wheel motors as the rotor can be directly fixed to the wheel. Moreover, in radial flux motors, the outer rotor design is about 15% lighter than the inner rotor machine, which generates the same torque due to their longer air gap diameter. In-wheel motors are almost radial because of the integration benefits, durability, and torque density.Passenger CarsA Passenger Car (PC), as defined by the OICA, is a motor vehicle equipped with at least 4 wheels, comprising not more than 8 seats. The PC segment is the largest, by vehicle type, and includes sedans, hatchbacks, station wagons, Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs), and Multi-Utility Vehicles (MUVs). This vehicle segment is the most promising market for electric vehicles as it is the largest segment in the automotive industry. The PC segment of the electric vehicle market is growing at a significant rate in emerging economies in the Asia Pacific region. The market growth in the region can be attributed to a rise in the GDP and population, improvement in lifestyle, increased purchasing power of consumers, and development of infrastructure.Commercial VehiclesThe commercial vehicle (CV) segment includes LCVs and HCVs. HCVs combine 2 categories of vehiclesheavy trucks and buses and coaches. The nature of these vehicles limits their production volume and growth rates as they are used in specific applications such as logistics, construction, and mining industries. On the other hand, LCVs have come a long way from having bare essential features to full-blown utility vehicles that can be used for passengers as well as commercial purposes.Air CoolingThe in-wheel motors, which have a peak power of 30 KW, can be cooled using the air cooling method. For instance, Elaphe provides LEV in-wheel motor that has a peak power of 20 KW, with a speed of 1,200 rpm, which can be cooled by the air cooling method. The in-wheel motors which are cooled by the air cooling method deliver a high torque, which enhance the performance of the vehicle. It is mainly used for light electric vehicles and city electric cars.Liquid CoolingThe in-wheel motors, which have a peak power above 30 KW, can be cooled using the liquid cooling method. For instance, Elaphe provides L1500 in-wheel motor that has a peak power of 110 KW, with a speed of 1,250 rpm and can be cooled by using the liquid cooling method. The in-wheel motors which are cooled by the liquid cooling method are powerful, compact along with standard disc brake and outer caliper. It is mainly used in SUVs and powerful sedans.Critical Questions:Where will the autonomous vehicle technology take the industry in the long term?Will the industry cope with the challenge of high cost of the in-wheel motor market?How do you see the impact of the additional weight of in-wheel motors?The global in-wheel motor market is dominated by major players such as Protean Electric (US), Elaphe (Slovenia), ZIEHL-ABEGG (Germany), Printed Motor Works (UK), and NTN (Japan).Key Topics Covered:1 Introduction2 Research Methodology3 Executive Summary4 Premium Insights4.1 Attractive Opportunities in the In-Wheel Motor Market4.2 Asia Pacific is Expected to Lead the Global In-Wheel Motor Market in 20254.3 In-Wheel Motor Market, By Power Output4.4 In-Wheel Motor Market, By Cooling Type4.5 In-Wheel Motor Market, By Motor Type4.6 In-Wheel Motor Market, By Propulsion Type4.7 In-Wheel Motor Market, By Vehicle Type5 Market Overview5.1 Introduction5.2 Market Dynamics5.2.1 Drivers5.2.1.1 Increased Simplicity and Efficiency of Vehicle5.2.1.2 Reduces Weight and Provides More Space5.2.2 Restraints5.2.2.1 Increase in Unsprung Weight in Wheel5.2.3 Opportunities5.2.3.1 Rising Trend of Autonomous Technology in Vehicle5.2.3.2 Increasing Penetration of Electric Vehicle Globally5.2.4 Challenges5.2.4.1 High Cost5.2.4.2 Complexity in Controlling Individual Wheel Speed6 In-Wheel Motor Market, By Components6.1 Introduction6.2 Suspension6.3 Rotor and Stator6.4 Wheel Bearings6.5 Regenerative Braking System7 In-Wheel Motor Market, By Cooling Type7.1 Introduction7.2 Air Cooling7.3 Liquid Cooling8 In-Wheel Motor Market, By Motor Type8.1 Introduction8.2 Axial Flux Motor8.3 Radial Flux Motor9 In-Wheel Motor Market, By Power Output9.1 Introduction9.2 Up to 60 KW9.3 60-90 KW9.4 Above 90 KW10 In-Wheel Motor Market, By Propulsion Type10.1 Introduction10.2 Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV)10.3 Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV)10.4 Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV)10.5 Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV)11 In-Wheel Motor Market, By Vehicle Type11.1 Introduction11.2 Passenger Cars (PC)11.3 Commercial Vehicles (CV)12 In-Wheel Motor Market, By Region12.1 Introduction12.2 Asia Pacific12.2.1 China12.2.2 India12.2.3 Japan12.2.4 South Korea12.3 Europe12.3.1 France12.3.2 Germany12.3.3 Italy12.3.4 Netherlands12.3.5 Norway12.3.6 Sweden12.3.7 United Kingdom12.4 North America12.4.1 Canada12.4.2 US13 Competitive Landscape13.1 Overview13.2 Market Ranking Analysis13.3 Competitive Situation & Trends13.3.1 New Product Developments13.3.2 Collaborations/Joint Ventures/Supply Contracts/ Partnerships/Agreements14 Company Profiles14.1 Key Players14.1.1 Protean Electric14.1.2 Elaphe Ltd14.1.3 Ziehl-Abegg14.1.4 Printed Motor Works14.1.5 NTN14.1.6 E-Traction14.1.7 TM414.1.8 Ecomove14.1.9 NSK14.1.10 Tajima EV14.1.11 Yasa14.1.12 Schaeffler14.2 Key Players From Other Regions14.2.1 North America14.2.1.1 General Motors14.2.1.2 Tesla14.2.1.3 Ford14.2.2 Europe14.2.2.1 Volkswagen14.2.2.2 BMW14.2.2.3 Daimler14.2.2.4 Volvo14.2.3 Asia Pacific14.2.3.1 Mitsubishi Motors14.2.3.2 Toyota14.2.3.3 Honda14.2.3.4 Hyundai14.2.3.5 NissanFor more information about this report visithttps://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/pmwsck/global_inwheel?w=5Media Contact:Laura Wood, Senior Managerpress@researchandmarkets.com For E.S.T Office Hours Call +1-917-300-0470For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call +1-800-526-8630For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900U.S. Fax: 646-607-1907Fax (outside U.S.): +353-1-481-1716 View original content with multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-in-wheel-motor-market-2018-2025---market-is-dominated-by-protean-electric-elaphe-ziehl-abegg-printed-motor-works-and-ntn-300706208.htmlSOURCE Research and MarketsLoad-Date: September 5, 2018End of Document

IntSights Cyber Intelligence Exposes Dark Side of Asia in Marquee Threat Report; Global Threat Intelligence Firm Reveals Nefarious Geographies Across Asia's Dark Web, Highlighting China's Unique Cyber LandscapePR NewswireAugust 8, 2018 Wednesday 12:00 PM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 544 wordsDateline: NEW YORK, Aug. 8, 2018 BodyIntSights Cyber Intelligence, the leading provider of enterprise cyber risk analytics, threat intelligence and mitigation solutions that automate proactive defense, announced today the release of the company's latest threat intelligence report, "The Dark Side of Asia: An Inside Look into Asia's Growing Underground World." This research takes a unique, behind-the-scenes look at the importance of understanding the specific dark web linguistic and cultural differences that today's threat researchers need to navigate to be effective in combating the growing cybercrime industry emerging in Asia."As the dark web grows, companies and government organizations need to understand that it's no longer enough to monitor cyber-crime activities typically associated with Russian, North Korean or other English-speaking cyber groups," said Itay Kozuch, Director of Threat Research, IntSights. "Language barriers, cultural differences and government-imposed access restrictions make it incredibly difficult for threat hunters to access and blend in with these Asian underground communities to effectively perform threat reconnaissance."The new research report by IntSights pulls back the curtain of the growing underground Asian Internet, and provides and overview of certain countries' dark web landscape, government laws and attitudes towards cyber activity, primary uses and motivations, common black market goods and services and key threat actors. The report also delves into the Chinese Internet network, where many hackers are not even using the dark web or openly-accessible anonymous networks. This has created an interesting dynamic between the Chinese government and its cyber citizens, and leads to a number of additional challenges threat hunters must work around.To get an inside look into key trends, laws, motivations and threat actors of the increasingly threatening Asian Internet community, download the full report here:https://www.intsights.com/dark-side-of-asia-research-report.About IntSights:IntSights is redefining cyber security with the industry's first and only enterprise threat management platform that transforms tailored threat intelligence into automated security operations.

China blocks top Australian broadcaster's websiteCNN WireSeptember 3, 2018 Monday 10:34 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 461 wordsByline: By Sherisse PhamDateline: HONG KONG (CNNMoney) BodyHONG KONG (CNNMoney) --  China has blocked the website of one of Australia's biggest news networks, adding to the list of international media groups prevented from reaching internet users in the world's most populous country.The Australian Broadcasting Corporation said Monday that China's internet regulator has censored its apps and website in the country. Chinese officials cited a breach of the country's laws and regulations, according to the ABC. Multiple high-profile news organizations have fallen foul of China's vast censorship apparatus, which is known as the Great Firewall. The websites of The New York Times, Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal have all been blocked in China for years. CNN's TV broadcasts are also routinely blacked out in China.Censorship of news outlets often occurs during or immediately following reports that the Beijing government deems sensitive or destabilizing. The New York Times, for example, was blocked after it published an article reporting that family members of the then premier, Wen Jiabao, had amassed a fortune worth billions of dollars. The ABC, Australia's public broadcaster, said Chinese authorities had declined to say what rules it had broken. According to GreatFire.org, a group that monitors internet censorship in China, censorship of the ABC site began around August 23, the same day the Australian government banned Chinese tech companies Huawei and ZTE from participating in the country's 5G rollout, citing national security concerns.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying declined to comment on the ABC ban at a regularly scheduled news briefing Monday, referring reporters to the country's internet regulator. China's Cyberspace Affairs Commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who took office 10 days ago, suggested Beijing's censorship of the ABC was an internal Chinese matter. "The ABC is funded to broadcast in Australia so we're in control of that," Morrison told 3AW radio on Monday. "China's a sovereign country. They make decisions about what happens there. We make decisions about what happens here."The ban comes after a period of frosty relations between Australia and China.Earlier this year, the then prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, admitted a "degree of tension" with Beijing over new laws aimed at tightening Australia's security and electoral processes, including a ban on foreign donations. The legislation followed a series of scandals involving alleged attempts by China to influence Australian politics. China has accused the Australian government of unfairly singling it out.-- Yong Xiong contributed to this report.TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Jim Cramer: Today Was the Opposite of YesterdayRealMoneyAugust 1, 2018 Wednesday 7:01 PM EDTCopyright 2018 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1226 wordsByline: Jim CramerHighlight: If you can't deal with the volatility, go all index funds.BodyDon't ever get comfortable with the best of our industrials because they are precisely the companies that might need to sacrifice some earnings on the altar of beating China.That's your takeaway on a day like today, a day which is the opposite of yesterday because at the beginning of Tuesday's session we got word of back talks with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and China but at the end, after the market closed, we learned that we might be upping the stakes on the trade war.That plus the almost zero-sum nature of Apple's  success and its romp to the elusive trillion-dollar milestone, define today's mixed session.First, let's do some stipulating. While there are globalists in the administration, and I would include Larry Kudlow and Steve Mnuchin, the globalist rhetoric does not extend to China. When you hear China you should be thinking one thing: as the statistics get more grim for China and they are getting grim, the president wants to accelerate the process and truly alter the way China does business with us.The president has two advisers, Mr. Outside, Robert Lighthizer, the U.S. Trade Representative and Mr. Inside, Peter Navarro, an assistant to the president, Director of Trade and Industrial Policy and they are fair traders not free traders. They don't like globalism and they think the Chinese have totally taken advantage of us and that it's all zero sum with China rather than something where we both do well. Just to be sure, winning the trade war does not mean China must heel. It means that there is no give without a get. No more joint ventures with bogus Chinese companies that just steal our technology and take half of our companies' profits. No more targeting our industries to wipe our jobs out and create their own jobs. No more dumping, either.Just to be sure, neither Navarro nor Lighthizer want our companies that have great growth in China to be pancaked by the policies they are pushing toward the president, policies that the president is eager and willing to adopt.Ultimately when an American Express  gets approved to do business in China it shouldn't have to do it in a joint venture. When a Qualcomm tries to merge with NXP Semi  the Chinese government can't block it. When our industrials want to do business in China they no longer want to give away their trade secrets. They want China to be like any other country to do business with.Ultimately, I think one of the reasons why the stock market is doing so well, and we had such a fabulous July with the Dow Jones Industrials up 4.7%, is because of a budding perception that the Chinese have so much more to lose than we do. There's dissent among Chinese academics about the direction of the government. There's a recognition that the decline in exports and the layoffs that come with them are not tolerable.Because of that stance it's real hard for the president to say "you know what? We have to start worrying about Boeing  sales. We need to see if they will buy more Caterpillar  engines. Let's get more 3M  surgical masks sold." That's not the agenda.I joked this morning that we came up with FANG. Now maybe we need a Navarro basket, and it would be an inverse ETF a group of stocks that go down when Navarro presses the jackboot to the PRC's jugular. You see the Chinese stocks rally off of Steve Mnuchin you slap on a Navarro, a basket made up of Boeing, Cummins  , Honeywell  , United Technologies  and 3M and a bunch of others. Then when the boom gets lowered on the Chinese you sell your Navarro and kaching, kaching.Of course, though, the other story line, Apple's stock, is also a zero-sum game. When Apple does well, it is so powerful that unless you have an app in the app store, you may not benefit nearly as much as you think. A supplier to Apple has a tough time because Apple is so important that it has gross margin clout, meaning it can appropriate your gross margins.First, in the trade war, Apple is a form of Switzerland. It's a dominant company in so many markets, even as it is only the third biggest cellphone maker in the world--dominant because it owns the premium market, the most lucrative portion of the entire mosaic. It kicks butt in Greater China and put up some fabulous numbers for the quarter. But it is in employment that Apple has the real edge. If the Chinese want to keep people working, it needs to appease Apple and not just vice versa. Yep, Apple has so many people who assemble in China that it has real clout.More important, the stock market, right now, is beginning to bifurcate Apple from, say, FANG, because Apple's got this tremendous service revenue stream that could be worth the entire enterprise value of Facebook  right now-about $500 billion-if it continues at this current trajectory. Because of its incredible ecosystem and its fantastic brand loyalty, Apple's starting to be talked about as a consumer product stock. I just wish some major Wall Street house would transfer coverage from tech to consumer products so we could see how much cheaper Apple's stock is versus Clorox  , Procter & Gamble  or Coca Cola  and so many others in the group.What's more important, though, is the gaping hole that is Facebook. As I said last night Facebook's stock has more tech fire power than Apple. There's much more pin action from the wounded social media king than there is Apple. So when Facebook's flying all the pins go flying. When Facebook's dying, the group gutters.I get it. Facebook represents advertising, cloud, privacy issues and bad press. Apple stands for consumer products that are loved and a business predicated on NOT selling your name to anybody.Apple's just enmeshed with those companies that are tied to the social media giant.One other thought. This market gives you endless buying opportunities. We saw the banks get slaughtered when rates were going lower. Now that they are going higher-and the Fed signaled today that the direction's the right one-the banks are superb investments.Drug stocks got slammed off of Presidential announcements. But their earnings were so strong that they became too cheap. They then got real love.Today's hated group? Retailers. Many of them just got crushed on rumors that business isn't that strong. I am not buying it. I think that the last three months are the least important of the year and that back-to-school will be quite robust. That means you a lot places to win as I think so many are doing so well and almost all of them got crushed. I know there are concerns that the new tariffs, if put in place will hurt retailers. I think otherwise and suggest you use weakness to buy them.Now I know that the moves down in the industrials are more stark and vicious than the ramp ups and that's created a level of fear that shatters confidence. All I can say is that you should not own these industrials unless you think that we will win the trade war. I think we will, as long as people remember that winning does not mean that China has to lose, it just means that we get to win as much as they do.So my bottom line is if you can't deal with the volatility, if you can't use the panic attacks to buy, go all index funds that because the moves will only be exacerbated until the Chinese blink, and then you will catch a move that could be extraordinarily bullish. But until that happens, the forecast remains delicious pleasure and then max pain.Load-Date: August 3, 2018End of Document

Boat with US soybeans up to the port of China; would be subject to sanctionsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 13, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 335 wordsBody       Reuters and Afp La Jornada Newspaper  Monday, August 13, 2018, p. 16 Beijing  A ship that transports soybeans from the United States docked Saturday in the port of Dalian, a month after reaching the coast of China, just when heavy tariffs were imposed on US goods, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon shipping data.  The Peak Pegasus transports 70 thousand tons of soybeans and arrived on the coast on July 6, shortly after Beijing imposed tariffs of 25 percent on US products for 34 billion dollars. The sanctions were in response to a similar move by Washington as part of the trade dispute between the two largest economies in the world.  According to recent data, the ship was in port in the early hours of Sunday. The move suggests that soybeans may be about to be discharged, making it one of the first shipments of grain from the United States that will be subject to Chinese sanctions. It was reported that the state Sinograin is the buyer.  Two other ships carrying soy from the United States - Star Jennifer and Cemtex Pioneer - have been anchored off the coast of China in recent weeks. The Star, off the coast since July 24, was in motion on Sunday. It was not clear where he was going.  Soybeans are the main agricultural export from the United States to China, with a commercial value of 12,700 million dollars in 2017.  Meanwhile, the price of US pork and beef has risen markedly in China, which favors meats from Australia and Latin America.  US products are so expensive that we will supply in other countries, said Zhang Lihui, Shanghai distributor of PMI Foods, one of the leading meat distributors in the world.  We will buy beef that comes preferably from Australia and Latin America, even a little bit more in Canada, "he said. PMI Foods has stopped importing pork from the United States.  After the start of the trade war between China and the United States, the customs duties imposed by the Chinese government on American meat products caused their prices to increase excessively. Load-Date: August 13, 2018End of Document

How Jack Ma went from English teacher to tech billionaireCNN WireSeptember 10, 2018 Monday 1:38 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1097 wordsByline: By Jackie WattlesDateline: NEW YORK (CNNMoney) BodyNEW YORK (CNNMoney) --  Jack Ma, the rags-to-riches entrepreneur behind Chinese e-commerce giant, Alibaba, plans to hand over the reins at the company he co-founded nearly two-decades ago.He said on Monday, his 54th birthday, that he will step down as executive chairman next year, ushering in a new era for the $420 billion company that has grown from a web page run out of Ma's apartment to a top global tech enterprise.Alibaba's empire spans everything from cloud computing and digital banking to online messaging and movie production.Ma, an outspoken advocate for globalization, will begin transitioning out of his role at a politically heated time. The United States and China are locked in an escalating trade war. Meanwhile, China's economy is showing signs of slowing.Duncan Clark, author of "Alibaba: The House That Jack Ma Built," told CNN that he doubts Ma's retirement announcement was prompted by geopolitical headaches."He has long talked about his desire to go back to his roots as a teacher," Clark said. So his retirement should come as "no big surprise."'Hollywood story'Ma was born to a poor family in Hangzhou, in the eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang in 1964. He struggled in school, and he has said during interviews that he was rejected from Harvard 10 times and repeatedly rejected for jobs.He failed his entrance exam twice before studying at the Hangzhou Teachers College. He graduated in 1988 and continued to teach English there for several years.Ma described his ascent to one of China's most prominent tech tycoons as a "Hollywood story" during an interview with The New York Times in 2005.He told the outlet that he traveled to California in 1995 to help collect a debt that an American businessman owed to a Chinese firm. But Ma said the man had a gun and held him captive in a Malibu mansion for two days. He escaped after promising the businessman he would become his partner in an internet venture.Ma did not contact the man again, but he asked friends in Seattle about the internet, according to The Times. Invigorated by the technology, Ma returned to China, where the internet was still virtually unknown."The day we got connected to the web, I invited friends and TV people over to my house," he told The Times. "We waited three and a half hours and got half a page. We drank, watched TV and played cards, waiting. But I was so proud. I proved the internet existed." Building AlibabaHe quit teaching and borrowed a couple thousand dollars to launch China Pages, one of the country's first commercial websites.When that venture failed, he scraped together roughly $60,000 from friends and investors and co-founded Alibaba.com as a business-to-business marketplace in 1999. It attracted backing from giants like Goldman Sachs and SoftBank.The company survived the dot-com crash in 2000, and a couple of years later Alibaba started turning a profit.Alibaba spawned Taobao.com, an eBay-like bartering marketplace, in 2003. It was a breakout success.Yahoo, then a tech powerhouse, purchased a large stake in Alibaba in 2005 in a deal valued at $4 billion that also gave Alibaba control over Yahoo's operations in China. Over the next decade, Alibaba amassed millions more customers and is credited with helping to change Chinese society by giving working-class people access to online commerce and creating a flood of new jobs. Record IPOAlibaba debuted on the New York Stock Exchange in September 2014 and raised a record $25 billion.But its early days on the stock market were shaky as the company struggled to meet Wall Street's lofty expectations.Ma gave his view in an interview CBS's 60 Minutes that year: "We believe customer number one, employee number two, shareholder number three. If they don't want to buy that, that's fine ... They can sell us."60 Minutes anchor Lara Logan pointed out that in the United States, "the shareholder is usually first.""Yeah, and I think they are wrong," he said. "The shareholder, good. I respect them. But they're the third. Because you've take care of the customer, take care of the employees, shareholder will be taken care of."Ma later expressed regret about the IPO. "If I had another life, I would keep my company private," he said in a 2015 speech.'Love them. Don't marry them.'Like other Chinese tech giants that have emerged over the past two decades, Alibaba has had to navigate an economy over which China's ruling Communist Party looms large.Ma told 60 Minutes that Alibaba works with Chinese authorities when it comes to issues of national security. But he said he still sought to keep the government at arm's length.His policy was to "never, ever do business with government," he said. "Love them. Don't marry them."In a 2014 article in The New Yorker, writer Jiayang Fan said that Ma and other self-made Chinese success stories were "becoming a problem for the Beijing government, which has historically chosen its heroes and compelled them to serve the needs of the Chinese Communist Party.""The problem, of course, is that they also point to an increasing adoption by the Chinese of Western values," she wrote.But Alibaba has played by Beijing's rules, allowing it to continue to grow strongly despite the Chinese government's tightening grip on the internet under President Xi Jinping. Ma has served as an advocate for the Communist Party, accompanying Xi on foreign visits and praising his policies.Looking forwardMa, who is worth around $40 billion, has remained the face of Alibaba. But he began gradually relinquishing control of the company years ago. He stepped down as CEO in 2013, retaining the role of executive chairman. Daniel Zhang is the current CEO.But Clark, the biographer, said that he doesn't think Ma will ever fully sever ties with the company."Jack has such a following [and] moral standing at the company, it doesn't really matter what title he has," he said.Ma holds a more than 6% stake in Alibaba, and the company's governance structure gives him and other partners firm control of the board. He told Bloomberg TV earlier this week he wants to return to teaching someday. "This is something I think I can do much better than being CEO of Alibaba," he said.Ma also said he wants to follow in the footsteps of Microsoft co-founder and fellow billionaire Bill Gates, who has pledged to give away at least half of his wealth during his lifetime.He plans to focus on his Jack Ma Foundation, formed in 2014, a charity dedicated to improving education, the environment and public health.TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

EXPOSING POTENTIAL COLLUSION BETWEEN GREENS AND REDS ON ENERGYStates News ServiceAugust 20, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1059 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the National Center for Public Policy Research:Both the Russian and Chinese governments are reportedly actively working with American environmental groups to hinder fossil fuel exploration in the United States. "This," said National Center Senior Fellow Bonner Cohen, Ph.D., "is the real collusion."At the recent America First Energy Conference in New Orleans, Bonner detailed lucrative relationships two American activist groups have allegedly forged with foreign governments in competition with the interests of the Trump Administration.As the mainstream media and much of the Washington establishment is caught up in thus-far unproven charges of collusion between Russians and the Trump presidential campaign, Bonner highlighted the work of congressional investigators and Daily Signal writer Kevin Mooney in exposing a possible long-term relationship meant to hinder American evolution from energy dependence on foreign powers to being energy independent and an exporter of fossil fuels.Bonner pointed out that "[t]he Russians take seriously President Trump's pledge to make the United States globally energy-dominant" and see the United States as a "very serious competitor" in the world energy marketplace.Compounding problems for Russia is that it has a "unique vulnerability" due to its relatively small economy. It relies the money is raises through exploitation of its fossil fuel deposits to remain a player in world affairs. As Bonner explained:Whatever geopolitical interest Vladimir Putin may have, he has to have a sound economic basis with which to finance that. And with the United States now a world leader in fossil fuels, it is right seen by the Russians as posing a real threat in the future one that they take absolutely seriously, as well they should.From the Russian's standpoint, this is just practicing good old-fashioned statecraft something that Vladimir Putin, a former KGB agent, understands very well.You're using environmental groups to sway public opinion against not only your big economic rival, but more importantly your biggest geopolitical rival.Just like has been alleged about the 2016 election, congressional investigators with the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Science, Space and Technology said that the Russian Internet Research Agency used social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to direct over 9,000 postings to influence public opinion and drive the development of American energy policy. There is also evidence pointing to two American environmental groups the Natural Resouces Defense Council (NRDC) and Sierra Club Foundation (SCF) receiving substantial funding from off-shore interests with ties to the Putin regime.The NRDC and SCF are harsh critics of the pro-energy development policies promoted by the Trump Administration such as fracking, pipelines and the end of any American compliance in the Paris Climate Accord. According to Mooney's reporting, the U.S. Senate's Committee on Environment and Public Works identified the shadowy Bermuda-based Klein, Ltd. as having given millions to the Sea Change Foundation in San Francisco. Klein, the report said, "was set up for the sole purpose of funneling anonymous donations to Sea Change." This was said to include money from foreign sources that included Russia. Between 2010 and 2015, Sea Change and a Sea Change beneficiary called the Energy Foundation gave $18 million to SCF and $15 million to NRDC.Seeking to answer the obviously question as to why groups headquartered in the United States might work with foreign governments against their own nation's interests, Bonner said: "Why bite the hand that's been feeding you when you've been dining quite well?"As Bonner noted during his presentation:You can see here that we have thanks for the work of congressional investigators established the money trail from Moscow to Bermuda to San Francisco to two of the most powerful U.S. environmental activist groups. It doesn't take a tremendous amount of imagination to figure out how long or what exactly the agenda is here.Moscow has an interest in condemning U.S.. natural gas/fossil fuel exploration and development simply because Russia itself is a huge producer of fossil fuels particularly oil and natural gas.Of course, the irony of it here is that the environmental groups which would have you believe that our use of fossil fuels is putting the planet at peril, are themselves receiving money from another country which is also a world leader in fossil fuels.But, as Bonner noted, this possible collusion isn't just with the Russians the Chinese are also reportedly involved in a long-term effort to negatively impact America's energy sector. China's work against the United States also allegedly involves the NRDC. Bonner said:This relationship goes back over two decades, and consists among other things of regular visits by NRDC officials to China, where they meet with government and Communist Party officials on a regular basis Something that the [U.S. House of Representatives Resources] Committee pointed out would not be taking placed without the approval of the Chinese government.While Russia is looking to maintain and possibly grow their power using the energy resources they have, Bonner said the resource-deprived Chinese are acting more geopolitical in perspective. He highlighted how the Chinese can use the NRDC's criticism of American energy policy to their advantage by hindering expansion, and that they also benefit from the group not criticizing their own poor environmental record. The NRDC has also focused on the U.S. Navy as a threat to marine concerns (while largely overlooking Chinese naval devastation related to the build-out of the Spratly Islands).Bonner concluded:Whatever the differences there are between China and Russia, the two countries do have one thing in common. They both see, in American environmental organizations, a ready-made fifth column. One that is eager to participate in condemning U.S. use of fossil fuels. One that is perfectly willing to work with some of the worst polluters in the world. And with governments that are actually extremely hostile to the United States.As this story has unfolded, Bonner has served as an expert in articles about this potential foreign collusion against American energy policy.Load-Date: August 22, 2018End of Document

Welcome back. Thanks for joining us this morning.I'm Maria Bartiromo. Happy Thursday. It is Thursday, July 26th.Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.Facebook unfriended on Wall Street this morning. The stock is plunging on disappointing sales and revenue guidance, nearly $150 billion of market value wiped out in the after hours trading session. The stock right now down about 19 percent right now.Facebook setting the tone for the rest of the tech sector. The biggest names in technology under pressure this morning. Amazon is going to be the one to watch today. It reports after the close. Going into the numbers, the stock is down one and three-quarters percent. Check out Twitter down 3.5 percent, Snap down 4 percent.Broader markets meanwhile look like this. Dow Industrials are fine, up 30 points. But the Nasdaq taking a hit on the weakness in tech. Nasdaq down 64 points right now, almost 1 percent lower. S&P 500 down a quarter of a percent.It was a wild session on Wall Street yesterday particularly in the final hour of trading. Stocks surging in just the last 30 minutes of trading on reports of a softening trade dispute between the U.S. and the E.U. President Trump explained why it's important to get a trade deal in place. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The United States and the European Union together count for more than 830 million citizens and more than 50 percent of the global GDP. In other words, together we're more than 50 percent of trade. If we team up, we can make our planet a better, more secure and more prosperous place.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Global markets this morning reacting. We've got the CAC 40 in Paris up a third of a percent. The DAX index in Germany up better than 1 percent. The FT 100 in London up just a fraction.In Europe investors are waiting to hear from the European Central Bank. We will hear from the ECB and get a sense of when interest rates will be on the rise coming up. And we will bring that to you as soon as it hits the tape.In Asia overnight markets finished mostly lower with the exception of Korea. That was up three-quarters of a percent.And then this -- censoring conservative ideas; a startling new report says Twitter is shadow banning top Republican officials. It's not happening to Democrats. The outrage coming up this morning.Bitcoin making a comeback -- the cryptocurrency surging above $8,000 for the first time in months -- a closer look at the crypto craze this morning.And there's no such thing as a free lunch, right? Well, San Francisco is trying to take away the free food at technology companies' cafeterias. We'll tell you why.All those stories coming up this Thursday morning and joining me to break it all down: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Former NFL star and the Brewer Group CEO Jack Brewer with us this morning; and CFRA investment strategist Lindsey Bell. Great to see everybody this morning.LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA: Great to be here.JACK BREWER, CEO, BREWER GROUP: Yes. Great to be here. BARTIROMO: And the big story is Facebook this morning is down now 19 percent, Lindsey -- because people are now questioning about this 30 percent growth number that we've been seeing for so long at Facebook. Looks like that's in the rear view mirror at this point.BELL: But even declining by high single digits sequentially quarter over quarter, which is the guidance that management provided, you're still getting 20 percent --BARTIROMO: Yes.BELL: -- top line growth. Where else are you going to get that?(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Absolutely. But you have to wonder if the stock where it's trading at is equal to that kind of growth versus what else we were seeing at Facebook.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: I'll point to the Instagram stories issue, because it was in the Instagram stories -- they're not pulling in the same amount of money as ads shown in Facebook and in the Instagram feeds.And this is particularly troubling because as of next year Facebook had been predicting that the stories would have more essentially traffic than the original photo feeds on Instagram. So again, that's where they were placing their bets. Now they have to figure out a better way to monetize these Facebook stories.And they have been gaining traction. A lot of people use those rather than just kind of posting the run-of-the-mill photos and videos to their Instagram feeds. They're using those ones that disappear in 24 hours.BELL: Yes. I think Jack was posting a story earlier this morning.BARTIROMO: What were you posting?BREWER: Yes. I post the story -- I always post stories. But they're going to have to evolve that business model on the ad side when you talk about stories. I think at the end of the day you'll see over the next maybe six to 12 months they're going to start using their influencers a little bit more. I think you'll see more partnerships with influencers because those are the ones that are really driving the traffic.Even -- look at YouTube now. I mean if you go on YouTube now, a lot of those ads and those pieces they're putting out, YouTube is actually assisting the companies in producing those ads.And so these social media companies are going to have to get more hands-on with the way that they're putting the stories out, with the way that they're actually generating the content.BARTIROMO: And the news on Facebook is offsetting other positive news in terms of trade. Markets rallied on the results of a meeting yesterday with the European Commission's Mr. Juncker and President Trump.Joining us right now on the telephone is LJH Investment Advisers managing director Larry Haverty. Larry -- thanks very much for calling in this morning. Your reaction to Facebook?LARRY HAVERTY, MANAGING DIRECTOR, LJH INVESTMENT ADVISERS: (INAUDIBLE)BARTIROMO: Larry -- unfortunately, you're going in and out. We're not hearing you well. Obviously, you're on a cell phone. We would love to get your insights on this.But of course, $150 billion in lost market value in the after hours trading session is what people are reacting to today. Was it an overreaction in your view?BELL: No, I mean I think this has been a high flier. It was up 25 percent going into this press (ph). There were high expectations. And you know, we got lucky in the first quarter.The Cambridge Analytica scandal was not -- you didn't see it in the numbers. Now you're seeing it in the numbers. There are repercussions for this type of activity. And there's --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Especially as they invest more in privacy tools. That's going to cost money.BELL: Exactly.MCDOWELL: But it's maybe short-term loss for a long-term gain. These are problems that have to get fixed if Facebook wants to retain this giant user base that it has and continue to grow and monetize. The people are using say WhatsApp and Instagram.But to shine a spotlight on what the stock is doing, shares hit an all-time high yesterday --BELL: Yes.MCDOWELL: -- and so in less than 24 hours essentially, it's gone into bear market territory with almost down 20 percent.BARTIROMO: Left it all out.MCDOWELL: That is so astonishing to see that. And it is -- it's a lesson to people when you invest in a company, a stock that has a really high valuation on it, you better be in for the long haul. You could lose -- if you're going to sell today you could lose 28 percent of whatever you put in yesterday.BARTIROMO: The "Journal" story was great, going through the tick tock of the conference call and sort of what, you know, Sheryl Sandberg said versus Mark Zuckerberg versus the CFO.MCDOWELL: Zuckerberg saying Instagram has been this amazing success and highlighting. And then Sheryl Sandberg comes on and --BARTIROMO: Awesome.MCDOWELL: -- everything. Yes, "The Lego Movie", "everything is awesome". And then the CFO comes on. Leave it to the money guy to be fair (INAUDIBLE) and go, well, I've got a couple of bombs I'm about to drop on you," 20 minutes into this conference call. . It's not funny. It's not funny.But there were a lot of problem areas that the finance chief highlighted.BARTIROMO: And that certainly is setting the tone for technology this morning. Facebook right now down 20 percent.And then there's this, Trump talking tariffs. President Trump off to Illinois this morning to talk workforce development and tour a steel factory that's reopened as a result of his tariff regulations.Just in the last hour I spoke with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross who touted the President's tough stance on steel and aluminum tariffs. Here's what he told me this morning.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WILBUR ROSS, U.S. SECRETARY OF COMMERCE: So steel and aluminum, there's no intention to abandon those industries. So the President is very happy with the progress they have made in opening new facilities. I'm joining him today as we go out to visit one that had just recently been reopened. He's not going to do anything to destroy steel and aluminum from their new-found substance.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: And yet, it's a double edged sword. Both Coca-Cola and General Motors will be raising prices they say on their iconic products in large part because of the fallout over tariffs.Joining me right now is Ambassador Paul Wolfowitz. He is former deputy secretary of Defense, former ambassador to Indonesia and former assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific Affairs. Ambassador -- good to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining me.PAUL WOLFOWITZ, FORMER AMBASSADOR TO INDONESIA: Nice to be here -- Maria.BARTIROMO: Your reaction to Secretary Ross' notion that the steel and aluminum tariffs are remaining intact. The markets rallied hugely last night on this idea that the E.U. and the U.S. are going to work toward no tariffs but we know that the aluminum and steel tariffs are still in place.WOLFOWITZ: And I think they're hurting some of our best friends including Japan pretty badly.BARTIROMO: So your thoughts on this strategy that the President has. You know, he comes into this saying ok, we lost $151 billion with the E.U. We lost you know, $500 billion with China. We want a more level playing field.And do you think this is all a negotiation, that at the end of the day maybe the U.S. comes out in a better place as it seems like the markets are viewing this?WOLFOWITZ: Well, I certainly hope so because there's no question, we need a more level playing field. But we could end up with a very, very rocky one instead if this escalates.BARTIROMO: Because the President and the European Commission president Mr. Juncker yesterday came out very positive and discussed that they are going to have a breakthrough in trade talks to avoid a transatlantic trade war. The two leaders agreeing to hold off on further tariffs signaling a pause in the President's auto tariff threat. Ambassador -- could zero tariffs with Europe become a reality in your view?WOLFOWITZ: It will certainly surprise me if it happens but it would be a good thing.BARTIROMO: What is your take in terms of what's happening in terms of a cease fire when it comes to China? President Xi issuing a stark threat to President Trump claiming that there would be no winner in a global trade war.Your reaction to President Xi's comments? What does yesterday's deal between the U.S. and Europe mean for China?WOLFOWITZ: I think it puts more pressure on China. And the issue with China is not so much about the tariffs although they're relevant. But the real issue with China is the way it's been stealing intellectual property here, not only by forcing companies to reveal what they have but also by cyber methods, breaking into corporate secrets. I think it's a very, very dangerous trend that they've been on.BARTIROMO: Yes.WOLFOWITZ: And I think it's good to be opposing them.BARTIROMO: So you're glad in terms of the pushback from America to China in terms of the consistent theft of intellectual property?WOLFOWITZ: If it doesn't get out of control -- but my sense is from Xi's comments is he's much more worried about where it could go than we are.BARTIROMO: Yes.Ambassador, let me move on to the President's bilateral meeting with Vladimir Putin. National security adviser John Bolton citing special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation for a delay issuing this statement. "The President believes that the next bilateral meeting with President Putin should take place after the Russia witch hunt is over. So we've agreed that it will be after the first of the year."How do you expect the U.S. policy toward Russia moving forward and any thoughts on the President's foreign policy decisions?WOLFOWITZ: You know, one of the ironies here is that Putin has obviously succeeded in sowing enormous dissension in the United States over our own political process which is one of his goals. But he's actually ended up with a Russia policy that is probably much tougher than he might have had otherwise and may even get tougher still.BARTIROMO: So you think that -- then, I guess that's a positive in your view?WOLFOWITZ: Positive that the meeting's postponed? Absolutely. But what I would like to see more talk about is measures like this Magnitsky Act that put pressure on Russian plutocrats to make it much more difficult for them to hide their money here and to launder it.And the British (INAUDIBLE) something called the unexplained wealth orders which are now putting a lot of pressure on probably Russians, but maybe other people as well, who are buying expensive property in London through offshore shell companies to hide it. That's a real threat to Putin and his clique.BARTIROMO: Yes, right. That's why he's apparently going after Bill Browder, who of course, it was Bill Browder's lawyer Mr. Magnitsky who was killed in jail and he was able to get the Magnitsky Act.Let me ask you about Secretary of State Mike Pompeo yesterday testifying in front of the Senate foreign relations committee facing a barrage of questions aimed at U.S. policy on Russia and on North Korea. Pompeo vowed that the U.S. will not relax sanctions towards Russia but said that we cannot make progress with Moscow unless we're open to discussions. Listen to this clip from yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: President Trump believes the two great nuclear powers should not have a contentious relationship. This is not just in our interest but in the interest of the whole world.He strongly believes that now is the time for direct communication in our relationship in order to make clear to President Putin that there is the possibility, however remote it might be, to reverse the negative course of our relationship. Otherwise, the administration will continue imposing tough actions against Russia in response to its malign activities.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Ambassador, it looked like Mr. Pompeo did well yesterday. Anything strike you from that testimony?WOLFOWITZ: Well, I certainly agree with that second part of keeping up the pressure.I mean it's worth noting, Maria, that when President Reagan was negotiating with the old Soviet Union, he didn't let up the pressure on Poland which was one of their weak spots. And even more impressively when he was working closely with General Secretary Gorbachev to get an arms control agreement that was very important to everybody he made that famous statement about "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall." So he kept the pressure up in Berlin.I think the only way you get anywhere with people like Putin is by having pressure on them. If you just try to do it by being nice it never works.BARTIROMO: Yes, for sure. Ambassador -- it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much.WOLFOWITZ: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Paul Wolfowitz joining us there.We'll take a break. When we come back, bitcoin is bouncing back. The cryptocurrency jumping above $8,000 for the first time in two months. What's behind the recent gains -- coming up.Then Twitter's shadow ban -- why some prominent conservatives are now failing to appear in search results on the social media platform. We've got the story and the fallout, coming up.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Breaking news -- two police officers killed in the line of duty.Cheryl Casone with the details now and headlines -- Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWOR CORRESPONDENT: We're getting some new details, Maria, on this breaking news. This happened in Milwaukee. A 17- year police veteran was shot and killed by a suspect who was wanted on gun and drug violations. They do have that suspect in custody now. A procession of officers escorted the fallen officer's body to the medical examiner's office. Look at these incredible pictures.This is the second death of a Milwaukee police officer just this summer. What a show of support.Meanwhile in Arizona, one officer was shot and killed and the other was injured. This happened last night there. The officers responding to a call about a man driving erratically on the roads.Well, New York is keeping its promise to 9/11 victims' families 17 years later. Through improved DNA testing the medical examiner's office has identified the 1,642nd victim of that terror attack.Scott Michael Johnson was 26 years old. He was working for the investment banking firm Keefe, Bruyette and Woods. He was on the 89th floor of the South Tower. The bone belonging to Johnson had been tested dozens of times throughout the years but recent improvements allowed examiners to gain enough DNA evidence to make that match. Johnson -- the first victim to be identified since august of last year.Well, Mattel is cutting costs and they're cutting jobs. The company slashing 2,200 jobs as they continue to struggle with falling sales after reporting weak and unexpected quarterly results. Mattel, which is of course, well-known for making Barbie and Hot Wheels, also hurt by the closing of Toys R Us which happened recently this year. Shares of Mattel, Maria, are trading lower in the premarket -- ok, a lot lower, down by 11 percent. There you go.BARTIROMO: Big move there, cutting 2,200 jobs and the stock takes a hit.CASONE: Which is -- usually it's the opposite we see. That's not good for that company.BARTIROMO: Thank you -- Cheryl.Coming up, bitcoin bouncing back this morning, the cryptocurrency jumping above 8,000 for the first time in two months. What's behind that big gain, coming up.Then, no such thing as a free lunch, right. Why San Francisco is now looking to ban free cafeterias at technology companies -- one of the best perks there is.Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Bitcoin optimism is back. The cryptocurrency reaching over $8,000 a token for the first time since May. Ripple chief market strategist Cory Johnson joins us now to talk more about that. Cory -- it's great to see you.CORY JOHNSON, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, RIPPLE: Good to see you too.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. What do you make of this recent move higher on bitcoin? And tell us how you see the overall market? Because you're really much more bullish on XRP as opposed to bitcoin.JOHNSON: Yes. Well, I think -- I think for us, you know, Ripple has based some of our software solutions on XRP because we think it's a better technology. We look at XRP as sort of block chain 2.0.The bitcoin is a fascinating idea but it's really sort of breaking down in terms of its ability to use it, closing transaction is really slow. We're looking at a business problem. And the business problem is moving money across borders.It is crazy that today I can send a text message to a friend in Rome with emojis and a gif of falling down and clever stuff and I can send an Excel spreadsheet by e-mail to South Africa in 3 seconds. But if I want to move money from New York to Mexico City it takes five days and costs over 500 basis points.BARTIROMO: Wow.JOHNSON: That's crazy in this era of technology. So Ripple has created a bunch of software products to really accelerate that process, to move money in less than a minute and for, you know, just basis points. But using XRP as a basis technology for some of the software solutions we can move it so much cheaper and so much more efficiently using XRP. We think that XRP will have great value over time.BELL: What about consumers? Mastercard just applied for a patent to be able to use cryptocurrencies on credit cards.JOHNSON: Right.BELL: Is that the future of currencies?JOHNSON: I mean we are 100 percent focused on business. I mean I think that there will be lots of better ways for money to move but again, when you talk about moving money, bitcoin's slow. Ether is slow. XRP moves really, really fast just because of the way the technology is a little bit different.I don't want to give you the technological details but fundamentally money should move as fast as ideas move as fast as data moves. And right now it doesn't. And it's really expensive.The place that money hurts -- that slow-moving money hurts people is moving money across borders. If you are working and your family is in another country, if you're on vacation in another country, if you're a business and you want to buy products in another country to sell it where you are, it takes so long to move money and costs so much money.Imagine if your business is selling (ph) with 500 basis points -- the World Bank says it's a 532-basis point cost to move money across borders for anyone. That's a horrible drag on business. We're trying to fix that.MCDOWELL: What about the regulatory hurdles and head winds country by country in terms of are they rising because again, we talk about no borders in terms of virtual currencies but there are borders and regulators love to make sure that even in the digital world that those borders exist.JOHNSON: Look, one person's regulation is another person's protection.MCDOWELL: Right.JOHNSON: I believe it's really important for investors to be protected. We've seen what happens when there aren't investor protections. We've seen investors lose so much money. And we've seen it in the world of crypto. We've seen some real bad actors involved.So we're thrilled that regulators are getting involved. It's really interesting. It's not what I expected when I joined this company say six months ago and we're very much engaged in conversations with regulators.But I'll say that a lot of other countries are moving faster than the U.S. to try to provide really clear lanes of where business can act, what's right and what's wrong.BARTIROMO: Like China.JOHNSON: Well, China's a really peculiar case. Most of the bitcoin mining, most of the ether mining is all taking place in places where power is cheap, which is China; and where they've got the access to the best computer chips, which is China. And so China -- most bitcoin is mined in China. Most ether is mined in China.XRP isn't being mined. It was pre-mined, if you will. So as a result it uses virtually no power when it's, you know, compared to these other things. Running a node in the network is so much cheaper as a result. And there isn't any mining cost with that. So it's a different kind of technology as a result.But countries like Singapore, countries like Switzerland, countries like Thailand are working really hard to make sure that businesses develop there around block chain. The U.S. is starting to do some things. The SEC has started to try to figure some things out.BARTIROMO: Yes.JOHNSON: But other countries aren't waiting and the entrepreneurs aren't waiting to start business.BARTIROMO: really exciting opportunity.Cory -- thanks so much for joining us.JOHNSON: It's so good to see you.BARTIROMO: You, too. Great to have you -- Cory Johnson.MCDOWELL: We've known you a lot of years -- Cory Johnson.JOHNSON: We're not that old? Come on.MCDOWELL: No, we're not.BARTIROMO: And you're still innovating.JOHNSON: Go figure.BARTIROMO: Cory Johnson.Coming up, Twitter's shadow ban -- some prominent conservatives are now failing to appear in search results on the social media platform. We've got the story and the fall out coming next.And then fighting free lunches -- why two San Francisco lawmakers are trying to do away with free cafeterias at Silicon Valley technology companies. The story coming up.Back in a minute.MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Welcome back. Good Thursday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us this morning. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Thursday, July 26th. Your top stories right now, 07:31 a.m. on the East Coast.Facebook unfriended by investors this morning, take a look at the stock, plummeting better than 20 percent. The company taking a hit after reporting disappointing sales and revenue guidance, the conference call had lots of expectations and they fell short.It is just the tip of the iceberg for technology. We've got Amazon and Intel reporting this afternoon, those are the two to watch today. Amazon with some high expectations there, going into the quarter down 1-3/4 percent going in to the numbers.Futures this morning, indicating a mix opening. The Dow Industrials are up 36 points right now but the NASDAQ is down 58 points as technology takes a hit on the Facebook news.The markets ending the day yesterday higher. Tensions over trade disputes between the U.S. and the E.U. ease as the president spoke with the European Commission President Mr. Juncker and said they are going to work toward an agreement toward zero tariffs. Markets rallied on that. Dow Industrials finished up 172 points. The NASDAQ was up 91.In Europe this morning, take a look at the indices, money is moving into stocks. The DAX Index up better than one percent. No real agreement on autos and yet the DAX Index in Germany quite strong today, up better than one percent. CAC Quarante up quarter of a percent. The FT-100 unchanged as the European markets await the European Central Bank news this morning.Asian markets closing mostly in the red overnight. Take a look, the KOSPI was up three quarters of one percent.President Trump on Twitter declaring a big day for free and fair trade after his meeting with the European Commission president. The president said that the goal would be zero tariffs. I spoke with U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross earlier this morning to get his take.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WILBUR ROSS, SECRETARY, U.S. COMMERCE: Well, you notice on light trucks, there was an exception for automotive products. It said we'd work towards zero tariffs on nonautomotive industrial products. Steel and aluminum, there's no attention to abandon those industries.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, Twitter accused of hiding conservative voices in the search results at the company. The company taking heat this morning for so-called "shadow banning." We will tell you all about it with the details coming up.Then, local businesses are up in arms in San Francisco over free lunches at technology companies. They want to force workers to pay up, leave campus to get food and pay for it. The controversy, coming up.We're in the middle of the summer blockbuster season where there are big movies, there is IMAX. We are checking in to see surprises the company's got in store for movie goers. We'll check in with the IMAX CEO on earnings and what's ahead.All that coming up, but first, Facebook shares, falling out of bed this morning, that's for sure. The stock down 20 percent on news from the company's earnings report which basically opened up the idea that growth is slowing down at Facebook as they invest more in security and privacy tools.Joining us right now on the telephone is Arete senior analyst Richard Kramer. Richard, great to have you this morning. Thanks for joining us. Your reaction to the Facebook news yesterday?RICHARD KRAMER, SENIOR ANALYST, ARETE (via telephone): Well, I think we had already had a growth slowdown from extremely high levels in our numbers. I don't think that was a big surprise. The biggest surprise was that Facebook is extremely happy to continue spending the kind of money it does, both on cap-ex, on staff growth, on buybacks and so forth.BARTIROMO: But -- I mean, when you look at the kind of growth numbers that we've been accustomed to at Facebook, 30 percent revenue growth, are those days now in the rear view mirror? Is that the issue here that we're not going to see the kind of growth that we expected in the past?KRAMER: I think you need to put this in the context of the law of large numbers. And Facebook ended last year at a $40 billion company. And finding an incremental 50 percent growth on top of that, which is the clip that they were running at last year, is -- you know, finding another $20 billion of advertising revenue and that's just simply a very hard to do.LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA: Richard, Lindsey Bell here. Interesting, revenue per user was actually up, which I thought was kind of a highlight, if you could find one. But the real question we've talked about all morning is Instagram, this is supposed to be the growth engine for the company going forward. How are they going to monetize it? They've kind of lagged there. What do you see going forward with that?KRAMER: I mean, Instagram is incredibly powerful platform. And if you look at brand like, Nike, that has 80 million followers on Instagram, where else will it be able to tap into a global audience to directly market its products to? I wouldn't be overly concerned about that transition. That's something that we've written about earlier this year. I think there's also another important narrative which is Facebook is desperate to avoid regulation, by showing -- saying that they're going to invest more and show lower margins, they're creating a sort of oh, woe is me narrative around the stock that hopefully will keep for them regulators at day.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Richard, it's Dagen McDowell on Instagram, it's not the feeds per say and the ad revenue that that pulls in, it was the ad revenue generated on the Instagram stories because Facebook has predicted that activity on those stories, those photos and videos that disappear after 24 hours, would eclipse the time spent just scrolling through feeds next year. How can they better monetize the ads that are -- and activity in Instagram stories. What do you expect them to do?KRAMER: Well, I think what you're -- I think what you're pointing out is that story's clearly is a new format and they're transitioning to it and they're willing to take the pain clearly as a company with $42 billion of cash. They can absorb quite a bit of that pain. I think you have to give them some time. Because the next thing that will clearly be coming on Instagram is shoppable icons that -- it will turn into -- rapidly turn into an e-commerce platform alongside stories.So, there's a lot of directions they can take Instagram. The focus right now is on this transition to stories. But that overlooks a whole range of other options that they have with the platform.BARTIROMO: Would you buy the stock right here at 173 and change?KRAMER: Well, we're obviously not supposed to talk about our ratings on the air but we are -- we have a -- we have a positive view on the stock. I don't think that -- I don't think Facebook's days are completely over because they're planning to spend more money. I think if you look out three, five years, and ask yourself will the platforms that they have still be as relevant? It's main Facebook may not be as relevant but Instagram may be a lot more relevant.BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there. Richard, good to see you. Thanks so much for joining the conversation this morning.KRAMER: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Richard Kramer joining us.Turning now to Twitter being under fire. The social media company facing backlash for reportedly restricting the visibility of top Republicans, but not Democrats, in its search results. The technique is called shadow banning. And according to the Vice News, people like RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel do not appear in Twitter's auto populated dropdown search box on the site.McDaniel twitted about it yesterday writing this, the notion that social media companies could suppress certain political points of view should concern every American. Twitter owns the public -- owes the public answers to what's really going on.Joining us right now is Caldwell Strategic Consulting founder and Fox News political analyst Gianno Caldwell. Gianno, good to see you. Thank you so much for joining us. What do you think is going on?GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Good morning. Thank you for having me.BARTIROMO: What's your take on this, Gianno?CALDWELL: Well, I mean, this comes as no surprise to me and many other conservatives. You think about what happened with Diamond and Silk with (INAUDIBLE) members of congress being impacted by Facebook and other social media networks who don't like the political speech of conservatives, it's fairly problematic. We've seen hearings on this on Capitol Hill. I think that it's now time for members of congress to take a deeper look and begin to put regulations on these companies that do this, that really try to interfere with the equitable actions of every American.So, whereas as you can be Louis Farrakhan and not be shadow banned or impacted in any way, who obviously uses forms of hate speech or you can be Madonna and threaten the president of the United States in ways. These individuals still have a social media presence that's glowing for their viewers.So, why is it that conservatives who talk about being pro life, who talk about other capitalism, why is it that they're being shadow banned? This is problematic on many levels and it's something that congress must take a deeper look, a heightened look, I think.BARTIROMO: You know when we had Kevin McCarthy on and other Republican congressmen, they all said that -- you know, you don't want necessarily the government to come in and start being big government on companies, right? I don't think anybody wants that because we are in a free market. What you would like to see is competition come in and we'll see if this leads to that. Because, obviously, there's an issue here. If Twitter is going to censor conservative ideas.MCDOWELL: One issue is -- and that's why Facebook is spending so much money on privacy, that's why they're dedicating themselves to improving the protections on the platform. And they've been accused of censor -- obviously, censoring conservative content as well.But that's -- but they understand the danger of regulation. Or they're beginning to understand that.But in terms of the problem that you expressed with Ronna McDaniel, it's still apparent, like this is something that Twitter could fix in spontaneously. If you put the name Ronna in the search, Ronna's got a verified Twitter account. But instead, the first results, if you put Ronna in, you get somebody who has a verified account with a few thousand followers, not 85,000 like Ronna McDaniel. You get somebody with a verified account with a few hundred.And by the way, I follow a lot of conservatives on Twitter and they follow me back but they're not giving me that search result. That's something that Twitter could easily fix and so far they haven't done it.BARTIROMO: No, they haven't.JACK BREWER, CEO, THE BREWER GROUP: So, Gianno, this is Jack Brewer. What can influencers do, conservative minded influencers, what can we do to really push forward this messaging? Because at the end of the day, these social media companies are dependent upon influencers. That's where people are going, that's who they're following. And so, you know, I'm just trying to figure out, come up with an idea on what steps we can take to make our voices bigger?CALDWELL: You know, interestingly enough, I think especially when it comes to the shadow banning issue, there's been a lot of folks that have spoken up. That's the reason why we had those big hearings on Capitol Hill. You saw Diamond and Silk actually on Capitol Hill in a hearing where we had this discussion. Many of these social media companies have said that they were taking steps to correct this. But you continue to see the same issue pop up time and time again.When we have the president of the United States who's a -- the biggest government leader using this service. And we know that there's other government leaders who've been shadow banned as well, members of congress, that's when it's necessities.In my view, of course, we don't like regulation, competition is great, but this is something that the government is fully using. This is a -- this is a spear where public dialogue is happening on a regular basis. So yes, it's great to have competition but it will take a while before competition is able to compete with that kind of search profile, these social media sites.BARTIROMO: Right.CALDWELL: So, yes, this is the time I think that we should be going in and talking about listen, if you're not going to correct this, you made claims time and time again, there should be some form of a penalty because there's voices that are seriously being silenced.MCDOWELL: Just really quick, Jack Dorsey has been meeting privately a lot of conservative thought leaders and having a lot of discussions. But that talk needs to turn into a walk in terms of the policies and the way that Twitter is actually managed.BARTIROMO: And it hasn't.MCDOWELL: Right.BARTIROMO: It has not. Gianno, good to get your insight. Thanks so much.CALDWELL: Thank you.BARTIROMO: We'll see you soon. Gianno Caldwell there.Coming up, no such thing as a free lunch, right? Well, why San Francisco is now looking to ban free lavish cafeterias at technology companies, one of the best perks for tech workers, that story coming up.Then, pump up the volume. We are going deeper into the ultimate high quality movie going experience with the CEO of IMAX, coming up.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A move to ban free lunches at technology company cafeterias in an attempt to support local restaurants. Gerri Willis with the details now, Gerri.GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria. That's right. If you are one of the thousands of San Francisco workers used to enjoying a free lunch every day at work, get ready for a change. The city's Board of Supervisors wants to ban the free lunch, saying it hurts local restaurants. Look, even the restaurants say they can't compete.Free lunches are a perk at big tech companies and offered by the likes of Google, Twitter, but also Levi Strauss. That's an old one. There are 51 such employee cafeterias in San Francisco. One supporter of the law banning in house cafeterias said this "We don't want employees biking or driving to their office, staying there all day and going home. This is about getting people out of their office."However, if the law is passive and only applied a new companies putting a cafeteria is not existing once. Well, the proposals in usual, it's not without president. Nearby Mountain View, California barred Facebook from subsidizing on-site meals for 2,000 workers for the tech company offices. Says one San Francisco restaurant to -- restaurant tour that it's hard to compete with free.BARTIROMO: So what? I mean, companies are allowed to offer their employees whatever they want. I mean, this is basically to me big government telling companies how to do their business.WILLIS: Or just mouthy small government, right?BARTIROMO: Yes.WILLIS: It's a board of supervisors here.BARTIROMO: Right, a board of supervisors. Local city supervisors telling technology companies how to pay their employees. That's a perk that companies have a right to give.BREWER: And what about the food service companies, right? They're most the -- most of them are outsourcing us. So you have you know, major food service companies now that are going to be losing contracts and it makes no sense. Another thing, why don't they just charge them a quarter, come eat a full meal, a quarter.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's good. Then the local restaurants will have to compete with that.BREWER: Exactly.MCDOWELL: Why, I can't figure out why some of these companies haven't moved to more free market cities? I know that all the talent is in Silicon Valley and in San Francisco.WILLIS: Well, they have moved south, right?MCDOWELL: And some of them have moved to Texas which is a no income tax state, maybe even -- I know, I think Zappos is based in Las Vegas, of all places. But that's owned by Amazon.But I'll point out, again, it's because these bureaucrats think they know better --BARTIROMO: Right.MCDOWELL: -- than people who have created some of the greatest companies in the history of America.BARTIROMO: That's why they're getting the (INAUDIBLE) that they're getting. Because they got all these perks. So what? They're allowed.WILLIS: What if you're an employee of one of these companies and city hall saying we're going to take this away from you. I would really be pissed. Is this really going to help them? I don't think so. This is exactly like the big debate three years ago over busses, Google busses. Local groups complained hey, this is texploitation. They're there ganking up major arteries in the city.By the way, it was free to the city to transport Google employees. They didn't have to pay for city busses --BARTIROMO: You're right.WILLIS: -- to get people anywhere.BARTIROMO: It's incredible. I think we all agree.MCDOWELL: Listen, I lived in San Francisco --BELL: Keep out of the business.MCDOWELL: -- for less than a year and I hated it for that very reason.WILLIS: We were there at the same time.MCDOWELL: Yes, we we're there at the same --BARTIROMO: City officials -- City officials trying to tell businesses how to run their businesses. Gerri, thank you.WILLIS: You're welcome.BARTIROMO: Speaking of technology, President Trump is just tweeting this, he says this, Twitter shadow banning prominent Republicans, not good. We will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once. Many complaints.Yes, we were just talking about this, obviously. We're going to take a short break. When we come back, blockbusters on the big, big screen.I'm talking to the CEO of IMAX next hour about his company's high quality theater experience and summer movie going surprises. Back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Wow. What a clip, that was a clip from "Mission: Impossible- Fallout". The sixth installment of the wildly successful franchise of "Mission Impossible". The Tom Cruise led blockbuster is the latest IMAX offering. It hit screens nationwide tomorrow -- tonight.IMAX meanwhile, reporting second quarter earnings last night in earnings per share $00.30 on 98.3 million revenue. EPS beating expectations with revenue narrowly missing expectations.Joining us right now is the CEO of IMAX, Richard Gelfond. Richard, it's great to see you.RICHARD GELFOND, CEO, IMAX: Great to see you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us.GELFOND: I'm happy to be here.BARTIROMO: Good quarter.GELFOND: Very good quarter.BARTIROMO: What drove the quarter?GELFOND: Well, first of all, the second quarter was the highest box office quarter in the history of the movie business.BARTIROMO: Wow.GELFOND: Somewhat surprising, people think it's somewhat stagnant industry but it's actually still growing. And IMAX's case, what we do is global blockbusters. So, a large majority of our revenues were international. We did over $100 million in China in box office, over $100 million domestically and over $100 million in the rest of the world. We were firing on all cylinders. I think the public has an appetite for these blockbusters in a premium way and that's where IMAX's fits.BARTIROMO: That's really important information that you're giving us. Because the international story is such an important growth story for so many companies, IMAX included. You haven't been caught up in this tariff fight with China.GELFOND: No, we haven't. You know, I don't think we will either. And some of the reasons for that, Maria, are it's been a very good relationship between Hollywood and China. So Hollywood's made a lot of money exporting its films to China. We have a separate public company in China that's worth over $1 billion, a big business. We do a big part of the Chinese box office. And for the Chinese, they're portrayed in a different way than they were years ago.So, they're not the bad guys anymore and they're not -- you know, the communist enemies. They're portrayed, you look at movies like "The Martian" or you look at movies like "The Great Wall", in a very favorable way. So, I don't think China wants to poke an eye at Hollywood right now. I don't think that works.BARTIROMO: Did you have to give up any of your technology, did you have to give up any of the secrets of IMAX in order to get your company -- you know, in a foothold in China?GELFOND: We didn't. And we didn't -- initially, we didn't grow with Chinese partners. We did it ourselves. On the other hand though, we had an ugly episode about seven or eight years ago where someone, a former employee stole some of our technology and they were backed by the Chinese government. And it was drawn out.So, you know, I think the government has something there when they talk about protecting the theft of I.P. And I think China's a real world power now. They're not a disrupter. They're the status quo. They have more engineers than anyone graduating in the world. And I think they have to be part of the world community and protect I.P.BARTIROMO: The best part of IMAX is the experience. That's why you're seeing the growth you are in Saudi Arabia. In China you're looking at building and expanding, throughout the Middle East.Tell us what's on top in terms of the big movies and also what you're expecting in terms of the Middle East and where the growth comes from next.GELFOND: Well, Saudi Arabia is a promising market. It just opened up to cinema a few months ago. And we are the second theater -- commercial theater ever in Saudi Arabia with Vox, AMC opened the first commercial theater there. India's a very big growth market for us now. We have -- I think, 35 theaters in the Middle East today. They love the Western movies.BARTIROMO: Wow, fantastic.GELFOND: "Black Panther" played amazing in the Middle East.BARTIROMO: That did very well. And I know you have "Aqua Man" coming up, you've got the Fantastics.GELFOND: "Fantastic Beasts".BARTIROMO: The "Fantastic Beasts".BARTIROMO: "Ant-Man".BARTIROMO: Richard, you're going to be our special guest this weekend in Wall Street. We'll see you soon. Thank you so much. Richard --BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Thursday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us this morning. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Thursday, July 26th.Load-Date: July 26, 2018End of Document

The countries each have tariffs on $50 billion worth of imports from each other. If the US imposes the tariffs, China will be unable to respond in what so far has been a tit-for-tat trade dispute as its imports of US goods falls short of that level. Several news reports indicated the new tariffs, if imposed, would be 10%, down from the original percentage set last month of 25%. The US and China last week said they'd start negotiations to end their ongoing and escalating trade dispute, but China has reportedly said if the US moves forward with new tariffs, it would walk away from the negotiating table.

In an interview with newspaper NZZ am Sonntag published on Sunday, CEO Tidjane Thiam said that the bank has left its past behind and it's business as usual. "For the future our goal is business as usual," Thiam said. "For the next two years a profit of between 5 and 6 billion francs is realistic." Thiam also said that the bank projects profits to be "a little lower" in 2018 as the company struggles with high financing costs. "That's due to our capital raising during the financial crisis," he added. Technology Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) was down 0.7% and other tech funds iShares Dow Jones US Technology ETF (IYW), iShares S&P North American Technology ETF (IGM) and iShares S&P North American Technology-Software Index (IGV) were in the red. Among semiconductor ETFs, SPDR S&P Semiconductor (XSD) was down 0.8% and Semiconductor Sector Index Fund (SOXX) was down 0.6%. Amazon.com (AMZN) slipped more than 2% after it said it had rolled out an initiative to bolster online shopping from small businesses as the company looks to promote the growing sector of sellers using the e-commerce giant's platform to reach consumers.

Exploring Chinaâ€™s Social Media Landscape: Digital Revolution or Revolutionizing Digital?News Release WireSeptember 14, 2018 Friday Copyright 2018 Broadcast Interview Source, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 744 wordsBodyBy Huong Cao,George Mason UniversityD.C.-based Social Drivers co-founder and chief strategy officer Anthony Shop, who was awarded an Eisenhower Fellowship to study digital and social media trends in China, shared his first-hand observations with marketers, communicators and China watchers on Sept. 12 at George Washington University in Washington, D.C.In a lecture titled 'China: Digital Revolution or Revolutionizing Digital?.", Shop discussed the impact of the digital revolution on China and what we can learn from it, by sharing stories of Chinas Great Wall and The Silk Road, which are two familiar, well-known images of China. According to Shop, the story of modern or future China can also be viewed through the lens of a wall and a road: The Great Firewall of China and One Belt, One Road Initiative, respectively.The Great Firewall of China, which can be an impolite term in the country, represents the tool the Chinese government, which strongly advocates for Internet governance, uses to regulate the Internet domestically and to prevent Chinese citizens from accessing some foreign websites. The One Belt, One Road Initiative is Chinas modern-day version of The Silk Road, or can be seen as an ambitious branding campaign that the leadership of China has greatly invested in to extend the countrys economic and cultural influence. These are two important factors that make the digital landscape in China more complex and underline major differences between the American and Chinese digital landscapes.The first major difference, noted Shop, was media centralization. He brought up CCTV, which is China Central Television, as a symbol of the centralization of information and power in the Communist Party, which provides guidelines based on socialist values. To illustrate, Chinese newspapers promote the One Belt, One Road Initiative with ads, and the Communist Partys slogan and information are displayed through out-of-home advertising. Chinas media landscape is greatly shaped by this centralization, which also means that there is little direct communication between policymakers and the public, such as what we have here in the U.S. on social media. In addition, there is little to no government regulation of paid sponsors, while government regulation of content is enforced by technology platforms. China also has the '50-Cent Party.", which is an informal term for paid Internet commentators, who are responsible for monitoring public opinion to the benefit of the Communist Party.In addition to '50-Cent Party.", Shop also discussed other Chinese terms regarding the use of influencer engagement a tactic in Chinas and U.S converging media. He said that those we consider as influencers are called 'key opinion leaders." (KOLs) in China. Influencers or KOLs are whom brands want to share their messages with, as they can convey brand messages to the audiences they have built. As we live in a world of converging media, Shop suggested making people the center of what they do, rather than their brands. In addition, 'We Media." is a Chinese term for what we call 'bloggers." or 'Youtube stars.". 'We Media." represents the idea that someone else, not an authorized centrally controlled media organization, fills an audience and gets to distribute his or her content which can be seen as a threat to traditional media in both U.S. and China.Shop shared that one of the misconceptions before coming to China as a Fellow was the assumption that China platforms like Weibo and WeChat were parallels to Twitter and Facebook. In reality, he said, social media apps in China are very different. While Facebook is a single-use mobile app used as a tool to connect people, WeChat can serve multiple purposes, including in-store payments, online shopping, transportation and much more.Shops lecture presented the audiences with interesting views about Chinas social media landscape. But, moreover, he also provided practical lessons by highlighting the rise of influencers and the necessity of content moderation which raises an important but controversial question in our current media environment: Who would take on the responsibility of monitoring content: Our government, Facebook or us social media users?(Shop will be doing aa similar presentation for PRSA-NCC on October 25 and you can registerhttps://www.prsa-ncc.org/global-marketing-communications-what-pr-pros-should-know-about-chinas-digital-revolutionherehttp://www.Newsreleasewire.com/161960Load-Date: September 15, 2018End of Document

PRESS: Google Employees Protest Plans For Censored China AppLive Briefs PRO Global MarketsAugust 17, 2018 Friday 2:02 AM ESTCopyright 2018 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 393 wordsBody Google employees have written a letter calling on bosses to reveal more about alleged plans to launch a censored search engine in China, according to media reports on Thursday.Google, part of Alphabet Inc, refused to comment on reports earlier this month that it is building an Android search app that would comply with Beijing's strict censorship rules and is due to be launched in the next six to nine months pending Chinese government approval.The app would ban information related to human rights, democracy and religion - topics censored by China's so-called Great Firewall.On Thursday, investigative news website The Intercept reported that Google staff have circulated a letter arguing that the project, codenamed "Dragonfly," raises "urgent moral and ethical issues."The letter calls on the internet giant's leadership to recognize a "code yellow situation," an internal alert that signifies that a crisis is unfolding, according to The Intercept.The employees argued that they could be unwittingly violating the company's ethics code, which states that it will not build or deploy technology whose purpose contravenes human rights.Only a few hundred of Google's 88,000 employees had been briefed about Dragonfly, the Intercept reported."Currently we do not have the information required to make ethically-informed decisions about our work, our projects, and our employment," the employees wrote."We urgently need more transparency, a seat at the table, and a commitment to clear and open processes: Google employees need to know what we're building," the letter added.Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment from dpa.The search engine plans have also drawn criticism from rights organizations including Amnesty International, which called the earlier reports "alarming."The effort to write the letter was partly led by the same group of employees who recently protested against a Google contract with the US military to create technology to speed up analysis of drone footage.The company subsequently allowed the contract to lapse.Google withdrew from China in 2010 in response to the country's censorship but has more recently made inroads into the Chinese market by opening an artificial intelligence centre and launching a game. China has the world's largest online market, with 772 million internet users.By dpa correspondentsLoad-Date: August 18, 2018End of Document

CHINA'S BID TO SILENCE POET HIGHLIGHTS 'HUMAN RIGHTS DISASTER' OF XINJIANG CAMPSStates News ServiceAugust 27, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 855 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Recent threats by China's state security police against Muslim poet Cui Haoxin -- known by his pen name An Ran -- are a deliberate attempt to stop him speaking out about the mass incarceration of Uyghurs and other minority groups in its northwestern region of Xinjiang, a rights group has said.Cui, a Hui Muslim, was visited and threatened by police on Aug. 16 after he sent and retweeted posts from his Twitter account about the detentions.He was warned not to use overseas social media, and not to become a "tool" of hostile foreign forces, he wrote in a later blog post."As a group dedicated to safeguarding and cherishing freedom of expression everywhere, PEN America recognizes that China's policy of forced 're-education' in Xinjiang is a human rights disaster, one with dire implications for the right to free expression," PEN America said in a statement on its website."We call upon the government to immediately end and reverse these catastrophic and abusive policies."Last April, An Ran was sent on a weeklong 're-education course' in eastern China and was briefly detained in connection with his poetry and other writings that reference Xinjiang, it said."An Ran, a poet, is speaking out on one of the most important human rights issues of our day," Summer Lopez, who heads PEN America's Free Expression Programs, said. "Instead of attempting to shut him down, authorities should be listening.""This is a clear cut example of the Chinese government seeking to silence a critical voice through intimidation," said Summer Lopez, senior director of Free Expression Programs at PEN America.PEN America cited "wide array of credible reports from journalists and human rights organizations [that] have revealed a broad system of state surveillance and forced detention of inhabitants ... in large [camps]."Once inside, "they are subject to a mandatory "patriotic" regimen ... oriented around coercively discouraging detainees from expressing their ethnic and religious identity, including reported incidents where Muslim detainees were forced to eat pork, as well as other abuses," it said."While reported numbers vary, the number of detainees is widely believed to be in the hundreds of thousands," it said.Cui told RFA he fully expects to face further retaliation, based on warnings from police during their visit that he should stop speaking out about the Xinjiang camps."The reason I am continuing to speak out is that there is a mass incarceration under way in Xinjiang on a huge scale," he said in a recent interview with RFA. "If we don't pay attention, we will leave [Uyghurs and other detainees] in utter despair and helplessness.""I will continue to speak out until my last breath for these people, regardless of what happens next," Cui said.Cui said the so-called "re-education camps" are targeting a specific ethnicity and their culture and religion."This is a mass incarceration targeting a specific ethnic group and a specific religion, which has similarities to the events that took place in Nazi Germany," he said. "The authorities say that they are in danger of being radicalized, and that this is an anti-terrorism measures, but I think that you can't solve social problems with concentration camps."Turkey-based Uyghur Rafat told RFA that he has a number of friends and relatives who have been sent to the camps."The Xinjiang camps differ from the Nazi concentration camps in name only," Rafat said. "Anyone from the free world would see this in an instant, were they able to witness them with their own eyes."Earlier this month, the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) expressed concerns over China's mass internment of ethnic Uyghurs and restrictions on their religious freedom.The panel said it was "deeply concerned" by reports that China "has turned the [Xinjiang] Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) into something that resembles a massive internment camp that is shrouded in secrecy" in the name of eradicating "religious extremism" and "maintaining social stability."Beginning in April 2017, Uyghurs and Kazakhs accused of harboring "strong religious views" and "politically incorrect" ideas have been jailed or detained in political "re-education camps" throughout the region. Many have done nothing more than go overseas, or have family members who have gone overseas.Earlier this month, China's foreign ministry effectively expelled a BuzzFeed journalist who won a human rights award for her reporting on the mass incarceration and surveillance of Uyghurs and other groups.The decision by China's foreign ministry not to renew the visa of BuzzFeed's China bureau chief, Megha Rajagopalan, came after she carried out extensive investigative reporting into heavy surveillance measures in Xinjiang, and the use of huge camps to detain Uyghurs and other minority groups for "re-education," the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said in a statement.Reported by Ng Yik-tung and Dai Weisen for RFA's Cantonese Service, and by the Mandarin Service.

To what extent would Russia and China be willing to defend Chavism ?: PanAm PodcastCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 27, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 334 wordsBody The relations of China and Russia with Venezuela are well known and increasingly arouse more concern. Many wonder, for example, if in case of a military intervention in Venezuela, one of these two countries would react in defense of Chavism. In today's podcast we talk to an expert about the possible intentions of these two countries in Venezuela.  Our guest is Cesar Sabas, BA in International Studies from Universidad Central de Venezuela. Master in Political Science at the Simón Bolívar University. Master in International Relations and Security Policy of the University of Toulouse, Capitole (France). And Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Toulouse, Capitole.  For our interviewee today, the relationship that China has with Venezuela is different from that between Russia and the oil country, and the incentives are also different. China has an economic interest, it does not want to risk that it's up to it to forgive the debt. Sabas also insists that Xi Jinping has no particular intention of helping Chavism, and that in fact the Chinese government has had talks with the MUD. They are State relations and have nothing to do with ideology, but with their desire to be a great empire.  Regarding the interest of Russia in Venezuela, Sabas believes that it is an attempt to counteract the blows that consider that EE. UU He has given them. The US government supports, for example, Ukraine and finances NGOs in countries that the Russians consider their sphere of influence. For the guest, Russia wants to support regimes that are in some way subversive to the US Government.  In this podcast, an expert gives us his opinion about the ultimate goal that China and Russia are looking for in Venezuela. We also ask ourselves if these relations are an ideological and specific support for Chavismo and if these two countries would be willing to defend the tyranny in a possible warlike confrontation.  China's interest in Venezuela is different from that of Russia (PanAm Post)       Load-Date: September 27, 2018End of Document

Vaccine Safety in China Requires Releasing Lawyers, Free PressTargeted News ServiceJuly 23, 2018 Monday 7:40 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 436 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyHuman Rights Watch issued the following report:China's social media users are in an uproar over a major drug company's sale of substandard vaccines - most for babies as young as 3-months-old - and the authorities' persistent failure to regulate the vaccine market properly.On Sunday, China's Premier Li Keqiang vowed to "resolutely crack down on ... criminal acts that endanger the safety of people's lives ... and severely criticize dereliction of duty in supervision." The police have since launched an investigation, but for that or any pledge to be meaningful--unlike commitments made following previous vaccine scandals--Premier Li and other leaders should take the following steps:First, release from incarceration all the lawyers who assisted victims in previous vaccine scandals. From 2006 to 2009, lawyer Tang Jingling represented a group of parents whose children were left permanently disabled after being given problematic meningococcal vaccines. This would require quashing the five-year sentence Tang is currently serving on baseless charges of "inciting subversion." Similarly, lawyer Yu Wensheng has languished in a detention center on spurious "subversion" charges. Yu had represented a man who was detained for seeking redress for his daughter, who became seriously ill after being given spoiled vaccine.Second, stop harassing, detaining, and prosecuting families of victims of faulty vaccines. In July 2015, after being given vaccines at the local government-run epidemic prevention center in Henan province, Wang Nuoyi was diagnosed with a brain injury and other illnesses. In pursuit of justice, her family wrote letters to the government. The authorities responded by detaining Wang's father for four months in 2017 as well as at least six other members of his family, and prosecuting Wang's grandmother for "provoking trouble," which resulted in a two-year prison sentence.Third, stop punishing journalists for exposing vaccine scandals. In 2010, prominent investigative journalist Wang Keqin was removed from his post at the China Economic Times after the newspaper published his story about mishandled vaccines that led to the deaths of four children in Shanxi province. Amid the current scandal, while netizens are free to condemn the drug company, news articles and social media posts that showed the Chinese government in a critical light continue to be censored.If Premier Li is serious about transparency and accountability, his government should stop punishing those who endeavor to achieve exactly that.Sophie RichardsonChina DirectorCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6379898 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: July 24, 2018End of Document

Market opening: China and results bolster exchangesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 24, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 607 wordsBody       This is one of the busiest weeks of the year in terms of earnings presentations and for now the listed companies are giving good news to investors. China's stimulus measures are also boosting stock markets.The market in numbers PSI-20 decreases 0.18% to 5,628.17 points  Stoxx 600 earns 0.39% to 386.38 points  Nikkei appreciated 0.51% to 22,510.48 points  Interest on ten-year Portuguese debt advances 1 basis point to 1.78%  Euro depreciates 0.2% to $ 1.1675  Oil in London appreciates 0.07% to $ 73.11 European stocks return to earnings China's economic stimulus measures and positive results from several global players - such as Google, PSA and UBS - are boosting European stock markets on Tuesday, as they recover from falling overnight. The Chinese government has said it will move ahead with stronger fiscal measures to boost the economy, prompting the country's stock exchange to rise to a one-month high.  The Stoxx600 gained 0.39% to 386.38 points, and the performance boost is two sectors: the car with the shares of PSA (Peugeot, Citroen, Opel) appreciating 9.54% after good results and the banking with the rise of UBS, which also showed accounts that pleased investors. The tech sector is also on the rise, after last night the US-based Alphabet (Google's owner) posted well above-expected results, which tossed the shares into record highs.  In Lisbon the PSI-20 falls 0.18% to 5,628.17 points, with the Portuguese index being penalized by the performance of Galp Energia (-1.06% to 16,875 euros) which is in line with the European sector.  BCP stands out for the positive: the bank's shares are increasing 0.55% to 27.32 cents, a day after the European Central Bank gave the green light to the successor of Nuno Amado, who becomes chairman. Miguel Maya is the new executive president of the bank, and his board of directors took office on Monday. The BCP presents next Thursday the accounts for the first half. Euro retreats for the second session After recovering ground last week, the euro is falling for the second consecutive session today, and the session on the foreign exchange market is the new low of the last year of the yuan, with the Chinese currency being penalized by the injection of funds in the financial system by the central bank of China.  The euro is down 0.2 percent to $ 1.1675 as investors are also eyeing the ECB's monetary policy meeting scheduled for Thursday. Interest from Germany up to five weeks Germany's sovereign bonds are down slightly, but enough to squeeze the yield on 10-year bonds above 0.4%, which is a five-week high. According to Reuters, this trend illustrates an improvement in market sentiment, which is more willing to accept risk. Interest on Portuguese bonds is also on a slight rise (1 basis point to 1.78%), so the spread against bunds remains stable at 137 basis points. Oil close to one-month lows Oil is trading steadily at the opening of the European session, with quotes close to last month's lows, as investors continue to feara reduction in the demand for this raw material due to the effects of the commercial war on global economic growth. Despite declining stocks in the US, oil has fallen by about 8% in July.  This Tuesday the WTI in New York depreciates 0.04% to 67.86 dollars and Brent in London values ??0.07% to 73.11 dollars. Gold falls to a one-year low Gold has also been one of the raw materials most penalized by the trade war, especially because the precious metal has a strong inverse correlation to the dollar and the US currency has been the winning asset in the current context. Gold is down 0.2% to $ 1,221.61, which is a new low last year. Load-Date: July 24, 2018End of Document

Google employees sign protest letter over censored China search engineStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeAugust 19, 2018 SundayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: HI-TECH; Pg. 1Length: 520 wordsByline: Sandy MccarthyBodyEight year ago, after Google Pulled censored websearch out of China, Sergey Brin explained the decision, saying: "'In some aspects of [government] policy, particularly with respect to censorship, with respect to surveillance of dissidents, I see some earmarks of totalitarianism.' Dragonfly and Google's return to China raise urgent moral and ethical issues, the substance of which we are discussing elsewhere".Google previously offered a search engine for China, but the company withdrew it over concerns on both censorship and cyber attacks.A section of the letter obtained by online tech publication Gizmodo - the emphasis is from the employees.Google executives have admitted that they are considering the possibility of relaunching their search engine in China after an nearly decade-long absence from the country.Google famously ended its search operations in China in 2010, protesting the country's strict demands that users be prevented from accessing critical websites and topics. It is possible that they may have come up with better rules with the Chinese government on the new search engine.The letter calls on executives to review ethics and transparency at the company.Rumors have been swirling that Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is working on a search engine for China, but a new report indicates the brakes should be tapped on those expectations.The search engine, which would be app-based, would remove items that contain certain words or phrases and would apply to image search, suggested search features and automatic spell check. The trade war has hindered Google's negotiations with Beijing officials, who must sign off on the "censored search platform".Disable Google Tracking Location ServiceThis isn't the first time we've heard of Google tracking your location regardless of whether you have location services turned on. You can not turn off Google Play services , which supplies your location to other apps if you leave that service on.At that time, Google Engineering Vice President Ben Gomes announced changes to the company's search algorithm aimed at promoting "authoritative" news sources over "alternative viewpoints".According to The Wall Street Journal, Google CEO Sundar Pichai held a meeting yesterday to address these concerns.The revelation has stunned many people, including the majority of Google's 88,000 employees.The employees were not given details about the project and they are now angry after a report leaked about Google working on such a project.Pichai told employees: "We'll definitely be transparent as we get closer to actually having a plan of record here" on Dragonfly, according to the transcript. "The team has been in an exploration stage for quite a while now, and I think they are exploring many options". Earlier this year, employees protested against Google's involvement in an AI project to improve weapons for the Pentagon.After a separate petition this year, Google announced it would not renew a project to help the US military develop artificial intelligence technology for drones.Well, where is the ethics in this project that Google might be undertaking.Load-Date: August 20, 2018End of Document

Self-Driving and Electric Vehicles are Combining to Make the Cars of the FuturePR NewswireJuly 25, 2018 Wednesday 8:30 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2551 wordsDateline: NEW YORK, July 25, 2018 BodyNetworkNewsWire Editorial Coverage: Self-driving and electric cars are poised to combine production efforts as both technologies mature.Investment in self-driving vehicles is growing, leading to the emergence of specialist companies.Electric cars are also on the rise, supported by the infrastructure of apps and charging points.Both engineering and human factors suggest that these technologies are likely to combine.Support from the Chinese government is pushing these technologies forward in one of the world's most important markets.The growth of advanced automotive technology has led to the rise of companies such asForesight Autonomous Holdings Ltd.(NASDAQ:FRSX) (TASE:FRSX)(FRSX Profile), an innovator in advanced vision sensor systems for assistant driving, semi and fully autonomous vehicles.Tesla Inc.(NASDAQ:TSLA) is pairing sensor technology with electric motor vehicles and has recently found a foothold in China.General Motors Company(NYSE:GM) will start mass production of self-driving vehicles next year and has been pushing its latest electric SUV to the Chinese market.Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is developing a sophisticated self-driving system that fuses multiple sensor inputs. AndIntel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC) has joined the sector by acquiring Mobileye, bringing its technological clout to sensor technology.Two Trends Becoming One Two important trends in car design have been emerging over the past 20 years. One is the shift toward electric vehicles. Driven by a desire for cleaner air, better health and a more sustainable planet, designers have been creating vehicles that can reduce pollution by running on electricity instead of gas.The other trend is a shift toward autonomous vehicles. These self-driving cars will not only save travelers from the laboriousness of driving, they are also expected to reduce traffic accidents and increase the efficiency of traffic flows by removing human error from decision-making on the road. For years, these two developments have existed in parallel. Now they're coming together.ParallelDevelopments Though many people still see self-driving cars as science fiction dreams, such vehicles are coming close to reality. Big players such as Tesla and General Motors are pushing forward with this technology, showing their faith in the market. Alongside them, a wealth of smaller specialist businesses, includingForesight Autonomous Holdings (NASDAQ:FRSX) (TASE:FRSX),are emerging to provide critical components.Foresight's growth provides an example of how the market has matured. Founded in 2015, the company designs, develops and commercializes vision sensor systems for assistant driving, semi and fully autonomous vehicles. These systems include sensors, processors and software that allow a vehicle to make sense of that information. As explained in a CNBC article on "What Driving Will Look Like in 2028," these systems serve as the eyes of a self-driving vehicle and will be vital to the automated-driving industry's success. There's enough interest in automated driving not only to support a specialist company such as Foresight but to also see it flourish.Meanwhile, electric cars are already on the streets in commercial production. Hybrids have become the first choice of environmentally conscious drivers. Charging points are springing up in cities across the world, with specialist apps available to help drivers find charging points. While both sectors are diversifying individually, with specialist services such as these apps and Foresight's passive sensors, they are also growing closer together.Related Developments Analysis by Lux researchindicates that battery-powered engines and sensor-equipped self-driving vehicle manufacturing will almost inevitably merge with each other. There are practical engineering reasons for this, tied to the batteries of electric vehicles. It will be far easier for a self-driving car to drive into a wireless charging station than to refuel at a gas station where a human being must be available to pump gas.In addition, the voltage and storage capacity of an electrical vehicle's battery are better suited than the capacity of a conventional fossil fuel-powered car's battery for sustaining self-driving equipment such as Foresight's sensors and processors. This gives designers more freedom to create the best possible sensor and processing technology for self-driving vehicles.Automated driving could help to solve one of the biggest drawbacks of electric cars: driving distance ranges.Automated driving leads to more efficient driving, reducing a vehicle's fuel consumption and allowing electric cars to travel farther before they need to recharge.The behavior of consumers will also play a part in this merging trend. Early adopters who pay a high price for Tesla's electric cars are more likely to try out other innovations, such as the self-driving vehicles that use vision sensors like Foresight's. They will want to see these features combined, and manufacturers will be keen to fulfill this request because winning the support of this group is vital to the success of any product.Both technologies are expected to mature enough for mainstream use around the same time. They are forecast to hit the mass market together, and so it will make commercial sense to combine them.And finally, the behavior of governments will push the technologies together. The increased safety of self-driving vehicles will lead governments to encourage implementation of the vehicles. Many governments are already encouraging the use of electric cars over vehicles that use petroleum or diesel. As legislation enforces these changes, manufacturers will have to adopt both technologies.Big in China China is emerging as the dominant economic power of the 21st century, and therefore, the adoption of these technologies in that country will be critical. China's leaders are eager to be at the forefront of emerging technologies. This is reflected in the way they have encouraged the country's car manufacturers to adopt electric engines. Chinese manufacturersBAIC and Geely have both made recent pushes in this direction, while Chinese tech giant Baidu isaccelerating the development of its self-driving vehicle platform.This is good news for many tech companies outside of China, as it creates opportunities to sell self-driving and electric car technology in a rapidly growing market.A leading global Chinese electric vehicle manufacturerhas already ordered a prototype of QuadSightvisionsystem. If that company's evaluation of QuadSight is positive, the system may then be built into a new range of autonomous electric vehicles, putting Foresight at the heart of these combined systems.The Road to Electric and Automation As interest in electric and automated vehicles grows, companies are tackling the resulting challenges in a range of different ways.Tesla Inc.(NASDAQ:TSLA) is already exploring both self-driving vehicles and electrics and, therefore, is one of the front-runners in the race to get an automated electric car to market. Its self-driving systems have suffered some setbacks in field testing as a result of accidents on the road, but the company has also scored some notable successes. Tesla recently reached a deal with the Chinese governmentto set up a factory in China, giving it access to that large and growing market. With capacity to produce 500,000 cars per year, this could easily become one of the most important car manufacturing plants in the world.Established automotive giants are adapting to the changing consumer climate.General Motors Company(NYSE:GM) has announced that it willstart mass production of a self-driving car for the first time next yearat a plant in the United States. The company also has an eye on the Chinese market, where it recently showed off its latest electric car design for the first time. The Buick Enspire SUV went on display at Auto China 2018 in Beijing in April, drawing attention with its powerful and fast-charging technology.Always striving to be at the forefront of technology,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) has been working on both electric and self-driving cars. Secrecy shrouds much of its work, but it is generally known that the company started on an electric car in 2014 before scaling back its operations to focus on self-driving systems for use with other manufacturers.A recent legal casehas revealed some details about what Apple is doing, including fusing multiple inputs into a single sensor system to create a more sophisticated self-driving vehicle.Intel Corporation(NASDAQ:INTC), another company not known for working with cars, has become a significant player through itsrecent acquisition of Mobileye. This subsidiary specializes in the production of advanced driver assistance systems, using sensors and processors to help people drive more safely and efficiently. This is the sort of technology that has laid the groundwork for self-driving and that is now being utilized in automatic vehicle systems.Both self-driving and electric vehicles are developing quickly, thanks to the efforts of a growing number of companies. The two sectors appear certain to combine, giving both spaces a better chance to thrive. The adoption of both types of vehicles in China will only add to the momentum, increasing the chances that today's drivers may live to see the cars of the future.For more information aboutForesight Autonomous Holdings, please visitForesight Autonomous Holdings (NASDAQ:FRSX).About NetworkNewsWire NetworkNewsWire (NNW) is a financial news and content distribution company that provides (1) access to a network of wire services viaNetworkWire to reach all target markets, industries and demographics in the most effective manner possible, (2) article and editorial syndication to 5,000+ news outlets (3), enhanced press release services to ensure maximum impact, (4) social media distribution via the Investor Brand Network (IBN) to nearly 2 million followers, (5) a full array of corporate communications solutions, and (6) a total news coverage solution withNNW Prime.

The U.S. Government and its growing technological illiteracyDaily Princetonian: Princeton UniversitySeptember 30, 2018 SundayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: OPINION; Pg. 1Length: 1236 wordsBodyThis past summer I had an innocent conversation with one of my relatives who happened to be struggling with connecting to the internet on her newly purchased iPhone. When I told her she needed to either use data or to connect to WiFi in order to do so, I was met with the response, "Isn't WiFi how they hack your information?"Although I spent a few extra minutes explaining the concept of WiFi, I was not immediately concerned. The technological divide between age groups is often harmless and reconcilable.However, this divide has begun to manifest outside of simple familial misunderstandings. Infamously, recent scandals involving Russian election interference through social media outlets and alleged conservative shadow banning on Twitter have exposed certain individuals to copious amounts of information about technologies they otherwise would have no reason to interact with.Consequently, misunderstandings of the unknown have led to the development of misguided fears and notions among disconnected demographics with respect to what recent buzz phrases like "data mining," "social media," or "ad-based business models" actually entail.As apprehensions concerning the privacy, security, and honesty of social media outlets have grown, the United States government has stepped in to assuage the damage in addition to providing potentially beneficial regulation.Nevertheless, just as you would not entrust a serial thief to housesit, we as a public should not entrust a legislative body of disconnected senators to regulate the way firms like Facebook or Google develop their user interfaces and ad-centric business models.Independent of Facebook's acknowledged struggles with Russian advertisements interference during the 2016 election, the questions posed by Senators at the hearing reinforced the aforementioned divide.In one instance, Senator Orrin Hatch from Utah asked of Zuckerberg, "How do you sustain a business model where customers don't pay for your service?"Business models driven by ad-revenue and in-app purchases have existed as staples of tech giants, and social media firms in particular, for years. As such, Senator Hatch's question did not solely communicate a current misunderstanding of how Facebook generates revenue.In short, technology has accelerated at a faster rate than the understanding of those who constitute the legislative branch of the United States Federal Government. This disconcerting trend was made evident during Mark Zuckerberg's Senate hearing on Facebook's data and advertising practices.Until recently, this growing divide went unnoticed, either for lack of caring within the U.S. legislature or for lack of awareness of the problem's existence. In any case, legislators need to be held accountable for maintaining a level of technological literacy prior to regulating relatively recent technological developments such as cryptocurrencies, social media platforms, and search engines. This accountability should come in the form of a reimagined educational background for politicians.The growing embeddedness of STEM in our everyday lives also calls for changes in the educational backgrounds of our legislators. Already here at Princeton, the Wilson School takes a relatively interdisciplinary approach by requiring coursework in statistics, economics, data science, natural science policy, and psychology in addition the expected instruction in policy and international affairs. Gradually restructuring the mutual exclusivity of political and STEM educational backgrounds would improve the authority and interactions legislators would enjoy when interacting with Silicon Valley's companies.On a similar note, China's economic eruption over the last decade has largely been fueled by technocratic leadership. Despite the Chinese government's ignominious censorship practices and shortcomings in handling social issues, their recent success exemplifies the merits of politicians with a working educational background in STEM.Moreover, longstanding practices in society, like physical mail, have online parallels, email, that could benefit from analogous legislative protections but have been glanced over time and again. While opening or stealing mail that is not addressed to you is a federal offense, there are no laws safeguarding the privacy of emails.Despite daily interactions via email outnumbering physical mail, we have not seen the U.S. government act in accordance with changes in the ways people communicate, both professionally and casually. While some members of Congress have noticed the need for contemporary email privacy regulations, they are few and far between.The most salient difference between email and mail is that the latter is delivered by the United States Postal Service and subsequently relates to a federal agency, which warrants punishing mail theft as a federal offense.Having said that, the government should also consider the necessity to safeguard the information transferred daily via email, due to both the quantity and sensitivity of the contents. Even rudimentary confirmation emails following an online purchase can contain one's name, phone number, address, and credit card information.Currently, the contents of email exchanges are left to private parties whether that entails the user or the email provider. In both instances, security settings leave much to be desired. I have observed that a large majority of email users even struggle to prevent spam from cluttering their inboxes, let alone more nefarious communications.As of now, regulatory trends have focused on impeding companies rather than addressing individual user interactions. New York already stamped regulations on Uber and Lyft that inhibit TLC licenses distributed to For-Hire Vehicles , thus undermining the business models that made Uber and Lyft so disruptive in the transportation industry. No longer can any individual with a car monetize that resource per request by willing customers.In a similar vein, New York passed legislation requiring Airbnb to share its user data, shrinking aggregate demand for Airbnb's services as customers who wanted to maintain a private corporate-client relation are now not able to do so.In doing so, New York's underlying motives seem targeted at preventing emerging tech-driven companies from disrupting the older institutions in New York City. Uber and Lyft represent strong competitors to New York's taxi industry and undermine medallion owners. Relatedly, Airbnb disturbed New York's rent-controlled real estate gold mine. As a result, all three companies have experienced regulatory constraints targeted at limiting their influence.Considering the foregoing, the question arises whether recent regulatory measures taken against emerging tech firms are designed to improve and protect consumers or designed to preserve dated commercial norms in the city.Moving forward, the development of appropriate regulation for an ever-developing tech sector requires two important modifications to the current approach. First, senators must develop a greater understanding and literacy of the business models that drive modern technological firms. Second, the legislature's initiatives must shift from protecting the industries being disrupted to the improving consumers interactions with the new products.Hunter Sieben is a sophomore from Ottawa Hills, Ohio.

'I Think This is the Most Important Relationship That We Have'Targeted News ServiceJuly 13, 2018 Friday 6:58 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1781 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Ripon Society issued the following news release:With China growing in power and its relationship with the U.S. being put to the test, The Ripon Society held a breakfast discussion yesterday morning to examine the state of Sino-American relations, and the trade war between the two countries that has erupted this year.Leading the discussion were three Senators who traveled to China as part of a congressional delegation this past March. The Senators included Steve Daines (MT), Ron Johnson (WI), and David Perdue (GA). Daines led the delegation, and kicked off the discussion by talking about the U.S. relationship with China and what the group saw while they were there."I think this is the most important relationship that we have," the Montana lawmaker stated. "Think about where we are going as a world and where China is headed The top five banks in the world today are in China. Three of the top six Internet companies in the world are in China. We've got Amazon and Google. They've got Tencent, Alibaba, JD.com."I asked that this delegation visit the technology ecosystem that is developing in China, and that's what we focused our time on. I was thrilled to have David Perdue and Ron Johnson come along. I think we all came away changed. You have one more picture of what's going on in China."Daines spent almost 30 years as a businessman before his election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2012. For five and half of those years, he lived and worked in China as an executive with Procter &#38; Gamble.He has traveled to the country and region numerous times since, including most recently this past May, when he saw further indication of China's future growth."I took another trip back to Shanghai recently," he recalled. "I met with John Bruns, the President and CEO of Boeing. He said the top three airlines right now measured by fleet are American, Delta, and United. By 2035, it'll be China Southern and Air China. They'll displace U.S. airlines and the larger airlines around the world. So this is where it's all headed."Johnson agreed."Let's face it," he said, "the economy is made up of two things -- human capital and financial capital. China has 1.4 billion people. They have the financial capital now. They have the innovation. They've stolen our secrets, and they're innovating themselves. So from my standpoint, what we need to start doing is, first of all, somewhat turn the tables."Because of their intellectual property theft and because of their mercantilist way of doing business, they've been winning and the rest of the trading world has been losing. And President Trump is absolutely right to walk that line. But I don't believe we're going to have the capability of turning the tables where it's a win-lose situation -- where we win and they lose."Like Daines, Johnson is also a veteran of the private sector, having spent over three decades running a successful manufacturing company in Wisconsin prior to his election to the Senate in 2010. He noted that the company has been exporting to China for over 20 years. In part as a result of that experience, he understands not only the significance of the Chinese market, but why it's important for America and its allies to stick together -- not only to make sure the Chinese play by the rules economically, but to make sure they play a productive role with regard to global security."From my standpoint, being in a trade war with everybody is not going to work," he declared. "We ought to be allied with the rest of the trading world against China to insist that they follow the rules. It's the only way this is going to work. One last point -- our top priority in our relationship with China is that we need to get them to continue to maintain the sanctions against North Korea because that's an incredibly dangerous situation."Perdue concurred, and began his comments with an observation about the Chinese people."I will tell you," the Georgia Republican said. "In my opinion -- watching this over the last 30 years or so -- we got it wrong. We all got it wrong. We thought as China became more affluent, developed a middle class, and became a member of the community of nations that they would open up and liberalize That just hasn't happened."Perdue then turned his attention to the Chinese government and their leadership of the country in recent years."I think China has overreached," he stated matter-of-factly. "I think they misread what happened over the last decade under Barack Obama. They saw a disengagement with the rest of the world, but I think they misread America I think they have gotten to a point where they believe that we either can't -- or won't -- stop their march to regain the hegemon position that they had.""President Xi Jinping gave a speech a few weeks ago where he quoted Confucius He quoted Confucius as saying, 'Just like there can't be two suns in the sky, there can no longer be two emperors on the earth.' The word for emperor can also be hegemon. So it's very clear China sees its rightful place as the rule maker.""I believe the struggle in the world is going to be between self-determination countries and state-control countries. Today, you have two dominant state-control countries -- Russia, which has a very, very small economy; and China, which is a growing economy. They see themselves as the largest developing economy. They see us as the largest developed economy. And therein lies the imbalance when you start talking about trade."Perdue is the only Fortune 500 CEO in Congress and has over 40 years of business experience as the former CEO of Reebok and Dollar General stores. Like Daines, he has a first-hand understanding of what it is like to live and work in China as a result of his having served as an executive with the Sara Lee Corporation in Hong Kong in the early 1990s.Since his election to the Senate in 2014, he has also taken an interest in the military side of the U.S.-China relationship as a result of his role on the Senate Armed Services Committee, where, he said, he has gained an even better appreciation for why America's strategic alliances around the globe are so key."The allied relationships we have is what Russia and China do not have today," he observed. "I just went to the Shangri La military conference in Singapore. The number one revelation I got from that meeting was that China is absolutely prying apart the relationships that we have with our Southeast and East Asia partners. And it is devastating. It's amazing how much progress they've made. The propaganda is absolutely stronger than Russia's propaganda in Eastern Europe. I believe that's the struggle for the next 50 years."Daines echoed Perdue's remarks."David brought up a great point about how the West got China wrong," he added. "I was in Beijing interviewing students, recruiting a team for Procter and Gamble, in 1992. These students had been in Tiananmen Square, and it was giving rise to the hope somehow that the liberalization of the economy would liberalize the way the government works. The opposite has happened. It's much more authoritarian."One great way to look at that is to look at the front page of the China Daily in the '03, '08, '13, '18 elections. In '03, they put four pictures in the China Daily on the front page. In '08, it was three pictures. In '13, it was two pictures. In '18, it's one great big picture of now the President for life, Xi Jinping. We got that wrong. They are much more authoritarian. We need to keep one eye clearly on the huge opportunity that China presents for U.S. companies and business. The other eye needs to be clearly on the very real threat that China presents right now to the world order."Following their remarks, the three Senators were asked a number of questions, including one about the President's decision to impose tariffs on China and the trade war that has erupted as a result."We are at an incredibly dangerous point right now," Johnson declared. "Like French President Macron said, it just doesn't work when you're at war with everybody. And currently, we are. So I've certainly been publicly and privately encouraging this President to use this as negotiating leverage. But conclude the negotiations so that we can present a united front -- the rest of the trading world demanding that China follow the rules."Daines agreed."I think we can't go about this alone," he stated. "I applaud President Trump for putting disruptive forces into this relationship. It needed to be confronted. This does not end well for the United States without confronting the outright theft by China of intellectual property. That had to be confronted. However, I think a multilateral approach will be a better approach -- both as it relates to our Asian allies in the Asia Pacific, or whether it's NATO and the threat of Russia. I think multilateral needs to be a part of the strategic thinking longer term."Perdue credited the President with shaking up the U.S.-China relationship, but expressed similar sentiments about the need to work with our allies and avoid a go-it-alone approach."President Trump's instincts are right," the Senator and former CEO stated. "I don't like tariffs. But it's disruptive -- you've got their attention. It was obvious when we were meeting these top leaders from Li Keqiang, premier of China, on down, that we have their attention. I think they misread the eight years of Barack Obama. They saw a disengagement with the rest of the world. This guy Trump comes back in and says, 'Wait a minute, NATO -- we're going to pull out if you don't start paying your fair share.' It's a $400 billion delta that we've been subsidizing Europe on national defense. We have an uneven playing field with regard to trade. President Trump is disrupting that. The Chinese are nervous about that. They're vulnerable right now. They've got a lot of debt, you can't see it because it's pushed down in the SOE's, it's pushed down into other quasi-companies like that. They need our markets right now."To view the remarks of Senators Daines, Johnson and Perdue before The Ripon Society breakfast discussion yesterday morning, please click on the link below:The Ripon Society is a public policy organization that was founded in 1962 and takes its name from the town where the Republican Party was born in 1854 - Ripon, Wisconsin.

China is ready for the future and evaluates to include artificial intelligence in its curriculumCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 1, 2018 SundayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 577 wordsBody Ming Ming lives in the year 2028. In the mornings he wakes up with the voice of a virtual assistant who tells him the time, while from the kitchen a robot is responsible for preparing breakfast. Everything is programmed not to delay your entry to work, a task that the creators of your autonomous vehicle are also taken seriously: the car is programmed to identify the fastest way to the office.  With this story begins the first chapter of Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence, the textbook that is now mandatory reading in 40 Chinese schools. It is a book developed especially to introduce middle school students to this subject. In its nine chapters cover topics ranging from the history of artificial intelligence to its current use in public security systems.  "The artificial intelligence sector is facing a shortage of talent around the world, the publication of the book is an advance, because it brings this type of technology out of the ivory tower and makes it part of the learning of the school", explains Lin Dahua, professor at the University of Hong Kong, institution that collaborated with the creation of the book. The publication is part of a much larger plan that began six months ago, when the Chinese government announced that the country aspired to lead the world race in the field of artificial intelligence by the year 2030.  The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology launched a 28-page document in which they identify young people as key players in this plan, and in which they encourage schools to create alliances with universities and companies to boost talent.  If this one-year pilot with the first 40 schools brings good results, China hopes to include the subject of artificial intelligence in educational plans across the country.  "This is similar to when the computer was introduced in the classroom as a way to support the study of mathematics and science, or when robotics workshops are introduced with the same motive, in that sense, it is not that there is a need to prepare young people in the specific field, but it is an excellent opportunity to, using technological advances, teach the skills that will be essential today and in the next 20 years ", believes Jorge Pérez, an academic from the U. de Chile dedicated to research in the area of ??artificial intelligence.  This area already shows its progress through automatic processing and learning from data: the autocorrector of the cell phone, the system that detects spam in email or the applications that recognize the faces within a photograph are some practical examples. The advertising that is received from a web page or the recommendation systems in shopping sites also account for systems that are learning from the past preferences of their users.  Asked about the plausibility of taking the study of artificial intelligence to Chilean classrooms, Perez says that - as long as it is done well - this could help bring students closer to technology, "in particular to computer technology, programming and data management What worries me about Chile is that in general we stay in fashion, in marketing ... in giving away the computer or inaugurating a new school program, and we forget the foundations, the foundations And if you look at the quality, the idea of ??the book of China is to start with the history and the scientific and computational bases, that is the good way to do it, as in any case in which you want to teach a good teaching ". Load-Date: July 1, 2018End of Document

Private enterprises give a strong boost to the reinvigoration of LiaoningPR NewswireAugust 30, 2018 Thursday 9:00 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 895 wordsDateline: BEIJING, Aug. 30, 2018 BodyA news report by China.org.cn on China Top 500 Private Enterprises Summit: The 2018 China Top 500 Private Enterprises Summit is held in Shenyang, capital of Liaoning province, from August 29 to 31. The grand gathering has drawn attention from across China and even the rest of the world. Representatives from Chinese business giants, such as Huawei and Jingdong, and from 15 Fortune Top 500 companies come together to discuss matters of vital importance to the development of the Chinese private sector.The choice of Liaoning as the host of this summit is by no means accidental. Located in northeast China, the coastal province has unique geographical advantages and rich natural resources. It also has good industrial foundations and abundant human resources, making progress in scientific and technological innovation and a high rate of urbanization compared with other provinces. As the cradle of China's industry, Liaoning has made an indelible contribution to the country. However, the provincial economy remained beleaguered for quite some time, plagued by deep-rooted problems such as the monotonous economic structure and state-owned enterprises' heavy burden.With China's economic and social development entering a new era, and its continuous deepening of reform and opening up, Liaoning's economy is also experiencing a new lease of life. In the first half of this year, the growth rate of the value added from the province's industrial enterprises with an annual operating revenue of no less than 20 million yuan ranked third in the country. In terms of contributions to Liaoning's economic growth, the proportion of private enterprises has significantly increased. On the list of China Top 500 Private Enterprises, there is no lack of world-famous enterprises like Wanda Group that went global from Liaoning.In order to create a good environment for the private economy, inspire more people to start businesses and thus protect entrepreneurship, Liaoning has proposed to cultivate a business environment that is internationalized, law-based and convenient. In the past five years, Liaoning has abolished and adjusted over 2,000 administrative powers; significantly cut the time it takes to open a business; improved the credit rating system; and amended laws to improve the business environment. At the same time, Liaoning continues to significantly ease market access, encouraging foreign and private capitals to get involved in the reform of state-owned enterprises.The traditional strengths, together with an open attitude and advocacy of service, will surely attract more private enterprises and facilitate them to become an important engine in boosting Liaoning's high-quality development. At this year's summit, many private enterprises have signed cooperative agreements with Liaoning, and several major projects have already landed in the province.The summit also sets up special topics around the revitalization of Liaoning and northeast China, such as the founding conference of the province's merchants federation and the third annual mergers and acquisitions meeting in northeast China. The choice of Liaoning as the host of the summit shows the Chinese government's confidence in and concern for the province, as well as its recognition of the province's achievements in reform, opening up and economic development. We have every reason to believe that Liaoning will make a comeback in the new era toward the reinvigoration of the province.China Mosaichttp://www.china.org.cn/video/node_7230027.htmPrivate enterprises give a strong boost to the reinvigoration of Liaoninghttp://www.china.org.cn/video/2018-08/30/content_61083176.htmAbout China.org.cnFounded in 2000, China Internet Information Center (China.org.cn/China.com.cn) is a key state news website under the auspices of the State Council Information Office, and is managed by China International Publishing Group.

INTERVIEW: 'EVEN IF I WANTED TO RETURN TO MY HOMELAND, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE NOW'States News ServiceSeptember 7, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 639 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Beginning in April 2017, Uyghurs accused of harboring "strong religious views" and "politically incorrect" ideas have been jailed or detained in political re-education camps throughout the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), where members of the ethnic group have long complained of pervasive discrimination, religious repression, and cultural suppression under Chinese rule. Turghunjan Tursun, a Uyghur from Yarkand (in Chinese, Shache) county, in the XUAR's Kashgar (Kashi) prefecture, recently said in a video posted to social media that more than a dozen of his family members, including his wife and young sons, have been detained in the camps because he has been living since 2014 in Turkeyone of more than 20 countries blacklisted by China's government because of the perceived threat of religious extremism. Tursun provided further details about his family members in a recent interview with RFA's Uyghur Service and said that while he initially held back from discussing their cases for fear of further reprisals against his relatives in the XUAR, he decided to come forward with his story because he has nothing left to lose.RFA: Could you tell us about your claims in the video you have posted on social media regarding the tragic story of your family?Tursun: I arrived in Turkey in June 2014 and since then, my wife, my four sons, and my sisters and brothers have all been arrested. They were arrested simply because I am living in Turkey.My eldest son, Abdushukur, is 23 years old. He was arrested in Guangzhou in September 2015. My wife, Arzigul Tursun, was arrested in Yarkand county's Egechi Bazar with my two young sons, aged five and seven. My seven-year-old son's name is Seytulla and my five-year-old son is named Mujayit. Another son is Alimjan, and he was arrested in Yarkand county's Yarkand Bazar. My five- and seven-year-old sons were separated from their mother after she was arrested and I don't know where they are now, or if they are even still alive. None of them have committed any crimes, and neither have I, but even if I wanted to return to my homeland, it is impossible now.My eldest sister Gulember Tursun, her husband Ismetulla Qawul, and their son Abdureshit Ismetullah lived in Egechi's No.19 village, but my sister and her husband were detained. I don't know which re-education camp or prison they are held in at the moment. My other elder sisters Horniyaz Tursun ... and Nurimangul Tursun have both been taken for re-education. My younger sister, Gulsenem Ismetullah, was living in Yarkand Bazar at the time of her arrest, which was also because I am living in Turkey. I don't know where they are held, or if they are alive or not. My eldest sister's son, Abdureshit Ismetulla, sent money to me once, and he was given an 18-year prison sentence for doing it. Her second son, Abduqaxar Ismetulla, was also arrested, and he was also handed an 18-year prison sentence for speaking to me over the phone.RFA: What encouraged you to come forward and disclose information about their cases?Tursun: I am the reason for the arrests of all my family members, and my only 'crime' is that I am living in Turkey. I thought it is better for me to burn in the center of the fire than remain on the outside, so I decided to expose what has happened to my family and relatives.I am struggling to find words to express my feelings. We have all jumped into the fire, and sadly my wife and my young children are suffering the most from the flames. I thought that by revealing all of the atrocities perpetrated against us by the Chinese government, I might find some comfort and a sense that somehow my family has been avenged.Reported by Gulchehra Hoja for RFA's Uyghur Service.

China, Russia And Iran Accused Of Targeting US Through Economic SpyingLive Briefs PRO Global MarketsJuly 27, 2018 Friday 9:38 AM ESTCopyright 2018 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 389 wordsBody Efforts by intelligence services from China, Russia and Iran, along with their proxy hackers, to steal American intellectual property, trade secrets, and proprietary information via cyberspace have been revealed in a US government report released Thursday.The National Counterintelligence and Security Center's "2018 Foreign Economic Espionage in Cyberspace" report highlights current threats and future trends in foreign economic spying targeting the US."Our goal in releasing this document is to provide US industry and the public with the latest unclassified information on foreign efforts to steal US trade secrets through cyberspace," said William Evanina, director of the NCSC.NCSC, which is the US' premier source for counter-intelligence and security expertise, has sent a classified version of the report to the Congress.The report names China, Russia and Iran as "the most pervasive nation-state threat actors," and cites recent examples of their cyber economic espionage activities in the US. Despite advances in cybersecurity, the report says cyberespionage offers such actors a relatively low-cost, high-yield avenue to obtain a wide spectrum of US intellectual property.The report identifies energy, biotechnology, defence, environmental protection, high-end manufacturing, and information and communications technology as the US industrial sectors and technologies that are at greatest risk.In addition, the report highlights several emerging threats that warrant attention.There were numerous events involving hackers targeting software supply chains in 2017.The report warns that laws in foreign countries, such as in China and Russia, can pose an increased intellectual property risk to US companies doing business there.China's 2017 cybersecurity law mandates that foreign companies submit their technology to the Chinese government for national security reviews. Russia has dramatically increased its demand of source code reviews - which are overseen by Russian intelligence - to approve of foreign technology sold in their country.Citing the examples of Kaspersky Lab and Netcracker Technology Corp, the report notes that such companies often provide services that require access to control points of computer networks they support, presenting opportunities for foreign nations to acquire sensitive information.Load-Date: July 28, 2018End of Document

The Latest: Senator blasts Google for reply on China searchAssociated Press Financial WireSeptember 4, 2018 Tuesday 11:17 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: WASHINGTON DATELINELength: 688 wordsDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - The Latest on congressional hearings on social media issues (all times local):7:30 p.m.Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia is blasting Google for a response to lawmakers' inquiries about its reported plans to launch a search engine in China that would comply with censorship laws.Warner says he is "truly disappointed" with a letter from Google CEO Sundar Pichai that arrived Friday, before a Senate hearing Wednesday in which Google will not have a representative present.Pichai said in the letter he wasn't able to answer detailed questions and said the question of whether it would release a search engine in China "remains unclear."Warner says any Google effort to get back into China could help the Chinese government repress its citizens. Google says despite pulling its search engine from China in 2010, it still employs hundreds of workers there.__5:50 p.m.A nonprofit watchdog group says it bought ads on Google as recently as June while posing as the Russia propaganda agency that sought to influence the 2016 U.S. election.The ads pointed to websites tied to Russia's Internet Research Agency, used rubles, and used the agency's tax ID.The Campaign For Accountability says in a report published Tuesday that the ads were approved in as little as 24 hours. The campaign says the quick approval shows that Google is not doing enough to stop bad actors from abusing its platforms.Google has accused rival Oracle and groups it works with of performing a stunt to impersonate Russian trolls. It says it has since disabled those accounts and has taken further action to upgrade its vetting process.___3:15 p.m.Google won't have an executive testifying alongside Twitter and Facebook before a Senate intelligence committee hearing Wednesday.The committee invited Larry Page, the CEO of Google's parent company Alphabet. Google offered another executive instead, and the committee said no.The other executive is chief legal officer and senior vice president of global affairs Kent Walker. Google says Walker will still submit testimony and brief members on the subject of the hearing, which is foreign influence operations and their use of social media platforms.Walker's written testimony says the company found "limited activity" around government-backed election interference following the 2016 vote and took "swift action" once it did. Google says it continues to use "advanced technologies" to increase security and fight manipulation on its platforms.__3:10 p.m.Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg says the company is getting better at finding and combating adversaries who try to use the platform.The company's No. 2 executive says in prepared testimony ahead of a Senate intelligence committee hearing Wednesday that those adversaries include financially motivated troll farms and "sophisticated military intelligence operations."The Menlo Park, California-based company revealed last year that a Russian internet agency had used the platform to try to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Production cost is calculated by the inventoriable costs relating to production of polysilicon in Xinjiang divided by the production volume in the period indicted. Cash cost is calculated by the inventoriable costs relating to production of polysilicon excluding depreciation expense in Xinjiang, divided by the production volume in the period indicated.(3)    Daqo New Energy provides non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, adjusted net income attributable to Daqo New Energy Corp. shareholders and adjusted earnings per ADS on a non-GAAP basis to provide supplemental information regarding its financial performance. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the section captioned "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" and the tables captioned "Reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to comparable US GAAP measures" set forth at the end of this press release.Management Remarks"We remain confident in the long-term sustainable growth of the polysilicon industry despite the impact by the new solar PV policies issued by the Chinese government on May 31, 2018," commented Mr. Longgen Zhang, CEO of Daqo New Energy. "The new solar policies caused uncertainty in the domestic solar market and impacted downstream demand in June. Leveraging our strong cash position and efficient corporate management, we maintained full production capacity and resumed shipments when customer demand and pricing stabilized in early July. With our production facilities now running at full capacity and inventory at low levels, we are reiterating our full year polysilicon production guidance of 22,000 to 23,000 MT.""Utilization levels and demand from our downstream customers improved in July. According to the China Silicon Association, approximately 30-35% of China's domestic polysilicon production capacity has been shut down as those producers are unable to survive at the current market prices. With supply becoming increasingly limited and demand gradually recovering, polysilicon ASPs began to improve during July.""Despite the challenging market environment in China, demand for solar PV products remains healthy and robust for the rest of the world. New emerging markets in Latin America and the Middle East are booming with growing demand. India in particular is expected to grow rapidly. With grid parity approaching in many markets, such as Europe and the US, project developers are more aggressive in their bids. With solar PV markets outside of China accounting for an increasing percentage of our downstream customer's shipments, we are confident in the long-term sustainable growth of the polysilicon industry and our ability to benefit from this growth by increasing our production capacity and improving our cost structure and polysilicon purity.""I am pleased with our performance in this quarter and our ability to remain flexible and rapidly adapt our business to a challenging market environment. EBITDA during the quarter was $31.0 million and we generated $67.1 million in cash flow from operations during the first half of 2018. We are one of the very few polysilicon producers able to continuously generate positive EBIT, net income, and operation cash flow in this challenging market environment. In addition, we expect to complete our Phase 3B expansion project and start pilot production in the fourth quarter of 2018, which will increase our annual capacity to 30,000 MT and further reduce our polysilicon production cost by approximately $1 per kilogram across our entire production facility. We believe that demand for our high-quality polysilicon products will continue to grow over the long-term as solar PV is becoming increasingly cost competitive and less dependent on government policies and subsidies. Our strong balance sheet, sufficient operating cash flow and newly added capacity coming online will help us to further solidify our position as the polysilicon manufacturing leader."Other Corporate DevelopmentsIn April 2018, the Company issued 2,064,379 ADSs, representing 51,609,475 ordinary shares, through a follow-on offering, at $55.00 per ADS. The proceeds, net of underwriting commission and issuance cost, were $106.6 million.In May 2018, Xinjiang Daqo New Energy, one of the Company's subsidiaries, voluntarily delisted from the China New Third Board for better use of our resources and to save unnecessary listing costs, because the effectiveness and efficiency of financing activities on the China New Third Board did not meet the Company's expectations.Outlook and guidanceThe Company will begin a scheduled maintenance shutdown for its Xinjiang polysilicon facility in September, which is expected to impact polysilicon production by approximately 2 to 3 weeks based on current maintenance plans. During this period, in additional to the scheduled annual maintenance work, the Company will also connect the newly constructed phase 3B facility to its existing facilities, upgrade technology across all of its facilities and install various manufacturing efficiency projects.  As such, the Company expects to produce approximately 4,100 MT to 4,300 MT of polysilicon and sell approximately 5,900 MT to 6,100 MT of polysilicon to external customers during the third quarter of 2018. The above external sales guidance excludes shipments of polysilicon to be used internally by the Company's Chongqing solar wafer facility, which utilizes polysilicon for its wafer manufacturing operation. Wafer sales volume is expected to be approximately 7.0 million to 8.0 million pieces for the third quarter of 2018. For the full year 2018, the Company expects to produce approximately 22,000 to 23,000 MT of polysilicon, inclusive of the impact of our annual facility maintenance.This outlook reflects Daqo New Energy's current and preliminary view as of the date of this press release and may be subject to change. The Company's ability to achieve these projections is subject to risks and uncertainties. See "Safe Harbor Statement" at the end of this press release.Second Quarter 2018 ResultsRevenuesRevenues were $67.0 million, compared to $103.3 million in the first quarter of 2018 and $76.0 million in the second quarter of 2017.Revenues from polysilicon sales to external customers were $63.0 million, compared to $95.6 million in the first quarter of 2018 and $61.1 million in the second quarter of 2017. External polysilicon sales volume was 3,881 MT, compared to 5,411 MT in the first quarter of 2018, and 4,497 MT in the second quarter of 2017. The decrease in revenues from polysilicon was primarily due to lower polysilicon sales volumes and lower ASPs. The Chinese government issued new solar PV policies on May 31, 2018, which are expected to reduce solar installation quotas and feed-in tariffs in China during the second half of 2018. This created uncertainty in the domestic solar market and negatively impacted downstream demand.Revenues from wafer sales were $4.0 million, compared to $7.6 million in the first quarter of 2018 and $14.9 million in the second quarter of 2017. Wafer sales volume was 9.8 million pieces, compared to 13.3 million pieces in the first quarter of 2018 and 27.0 million pieces in the second quarter of 2017. The sequential decrease in revenues from wafer sales was primarily due to lower sales volumes and lower ASPs.Gross profit and marginGross profit was approximately $27.2 million, compared to $46.2 million in the first quarter of 2018 and $24.2 million in the second quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP gross profit, which excludes costs related to the non-operational polysilicon assets in Chongqing, was approximately $27.6 million, compared to $46.6 million in the first quarter of 2018 and $24.8 million in the second quarter of 2017.Gross margin was 40.6%, compared to 44.8% in the first quarter of 2018 and 31.9% in the second quarter of 2017. The sequential decrease was primarily due to a decrease in ASPs which was partially offset by a decrease in average polysilicon production cost.In the second quarter of 2018, total costs related to the non-operational Chongqing polysilicon assets including depreciation were $0.4 million, compared to $0.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 and $0.5 million in the second quarter of 2017. Excluding such costs, non-GAAP gross margin was approximately 41.2%, compared to 45.2% in the first quarter of 2018 and 32.6% in the second quarter of 2017.Selling, general and administrative expensesSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $7.8 million, compared to $4.8 million in the first quarter of 2018 and $4.5 million in the second quarter of 2017. The increase in SG&A was primarily due to the increase of non-cash share-based compensation costs related to the Company's 2018 share incentive plan.Research and development expensesResearch and development (R&D) expenses were approximately $0.2 million, compared to $0.1 million in the first quarter of 2017 and $0.3 million in the second quarter of 2017. Research and development expenses can vary from period to period and reflect R&D activities that took place during each period.Other operating incomeOther operating income was $1.9 million, compared to $0.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 and $0.8 million in the second quarter of 2017. Other operating income mainly consists of unrestricted cash incentives that the Company received from local government authorities, the amount of which varies from period to period.Operating income and marginAs a result of the foregoing, operating income was $21.0 million, compared to $41.7 million in the first quarter of 2018 and $20.2 million in the second quarter of 2017. Operating margin was 31.4%, compared to 40.4% in the first quarter of 2017 and 26.6% in the second quarter of 2017.Interest expenseInterest expense was $3.4 million, compared to $4.1 million in the first quarter of 2018 and $5.3 million in the second quarter of 2017.EBITDAEBITDA was $31.0 million, compared to $51.7 million in the first quarter of 2018 and $29.8 million in the second quarter of 2017. EBITDA margin was 46.3%, compared to 50.0% in the first quarter of 2018 and 39.2% in the second quarter of 2017.Net income attributable to Daqo New Energy Corp. shareholders and earnings per ADSAs a result of the foregoing, net income attributable to Daqo New Energy Corp. shareholders was $13.4 million, compared to $31.6 million in the first quarter of 2018 and $12.1 million in the second quarter of 2017. Earnings per basic ADS were $1.06, compared to $2.91 in the first quarter of 2018 and $1.15 in the second quarter of 2017.Financial ConditionAs of June 30, 2018, the Company had $179.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, compared to $83.0 million as of March 31, 2018 and $49.8 million as of June 30, 2017. As of June 30, 2018, the accounts receivable balance was $0.3 million, compared to $2.0 million as of March 31, 2018 and $3.8 million as of June 30, 2017. As of June 30, 2018, the notes receivable balance was $19.3 million, compared to $49.7 million as of March 31, 2018 and $10.5 million as of June 30, 2017. As of June 30, 2018, total borrowings were $195.7 million, of which $92.9 million were long-term borrowings, compared to total borrowings of $217.8 million, including $108.4 million long-term borrowings, as of March 31, 2018 and total borrowings of $219.3 million, including $123.1 million long-term borrowings, as of June 30, 2017.In April 2018, the Company issued 2,064,379 ADSs, representing 51,609,475 ordinary shares, through a follow-on offering, at $55.00 per ADS. The proceeds, net of underwriting commission and issuance cost, were $106.6 million.Cash FlowsFor the six months ended June 30, 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was $67.1 million, compared to $73.6 million in the same period of 2017. The decrease was primarily due to an increase of inventory balance, as well as payment of tax expense.For the six months ended June 30, 2018, net cash used in investing activities was $52.5 million, compared to $32.9 million in the same period of 2017. The net cash used in investing activities in the first half of 2018 and 2017 was primarily related to the capital expenditure on the Xinjiang polysilicon projects.For the six months ended June 30, 2018, net cash provided by financing activities was $93.2 million, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $23.4 million in the same period of 2017. The increase was primarily due to net proceeds from follow-on offering.Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresTo supplement Daqo New Energy's consolidated financial results presented in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("US GAAP"), the Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures that are adjusted for certain items from the most directly comparable GAAP measures including non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin; earnings before interest, taxes, Depreciation & Amortization ("EBITDA") and EBITDA margin; adjusted net income attributable to Daqo New Energy Corp. shareholders and adjusted earnings per basic ADS.  Management believes that each of these non-GAAP measures is useful to investors, enabling them to better assess changes in key element of the Company's results of operations across different reporting periods on a consistent basis, independent of certain items as described below. Thus, management believes that, used in conjunction with US GAAP financial measures, these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with meaningful supplemental information to assess the Company's operating results in a manner that is focused on its ongoing, core operating performance. Management uses these non-GAAP measures internally to assess the business, its financial performance, current and historical results, as well as for strategic decision-making and forecasting future results.  Given management's use of these non-GAAP measures, the Company believes these measures are important to investors in understanding the Company's operating results as seen through the eyes of management.  These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with US GAAP or intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with US GAAP; the non-GAAP measures should be reviewed together with the US GAAP measures, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.Non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin includes adjustments for costs related to the non-operational polysilicon assets in Chongqing. Such costs mainly consist of non-cash depreciation costs, as well as utilities and maintenance costs associated with the temporarily idle polysilicon machinery and equipment, which will be or are in the process of being relocated to the Company's Xinjiang polysilicon manufacturing facility. The Company expects a majority of these costs, such as depreciation, will continue to occur as part of the production cost at the Xinjiang facilities subsequent to the completion of the relocation plan. Once these assets are placed back in service, the Company will remove this adjustment from the non-GAAP reconciling item. The Company also uses EBITDA, which represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and EBITDA margin, which represents the proportion of EBITDA in revenues.  Adjusted net income attributable to Daqo New Energy Corp. shareholders and adjusted earnings per basic ADS exclude costs related to the non-operational polysilicon assets in Chongqing as described above.  Adjusted net income attributable to Daqo New Energy Corp. shareholders and adjusted earnings per basic ADS also exclude costs related to share-based compensation. Share-based compensation is a non-cash expense that varies from period to period. As a result, management excludes this item from its internal operating forecasts and models. Management believes that this adjustment for share-based compensation provides investors with a basis to measure the company's core performance, including compared with the performance of other companies, without the period-to-period variability created by share-based compensation.A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to comparable US GAAP measures is presented later in this document.Conference CallThe Company has scheduled a conference call to discuss the results at 8:00 AM Eastern Time on August 7, 2018.The dial-in details for the live conference call are as follows:Participant dial in (toll free):+1-888-346-8982Participant international dial in:+1-412-902-4272China mainland toll free:4001-201203Hong Kong toll free:800-905945Hong Kong-local toll:+852-301-84992   Participants please ask to be joined into the Daqo New Energy Corp. call.A replay of the call will be available 1 hour after the end of the conference through August 14, 2018.The conference call replay numbers are as follows:US Toll Free:+1-877-344-7529International Toll:+1-412-317-0088Canada Toll Free:855-669-9568Replay access code:10122848To access the replay using an international dial-in number, please select the link below.https://services.choruscall.com/ccforms/replay.htmlParticipants will be required to state their name and company upon entering the call.ABOUT DAQO NEW ENERGY CORP.Daqo New Energy Corp.

Do trade wars hurt business? Ask QualcommCNN WireJuly 24, 2018 Tuesday 8:53 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 686 wordsByline: By Julia HorowitzDateline: NEW YORK (CNNMoney) BodyNEW YORK (CNNMoney) --  Plenty of companies have been caught up in President Donald Trump's trade wars. Few have been jerked around more than Qualcomm.On Wednesday, the San Diego-based chipmaker will have to abandon its $44 billion acquisition of the Netherlands' NXP Semiconductors if it fails to gain approval from regulators in Beijing. The deal, first announced more than 20 months ago, has been held up by the Chinese government for months amid the trade fight with the United States. China could pull through and greenlight the merger at the last minute. But the situation is uncertain at best."If I were to lean one way or the other, I would lean toward no deal," said Susquehanna International Group analyst Christopher Rolland, who tracks semiconductor companies.If the deal doesn't go through, Qualcomm will have to pay NXP a $2 billion termination fee.Qualcomm has been caught up in the president's trade fights before.In March, Trump blocked Broadcom's $117 billion bid for Qualcomm over national security concerns, an extraordinary move. The Trump administration is also considering tariffs on semiconductors imported from China. A trade organization that represents Qualcomm says that would hurt member companies.The trade war whiplash has exacerbated Qualcomm's recent struggles. The company makes most of its money licensing smartphone radios and chips, but two of its biggest customers, Apple and Huawei, are fighting Qualcomm over royalty payments. Apple could also move to use Intel chips - and not Qualcomm chips - in its new iPhones this year.Meanwhile, Qualcomm has faced regulatory scrutiny all around the world. The European Union fined it $1.2 billion in January for antitrust violations, three years after China fined it nearly $1 billion for an antitrust issue. "It's just been one thing after another," said Stacy Rasgon, a chip analyst at Bernstein.Qualcomm declined to comment Tuesday.Qualcomm announced its merger with NXP in October 2016, hoping the deal would allow it to expand into new businesses. Qualcomm focuses on smartphone chips, and NXP has expertise in microchip security and chips for cars.Since then, the market has shifted. Demand for chips has been solid, and NXP's earnings haven't been as strong as expected, Rolland said.This could cushion the blow for Qualcomm if the deal falls through. Qualcomm has also said it'll pursue a stock buyback if it can't buy NXP, which would appease many investors.There's still time. According to the agreement between the two companies, Qualcomm has until 11:59 p.m. ET Wednesday to get approval from Chinese regulators. It's the last endorsement the companies need to complete the deal.Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf told The New York Times last week that the company won't seek an extension past Wednesday, when the company reports earnings.In China, the call now rests with political leaders, according to Paul Triolo, who specializes in global technology policy at Eurasia Group. He sees "very little upside and tremendous potential for downside" if Beijing doesn't give its OK. Triolo expects the deal to be approved.He noted that even though the United States has eased penalties on Chinese phone and telecom equipment maker ZTE, the US government still holds tremendous power over the company. The Chinese government won't want to put ZTE in danger again, he said.Triolo predicted the decision will come down to the wire.In recent months, US tensions with China have repeatedly roped in Qualcomm.Besides the Broadcom deal, which was scuttled after US officials raised concerns that it would give China an edge on 5G technology, Qualcomm faces complications from potential American tariffs on chips imported from China. On Tuesday, the Semiconductor Industry Association, of which Qualcomm is a member, made its case against the possible tariffs at a hearing in Washington.US companies often send mostly finished chips to China for assembly, testing and packaging. They could then face tariffs when these chips are shipped back in to the country.TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

The Scrap Vehicle Recycling Market in China 2018-2022 - ResearchAndMarkets.comBusiness WireJuly 31, 2018 Tuesday 2:25 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Business Wire, Inc.Distribution: Business EditorsLength: 492 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "Research Report on China's Scrap Vehicle Recycling Industry - 2018-2022" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.In 2022, the scrap vehicle recycling volume will exceed 5 million and the market size will exceed CNY 50 billion, representing a CAGR of 28.1% from 2018 to 2022.Vehicle consumption becomes increasingly popular in China with the development of economy and increase of income. On the assumption that the service life of passenger vehicles is between 8 to 10 years, the number of scrap vehicles had exceeded 6 million by 2017 and will grow at an annual rate over 10%. However, only 1.47 million scrap vehicles were recycled in 2017. Many scrap vehicles are still being used or were illegally disposed. For example, some of them were reassembled or refurbished to be sold as second-hand vehicles.Owing to the poor industry regulation, legal scrap vehicle disposal has been affected by the illegal one. To promote the development of the industry, the Chinese government is improving relevant policies. It is expected that the new version of Regulations on Vehicle Recycling Management will cancel the quota on the number of scrap vehicle recyclers, and allow the circulation of scrap vehicles' engine, steering gear, transmission, front and rear axles and frame to qualified manufacturers for remanufacturing. This policy change will greatly expand the market of scrap vehicle recycling.The combination with "internet+" will help legal recyclers to deal with the penetration of illegal recyclers. Moreover, e-commerce platforms will facilitate the recycler's communication with vehicle owners and downstream parts remanufacturers to increase the industry's profitability. The broad market prospect and favorable policy environment will attract a great deal of capital to the industry.Topics include:• Development environment of China's scrap vehicle recycling industry• Volume and market size of scrap vehicle recycling in China• Competition in China's scrap vehicle recycling industry• Major scrap vehicle recycling enterprises in China• Factors influencing the development of china's scrap vehicle recycling industry• Forecast of market size of China's scrap vehicle recycling industry, 2018-2022Companies Featured• Tianjin Xinneng Renewable Resources Co.

U.S. Faces 30-year Test of Its Resilience, Says Former National Intelligence Chief ClapperTargeted News ServiceAugust 30, 2018 Thursday 8:11 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1738 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: HUNTSVILLE, Alabama BodyThe University of Alabama's Huntsville campus issued the following news:Global geopolitical events during the next 30 years will test the resilience of the United States, particularly in regard to chief adversaries Russia and China, former U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Wednesday in a speech at The University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH)."How we manage to sustain and protect the attributes of our resilience will be what makes all the difference, and really that is up to us," he said, adding that he is confident the country can rise to the challenge as it has risen to other challenges in its past.The retired U.S. Air Force lieutenant general, who has more than 50 years of military and intelligence experience, also told Redstone Arsenal officials, defense industry executives and local economic and political leaders in the audience that he is "not a big proponent of the Space Force as a separate branch of the services."A Space Force would only require about 20,000 people and at that size is too small to be a separate branch, Clapper said."If the issue is not enough emphasis - money - being placed in space, then OK, but we do not need a separate force," he said. Raising the issue will result in more attention being paid by the other branches of the military, Clapper said.Clapper spoke at UAH as part of the university's Distinguished Lecture Series. The series brings nationally recognized guest speakers to Huntsville to enhance community collaboration and assist the development of Redstone Arsenal. It fosters better understanding of current events and future trends, how they impact the federal organizations at Redstone and how they could influence U.S. reaction to world events and the nation's future exploration, discovery and technological development.Clapper served from 2010 to 2017 as the fourth director of national intelligence, the nation's top intelligence official and the principal intelligence advisor to the president. He held one of the broadest portfolios in the government, overseeing 200,000 intelligence employees internationally, a $52 billion budget and high-profile organizations like the CIA, NSA and FBI.Russia and China pose the greatest existential threats to the U.S., Clapper said. To a lesser degree, North Korea and Iran are also troublemakers for the U.S."Russia remains the greatest near-term threat over the next five years, or as long as Putin is around," he said, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. "Russia poses a fundamental threat to our institutional way of life, and we give them an easy target."The Russians have engaged in robust cyber espionage that includes "implants in our infrastructure that are just sitting there ready to be used when they see fit," Clapper said. Moscow also possesses a doomsday nuclear weapon that could create death and destruction along the U.S. East Coast and is probably operating in violation of nuclear treaties in several areas of weapons development, he said."Putin has a tremendous resentment of the U.S.," Clapper said. "Plus, the fact that he was a KGB officer colors how he thinks about us."Russian submarines regularly run reconnaissance on the U.S. undersea cable communications network that carries a lot of vital communications traffic, Clapper said, resulting in the re-establishment of the U.S. Navy's Second Fleet in the North Atlantic in response to Moscow's assertiveness."Their reconnaissance has assumed Cold War proportions," he said.Clapper said Russian interference in the U.S. internally includes election interference and also a broad effort to sew doubt, dissension and distrust among American citizens in order to discredit the government and cast doubt on the veracity of truth."I never expected such a direct, aggressive and multifaceted attack on our systems as the Russians did in 2016," said Clapper, who played a pivotal role in uncovering the likely parties at work behind the 2016 hack of the Democratic National Committee and who briefed then-incoming president Donald Trump at Trump Tower in 2017 on Russian election interference intelligence.He said Trump was reluctant in that meeting to accept any intelligence that might be construed as questioning the legitimacy of his election and has been reticent to establish a hard line with Putin on the subject."The evidence for the magnitude of Russian interference is overwhelming - just the forensic evidence - and it is very disturbing to me that he won't call him out on that," he said. "I felt a duty and an obligation, after spending 50 to 55 years in defense of our country, to speak out about that."Although Clapper said he told Trump no evidence of collusion had been found, he said attempting to establish collusion is a "standard Russian technique, and I am sure that they employed it in the Trump organization in order to try to get something going."While Moscow is a formidable near-term threat, the long-term outlook for Russia is not good, Clapper said. The country remains reliant on a mineral extraction economy and it has a large population of aging males that in the future will render it militarily unable to mount a sustained conventional campaign.China is the longer-term existential threat to the U.S. and is uniquely so because the Chinese and U.S. economies are so inextricably intertwined, Clapper said."The fact that our economies are so well bound together moderates that threat to some degree," he said. Still, the Chinese economy is on course to surpass the U.S. by 2020 and become the largest economy in the world.China's focus on becoming an economic power, its science and technology push, its penchant for stealing intellectual property, its "One Belt, One Road" drive to modernize infrastructure, its deals with other countries to build infrastructure in exchange for access to raw materials and its trade practices all are continuing threats to the U.S., said Clapper."Trump's got a point," when it comes to trade, tariffs and China, he said. But those trade efforts may be limited by a ballooning U.S. debt."What I worry about is, the Chinese own a lot of our debt, and if they should decide to call in that debt, it could cause major economic problems for us," Clapper said. "Our greatest long-term internal threat is our debt."The Chinese are setting specific areas in science and technology where they want to dominate, he said, and in June 2016 China surpassed the U.S. in supercomputing.China is also modernizing its military in the areas where the U.S. has strengths.Yet the greatest impediment to Chinese expansionism is its aging population, Clapper said, and projections show that future pension funding could become a major economic problem for the country."A growing population that's growing older, with growing demands, will make it harder for the Chinese government to keep stability," he said.China is interested in North Korea as a buffer between U.S. forces in South Korea and itself, Clapper said."What China doesn't like is North Korea imploding, and they lose their buffer state."He served in South Korea in the mid-'80s as director of intelligence on North Korea and describes the atmosphere in North Korea as "paranoid.""My views on North Korea were heavily influenced in 2014 when I went there to get two of our citizens out from imprisonment in forced labor," he said. "North Korea is not going to denuclearize. Pyongyang went to school on Libya's Muammar Gaddafi and they know how that turned out."North Korea presently has enough fissionable material to create 30 to 60 nuclear weapons, Clapper said, and he believes it has the means to deliver them, as well. In the North Korean view, having that capability makes it an equal with the U.S."I believe the reason for their 'good behavior' is that they believe they have what they need for deterrence," Clapper said.President Trump lost an opportunity to leverage his recent visit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un, he said. "He did not leverage the simple fact that he was there, which was seen as an incredible event inside North Korea."Clapper said an opportunity to ask what North Korea would need to feel secure without nuclear weapons and to attempt to define what each country means when it talks about denuclearization was lost."When Pyongyang looks south, it sees a formidable conventional army arrayed against it," he said. "They realize the profound conventional disparity between themselves and South Korea."He'd like to see the U.S. and North Korea establish interest section offices with each other to normalize relations and prevent misunderstandings, as the U.S. did with Cuba. An interest section is staffed below the level of ambassador and provides a conduit for information purposes, as well as intelligence abilities. Establishing a Pyongyang office would also provide a measure of assurance to North Korea that the U.S. would not bomb its capital, Clapper said.South Korean President Moon Jae-in is "an extremely astute leader," Clapper said. "They have a more intense interest in reducing tensions." That intensity makes close coordination between South Korea and the U.S. priority, he said.In the Mid-East, "there is no question that Iran is a serious threat, in terms of its missiles and its proxies," Clapper said.As far as he knows, Iran remains in compliance with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action under which it destroyed much of its nuclear production capability, Clapper said."But for whatever its own reasons were, our administration chose to back out of this deal," he said. "I don't believe we'll ever put Humpty Dumpty back together again, in terms of the kind of international cooperation it takes to get another deal. What we did played to the hardliners in Iran."While Iran is a major concern, its role as a disruptor is limited by its faltering economy, internal corruption and consequent high inflation and unemployment, Clapper said. These forces have sparked demonstrations fueled by information spread through millions of cell phones."I believe the revolutionary theocrats are on the way out," he said.Globally, Clapper said the U.S. role is currently in a state of flux."There is great uncertainty among our allies about our long-term leadership role," he said. "When people are in trouble and they call for help, they don't call for Russia or China or some other country, they call for us."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6427514 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: August 31, 2018End of Document

Candidate Backs Universal Health Care For Illegal Immigrants; PETA Attempts To Erect Tombstone To Honor Dead LobstersMORNINGS WITH MARIA MORNINGS WITH MARIA 8:00 AM ESTAugust 30, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; DomesticLength: 6796 wordsByline: Dagen McDowell, James Freeman, Robert Wolf, Blake Burman, Newt Gingrich, Hillary Vaughn, Morgan Ortagus, Jeff Flock, Stuart Varney, Gerri WillisGuests: Jennifer MorganBodyDAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: And a sign of easing trade tensions with Europe. The European Union, the trade chief there saying those countries are willing to cut car tariffs, get rid of them if the U.S. will do the same. We look at European markets losses across the board at the moment although contained. All three market gages there down about half of one percent.In Asia overnight the major gages, closing mostly lower, the Nikkei eking out a small gain to the upside. Trump versus tech, the President going toe-to-toe with Google accusing the search giant of bias against conservative voices. Google hitting back with its own evidence. Retail in the red, we've got more retailers reporting earnings this morning. Abercrombie and Fitch and Dollar General sliding ahead of the open.Abercrombie and Fitch down almost 10 percent in premarket trading. We break down those numbers. And an Apple acquisition, the iPhone maker just bought a company that makes lenses for augmented reality. We'll find out what new device the house of jobs might be getting in to.And then there's this. Many lobsters were killed in a truck crash in Maine. Now PETA wants to erect a memorial to the crustaceans that were lost. Here to break it all down, national security analyst Morgan Ortagus, Borrowed Time co-author, James Freeman, and 32 Advisers founder and CEO, Fox Business contributor, Robert Wolf. Made you laugh. I think that was the point. I think that's the point.JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Sounds like one delicious memorial, maybe we could have a separate ceremony at dinner one evening.MCDOWELL: Growing up in the south, I would just say -- I asked 10 people who were not above eating road kill, so I think you all could pull your chairs up to the same table, James Freeman.FREEMAN: That's some good road kill.(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: I think that PETA has a sense of humor. There we go. Good to see you.ROBERT WOLF, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: Good to be here.MCDOWELL: Good to see you. So we're -- we've got a lot more coming up in this hour. Former Speaker of the House, Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich, SAP Americas and Asia-pacific Japan President, Jim Morgan is here, the host of "VARNEY & COMPANY", Stuart Varney. All of those fine folks coming up.President Trump tweeted this morning once again this morning. The only thing James Comey ever got right was when he said that President Trump was not under investigation. Comey still on his mind. And now onto our top story this hour. A trade deal on the horizon. Growing optimism over U.S. negotiations with Canada. Blake Burman is on that story at the White House live for us. Blake, good morning.BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Hi there Dagen, good morning to you as well. Talks to set to resume between the United States and Canada, Canada's minister of foreign affairs and top trade rep here in the U.S. About an hour from now at the top of the 9:00 hour, it has been two days of intense negotiations at the highest levels and it appears as if the United States and Canada are getting closer.President Trump when asked about this yesterday said that things are going "really well." And this was his responses when he was asked if he's optimistic that the two sides can come to a deal.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think so. I think Canada very much wants to make a deal and I think it's going to be obviously very goods for Canada if they do and I think it's probably not going to be good at all if they don't. We have a very good relationship.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURMAN: The Trump administration set a deadline for Canada of Friday, tomorrow to either come to some sort of a compromise with the U.S. or at least show that they are willing to move forward so that the administration can go to Congress here at home and say that things are moving in the right direction with Canada. The Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland saying yesterday that she feels there is a spirit of compromise.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRYSTIA FREELAND, MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF CANADA: I do. I feel that both parties are coming to this stage of the negotiations with a lot of good will. Certainly that is what Canada is bringing to the table.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURMAN: Meantime, Dagen, the European Union's top trade rep this morning saying that the E.U. would be willing to go to zero tariffs on autos, so long as the United States do the same, if that were to happen and it is an if at this point, that would no doubt be a major win for President Trump and that statement today from the E.U. goes beyond the framework that the U.S. and E.U. said that they would work upon when it was announced here at the White House last month, Dagen.MCDOWELL: And maybe a win for people who would love a cheaper pickup truck.BURMAN: Right, right.MCDOWELL: Because again we've got a 25 percent tariff on imported light trucks in this country. Good to see you, Blake.BURMAN: You too.MCDOWELL: Blake Burman live at the White House. Joining me now, former speaker of the house, Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich. Your current -- your take, Mr. Speaker, on the current trade negotiations.NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, things going very well for Trump, and United States. In fact there's lots of people thought he couldn't get a deal with Mexico. He clearly is going to have a deal with Mexico. That's a huge breakthrough. And sets the stage for a much better relationship with the incoming new Mexican President. At the same time the Canadians I think sort of thought they could sit it out for a while.And now they're having to play catch-up, and United States is so key to the Canadian economy that they have to get to an agreement. The Canadians cannot afford to have the U.S. start applying tariffs in other things that would stop them. So I think Trump is in a strong position, the only question I would raise about the European offer are they going to continue to value-added tax where they get to rebate for their autos.And then apply the tax to our cars and isn't that in effect the same as tariffs? So, I think you've got to enter a European negotiation with a full understanding of the different gimmicks they use to protect their market.MCDOWELL: But Mr. Speaker, Newt, this is actually why I've been -- I've been negative on the tariffs that the Trump administration has used because it is essentially a value-added tax on imports in this country. It's a tax that ultimately would be passed on to consumers, but given this deal that they've been able to negotiate with Mexico moving on to Canada, how quickly do you think we could get a deal.And actually get some concessions from China on the fact that that nation steals our intellectual property trying to put a stop to that, trying to put a stop to the forced surrender of our own technology. Again, the naysayers with this President often are wrong and I would admit that but what about China?GINGRICH: Well, China is a much harder case because you're now asking the Chinese government to give up what the Chinese government is doing. You know, intellectual property theft in China is not random behavior, it's actually a division of the people's liberation army based right outside of Beijing. And they do it as a deliberate act of government policy. So you're asking them to profoundly change how they've operated.I think we ought to be very tough with them. And I do think they are rattled by the way in which Trump is marching down the road. And the fact the Trump understands, we, you know, the Chinese need us, 10 or 15 times more than we need them. And he is in a very strong position. My guess is that they'll turn to Europe next and then towards China just because Europeans seem rattled and should have done the deal.But Trump is beginning to prove that he can actually negotiate international trade in a way that no so-called expert thought he could.MCDOWELL: Mr. Speaker, let's just talk about President Trump was tweeting about the stock market promising more great things to come. But there is so little focus on the left by the Democrats on what is really going on in this country on the ground in terms of this incredible economic growth that we've seen. In the quarter, the last quarter fastest pace in nearly four years.Estimates that are north of four percent at least for the current -- the quarter that we are in wages fastest growth in a decade, optimism among consumers highest it's been in 18 years. New record-highs on the stock market. This is a huge opportunity for Republicans as we head into the midterms to highlight this over and over and over and over again.GINGRICH: Well, look, I think there is a huge opportunity here because as the Democrats respond to Trump by going further and further to the left and getting crazier and crazier, they're creating this huge gap, I mean, look at the Florida outcome as an example, look what Gavin Newsom is promising in California as the Democratic nominee who wants to apply universal healthcare to people who are here illegally.Which could make California the recipient of medical refugees from entire planet. You know, the message could be if you get sick go to California, they want to take care of you. These kind of ideas are permeating the Democratic Party right now. And the liberal media is not doing the Democrats any favor by allowing them to get further and further and further out of touch with reality.And as you point, the reality is I believe the numbers that came out this morning, we've had a bigger increase in the media and income in the last year than in the eight years of Obama combined. That's a remarkable achievement by Trump. And I think it will make him stronger and stronger.MCDOWELL: It's almost comical though that some of the Democrats are now worried about the debt and deficits, these are Democrats who didn't vote for the tax cuts, they don't believe in giving -- allowing individuals to keep more of their money, allowing corporations to make decisions that are in their best interests, interest of the company, interest of the employees but now that they're -- one of the talking points I've actually heard more than once from people, who come on our air is that they are now worried about inflation.That an -- oh, inflation is eating up more than the wage gains that we have in this country and it is high comedy, Newt.GINGRICH: Look, I think the Democrats have a huge problem. They've never gotten over Hillary Clinton losing. That was a psychotic moment for them would happen so suddenly. And the result is, they wake up every morning knowing Trump did something wrong, I wonder what it is. And that's how they spend all day every day, and so they can't -- they can't unlock, they can't come to grips with what is a rapidly changing world.Look, in Florida, a Democratic nominee for governor of Florida is promising the highest business tax rate in the south. Now, what's that going to do? It's going to drive jobs out of Florida. Gavin Newsom is campaigning in favor of a higher gasoline tax in California. Every time you turn around, the Democrats shows up ask him, how much are they going to raise taxes to pay for the government-run healthcare proposal?Our estimate for California alone is maybe 4$0 billion a year in higher taxes. That's the kind of self-worth. They're simply spinning out of touch with reality and I think that will bite them very badly this fall.MCDOWELL: This garbage, I never took math in school, Medicare for all proposal that you hear some people on the left. We would have to more than double the amount of money that the Federal government takes in from corporate and individual taxes in this country and it still wouldn't pay for it over a 10-year period. That's how the math doesn't add up. At the same time they don't -- you can't touch or even try to fix Medicare or Social Security, Newt.Again, it's just -- it's not living in a world of reality, a reality where people have bigger paychecks, 90 percent of people have larger paychecks this year and it's not Nancy Pelosi making decisions with your money, it's you sitting at home whether you live in Iowa, Missouri, or Oregon.GINGRICH: Well, look, I think it's pretty simple. Medicare for all is Medicare for none because the whole system would collapse. The fact is most Americans don't want government bureaucrats running their health system. I think all these big ideas collapse when you start looking at them in the real world. And that's why I think if the Republicans are prepared to run an aggressive campaign of a big choice they may have a surprising outcome this fall just as we did in 2016.Remember, up until election night 2016, all of the experts thought Hillary would win. I think the same thing we may be about to face same reality this year and suddenly have a huge Republican gain in the Senate and potentially I think actually have the Republicans increase House seats rather than losing. If that happens, the level of shock on the left will be unbelievable.MCDOWELL: Newt, really quickly with the President taking on Google, worried about conservative speech being suppressed by the social media companies. Do you think that he will regulate or is it just talk?GINGRICH: Well, I think at a minimum, we need hearings to bring in, you know, Twitter, Google, Facebook. I mean, these large institutions are really quasi public. And you cannot have them dominating information space only on behalf of left wingers. I was frankly very surprised by how biased they have been. And I think you've got to look, and I don't know what solution is yet but you at least got to get it out in the open.And at the minimum places like Google and Facebook ought to have advisory groups that are genuinely both liberal and conservative with real power to supervise and to police it and make sure that every citizen has the real fair opportunity to communicate.MCDOWELL: Amen, sir. Amen. Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich. Great to see you as always.GINGRICH: Good to see you.(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: Coming up. Augmented Apple. The tech giant's ambitions with A.R. glasses. Plus, a new plan for PETA. Why the animal rights group wants to say good-bye to some lobsters in a very unusual way later this hour.MCDOWELL: President Trump tweeting on. Here is what the President just said, I am very excited about the person who will be taking the place of Don McGahn as White House Counsel. I like Don but he was not responsible for me not firing Bob Mueller or Jeff Sessions. So much fake reporting and fake news. Yes. Bob Mueller is still there, Jeff Sessions still there. But -- we want to remember that was Robert Wolf, you want time to comment.WOLF: Biting my tongue.MCDOWELL: Yes. But right now we want to remember the maverick, a political icon, war hero, the first of many memorials taking place yesterday for the late Arizona Senator John McCain. Thousands of people lining up in 100 degree temperatures to pay their respects at the state's Capitol. Hillary Vaughn is in Phoenix with more details particularly on that service that's going to happen later today. I think it's at 1:00 East Coast time. Hillary?HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Dagen. 1:00 p.m. East Coast Time. The service will start here at the North Phoenix Baptist Church. But earlier yesterday thousands of people gathered in this triple- digit heat to pay their respects to Senator John McCain. The last person walking through the Capitol at 9:00 p.m. yesterday evening, some of the McCain kids made a surprise visit to those late night visitors at the Capitol.Sidney, Jimmy, Jack, and Doug shaking hands and sharing touching moments with supporters who wanted to pay their respects, the private ceremony yesterday at the Capitol was the first of several events planned for the remainder of this week to celebrate the life and legacy of John McCain.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. DOUG DUCEY (R), ARIZONA: He fought like hell for causes he believed in. He plowed through election after election with the energy and focus of a warrior. But along the way, he did it with humor and humanity. And without compromising the principles he healed so dear.(END VIDEO CLIP)VAUGHN: Senator McCain will be escorted by his family from the Capitol at 9:00 a.m. local time this morning. They will make their way here to the North Phoenix Baptist Church for memorial service. Along the way they expect thousands to stand along the motorcade route at the ceremony here. Former Vice President Joe Biden will give an address along with Governor Doug Ducey who will be in attendance.Over 22 sitting Senators will also be here at the church for the memorial service along with staff and players from the Arizona Cardinals and also the Arizona Diamondbacks which McCain was a very big fan of, Dagen.MCDOWELL: It was every person, every speaker, every song, every detail planned over a period of several months by Senator John McCain. And it's an incredible way watching it yesterday, the people lining up to pay their respects and look forward to watching it later today of what he meant to the people of Arizona and how much that state and it's incredible breathtaking beauty and the people how much it meant to him. Thank you so much, Hillary Vaughn.We'll be right back.MCDOWELL: Eyeing progress on trade. The next round of talks with Canada, they start in less than an hour. The uncertainty over deals weighing on business across industries. Joining us now, SAP Americas and Asia Pacific Japan President, Jennifer Morgan. Jennifer, SAP is one of the worldwide leaders in business software applications clients in over 180 countries. How are these trade disputes impacting customers and businesses as you see it right now?JENNIFER MORGAN, PRESIDENT, SAP AMERICAS AND ASIA PACIFIC JAPAN: What's interesting, I was -- I was with a big CPG company yesterday, I was with an aerospace company the day before and one of them said, every morning when I wake up, I look at the news to understand what do I need to think about in my supply chain. How do I need to think differently and what do I need to pivot?And this is exactly what we do. This is our bread and butter. Helping customers understand how to have most agile supply chain and how to pivot and how use technology to your advantage. So in times of uncertainty this is where we can really help our customers.MCDOWELL: So you would actually benefiting from the uncertainty.MORGAN: We're helping customers work through it.MCDOWELL: But have you seen in terms of businesses making big changes or holding off on investment decisions, holding off on decision-making because they don't know what's going to happen with these trade negotiations?MORGAN: I see them really leaning into technology because the only way to really cope with -- to cope with the change is through technology. And it's -- we're in a real time economy, and so these companies have to think in very different ways. So, now I see really leaning in.WOLF: Jennifer you and your company had an amazing kind of past year.MORGAN: Yes.WOLF: Talk about, you know, the growth of your cloud business. I heard it's like up over 40 percent and what's making you grow, you know, literally at a better pace in the market?MORGAN: Yes. We had great growth in K2, we have 40 percent revenue growth in the cloud. Really (INAUDIBLE) across all of our regions and industries. Digital transformation is obviously front and center. A lot of M&A activity that we see out there, companies have to think about how they can very quickly embrace those companies, get the synergies that they need. I'd say the other trend is around companies thinking about the consumer experience.Companies right now, the companies that will really thrive are the ones who are really thinking what is the experience that my consumer wants to have with my brand. It's not just about the buying experience but it's about the entire experience and companies who want to get direct to the consumer have to also make sure they got the right planning in place, supply chain, inventory so that you get the experience that you want.Not upfront but across the whole time for that customer.FREEMAN: So you've been -- sounds like seeing good results everywhere but the larger picture seems to be the U.S. doing really well, rest of the world not so great. Are you kind of thinking maybe the rest of the world is perking up, going to be growing faster based on what you've seen?MORGAN: Yes. I was -- I spent most of summer in both Europe and Asia and for us that's a really strong part of our business. Europe is a big part of our business. We saw great growth in our European businesses and in Asia you really -- the CEOs are leaning in, we had a big CEO event in Tokyo and that was great because these CEOs are leaning into the direct to consumer to really by the digital transformation.So our business has done very, very well, you know, across all the different regions. Mexico last week interesting, I was down in Mexico meeting with some of our largest retail customers as well. Same thing, same thing down there, moving to the cloud trying to get the cost down.WOLF: The President also said he loves Mexico.MORGAN ORTAGUS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. I heard a little bit about that conversation.MCDOWELL: And Canada. He did not leave Canada out.WOLF: No. I just want to give them those --(CROSSTALK)FREEMAN: -- Mexico to pay for.MORGAN: I didn't say that.ORTAGUS: Really quickly I want to get your quick take. We reported earlier that California is considering mandating one woman being onboard, you're a woman who clearly in a very high profile position in corporate America. Your take.MORGAN: So, I would -- I think most women, I know myself included, I silt onboard of Bank of New York Mellon. I want to be recognized and put in positions based on my accomplishments and I think most women, most underrepresented minorities feel the same ways. I think it comes down to leadership, right? CEOs have it in their power to put women and underrepresented minorities in leadership positions.Boards have the ability to do this. I look at our board at the bank, we got 25 percent women on that board. It's a leadership issue. I think it's all of the above. I don't think it can be solved with just a quota.ORTAGUS: Right.MCDOWELL: Promotion and reward based on merit.MORGAN: Yes.ORTAGUS: Very interesting.MORGAN: Yes.MCDOWELL: No. I think that that's what -- that's what we wish for everybody.MORGAN: Yes. And we have great -- and we have to help people get there. When you focus on people, the numbers follow.MCDOWELL: Thank you so much, Jennifer.MORGAN: Thanks for having me.MCDOWELL: A pleasure to see you.MORGAN: Thank you very much.MCDOWELL: Jennifer Morgan. A war of words between New York Governor Cuomo and his primary rival Cynthia Nixon.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D), NEW YORK: My opponent lives in world of fiction. I live in world of fact. Can you stop interrupting? Can you stop interrupting?CYNTHIA NIXON (D), GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE, NEW YORK: Can you stop lying?(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Oh, the other (INAUDIBLE) from last night's debate straight ahead. And President Trump heads to Indiana. Jeff Flock is there and he's going to talk to some real folks. Hey, Jeff.JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Oh, you know, Dagen they say the imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. I don't know. The person not supposed to be here for another 12 hours but he might already be here. We'll have an exclusive interview with that fellow right there in just a moment.MCDOWELL: Welcome back. I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Thursday, August 30th, your top stories at 8:30 a.m. Eastern. Breaking news, we just got initial jobless claims, they came in at 213,000. We are watching that -- we were expecting 214,000. We also got a look at personal income and spending for the month of July. Personal spending up four- tenths of a percent in line with expectations. Same story with personal income, it was right in line with what economists were looking for, gaining three-tenths of one percent. We also look at these, the personals consumption, expenditures. This is the Federal Reserve's most important gauge of inflation, gaining 2.3 percent. The core there up two percent. So, inflation based on that in check, wages still growing faster than inflation.Futures are showing this this morning, 57-point gain -- no, excuse me, 57- point loss on the Dow Futures. Losses in Europe, to tell you about, those markets lower as well, ever so slightly looking at England, France, and Germany down about half of one percent. In Asia overnight, there was a single gainer there, the Nikkei up not even one-tenth of a percent in overnight trading.The deadline approaches, trade talks with Canada kicking off again this morning, President Trump optimistic that Canada will join the new trade deal with Mexico before tomorrow's deadline.Spat in the city, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and primary rival Cynthia Nixon kicking it up a notch in last night's gubernatorial debate.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CUOMO: My opponent lives in the world of fiction, I live in world of facts. Can you stop you interrupting? Can you stop interrupting?NIXON: Can you stop lying?CUOMO: Yes. As soon as you do.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Wait until you hear what else they said to one another. California Senate making it harder for young people to buy guns, we have the latest details on the vote to change the legal age, coming up.It's an Apple acquisition, the iPhone maker just bought a company that makes lenses for augmented reality. We'll find out what new device might be coming out of the House of Jobs. And tragedy on the highway, many lobsters were killed in a truck cash in Maine. Now, the seafaring victims may get a memorial from their friends at PETA.To our top story this half hour, President Trump heading to Evansville, Indiana for a rally tonight. Jeff Flock already on the ground this morning where he's talking to diners at the Merry Go Round Restaurant ahead of the President's visit. Hey, Jeff.FLOCK: You can't make this stuff up, Dagen. You know, if you don't wonder whether this is Trump country or not, I don't know. Maybe a picture tells a thousand words here. Although, I tell you, it's interesting, you know, you talk to people, we sometimes come into town before these rallies just to get a sense of the people of what they're about. A lot of people like the President's policies, not of them -- all of them are crazy about the President himself, although this girl, I think is. Now, you look like somebody I might know.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, I'm going to be in town a little bit later in and out of the Ford Center.FLOCK: There you go. I don't know if that's real but there you go. And you're a supporter of the President.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.FLOCK: A farmer?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.FLOCK: Why?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I just believe that he's going to do good for the markets eventually. Going to take a while to get the instability out of him, but --FLOCK: If he raising corn and soybeans, and of course, those prices are pretty far down. Yes, go ahead.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't think Indiana is no longer a flyover state because Donald has been here twice down the last two years. He cares about Midwest.FLOCK: There you go. I hear you, sir. I hear you. I want to represent everything fair and balanced over there, I got a table full of Democrats, too, and we want to get a sense from them, too. These guys meet here frequently -- boy, man, they can eat, too. Hey, Larry, I'm sorry to interrupt you.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No problem.FLOCK: Lifelong democrat.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, sir.FLOCK: A schoolteacher, you support the President right now.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: oh, I'm a convert, for sure.FLOCK: What happened?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, I saw back when Clinton was in office, and what happened with the things he did in office, so a big change in the attitude of kids.FLOCK: Teachers, school tearchers?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, I mean, when we catch somebody red-handed, they're doing something they deny, deny, deny.FLOCK: But now, wait a minute, what about this president here?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, I've changed my philosophy a little bit. I'm voting for policy not people. And I -- I'm impressed with what Trump has done and capable of doing with his hands tied.FLOCK: With the -- not so impressed with the tariffs?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, I'm not. But if you look at history, there has been a lot of Presidents have been questionable.FLOCK: I guess you're right on that one.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There it comes a point in time where, yes, you want America to be better than it is, and I can't understand the Democrats --FLOCK: I got you --UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Open walls and higher taxes.FLOCK: Larry, I appreciate it. You can tell, Larry, is actually democrat, because if you look down there, Kyl, he may be wearing overalls but he got a pair of flip-flops on, that's a dead giveaway right there. Thank you.MCDOWELL: Is that how we judge somebody's political affiliation now, Jeff Flock, I really don't think that's fair. And those folks in Indiana sound a lot like me.FLOCK: The father of superficiality.MCDOWELL: No, I said those folks in --FLOCK: We're pretty far south here. We're pretty far south. You know, these folks from Indiana, this is Southern Indiana, and we're south of Louisville here, so pretty amazing.MCDOWELL: Pretty amazing. You tell that fellow I said that on the air, earlier, it's policy not personality, so you tell him I said that.FLOCK: I think it makes a lot of sense to a lot more people these days.MCDOWELL: It does. Jeff Flock, thank you so much for that. James Freeman, your reaction to what you heard. I love that line about Indiana is not a flyover state anymore because the President has been here twice recently.FREEMAN: And I'm not sure how representative that crew is but suggests maybe there are -- there is some patience on the part of farmers. They don't like these tariffs but they feel like we're generally heading in a good direction, and I would say, Robert, you might have a better sense of the incumbent Democratic Senator Joe Donnelly, looks like he's going to have his hands full this November with Mike Braun.WOLF: Yes, I think -- listen, Joe Donnelly is a -- you know, he's a blue collar guy, he fits incredibly well with police and fire, and the farmers, and a popular guy in Indiana. That being said, Trump is incredibly popular in Indiana and there's going to be a real battle on the swing states in the Senate whether it's here or Montana, or Missouri, and there's a slew of them where it's I think a strong Democratic incumbent who's good locally against an incredibly popular national President in those -- in those states. And then also, that's why right now most of them are flipping.ORTAGUS: Will he -- will he vote for Kavanaugh?WOLF: I think that -- my gut tells me that Kavanaugh will, you know, be on the Supreme Court. And that some of the swing state candidates will likely vote for Kavanaugh. You know, I can't say I love the process, obviously, I think there's -- there was better ways to go about it, especially, based on the past. But I think right now, the Democratic Party has to realize that they're in a battle in these swing states in the Senate.MCDOWELL: There are 10 -- there are 10 democratic senators who are up for re-election in states that Trump won. 10.WOLF: And I would say some of them. I look at someone like Manchin and Casey (ph). They're probably in pretty good shape in West Virginia and Pennsylvania look at someone like Kyrsten Sinema and the fellow running, Phil Bredesen in Tennessee and Arizona. They probably have a better chance. And then, you have a real group of us toss-ups I think it's going to be quite interesting, you know, what happens, and a lot will be based on what the economy does, you know, right into the midterms.MCDOWELL: Well, part of the problem for some Democrats and you'll -- we can talk about the language that we used to describe them, was kind of highlighted in New York. Things got heated. There was the gubernatorial debate between Governor Andrew Cuomo, and Cynthia Nixo, the actresss political new comment. Just listed.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CUOMO: My opponent lives in a world of fiction, I live in the world of fact. Can you stop interrupting? Can you stop interrupting?NIXON: Can you stop lying?CUOMO: Yes. As soon as you do.NIXON: We already have a corrupt corporate Republican in the White House, we don't need a corrupt corporate Democrat in Albany as his main opposition.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: A lot of what you heard when you talk about abolishing ICE, she tosses that out there like it's a foregone conclusion, and what did the governor call members of ICE? He took a shot -- he took a shot at basically members of law enforcement in this country. This is -- theseWOLF: Thugs.MCDOWELL: Thugs -- these individuals are pushing people left. Do you agree or not? You don't even want to call him Democrat.WOLF: Listen, I -- (INAUDIBLE) you know I'm not part of the populous left. I'm definitely, you know, socially to the left and probably more physically conservative than most Republicans are today.MCDOWELL: He's talking about trade.FREEMAN: When I -- when I look at that debate, that doesn't make me feel good living in the State of New York. I think actually Governor Cuomo will do a really good job for the State of New York. I think that when we're debating whether ICE is important or not, I don't think that's a debate we should be having. I think the debate should be more about the economy and what they can do policy, not whether the air condition should be at 76, 76 or 68.MCDOWELL: That's how petty it is.FREEMAN: And so, you know, that's -- it is disappointing for me but as someone in New York and as a Democrat, I think Governor Cuomo will be the right guy, and I don't think we should be pushed left as a party. I like people like Tim Ryan out of Ohio who actually is a pro-growth democrat. That's someone that's taking about not that $15.00 minimum wage is important, but that a little wage is important. There is -- sorry, go ahead.MCDOWELL: No, but I was going to say, here's the problem, that these loudmouths in the major cities, in California and in New York, they drive the messaging for a lot of Democrats and this is what people across the country hear if they turn on other television networks. And I've spend so much time down helping taking care of my mother, down in Rural Virginia. And people who live in these big cities, who live in these blue state bay are missing what is going on in this country, and they are missing out people feel about the economy and about President Trump, again, policy over personality.FREEMAN: Well, I think a lot of people in Upstate New York watching that debate were disappointed thinking it was like watching a fight for mayor of New York City, where was -- they wanted to hear a lot more about how you revive growth in the cities, outside of New York City, upstate New York, and I don't think they got too much on that last night.MCDOWELL: And you know what, you loosen up those dairy restrictions of exports going into Canada you know that helps upstate New York big time. Coming up, eye on retail earnings we break down the numbers next.MCDOWELL: Amazon may soon join the trillion-dollar club. Gerri Willis on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with more. Hey, Gerri.GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Hey, Dagen, that's right. So, pretty exciting stuff. We've been watching Amazon shares here all morning trading just below that 2000, level 1997.50 not far to go from here, and, of course, to join that 2,000 -- to join the trillion-dollar club with Apple, they'd have to hit 2050.57. So, that will be the benchmark for that. Very exciting stuff. We'll keep an eye on it. Meanwhile, if you are getting used to these retailers coming back, the brick-and-mortar retailers doing really well. Think about it again, Abercrombie and Fitch missing on same-store sales three percent versus 3.7. A disappointment there, the shares trading lower, as you can see, down 10 percent. Also, Dollar General same-store sales beat estimates 3.7 percent but the full- year profit outlook was disappointing. Interesting there, mix of business, went to low margin consumable items like toothpaste, not good, Dollar Tree also missing same-store estimates. That stock down as well. So, these brick-and-mortar stores, not doing so well here. Back to you, Dagen.MCDOWELL: Gerri, thank you so much for that. Turning to politics, Newt Gingrich was talking about this earlier, California Gubernatorial Candidate Gavin Newsom is now backing universal health care for illegally immigrants. Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GAVIN NEWSOM, LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA: I did universal health care when I was mayor, fully implemented regardless of pre-existing conditions (INAUDIBLE) and regardless of your immigration status. (INAUDIBLE) is the only universal health care plan for all undocumented residents very proud of that and we proved it can be done without bankrupting the city. I'd like to see that we can extend that to the rest of the state.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Mr. Varney, the host of "VARNEY & COMPANY."STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Forgive me for rolling my eyes, but that is final lunacy. It looks like, to me, the socialists are having an increasingly important role to play within the Democrat Party. Just put California aside for a moment, look at Florida, a socialist -- an avowed socialist has made it to the gubernatorial final in Florida. In New York, last night, the avowed socialist Cynthia Nixon, I think she won the debate against Governor Andrew Cuomo.And now, you've got California where Gavin Newsom as we just heard is going for universal health care for all illegals in the state. Who's going to pay for that? Well, business and the rich. Can you imagine the exodus of businesses and relatively wealthy people from California if they put this kind of thing in place? Can you imagine the welcome sign that he's hanging out for everybody, anybody who's sick anywhere in the world, all you got to do is get one foot in California and you are home free! Financial lunacy!MCDOWELL: Nine minutes away, more of Stuart. We love you. We'll be right back.CASONE: -- sent to Democratic Governor Jerry Brown for his signature. Well, Apple is setting its sights on Augmented Reality, the company confirming it's acquired a Akonia Holographics, it's a start-up that makes lenses for Augmented Reality glasses. The term is not disclosed. Apple won't discuss what it plans to do with Akonia, but the deal could help the company develop an augmented reality headset. Apple shares are slightly higher ahead of the opening bell.And then, there is this, animal rights group PETA is trying to erect a 5- foot tall granite tombstone at the site of a lobster truck crash that happened in Brunswick, Maine. About 7,000 pounds of lobster were destroyed last week in the wreck. So, the average size for a lobster was a pound and half, that means about 4500 lobsters died in this crash. Well, I mean, it died before but you know what I'm saying. Maine's Department of Transportation is currently reviewing the tombstone that PETA wants to put up in their memory. PETA says it hopes the tombstone will, quote, remind everybody that the best way to prevent such tragedies is to go vegan. Yes. I will send that back to you. You just chew on that one for a minute.MCDOWELL: You know, rather than scolding people who choose to eat meat and seafood, they're trying to use a little bit of humor and trying to be light about it, PETA. I would just -- James is still laughing, he's been laughing --(CROSSTALK)FREEMAN: That's what -- I wasn't sure if it was a gag from PETA or --MCDOWELL: Well, it's not really a -- it's sort of a gag -- no, I -- you know what, I don't -- I'm not going to lecture anybody about what they eat, but that means meat eaters shouldn't lecture me about eating vegetable.FREEMAN: Well, OK.MCDOWELL: Meantime, Jared Kushner arriving moments ago for the latest round of trade talks with Canada. Those talks set to begin in less than four minutes. We'll be right back.MCDOWELL: Thank you so much, Robert Wolf, James freeman, and Morgan Ortagus. You get five seconds Morgan, and you're the only other lady here, so --ORTAGUS: Thank you. I just want to say, Dagen, yesterday, you and I watched the processional for Senator McCain. We're all going to be watching over the weekend and honoring a great man.MCDOWELL: This afternoon, 1:00 p.m. Stuart, take it away.VARNEY: I certainly will, and good morning, Dagen. Good morning, everyone.Load-Date: August 30, 2018End of Document

Hello.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: I am. They were pushing me - - my chair forward. So --CASONE: You got to get right in the spot Dagen, right on.MCDOWELL: It's one of those mornings and I wasn't even late. So --CASONE: You never are.MCDOWELL: Yes. I got like four new bruises this morning. Ladies, thank you so much, great to see you both. And I've already made James Freeman laugh and it's 5:59 in the morning.Hey everybody, I'm giving it away who's on the show this morning. I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Thursday, August 30th. Your top stories at 6:00a.m. Eastern.Looking good as we inch closer to the deadline tomorrow, officials from the U.S. and Canada optimistic that a trade deal will be reached.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think Canada very much wants to make the deal and I think it's going to be obviously very good for Canada if they do and I think it's probably not going to be good at all if they don't.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau saying a deal could be reached only if it's good for Canada.Investors are still worried about trade but we have had day-after-day of new all-time highs on the S&P500, NASDAQ, and the Russell2000. This morning we have a picture that's lower to the downside, Dow Futures off by 844 points at the moment.As I pointed out, we had record highs yesterday for your broad market gauges hitting their fourth consecutive record close.In Europe take a look at England, France, and Germany.

We have the details of the incredible deal.Duck and cover, the world's biggest food fight, you won't believe how many people were there to chuck tomatoes at one another.All that and so much more coming up this morning, National Security Analyst Morgan Ortagus. Borrowed Time Co-Author James Freeman. Actually, that's on my reading list.JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good.MCDOWELL: I bought it on my Kindle. And 32Advisors Founder and CEO, Fox Business Contributor Robert Wolf.ROBERT WOLF, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: Great.MCDOWELL: Has clearly been on the golf course a lot.WOLF: Yes. A little -- a little bit. I mean, if you call my hacking golf. Yes.MCDOWELL: Well as much as your -- as much as you play, your game should be good and better.WOLF: Yes, it's not. But I'm fun to play with. I mean -- but the game is not getting much better.MCDOWELL: And you were fun to spend a morning with us.WOLF: I'm glad to be here with James and Morgan and You.MCDOWELL: And glad -- thanks for the --FREEMAN: Likewise.MCDOWELL: Thanks for the courtesy laugh at 5:58 in the morning.FREEMAN: I got to thank you for the book plug. So you realize you don't have to read it as long as you buy it.WOLF: Yes. I'm reading it too. I'm going to just say I'm reading it too because I want to plug it.MCDOWELL: I am reading --MORGAN ORTAGUS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I haven't bought it or read it but I'll buy it.MCDOWELL: It is about Citi Group.FREEMAN: Yes, that's right.MCDOWELL: It is about the bubblelicious Citi Group, the rise and fall.FREEMAN: Yes.MCDOWELL: The rise and fall.FREEMAN: You're wondering their history and really strong bank before the government was standing behind it. Then once the government got behind it, not such a good history.WOLF: Well as a former Salomon Brothers guy that was bought by Citi Group that's now run by a former Salomon Brothers guy, I'm rooting for them. So I hope the book is rooting for them.MCDOWELL: Well we're here --FREEMAN: Well, it's topped with fate.WOLF: How about that?MCDOWELL: As we will be all morning long and everything that we talk about whether it's trade, the market, there was that debate last night between the candidates for the governor of New York.And also coming this morning, CFRA Investment -- Chief Investment Strategist Sam Stovall. Former White House Press Secretary, Fox News Contributor, Ari Fleischer. Senate Finance Committee Member, the Senator one of two, from Pennsylvania, Pat Toomey. Former Speaker of the House, Fox News Contributor Newt Gingrich. And SAP America's President Jen Morgan.We have some incredible guests coming up. But right here right now, optimism on trade, both President Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sounding optimistic about reaching a trade agreement by tomorrow's deadline. The commander-in-chief commenting on the negotiation yesterday at the White House.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I think Canada very much wants to make the deal and I think it's going to be obviously very good for Canada if they do and I think it's probably not going to be good at all if they don't. We have a very good relationship.They came yesterday to the White House and we negotiated late into the evening, they're in the White House right now, we're negotiating with them right now and they want to be part of a deal. And we gave until Friday and I think we're probably on track. We'll see what happens.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Do we get a deal by tomorrow James Freeman? Here's my quote that I wrote down from President Trump, "I love Canada. I love Mexico." So there you go. If he's sounding positive that way, it can't be bad.FREEMAN: Yes. That is progress, isn't it? And, yes, I think they get a deal. Remember, they don't have to agree on every phrase, every comma, and period right now. They just have to basically agree on where they're going and they've got this timeline to move it through the various legislatures.But I think they will get a deal because although consumers aren't going to necessarily like it to buy autos, the Canadian government likes what the U.S. did with Mexico. They liked these new efforts to keep manufacturing in the U.S. and Canada versus Mexico. So I think there's a lot of reason for Canada to cut a deal and we buy 75 percent of their exports.MCDOWELL: To get into the ways because we love doing that Morgan, the two sticking points for Canada -- the United States wants more access to the -- to selling dairy into Canada and then Canada wants to keep these existing dispute resolution panels that are used to resolve conflicts about tariffs among the three countries.But that sounds like in the grand scheme of things, ideas that can be resolved or problems that can be resolved.ORTAGUS: I think you're right. I think something else that this administration has said that they want to resolve with Canada is I.P. protections and that was -- that has been written into the new agreement, the new proposed agreement with Mexico.And the USTR has been actually quite tough on Canada's position on I.P. and that's been a real sticking point for them in addition to dairy farmers. The real challenge I see with all of this Dagen is that no matter what comes -- no matter what happens whether it's just a deal with Mexico or whether it's fully renegotiated NAFTA, this is going to slip into 2019.For congressional approval you'll need -- they'll need approval from both the House and the Senate. Clearly there's a chance that we're looking at least the Democrat House. So the strategy there, you know, will the -- will the democrats especially someone like Bernie Sanders who supported a trade agenda similar to the president, will they support this or leading up to 2020? Are they going to oppose this deal just simply because it's something that Donald Trump negotiated?MCDOWELL: Well let's ask this big old democrat.WOLF: Well listen, I think I've been to the right of the conservative party on trade because I've been for TPP, I've been for iterating NAFTA. So I don't mind as a former advisor to the president on export counsel, I'm a supporter of this.I think the president trying to do NAFTA2.0 is a good thing. If we can iterate, OK, where there's better labor standards in Mexico that brings the pricing up, so we're not -- cheap labor is not the beneficiary of kind of the detriment to the U.S., those are good things.That being said, whether it's tomorrow or a week from tomorrow, or a month away, I think we should just make sure we get the best possible deal, OK, for both sides. That can, you know, stand the time. That being said, we should also, you know, make changes throughout.One of the problems with NAFTA1.0 is we haven't really changed it in over two decades. So this is important to have the right changes, it seems like it's in the right trajectory, and it certainly seems with Chrystia Freeland their trade minister flying back immediately to try to do something is a good sign.MCDOWELL: Right. She was scheduled to go to Europe to --WOLF: She -- right.MCDOWELL: -- this week and she said, "Hey, I'm staying in North America and head south."WOLF: And as far as the dems, you know, what I would say is that if it's a -- if it's a good agreement between Canada and Mexico, just not bilateral with Mexico, I actually think it will pass both the House and the Senate.MCDOWELL: Well they need that for fast-track status.WOLF: I think it will pass the boat.ORTAGUS: That's true.MCDOWELL: They need that for fast-track status.ORTAGUS: In addition to what Robert said about labor, there's also new rules on the environment, also on I.P. protection as we talked about. So I think there's some positive things that both parties could look to but the Journal did criticize this as, you know, Dagen, they called it, "Politically managed trade."MCDOWELL: Yes, James.FREEMAN: Yes.ORTAGUS: "The economic logic is the opposite of Mr. Trump's domestic deregulation agenda."MCDOWELL: Well the headline was --FREEMAN: True. Yes.MCDOWELL: -- it is notably worse than NAFTA, the original NAFTA in many ways. And you talk about the -- how they were court in the likes of Sherrod Brown in Ohio and Sherrod up for re-election this year.FREEMAN: Yes.ORTAGUS: Yes.MCDOWELL: Yes. Again, that this reads like something that democrats wrote or maybe even the auto unions, the original Mexico deal.FREEMAN: Yes. I think it may be hard for people like Sherrod Brown to turn this down because it does move in his direction. And for that reason I think that we should expect auto consumers are going to pay more.This is sand in the gears of the North American supply chains that have made it much more competitive here. It is -- it is not so great for Mexico but good for Canada and the U.S. auto sector in terms of unionized labor there.So that's -- look, but I -- there's no reason in the world the president if he gets something on dairy should not give Canada what they want a dispute resolution because once he gets the NAFTA he wants, he doesn't need to put on any more tariffs. So there's no reason he shouldn't be able to --MCDOWELL: Give up -- give on them.FREEMAN: -- give on that issue.MCDOWELL: We have $650 million dairy trade surplus with Canada. So there's -- you know, it's a great talking point on the campaign trail. But the fact is that we benefit mightily from imports into Canada --FREEMAN: Yes. But we'd sell a lot more if they didn't have the barriers they have.MCDOWELL: Very, very -- well, I want to move -- I want move along to China.WOLF: Listen -- sorry, go ahead Dagen. That's how (INAUDIBLE) move to.MCDOWELL: China's commerce ministry saying today that trade issues with the U.S. can only be resolved through talks as equals. So do we see China getting ready for a drawn-out fight where certainly businesses in this country that whether they export to China, whether they import goods from China or watching that $200 billion mark that China -- that the United States is talking about, additional tariffs on that.As the Wall Street Journal Editorial Page today writes about how because of retaliatory tariffs, the cherry farmers in the Pacific Northwest have lost $86 million on sweet cherries just this summer, James?FREEMAN: Yes. This has cost. I mean, I -- when we talk about optimism for getting a deal here, it's not that I think these deals are all wonderful. Higher tariffs, more barriers are a negative as we're seeing in NAFTA.I hope he -- the president focuses on his message to the E.U. which is let's take tariffs down to zero everywhere, that ought to be the goal. I think this is going to take a while with China to resolve it but I think if he resolves NAFTA and he resolves it with Europe and you have them, the whole world focused on China and its intellectual property theft, I think China is eventually going to have to change.MCDOWELL: Real quick and then I'll get your comments on China and Europe because you mentioned Europe yesterday because Harley-Davidson has been a punching bag for the president. It was celebrating its 115th anniversary in Wisconsin yesterday.The American motorcycle maker coming under fire from the president because it said, "Hey, we got retaliatory tariffs from Europe, we're going to move some production overseas. Harley owners and Trump supporters sounded off at an event.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DEANNA KYROLE, HARLEY-DAVIDSON SUPPORTER: It is about bottom line and if he was controlling his business he would be doing the same thing, if not worst. At least they're trying their best to keep everything at home.MARTY GERNOWSKI, TRUMP SUPPORTER: I'm proud to have Harley here in Milwaukee and if they have to do what they have to do for a profit and make price in another country, then so be it.DAVID GULOTTA, HARLEY-DAVIDSON & TRUMP SUPPORTER: Harley-Davidson has survived for 115 years, you know. Through a lot -- through a lot more adverse situations than what they're dealing with right now, you know. The motor company will survive, I have faith in that.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: That just shows Robert that regular folks in this country voters whether they're right, left, or center, they are connected to what's going on with trade.WOLF: Listen, tariffs have unintended consequences. The idea that we're battling with Europe, OK, is absurd, OK? The truth is and I think as James pointed out and Morgan, our real concern is China.MCDOWELL: Uh-hmm.WOLF: I brought it up earlier and you've been bringing it up for a year now, we should stay in TPP and we should -- the best way to attack China is to have trading agreements with the 11 countries around China, Australia, New Zealand, Philippines.The idea that we dropped TPP because it was an Obama-led trade agreement is ridiculous, it's not the right thing. And my gut tells me if you look at what we're doing with Mexico and Canada, it actually is very similar to TPP. It's about labor standards, environmental standards.My gut tells me that will be the next thing we go after because a bilateral negotiation with China is not around the corner.ORTAGUS: Right.WOLF: Because it's all about -- as Morgan said it has to do with I.P., that's our biggest concern. There is nothing in the trade agreement that's going to withstand they are stealing our I.P.MCDOWELL: Final word Morgan.ORTAGUS: Well I think in addition to I.P. it's also about investment, right? And the type of restrictions on U.S. investment into China and what has always been incredibly worrying to me, Dagen, is, you know, the amount of Chinese communist propaganda that the regime makes American corporations spew put out on their social media when they do business there and that should be a concern for all American businesses.And this -- also the shady nefarious tactics of the Chinese government in the country, they'll put out misinformation about American companies that are doing business there to turn people away from and they've done it -- done it before and there's a lot that we don't see in terms of them retaliating against us, it's not just here on our shore.ORTAGUS: Right.MCDOWELL: Thank you Morgan, James, Robert. Oh boy, we've got so much to talk about. Salesforce sliding, shares of the business software maker taking a hit after strong earnings but a weak outlook. We'll tell you what the company CEO had to say too about taxes.And food fight, thousands turning out for Spain's massive tomato throwing festival, we've got the incredible pictures and we demo in studio. Straight ahead.MCDOWELL: People in Arizona saying goodbye to the late Senator John McCain at the State Capitol. Cheryl Casone has the details, Cheryl.CASONE: Yes. Dagen, good morning. There were about 15,000 people came to pay their respects to the late senator who served the state for 36 years in Washington.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JON KYL, FORMER ARIZONA SENATOR: John's love for America and Arizona. He represented our values all over the world as senator from Arizona and America is stronger for his fierce defense of our values. We can be proud he was our senator.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Today a memorial service will be held at the North Baptist Phoenix Church where former -- North Phoenix Baptist Church, excuse me, where Vice President Joe Biden is scheduled to speak and 24 sitting senators are going to be attending as well.Then his casket will depart Arizona and head for Washington. More services planned later this week.Well, Campbell Soup says that it plans to sell its international and refrigerated food businesses which bring in about $2.1 billion, this transaction will bring in that much. And this move opens the door to an outright sale of the company that sold possibility.Campbell Soup CEO Denise Morrison unexpectedly stepped down back in May, there's been a lot of pressure from shareholders on Campbell to do something. They're also going to be reporting the -- excuse me, they did beat on earnings and missed on revenue this morning. Shares of Campbell super low in the pre-markets.You've got the breaking news and you've got the earnings as well pressuring Campbell Soup. The stock is down more than a four and a quarter percent right now.Well, we're also watching Salesforce right now. The company's results coming in better than expected but the stock is under pressure this morning after they issued a disappointing earnings outlook for the third quarter.Co-CEO Mark Benioff also touting President Trump's tax cuts and deregulation. But the stock is down about three percent right now in the pre-market. This is the stock to watch today as well when the bells ring at 9:30.And then there is this, 20,000 people hurling tomatoes at each other at Spain's annual Tomatina Festival yesterday. This is known as the world's largest food fight. More than 30,000 pounds of tomato were thrown. For one hour people tossing each other with all of those, by the way, overripe tomatoes Dagen.And I like -- I like your thinking this morning that we should, you know, try and replay this in studio, you know, do our own version of a food fight. I'll work on that for the next hour.MCDOWELL: You know, that's a Tuesday afternoon at my place.CASONE: I think it looks fun. I wish I'd do it.WOLF: A little animal house action.MCDOWELL: Yes, exactly.WOLF: A little animal house action won't hurt anyone.MCDOWELL: Yes. I'm not going to do Robert Wolf. Guess what I am? A scene from animal house. Cheryl, thank you so much.Coming up, slamming big tech, President Trump targeting Google. Bernie Sanders takes aim at Amazon. We'll tell you about it ahead.Plus, Friends fashion.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOEY TRIBBIANI: OK buddy boy, here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: So did Balenciaga take a cue from Joey? You won't believe how much this layered look will cost you. It is an eye-popping price tag, that's ahead.MCDOWELL: Wall Street rally, stocks surging. The S&P500 and NASDAQ hitting all-time highs for the fourth day in a row. The technology sector and optimism over trade negotiations driving the major market gauges to those new highs including the Russell2000.Here now Sam Stovall, CFRA Research Chief Investment Strategist. Sam, how are you?SAM STOVALL, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH: Good, Dagen.MCDOWELL: Great to see you. Your reaction to this? The question in every investor's mind is can this market keep going? What would get in the way?STOVALL: Oh, I think it can. First though we have a trifecta of new highs, the S&P500, NASDAQ, Russell2000. So when you've got that kind of breath, when you have the widening out of the participation in this rally, that tends to be pretty good.We also recouped all that we lost in the correction from January 26th to February 11th. History basically says we go on to advance by almost nine and a half percent on average and we don't stumble again for another four months. So not to say that that's exactly how it's going to play out this time but usually when you hit a new all-time high that tends to add to investor confidence.WOLF: So just to play devil's advocate, although I'm rooting for the bull market, let's go back to our earlier years, you know, this reminds me a lot of 2000.STOVALL: OK.WOLF: OK? In 2000, we -- that was the last time --FREEMAN: Yikes.WOLF: Are you saying yes?FREEMAN: I was saying yikes.WOLF: OK. You'll see where I'm going with it then. In 2000 that was the last time consumer confidence was this high, OK? So we had the highest since 2000 announced last week.We were on the incredible trajectory and then all of a sudden 2000 comes and we had a two-year down trade, you know, starting with the dot.com bubble. It was all kind of, you know, a one-way direction and then all of a sudden we had the turn.My question is, long-winded, do you think with the raising rate environment, you know, fiscal deficit concerns and possibly based on where the yield curve is, the possibility of a slowdown based on what, you know, the yield curve's at least predicting for GDP. Does that change kind of your horizon and thoughts at all?STOVALL: I'm sorry, could you repeat the question?MCDOWELL: Hey, at least he admitted that.FREEMAN: I admitted it.STOVALL: I'm kidding you. I'm kidding you.WOLF: Don't forget here because, you know, James caught me off track --FREEMAN: I'm sorry I interrupted.WOLF: -- with the yikes. Did I talk about your book yet?MCDOWELL: Go ahead.STOVALL: No, those are good questions. First off, we're the second most expensive bull markets since World War II with trailing earnings being, you know, above the long-term average. Also on an S&P500 market cap to nominal GDP, we're more than twice as high as the average over the past 50 years.WOLF: This is kind of like a softball for you right now.STOVALL: Well -- but then comma, I think that we probably could --MCDOWELL: Semicolon, next thought. Go ahead.STOVALL: Well I got good grammar than most but my punctuation is pretty bad. I think that we probably still have some life left because we have never slipped into a bear market in the past 65 years when interest rates were below inflation where they are today.We'd have to see at least two more rate hikes before we even equal the year-on-year change in core CPI. And then we would have to have three more rate hikes next year just to get close to that threshold at first we -- the threat of falling into a bear market.So I still think that monetary policy is quite simulative at this point and with the Fed basically telling us what they're going to do, I'd like to say that a boxer is rarely fell by the punch he expects and at least it's not going to come from the Fed.FREEMAN: And I guess comparing the 2000 hoping maybe this isn't a reefed, you don't really see this sort of peps.com phenomenon of lots of non- companies that are public even though they're not really businesses and don't have real earnings.STOVALL: True. You're not really seeing the exuberance that typically bull markets look like incandescent light bulbs and tend to glow right just before they go out. So I'm not getting the questions from the newspaper vendors as to, "Gee, what stocks should I be buying or them telling me what stocks to buy?"So I agree, it's still -- investors are very skeptical about this events. And so as a result, it might have some life left.MCDOWELL: And they are willing to beat the, you know what, the stuffing out of a stock like Facebook.STOVALL: Oh sure.MCDOWELL: But when it misses and gives guidance that investors were shocked by, I know that Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft all hit new all-time highs yesterday but they're not buying every tech stock hand-over fist to your point.FREEMAN: And I wonder about the techs. I mean I look at regulation as probably good for the giants, they end up benefiting from it but do you look at that as a negative? Does that make you worried about these stocks we're talking about, the fangs?STOVALL: Well the -- I mean the fangs in opinion are very difficult from tech in general. Typically, tech is the best performing sector in a rising rate environment because they have the lowest dividend yields combined with companies need to add to their technology to improve the productivity of their -- of the employees that they're not going to be adding on to in the future.But I would say look toward the value side, if we see more gravitation, more interest in value stocks that implies and investors think that there's life and that they could actually sit with them for a little while while they recover.MCDOWELL: Sam Stovall, great to see you.STOVALL: Thanks Dagen.MCDOWELL: And thanks for the humor this morning before 6:30. Coming up, taking on technology, speaking of that, James mentioned more regulation or even some regulation on technology companies. President Trump renewing his attacks on Google, why he says that the platform is biases.And every day heroes, a police body camera capturing a dramatic rescue at sea. One of the rescued men refusing to leave his fishing rod behind, we have that story coming up.MCDOWELL: Good morning. I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Thursday, August 30th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.In looming deadline, trade talks with Canada, kicking off again, this morning, President Trump expressing optimism that Canada will join the new trade deal with Mexico before tomorrow's deadline.Checking the market action this morning, amid these trade talks, we have an 89-point loss on the Dow Futures right now, Futures are lower on the S&P and NASDAQ 100 as well, but yesterday, more records coming out of these markets, the S&P 500 and NASDAQ, hitting all-time highs, along with the Russell 2000.In Europe, markets are lower this morning, losses in England, France and Germany, to tell you about, the DAX down nearly one percent.And then, also, let's check on Asian markets, losses across the board except for a very, very slight gain on the Nikkei in Japan.Slamming Silicon Valley, President Trump, calling out Google, saying that the search giant promoted President Obama's State of the Union speeches on the site, but not his own, the President, speaking out about the tech company, yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I think that Google and Facebook and Twitter, I think they treat Conservatives and Republicans very unfairly. I think it's a very serious problem because they're really trying to silence a very large part of this country and those people don't want to be silenced. It's not right. It's not fair. It may not be legal. But we'll see. We just want fairness.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: How Google is responding, that's next. An incredible rescue, more video of this police officer saving three men from the water after their boat capsizes. We will show you that.And one for the record books, we'll tell you about the jaw-dropping contract extension for quarterback Aaron Rodgers, that will make him the highest paid player in NFL history.And please call the Fashion Police, where is Joan Rivers when you need her? Balenciaga unveiling a jacket with -- well, that looks like this, it looks like one shirt on top of a shirt, on top of a coat, on top of a sweatshirt, and it costs thousands of dollars, literally. We will tell you -- you have to stay with us, why people are comparing this style to Joey from Friends.But to our top story this half hour, Trump versus tech, the President making it clear that he wants fairness for Conservatives from major technology companies like Google and Facebook.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I think that Google and Facebook and Twitter, I think they treat Conservatives and Republicans very unfairly. I hear that they're holding hearings in Congress over the next couple of weeks.And I think it's a very serious problem because they're really trying to silence a very large part of this country and those people don't want to be silenced. It's not right. It's not fair. It may not be legal. But we'll see. We just want fairness.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Google firing back after President Trump tweeted a video in which he claims Google's homepage did not promote his State of the Union Address, even though President Trump -- President Obama's was highlighted.Here to discuss, Former White House Press Secretary, FOX News Contributor, Ari Fleischer. We talk about this on a business show because if this White House is going to move to regulate the tech companies because of some of its obvious bias, this is in dispute that would hurt business. What do you say, Ari?ARI FLEISCHER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Look, I don't mind politicians who occasionally throw high inside heat. Sometimes you need to do a little bit of that to make your people who oppose you in politics, back off a little bit, give you more fair coverage.But once it crosses the line with the government trying to regulate speech or regulate private sectors right to publish things, that's where I draw a line. So if he's throwing inside heat, God bless him, have at it. Don't hit the batter, though, and don't regulate.MCDOWELL: Morgan, you said the President, yesterday, did say he prefers not to pursue regulation of the internet giant. They're already -- it would be the DOJ, the FTC or the FCC that could add additional regulation.There are other things that the White House could do, but again, this at the moment. Just looks like a lot of talk.ORTAGUS: I think where the tech companies are right now is similar to where the banks were during the financial crisis, right? In terms of a complete --MCDOWELL: Meaning a government bailout?ORTAGUS: No, no, no. Not a government bailout, in terms of a regulatory perspective, not understanding where the winds are turning from both parties, right? And not getting out ahead of a lot of these stories.And I think they continue to be the big media companies -- tech companies, tend to be, especially social media, incredibly reactive still. And I call for them -- I know you, Dagen, have as well, to start enforcing more self- regulatory measures, because if they don't, the government will regulate for them.FLEISCHER: But let me stipulate, the government has no idea how to get this right (INAUDIBLE)ORTAGUS: That will stop them, Ar.FLEISCHER: Once you put a bunch of politicians in charge of speech in the tech industry, Facebook, Twitter, Google, it's going to turn into a fight over who gets the biggest political advantage as opposed to how to protect the most free speech. The cure for bad free speech is more free speech.FREEMAN: Can I -- can I just respond that --MCDOWELL: Yes.FREEMAN: Google did respond by saying and calling the President out that he was actually inaccurate.MCDOWELL: Well, here's what the Wall Street Journal writes today. Looking at the internet archive, this is that not -- non-profit that preserves historical snap shots. It appears to show that Google.com did promote President Trump's State of the Union at certain points during this year's speech and not at others.There's several snapshots of the page that don't show promotion of the speech. But, again, there does appear to be some promotion of the State of the Union.FLEISCHER: And I think it's fair, somebody needs to run it down to see whether or not Google promoted Trump as much as they promoted Obama. What the President put on Twitter was very clever. That video he had with Google promoting Obama, Obama, Obama, no Trump, very well done.But is it accurate? Is it fully accurate? I don't know that yet.MCDOWELL: I want to get James in here real quick.FREEMAN: I'm wondering, sort of, what you're hearing in terms of discussions within the administration. Because I think President Trump deserves a lot of credit for -- and his administration as appointees for not letting the FCC become the internet regulator, the way they regulated telephones.Now, it seems this idea that oh, we'll have the FTC, another federal bureaucracy become the internet regulators, kind of, gaining ground here. I could see a lot of these big companies wanting to do a deal. Are you -- how worried should we be about this? Because I'm very concerned, I don't know how fast you think this thing is coming down the pike.FLEISCHER: I think the true motivation for the White House is with all things, is protecting the President and protecting his image, because when you look at social media generally, Twitter, Facebook, it's biased against Republicans, it's biased against the President.Everybody sees it, and knows it, and feels it. So, he's throwing back in trying to get them to modify their behavior by dealing with Donald Trump. Oh, it does, which is blowing the whistle in public.There's a big difference between a public official blowing a whistle and signing a law. And he's right to blow a whistle. I don't want to see him sign a law because the government will botch it.MCDOWELL: Well, and also, we talked about -- there is obvious bias. Some of us have experienced or at least witnessed it in terms of Conservative speech on the social media platforms in particular. The bigger issue --And I've been warning these tech companies for literally, years, is the reckless disregard for people's privacy and how these companies actually make money off of our most personal information. And how they have essentially handed it off to companies and app developers, Facebook did for years, we didn't even know about it.FLEISCHER: Anybody who is on those platforms and puts their personal information on it and doesn't expect it to be shared is being naive. Once you tell everybody who your likes are, what your interests are, it's going to be shared. That's how they market it, that's how when you go on to Amazon, your product that you want to buy is already pulled up for you. There are also benefits to it.MCDOWELL: Yes, so you can't claim ignorance. You have to -- you have to be aware of what -- if you're getting something for free, it's not for free. You just don't know how you're paying for it.FLEISCHER: You want privacy, don't go online.MCDOWELL: Right. Thank you. Thank you, Ari. You know what, if you want privacy, don't walk the city streets nowadays because everybody's got a camera phone. You better be careful about cursing at somebody. Not you. I'm just saying in general.ORTAGUS: Are you serious, Dagen?MCDOWELL: You can't yell, you can't -- you can't yell anymore, not in the street. Speaking of New York and people yelling at each other, there was this bizarre back and forth between New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and candidate Cynthia Nixon in the first New York gubernatorial debate, just watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ANDREW CUOMO (D), GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK: My opponent lives in the world of fiction. I live in the world of fact. Can you stop interrupting? Can you stop interrupting?CYNTHIA NIXON (D), GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE, NEW YORK: Can you stop lying?CUOMO: Yes, as soon as you do.NIXON: We already have a corrupt corporate Republican in the White House. We don't need a corrupt corporate Democrat in Albany, as his main opposition.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Cuomo also doubling down on the Democratic talking point of abolishing immigration and customs enforcement, ICE. Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CUOMO: New York State is the state that is suing Donald Trump for ripping babies from the arms of their mother. New York State is the state that says we will not cooperate with ICE, they're a bunch of thugs. He politicized ICE. They're a bunch of thugs. We said we will sue them.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: That's the left going further left, Ari. What did you make of that?FLEISCHER: I think if I'm a law enforcement officer anywhere, local cop, sheriff, state police trooper, I'm offended, thugs, because they're enforcing the law and doing their jobs? I hate politicians who talk like this. It is so offensive to the people who protect us.MCDOWELL: But Cynthia Nixon has pushed him further left on this, don't you think?FLEISCHER: Well, that's the problem, and he's caving. Cynthia Nixon says she wants to abolish ICE. So, Cuomo has to act tough too, so he says they're thugs, wrong.ORTAGUS: Cynthia Nixon is right about one thing. She said that air conditioning is sexist. And considering Dagen and I are always freezing (INAUDIBLE) Cynthia Nixon is right, air conditioning is sexist.FREEMAN: Politics is local.MCDOWELL: What about a dose of what it's like to be in front of a live audience and there were supporters of Cynthia Nixon when he was bringing up like you live in the world of fiction, basically making fun of her television and acting career, that they booed him. You would hear it.FLEISCHER: Can I go back to what you said? Can I make you wear this tie? I mean, it's terrible. We need a colder studio.MCDOWELL: Yes, and we need -- we need better leadership in New York State. And I know -- we didn't see it last night. Coming up -- thank you, Ari Fleischer, thank you for the humor, so early in the morning.We tell you which state may soon become the first to mandate women on corporate boards.And then, this shirt on shirt on jacket on sweatshirt, how much it will cost you.MCDOWELL: California lawmakers taking a step to bring diversity to boardrooms, more chicks, they say, they mandate by law. Cheryl Casone has more. Hey, Cheryl.CASONE: Yes. You know, interesting -- I mean, certainly you may see more females in the boardroom or CEO, but lawmakers in California is taking this all a step further. They may soon require major companies that are headquartered in California have to put female directors on the board. Under this proposed law, boards will need to have at least one woman by the end of next year and at least two or three by the end of 2021. Those who don't will be fined. The law recently passed the state assembly and now heads back to the state senate and then the desk of Governor Jerry Brown. We'll keep you posted.And then there is this, a dramatic rescue off of a Florida's coast.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is everybody accounted for? I want to get everybody on the boat. Can you swim?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Grab the life ring.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Yes, that boat capsized. Police on Miami Beach released this body cam footage that shows three brothers that were rescued after their boat capsized. They had no life jackets on, by the way. Police believe that the boat was flipped by rough waters.And then, a little n nostalgia for you, Dagen. Remember this scene from "Friends""(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK, buddy boy, here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Yes. Well, it seems that fashion designer Balenciaga has taken inspiration from Joey of all people. At Paris fashion week, the company debuted this heavily layered jacket. If it is for you, it's $9,000. As you can see, it's got an outer coat, it's got layers, it's got a hoodie, it's like five different jackets. And then they also released this, this is kind of strange, red squared shoes. So, people on social media say it looks like a carton of McDonald's French fries. These are $545. I mean, you can't make this stuff up. That jacket reminds me, Dagen, of a guy that tried to go through TSA security wearing all of these clothes so he wouldn't have to check a bag. Remember that? This is what it reminds me of.MCDOWELL: But this is increasingly -- particularly what these fashion houses and women's fashion designers, it's like they're playing a joke on women. They're trying to see how foolish people will be with their money. It's literally $1,000 ripped gray sweatshirt.ORTAGUS: Well, I was just thinking that because air conditioning is sexist, I need this jacket.FREEMAN: I think they're playing a joke on men too, aren't they? That looks like the derelict campaign.WOLF: Listen, Steve Bannon was wearing that outfit for a year and no one said -- he had like four layers. He had the shirt, the under shirt, the --MCDOWELL: That officially -- you saying that will end that trend. It ended right now because --WOLF: I'm telling you, Bannon was wearing five or six layers.MCDOWELL: Sister, sister. Serena and Venus set to square off in round three of the U.S. Open. We've got the preview.MCDOWELL: Green Bay Packers Quarterback Aaron Rodgers has a lot of green coming his way. Jared Max has information on a record-setting contract extension. Hey, Jared.JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SPORTS REPORTER: Dagen, suffice to day, it's a beautiful day in Mr. Rodgers neighborhood. Set to begin his 14th season of the NFL. Rodgers signs a four-year extension that reportedly could be worth in the Mr. Rodgers neighborhood of $180 million. The breakdown, $134 million in base salary. $103 million of which is guaranteed an NFL record and a league high annual average of $33.5 million.We're going to see something tomorrow at the U.S. Open that we have not seen in over 20 years. Serena Williams won her second-round match at the U.S. Open on Wednesday in straight sets, 6-2, 6-2. Earlier, Serena's older sister Venus won her second-round match also in straight sets. And so, it will be an all sister affair. Tomorrow in flushing meadows not since January of 98, had the Williams sisters met this early in a grand slam tournament. Serena has won 17 of her 29 head to head matchups.MCDOWELL: Go, Williams sisters. My favorite athletes of all time. Continue.MAX: Defending Champion Rafael Nadal moved into the third round with a straight sets win, Wednesday night. However, 2012 champ, Andy Murray is done. He was eliminated in four sets by Fernando Verdasco.All right, let's cycle over to Major League Baseball. The operative word here is "cycle." When a player hits for a single, a double, a triple and home run of the same game, he hits for the cycle. Which is what the Brewers' Christian Yelich did against the Reds. He homered for the sixth time in his many games, and Milwaukee beat Cincinnati in 13 innings -- 13- 12 or 10 innings, I should say.Last in national league attendance for likely 13th time in 14 years, the Miami Marlins promise more noise at games next season. The team encourages its fans to get loud, bring musical instruments, bells, and whistles, and flags to games next year. The team says it offers the region's diverse Latin American culture to show pride, get loud an in one section of the ballpark. It will be called communidad tres, sero, cinco -- Community 305.Baseball and Budweiser, how about baseball and wine? Yes. Partnering with City Winery, the New York Yankees have opened a wine bar at Yankee stadium, which in addition to other wines and (INAUDIBLE) will offer Yankees' branded wines. City Winery's first permanent winery at sports stadium.MCDOWELL: I love it. Jared, thank you so much. And I'll shout out to the Williams sisters again. Jared Max with us. Straight ahead, Uber now looking to drone for food delivery. We'll tell you about it. That's on the next hour of MORNINGS WITH MARIA.MCDOWELL: Good morning.

Pudong New Area: Institutional changes are the real miraclePR NewswireSeptember 13, 2018 Thursday 9:00 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 846 wordsDateline: BEIJING, Sept. 13, 2018 BodyA news report by China.org.cn on China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone: If we look at China's coastal line as a bow, the Yangtze River is an arrow, and the city of Shanghai is the arrowhead. An even closer examination reveals the Pudong New Area at the very edge of the city. The former farmland and reed marshes have been miraculously transformed under China's reform and opening up process.In 1990, when the Chinese government decided to establish a new area in Pudong, the regional annual GDP was only six billion yuan. Last year, the figure had increased by 160 times to nearly 965.14 billion yuan. Today, Pudong has become an international metropolitan area full of high-rise structures, and the landmark Shanghai Tower, at 632 meters, is recognized as the world's second highest building.The fast development of Pudong can be attributed to the region's pioneering spirit. Great changes are taking place here on a daily basis. Currently, the most important program underway there is the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone. Opened in 2013, the zone is the first of its kind in China, providing the most convenient business atmosphere for enterprises. Today, a foreign enterprise can complete the whole business registration process in three days, compared to three to six months it might have taken in the past. Thanks to favorable policies, open and transparent systems and complete functions, the pilot free trade zone has become the first choice for foreign enterprises to access the Chinese market. World-famous companies establishing offices here include Microsoft, L'Oréal, PricewaterhouseCoopers , General Electric and Tesla.Economist Steven Ng-Sheong Cheungs says: "China's economic growth is not a miracle, institutional changes are the real miracle." Institutional changes have brought an obvious fascination and vitality. In less than 30 years, Pudong has seen tremendous changes.Most of the special economic areas established in China at the beginning of reform and opening up relied mainly on special preferential policies to attract investments. However, over-relying on such policies may hinder the flow of essential production factors in the long run. And the model cannot be copied or applied elsewhere. The Pudong New Area has instead focused mainly on more essential institutional changes, making brave and pragmatic explorations in opening finance, absorbing foreign funds, developing land resources and improving the business environment.Allowing the pilot areas and zones, the "fulcrums", to play a leading role in bringing about overall development is the important experience gained by China in the past 40 years of reform and opening up. The Pudong New Area, and especially the pilot free trade zone, are just such "fulcrums" as well as typical examples leading China's high-quality economic development. The word "pilot" has meanings of both "an experimental field" and "navigator", and both can be applied in Pudong. Currently, a number of institutional reforms, first launched in the pilot free trade zone, have been copied and promoted throughout the country. As a pioneer of China's reform, Pudong is pressing forward without pause.China Mosaichttp://www.china.org.cn/video/node_7230027.htmPudong New Area: Institutional changes are the real miraclehttp://www.china.org.cn/video/2018-09/13/content_63403589.htmAbout China.org.cnFounded in 2000, China Internet Information Center (China.org.cn/China.com.cn) is a key state news website under the auspices of the State Council Information Office, and is managed by China International Publishing Group.

Religious persecution, one of the objectives of socialismCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 23, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1086 wordsBody        Mario Félix Lleonart poses with his wife Yoaxis (theologian), behind the Falun Gong poster: "The ultimate goal of communism: to destroy the human race." (Yoaxis Marcheco)  Under the slogan that "the ultimate goal of communism is the destruction of the human race", persecuted by the Chinese regime gathered in the US capital, in a meditation session to honor thousands of disappeared, imprisoned and tortured by the religious persecution exercised by totalitarian and / or communist regimes such as those of China and Cuba.  It was the prelude to the Ministerial Meeting for the advancement of religious liberties convened by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Washington, along with leaders and religious movements around the world.  One present, the Cuban pastor, Mario Félix Lleonart Barroso, expropriated, tortured, imprisoned and subsequently exiled by Castro-communist regime, gave an exclusive interview for PanAm Post,  He explains that religious persecution in China is not limited exclusively to Falun Gong. The innumerable violations originate in the State Administration for Religious Care (SARA), the homologation of the Office of Attention to Religious Affairs of Cuba (OAAR). As well as in the official Chinese Protestant Church, known as the Three-Self Patriotic Movement (TSMP), whose equivalent in Cuba is the organization of the Communist Party known as the Council of Churches of Cuba (CIC).  Through "Operation Deterrence," the Communist Party of China attempts to "guide" believers who attend unauthorized churches (known as Shouwang) that the state controls and uses. In front of the Washington Monument, Falun Gong practitioners held a meditation session as an action against ideological persecution. (Yoaxis Marcecho)  However, the most persecuted group is still Falun Dafa, since in 1999 more than 10,000 practitioners gathered peacefully near the central government building in Beijing to demand legal recognition and freedom from State interference.  In retaliation, the Chinese government blocked Internet access to websites mentioning Falun Gong and declared it a "heretical organization" that threatened social stability.  Since then, hundreds of thousands of supporters have been detained extrajudicially, many detainees are forced to perform forced labor, suffer psychiatric abuse, torture and other methods of coercion to reform their thoughts at the hands of the Chinese authorities.  In 2009, at least 2,000 Falun Gong practitioners were killed because of abuse while in custody. SomeObservers estimate that the figure is much higher, and report that tens of thousands may have been killed to supply the organ transplant industry in China. Pastor Mario Félix Lleonart Barroso and his wife Yoaxis Marchecho Suárez, a tolo, pose in front of the Cuban flag in Washington. (Yoaxis Marcheco Suarez) Were they in representation of your organization, of Cuba, was it by countries? Our Patmos Institute is part of the International Roundtable for Religious Freedoms (IRF Roundtable) that promotes all collateral events to the Ministerial Meeting convened by the State Department for this July 24 and 25, and to which we were invited. That was the reason why we were present at the Washington Monument in solidarity with those condemning the religious persecution in communist China, and this served to exchange with Chinese activists and provide feedback on the persecution in Cuba.  In the same way, I am enrolled in the Ministerial Meeting for the advancement of religious liberties to represent all Cuban believers, whatever their religious creed, who in one way or another have received persecution in Cuba. What does the case of Chinese Falun Dafa teach us and how does it matter what the belief is when it is repressed by a totalitarian government? The case of the Falun Dafa in China shows us the true oppressive nature of the communist system. This kind of totalitarian system does not admit that independent entities are capable of mobilizing the masses in the same society in which they try to maintain total control.  It may or may not be in accordance with the teachings and practices of Falun Dafa, which in no way are harmful to humanity, quite the opposite, but what you should not allow is that a totalitarian system such as China carry out the persecution policy against this successful religious movement, or against any other. The theologian Yaxis Marcheco Suárez posing with Falun Gong practitioners, "Meditation guided by truth, compassion and tolerance". (Yoaxis Marcecho Suárez) What message would you give to those who idealize communism without having lived it? The communist system survived fascism and Nazism, but this does not mean that it is better than those horrendous totalitarian systems.  On the contrary, it means that he was able to write history from his position as the victor, in the case of Stalinism. It has been possible to better account for Hitler's victims than those of Stalin or Mao Tse Tung. Stalin camouflaged horrendous crimes, such as the killing of Polish army officers in the Katyn forest, blaming it onHitler History proved that it was one of the many Soviet crimes.  Communist systems, besides being oppressive systems, are also characterized by their powerful propaganda machines that are dedicated to washing their image and hiding crimes against humanity. Cubans for six decades have seen our country swept away, and countries like Venezuela or Nicaragua are suffering from the metastasis of our cancer.  The best proof of the success of the myths spread by communist propaganda in the free world is to see how people who have only known the benefits of the democratic world idyllically defend the facade of a system that fortunately they have not lived, but unfortunately not they know in essence, without realizing that by their defense of such myths they become resonance boxes of the propaganda that takes place in the intelligence centers of the promoters of international communism.  Recall that after the triumph of the revolution, Fidel Castro denied the communist nature of the regime he was trying to implement; and see right now the possibility of removing the atrocious word "communism" in the Constitution recently raised in the Cuban Parliament.  And it is that even the communists are weighed by the name; but I wish that the worst was the name and not the essence that, with name or without name, has characterized the practical effects of that harmful totalitarian system wherever it has been established. Load-Date: July 23, 2018End of Document

Trump Blames China For Canceled Pompeo Trip, Says US-South Korea "War Games" OffThe FrontrunnerAugust 30, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 637 wordsBodyReuters (8/29, Mason) reports that "just days after calling off a planned trip to North Korea by his top diplomat," President Trump "said on Wednesday he thought the United States was 'doing well' in its diplomatic efforts with Pyongyang." Said Trump, "I think we're doing well with North Korea. We'll have to see."On Wednesday afternoon, Trump also tweeted the following statement: "STATEMENT FROM THE WHITE HOUSE: President Donald J. Trump feels strongly that North Korea is under tremendous pressure from China because of our major trade disputes with the Chinese Government. At the same time, we also know that China is providing North Korea with... considerable aid, including money, fuel, fertilizer and various other commodities. This is not helpful! Nonetheless, the President believes that his relationship with Kim Jong Un is a very good and warm one, and there is no reason at this time to be spending large amounts... of money on joint U.S.-South Korea war games. Besides, the President can instantly start the joint exercises again with South Korea, and Japan, if he so chooses. If he does, they will be far bigger than ever before. As for the U.S.-China trade disputes, and other... differences, they will be resolved in time by President Trump and China's great President Xi Jinping. Their relationship and bond remain very strong."In a brief story, the CBS Evening News (8/29, story 4, 0:15, Dickerson, 5.58M) reported that "Trump was busy on social media this evening, tweeting four times in brisk order, blaming China for the cancellation of new talks with North Korea over its nuclear program. He wrote, 'Nonetheless, the President believes that his relationship with Kim Jong-Un is a very warm one'." The New York Times (8/29, Landler, 19.33M) says Trump "tried to make China the scapegoat for his stalled diplomacy with North Korea," and the Washington Post (8/29, Sonne, 15.68M) that "before Trump's tweets," Defense Secretary Mattis "issued a...statement, saying that only three specific military exercises had been suspended to 'provide space' for US diplomats to negotiate." Other than that, added Mattis, "our military posture has not changed since the conclusion of the Singapore summit and no decisions have been made about suspending any future exercises."Report: Trump Told Kim Jong Un He'd Declare End To Korean War.Vox (8/29, Ward, 1.66M) reports exclusively that Trump told Kim during their Singapore summit in June "that he'd sign a declaration to end the Korean War soon after their meeting, according to multiple sources familiar with the negotiations. But since then, the Trump administration has repeatedly asked Pyongyang to dismantle most of its nuclear arsenal first, before signing such a document." According to Vox, "that decision is likely what has led to the current stalemate in negotiations between the two countries - and the increasingly hostile rhetoric from North Korea."South Korea: Cancellation Of Pompeo Trip Increases Importance Of Moon Visit To Pyongyang.The New York Times (8/29, Choe, 19.33M) reports South Korean President Moon Jae-in's office said he now "sees a more urgent need to travel to North Korea next month" to meet with Kim now that Pompeo's "planned trip there this week has been canceled." While North and South Korea "had earlier agreed to hold a third summit meeting in Pyongyang" in September, Moon had "had hoped that Mr. Pompeo would first break a logjam in talks over denuclearizing the North, making it easier for him to push his agenda of increasing economic and other inter-Korean ties when he sat down with Mr. Kim." President Trump's cancellation of Pompeo's trip cast Moon's plan "into doubt," but his office said he was "intent on working as a mediator between Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump, just as he helped broker their first meeting in June."Load-Date: August 30, 2018End of Document

Taiwan mocks Beijing over new Winnie the Pooh filmCNN WireAugust 8, 2018 Wednesday 7:03 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 367 wordsByline: By Ben Westcott and Steven Jiang, CNNDateline: (CNN) Body (CNN) --  Taiwan's government has mocked Beijing over rumors a new film featuring Winnie the Pooh has been banned in mainland China, due to comparisons between the yellow bear and Chinese President Xi Jinping.On its official Twitter account, Taiwan's Foreign Ministry posted an image of their tourism mascot Oh! Bear, saying he was dismayed "his cousin Winnie's" film had been "banned" by Chinese authorities."Make no mistake: All bears are created equal in Taiwan and "Christopher Robin" is screening nationwide," the ministry said.The new Disney film centers around a grown-up Christopher Robin reuniting with his old friends from the Hundred Acre Wood, including Winnie the Pooh and Piglet.But Chinese filmgoers may not get a chance to see the movie, after reports emerged it won't be approved by the ruling Chinese Communist Party's propaganda officials to be shown in theaters.There has been no official announcement regarding "Christopher Robin," but many media outlets suggested there could be a link between the decision not to show the film and the Chinese government's crackdown on images of Winnie the Pooh.Cheeky netizens in China have often linked Pooh to Xi, claiming there is an uncanny resemblance between the two and provoking the wrath of Chinese censors.But given only 34 foreign films are allowed into the country every year, blockbusters tend to dominate the list in an attempt to turn the greatest profit.In addition, there's no blanket ban in mainland China on the character of Winnie the Pooh -- his books and toys can still be bought widely across the country.By drawing attention to rumors of a ban by Beijing on the film, Taiwan's government is attempting to highlight its greater freedom of expression compared to the mainland, at a time when the two governments are locked in a furious battle over the island's status.Despite Taiwan being self-governed for almost 70 years, the Beijing government continues to view the island as an integral part of its territory.China's State Film Bureau, which approves all foreign movies shown in the country, did not respond to requests for comment from CNN.TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Bear, saying he was dismayed "his cousin Winnie's" film had been "banned" by Chinese authorities."Make no mistake: All bears are created equal in Taiwan and "Christopher Robin" is screening nationwide," the ministry said.The new Disney film centers around a grown-up Christopher Robin reuniting with his old friends from the Hundred Acre Wood, including Winnie the Pooh and Piglet.But Chinese filmgoers may not get a chance to see the movie, after reports emerged it won't be approved by the ruling Chinese Communist Party's propaganda officials to be shown in theaters.There has been no official announcement regarding "Christopher Robin," but many media outlets suggested there could be a link between the decision not to show the film and the Chinese government's crackdown on images of Winnie the Pooh.Cheeky netizens in China have often linked Pooh to Xi, claiming there is an uncanny resemblance between the two and provoking the wrath of Chinese censors.But given only 34 foreign films are allowed into the country every year, blockbusters tend to dominate the list in an attempt to turn the greatest profit.In addition, there's no blanket ban in mainland China on the character of Winnie the Pooh -- his books and toys can still be bought widely across the country.By drawing attention to rumors of a ban by Beijing on the film, Taiwan's government is attempting to highlight its greater freedom of expression compared to the mainland, at a time when the two governments are locked in a furious battle over the island's status.Despite Taiwan being self-governed for almost 70 years, the Beijing government continues to view the island as an integral part of its territory.China's State Film Bureau, which approves all foreign movies shown in the country, did not respond to requests for comment from CNN.Load-Date: August 9, 2018End of Document

Therefore, I think they want to work with us to update the rules and reform the WTO.

Effect of the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act on the Video Surveillance Industry - Freedonia Group AnalysisPR NewswireAugust 15, 2018 Wednesday 9:42 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 764 wordsDateline: CLEVELAND, Aug. 15, 2018 Body On August 13, President Trump signed theJohn S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019, which authorizes FY2019 appropriations and sets forth policies for Department of Defense (DOD) programs and activities.The law also includes a policy that caused concern among several Chinese suppliers of video surveillance equipment. Beginning in August 2019, government agencies (e.g., cabinet-level departments, military branches, and others facilities such as federal prisons) from buying or contracting to buy telecommunications equipment produced by Huawei Technologies Company or ZTE Corporation, or video surveillance equipment produced by Hytera Communications Corporation, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Company, or Dahua Technology Company. It also bars the purchase of any such equipment produced by an entity believed to be owned or controlled by the Chinese government.Additionally, beginning in August 2020, these government agencies will also be barred from entering into, extending, or renewing a contract with an entity that uses any of the above-mentioned telecommunication and video surveillance equipment.This second provision is most concerning to the specified firms, uncertain about how broadly the ban will be interpreted.Hikvision commented in astatement: "The ban itself will not have substantial impact on the company's business. But due to its unclear points and semantic ambiguity in some terms, the bill might generate broader interpretations, which could extend the ban from federal agencies to non-federal installations [from using our products]."According to Jennifer Mapes-Christ, Senior Analyst and Manager of the Consumer & Commercial Goods group at the Freedonia Group, "The US government market for video surveillance systems is expected to exceed $700 million by 2021. While that is a relatively small piece of the total US market for these products, there are some significant areas of growth for high-tech video surveillance equipment in the government market, including the 'digital wall' along the US-Mexico border featuring advanced surveillance and analytics technology."Furthermore, she notes, "China-based firms are becoming increasingly important suppliers to the US video surveillance market. Hangzhou Hikvision has been a rapidly growing player, rising to one of the top 5 firms by 2016, due to its ability to compete on both price and quality."Mapes-Christ continues, "Much like the larger consumer electronics industry, the manufacture of video surveillance products has largely shifted to Asian countries, particularly in countries with low labor costs. Furthermore, the well-known production processes make these products easy to manufacture and transport. Imports - the lion's share of which come from China - now account for the nearly all of the video surveillance equipment sold in the US."She adds, "Although Huawei and ZTE have been marked as national security threats by the US since 2012, concern about security vulnerability of cameras provided by other China-based firms as well has been increasing over the last few years. Concern is particularly extended to companies with ties to the Chinese government with the perception that they might be able to exercise control over the equipment."Additional analysis of the video surveillance industry can be found in the Freedonia reportVideo Surveillance Equipment in the US.For the full list of Freedonia's security industry studies, visit: https://www.freedoniagroup.com/industry-category/secu/security.htmAbout The Freedonia Group - The Freedonia Group, a division of MarketResearch.com, is a leading international industrial research company publishing more than 100 studies annually.

Alibaba Shakes Off Trade War Concerns, Stays Focused on Domestic ConsumerRealMoneyAugust 23, 2018 Thursday 11:25 AM EDTCopyright 2018 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 545 wordsByline: Kevin CurranHighlight: The company and analysts are downplaying the trade spat's effect on company trajectory.BodyAnalysts are remaining confident in Alibaba's  ability to perform, downplaying the trade standoff's impact on the company.The company's net income gained 45% to $1.2 billion, while revenues rose 61% to $12.2 billion during the same quarter compared to a year ago.In an earnings presentation this morning, the e-commerce and cloud giant noted that its user base and revenue continues to grow despite macroeconomic pressures from tariffs and trade.Alibaba executive chairman Joseph Tsai told analysts that both China and Alibaba are well prepared to absorb the impact of trade tensions, as they stay focused on domestic economy."Alibaba's business is focused on capturing the Chinese domestic consumption opportunity and less reliant on Chinese exports," he explained. "We believe that Chinese government policy will continue to support imports into China to satisfy the rising demand of Chinese consumers."He added that is the U.S. goods are priced out of the Chinese marketplace by tariffs, consumers will simply shift to domestic producers.Growing Middle ClassSuntrust Robinson analyst Youssef Squalli likewise expressed his lack of concern on the macro factors in a note published after the earnings presentation this morning."While the stock was recently pressured by concerns around a trade war with the US, and a softening Chinese economy, we believe both are manageable for the company," he wrote. "On the trade war issue, BABA remains first and foremost a play on the rise of domestic Chinese consumption, with relatively small reliance on US consumers."Currently, the company has an annual active user base of 576 million customers, adding 24 million from the previous year.CFO Maggie Wei Wu specifically noted the company's ability to continue expanding user base in lower tier customers during the earnings this morning, lauding the company's price point initiatives as effective regardless of shifting economic conditions in China broadly."About 80% of these net adds are from lower tier cities as we broaden our offerings and services into those regions," she explained.Squalli indicated that he believes this is a good indicator for the continued rise of the Chinese middle class despite macroeconomic pressures."In terms of the slowing Chinese economy, 80% of the new active consumers came from lower tier cities, reflecting strong demand from rising income and rising middle class, which we believe can be sustainable for some time," he wrote.As a result, he maintained his buy rating on the stock and set a price target of $215.To be sure, Chinese markets overall have indeed been stung by political bluster over trade and the imposition of billions in tariffs.Year to date, the Shanghai Composite Index has fallen 17.61%, reflecting trouble in some of the largest Chinese companies, including Alibaba, which itself has fallen in market cap by  .However, as the bulk of its business is protected from trade-related external headwinds, both the company and analysts seem confident the e-commerce titan can wait out the storm."It is clear that nobody wins in a trade war," Tsai told analysts on the earnings call. "Over the years, China has become less reliant on exports so that the Chinese economy can withstand the imposition of tariffs on Chinese products."Load-Date: August 27, 2018End of Document

International students to US: Do you really want us?; Study abroad in the US impacts cultural relations and the economy. As overseas students question attending college here, American schools increase efforts to convey that they are welcome.The Christian Science MonitorJuly 2, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 Christian Science Publishing Society All Rights ReservedSection: EqualEdLength: 1523 wordsByline: Stacy Teicher Khadaroo Staff writerBodyLandry Bado has a new bachelor's degree in architecture from Temple University in Philadelphia, and he hopes to design museums, community centers - places that bring people together.A citizen of Burkina Faso in West Africa, he's also vocal about the benefits of coming together across borders for higher education.He's one of many students and staff who offer warm smiles as they convey the message, "You are welcome here" in a Temple video, designed to reassure prospective international students who may be concerned about what climate they'd land in if they come to study in the United States.Hundreds of US colleges and universities have joined the #YouAreWelcomeHere video and social media campaign, depicting the sense of home they try to forge on their campuses. It's also one way higher education is pushing back against President Trump's rhetoric and policies that cast globalization as a threat.US higher education needs to "make the case for continuing to be a destination for international students ... in response to a narrative in the country that is more anti-global engagement, more anti-immigrant," says Gil Latz, associate vice chancellor for international affairs at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis. At heart, he says, it's about addressing the question, "How can we both be safe and open to the world?"A $30 billion bump to the economyCompetition for international college students is growing globally, and many US colleges want to bolster their numbers - to boost both diversity and their bottom line. Just over 1 million international students contribute more than $30 billion a year to the US economy, and they help American students prepare for joining a global workforce.But admissions staff have been hearing rumblings from students and parents abroad - some alarmed by news headlines about violence and bias incidents at US schools, others worried about real or potential visa restrictions.Because of the political climate here, interest in coming to the US decreased for one-third of 2,104 prospective international students surveyed  in February 2017.But that's not the only factor fueling a recent decline in new international enrollments. After at least 12 years of steady growth, those numbers actually dipped before the election of Mr. Trump - by about 10,000 students in the fall of 2016, a 3 percent decline from the previous year.One contributing factor: a winding down of government scholarship programs in Brazil and Saudi Arabia for students to go abroad, says Rajika Bhandari, a top official at the Institute of International Education in New York, which publishes the "Open Doors" data report. Other factors include the growth of opportunities in large countries, such as India, and competitive strategies by nations like Canada, which markets itself as safe and welcoming.Decline in students in 2017Higher education groups here want to stave off a worsening decline of US market share. A survey of 500 US institutions indicated a 7 percent dip of new international students in the fall of 2017. "Things started to feel more scary after the elections [in 2016]," says Mr. Bado, from Burkina Faso. "A lot of people are becoming more and more anxious with the idea of traveling here."His parents cautioned him about sharing too much on Facebook after the election, worried that his own visa prospects could be harmed. Bado also knows students from Iran who have not been able to see their family members because of Trump's travel ban, upheld June 26 by the US Supreme Court.A host of education groups spoke out against the decision. "At a time when we should be making every effort to create connections and ties around the world through robust international exchange with all nations, especially those in the Middle East,... the chilling effect of this policy and the uncertainty for our international students and scholars will undoubtedly continue the current downturn in U.S. international student enrollment as the world wonders whether America will hold true to our values," said Jill Welch, an official at NAFSA: Association of International Educators, in a statement.Nevertheless, Bado has had a good experience in the US and is enamored with the City of Brotherly Love. "I tell [potential international students] about all the people that I've met that actually do not agree with all these immigration policies," he says.Abdulrahman Alsulaiman, a Saudi and a rising senior at Temple, says the #YAWH video made a difference in his cousin's decision to come to the US this summer to study English, and perhaps stay for an undergraduate degree. It "helped his parents really trust that their kid will be safe," he says.A push to woo studentsWhether part of the campaign or not, many American colleges have been working double time to allay worries - and to provide opportunities for international and domestic students to interact.Tufts set up a travel hotline for international students and scholars. The University of New Hampshire sent representatives to China and India to encourage students who had been admitted to actually enroll. Eastern Michigan University put up banners on their lightpoles featuring photos of international students. Temple hosted a week of activities, including a speed-dating style cultural exchange.The US State Department continues to promote study here through its EducationUSA offices around the world.But the State Department and other US agencies are also taking action to address growing concerns about the theft of intellectual property and threats to national security by individuals from certain countries, including China.The State Department is issuing new screening guidelines for Chinese students studying in highly sensitive fields such as aviation and robotics, acknowledged Edward Ramotowski, the deputy assistant secretary for visa services in the department's Bureau of Consular Affairs, during a congressional hearing  June 6. The exchange at the hearing suggested the new guidelines would require annual renewal of visas, primarily for Chinese graduate students in these fields. A State Department official would not confirm this to the Monitor, however, stating in an email that the maximum validity for a student visa for Chinese nationals is five years and is unchanged, and that consular officers have always had the right to limit the length of visas on a case-by-case basis.While the security concerns are important, the new guidelines, in conjunction with other immigration policies, could end up "contributing to a signal to foreign students that they're not welcome in the US," says Terry Hartle, senior vice president of the American Council on Education in Washington.'US is not safe'Kang, a Chinese citizen who attended graduate school at Columbia University in New York, recently launched Lighthouse Academy in Beijing, a business that consults with students there about study abroad, primarily in the US. Visa and safety concerns do make a difference for students, he writes in an email interview. He requests that his full name not be used because of concerns about possible trouble with the Chinese government if his name appears too frequently in foreign media.Many parents have told him they fear discrimination against their children since Trump's election, and they've also been disturbed by violent crimes against several Chinese students in the US. Add to that the recent media coverage of gun violence and "it conjured up a logic that is solid to parents: US is not safe," he writes. Half his undergraduate clients ask if they can apply to the US and Canada or other countries at the same time. Still, many Chinese students who can get into top-ranked US universities and afford the tuition will probably attend despite concerns, he says.Wu Ying, a sophomore at Shantou University in China, says she is wondering whether a master's degree in the US would be worth the price. Chinese students here have given her the impression that "though it might be tough and challenging sometimes it still has considerable merits," she writes in an email. "After hearing their ideas I feel inspired and want to 'have a try.' "Even those who have been negatively affected by violence in the US have urged people to see the bigger picture. After the Santa Fe, Texas, high school shooter killed Pakistani exchange student Sabika Sheikh, her father, Abdul Aziz Sheikh, told the Associated Press: "One should not lose his heart by such kind of incidents.... One should not stop going for education to the US or UK, or China, or anywhere. One must go for education undeterred."There's a sense of mission among international admissions directors like Michelle Kowalsky of Western New England University in Springfield, Mass., which is one of several schools offering two #YAWH scholarships for students starting in 2019."This is going to sound corny, but I feel like part of my job is this idea of world peace," she says. "The more you get to know people from other places, you understand that some of the things that you really care about, your family [for instance], are intrinsically important to people around the world." Graphic Students chat in the food court at Kingsborough Community College in Brooklyn in May of 2012.

OFFICIALS IN CHINA'S ANHUI TARGET XI JINPING CRITIC FOR 'PSYCHIATRIC TREATMENT'States News ServiceJuly 9, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 582 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Authorities in the eastern Chinese province of Anhui have visited an outspoken rights activist who criticized President Xi Jinping on social media, threatening to send him for psychiatric treatment for his "mental illness," RFA has learned.Lu Qianrong was visited in his home in Linshui township, Huoqiu county by a group of officials from the local government, as well as higher-ranking officials from nearby Changzhou city, he told RFA on Monday ."They said [I] often post comments that are critical of the government online, and asked if I have mental health problems, and that they would get me checked out," Lu said. "They said the government would pay, to see if I have any psychiatric problems.""I told them I don't have mental health problems, and [my troubles] were caused by their persecution of me," said Lu, who served a three-year term in a labor camp during the 1990s for blowing the whistle on official corruption."They said that they were 'worried about me', and that I should go and get a psychiatric evaluation only if I wanted to," he said.Lu said the visit is likely linked to his recent online criticisms of President Xi Jinping, however."They told me I had said things I shouldn't, and that I shouldn't write disparaging things about my country online," he said. "I told them that, as a citizen, I have a duty to oversee the government and the [ruling] Chinese Communist Party."China's medical profession has continued to collude with the authorities in carrying out psychiatric incarceration of critics of the government, the rights group Civil Rights and Livelihood Watch said in a recent report. Rampant abuse of psychiatry The practice of locking up those who challenge the government in mental institutions has become an endemic rights abuse in the country's legal system, and authorities have increasingly used the tactic against rights activists and dissidents as a way of imposing indefinite periods of detention on them without the need for a trial, the group said.The Mental Health Law was aimed at protecting citizens from misdiagnosis and involuntary medical treatment in state-run psychiatric hospitals. But the use of such institutions to restrain activists and dissidents is still widespread, the Hubei-based group said in a 2017 report.A few days after the visit, officials paid a call on Lu's wife at her workplace, asking her to agree to have her husband committed for psychiatric treatment, and even to divorce him, he said."They said your man is mentally ill, and you'd be better off putting him in a mental hospital," Lu said. "They also threatened my wife, saying that if I committed murder or arson, she would be the one who died, and that she'd regret it then.""Anyone else would have divorced Lu Qianrong a long time ago, they told her."Beijing-based rights activist Wang Lihong said the use of psychiatric diagnoses and enforced "treatment" is a common tactic employed by the authorities to control dissenting voices."They don't need to a trial, a notification of detention or anything like that to lock someone up in a mental hospital," Wang said. "They can do it whenever they like, and they send anyone whose mood isn't entirely positive to psychiatric hospitals, and then feed them various psychiatric medications.""This really messes a person up, doing great mental and physical harm," he said.

Alum's biotech company becomes first in China to start clinical trials of Car-T cancer therapyThe Duke Chronicle: Duke UniversityJuly 19, 2018 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 378 wordsByline: Shannon FangBodyFrank Zhang, Ph.D. '95, is the chairman and chief executive officer of GenScript Biotech Corporation, the first company in China to start clinical trials of CAR-T cancer therapy.After graduating from Duke, Zhang was an associate principal scientist at Schering-Plough until he founded GenScript in 2002. GenScript recently became the first company to earn approval from the Chinese government to begin clinical trials of a novel cancer treatment called CAR-T therapy to treat multiple myeloma.Though based in New Jersey, GenScript conducts much of its research and production in Nanjing, China. The company is a leader in life sciences research and early drug development and offers products and services such as gene synthesis, protein synthesis and custom antibody development.According to the company's website, it is also the most-cited biotech company in the world, with an average of 4,180 citations per year.CAR-T therapy essentially engineers the body's immune system to identify and attack tumor cells. Legend Biotech Company, a subsidiary of GenScript, presented a study in which 33 of 35 multiple myeloma patients entered clinical remission within two months of receiving therapy.However, current drugs used in CAR-T treatment can cost between $373,000 and $475,000, limiting access. Possible risks to GenScript include failure of its CAR-T trials and failure to commercialize the drug.In December, the company partnered with Janssen Biotech, a branch of Johnson & Johnson. GenScript received $350 million from the company and agreed to split the profits and overseas costs with Janssen.The company went public in 2016 on the Hong Kong stock exchange, with its initial public offering at HK$1.31. Since then, the share price has increased by 20 times. The company's stock peaked in January at HK$32.35, but has fallen 33 percent since the end of May.GenScript earned $152.6 million in revenue in 2017, with a year-over-year growth of 33 percent. Zhang recently reached a net worth of $1.3 billion.Earlier this year, Zhang said he may consider a separate stock listing for Nanjing Legend Biotech, the cancer-drug branch of his company. According to the Bloomberg article, the Duke alumnus said that the CAR-T therapy could be ready for sale by the end of 2020.Load-Date: July 20, 2018End of Document

Chayora Celebrates Major Milestone as It Nears Completion of Phase 1 of Its First Facility at Its Tianjin Hyperscale Data Centre Campus in China; The Company Is Targeting Live Operations of Its TJ1 Data Centre on the Tianjin Campus at Year-End 2018Business WireJuly 2, 2018 Monday 1:05 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Business Wire, Inc.Distribution: Business Editors; Technology WritersLength: 808 wordsDateline: HONG KONG BodyChayora , the Hong Kong-based data centre infrastructure company, announces today it is nearing completion of Phase 1 of its TJ1 Data Centre at its hyperscale campus in Beichen, northern Tianjin. On 26 June, Chayora celebrated reaching the midpoint milestone at its "Superstructure Launch Ceremony." The TJ1 build will be completed in September 2018, with customer-bespoke data hall fit out works able to commence in August. Live operations will commence in Q1 2019. In parallel, foundation works for Phase 2 of the first facility are now underway with the second TJ2 Data Centre build already being planned as part of the 300MW, 32-hectare / 80-acre campus which will ultimately comprise nine major data centre facilities.This press release features multimedia.

Tianjin also announced in May 2018 the establishment of a USD $16 billion fund to spur the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the province, which corresponded with the central government and Chinese industry launching a series of AI initiatives in recent months. This is especially significant in view of a policy blueprint issued last year by China's State Council calling for the nation to become "the world's primary AI innovation centre by 2030."The Superstructure Launch event at Chayora's Tianjin campus included a tour of the supply infrastructure; a campus and construction site tour; a series of presentations on the region and the construction project itself; and an update on Chayora's next milestones towards live operations by year's end. The event generated considerable interest from representatives of customers in attendance, as well as investors, government officials, supply chain partners and media, most of whom commented on the significant scale of the Tianjin hyperscale data centre campus development and the commitment to the best in international standards."We are delighted by the response of industry stakeholders to our Tianjin hyperscale data centre campus, including numerous enquiries from international cloud, technology and colocation provider customers," says Oliver Jones , co-founder and Chief Executive Officer, Chayora. "We can enable these enterprises to establish their footprint in China with design, construction and operations delivered to international standards, and we can serve diverse needs and entities given the scale of our hyperscale campuses. We can also see Chayora's Tianjin campus' capacity to become a prime hub for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning organisations given our masterplan features three high performance computing data centre facilities alongside the six hyperscale primary centres. The first project has progressed very well, and Phase 1 of our first facility is planned for completion in September 2018. We hope that we are demonstrating our commitment to deliver and execute with the same speed and reliability that is common in other parts of the world."While Chayora continues with development of its Tianjin hyperscale data centre campus, the company is already planning construction of a second hyperscale campus, a 280MW data centre campus to serve the greater Shanghai region. All Chayora sites have fully provisioned power from grid as well as from renewable sources wherever available and are carrier neutral with fibre connected to world-class standards.Chayora ensures the most reliable route to business engagement in China, helps to manage and optimise regulatory and licensing obstacles, and delivers the necessary infrastructure to meet the SLAs of international technology businesses, cloud services and colocation providers. The company's hyperscale campuses are ready for data centre construction and immediate connection to the domestic internet.For more information about Chayora, visit www.chayora.com .About ChayoraChayora Limited, headquartered in Hong Kong, is wholly-owned by Chayora Holdings Limited, a Cayman Island-based company.
