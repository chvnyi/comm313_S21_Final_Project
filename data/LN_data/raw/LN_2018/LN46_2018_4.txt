US stocks close higher even as US-China dispute escalatesAssociated Press InternationalApril 4, 2018 Wednesday 8:23 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 386 wordsDateline: NEW YORK BodyNEW YORK (AP) - The latest on developments in financial markets (all times local):4:20 p.m.Stocks rallied to finish higher Wednesday, overcoming worries about an escalating trade dispute between the U.S. and China.After plunging 501 points at the open, the Dow Jones industrial average finished with a gain of 230 points, or about 1 percent.Technology stocks reversed early losses, with the notable exception of Facebook, which fell slightly. Consumer stocks were strong, but industrials such as plane maker Boeing and farm equipment maker Deere, which could be hurt by any tariffs, closed with losses.The whiplash followed announcements by the U.S. and Chinese governments that they plans to impose tariffs of 25 percent on $50 billion worth of the others' imports. Some analysts downplayed the back-and-forth as negotiating tactics.The S&P 500 finished up 30 points, or 1.2 percent, at 2,644.69.___11:50 a.m.Stocks remain lower on Wall Street amid an escalating trade dispute between the U.S. and China but have pared some of their sharp early losses.Investors seemed rattled by news of the tit-for-tat $50 billion in proposed tariffs announced by both countries. A full-fledged trade war could slow global commerce.Big industrial and technology stocks were hardest hit by the selling. Boeing shares are down 2.7 percent and Caterpillar is down 2 percent. Among big technology shares, Facebook was down 1.7 percent.The S&P 500 lost 0.5 percent or 12 points to 2,602. The Dow Jones industrial average is 0.7 percent lower, or 176 points, at 23,858.Gold, considered a safe-haven investment, is up 0.2 percent._____9:35 a.m.Stocks are opening sharply lower on Wall Street as an escalating trade dispute between the U.S. and China poses a threat to global economic growth and corporate profits.The Dow Jones industrial average fell about 500 points at the open, with energy, industrial and materials sectors leading the decline.Deere & Co. fell 4.3 percent and Caterpillar dropped almost 3 percent. Boeing was down 3.3 percent.The sell-off was triggered after China announced a list of U.S. products that might be subject to a 25 percent tariff in retaliation for U.S. tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods.European and Asian markets also fell sharply.Gold, considered a safe-haven investment, rose nearly 1 percent.Load-Date: April 5, 2018End of Document

RUBIO, WARNER URGE PRESIDENT TRUMP TO REINSTATE ZTE BANStates News ServiceJune 26, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1013 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Florida Senator Marco Rubio:Today, U.S. Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Mark Warner (D-VA) urged President Trump to re-consider the deal lifting the ZTE ban, and to support the Senate-passed ban on government purchases of ZTE and Huawei equipment.In the letter to President Trump, the Senators wrote, The Senate and the U.S. Intelligence Community are in agreement that ZTE poses a significant threat to our national security. The Senate recently voted 85-10 to reimpose the April sanctions order and the ban on ZTE buying U.S. components, and to prohibit the U.S. federal government from purchasing ZTE or Huawei equipment and contracting with any entity that purchases such equipment. We urge you to heed the leaders of the U.S. Intelligence Community, supported by a strong bipartisan consensus in the Senate, that we must pursue policies that prevent the widespread use of ZTE products in the U.S.The Senators noted that at a February 13, 2018 hearing in the Intelligence Committee, six of the nations top intelligence leaders the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) and the heads of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), National Security Agency (NSA), Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) testified about the risks posed to U.S. national security by ZTE and Huawei. Additionally, the nations top counterintelligence officer, Director of the National Counterintelligence Security Center Bill Evanina, testified at his May 15, 2018, confirmation hearing that Chinese telecom companies such as ZTE and Huawei pose a significant threat to American security.As you know, this is not a new threat. Congressionally documented concerns date back to a 2012 House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence report on the serious counterintelligence concerns associated with ZTE equipment, the ties between the company and government, and the risks to American national security, the Senators added . ZTE, though publicly traded, is a state-backed enterprise that is ultimately loyal not to its shareholders, but to the Chinese Communist Party and Chinese government. This patronage relationship poses unacceptable risks to American sovereignty; risks that will only increase if the company is permitted to establish itself deeply in Americas telecommunications infrastructure.The full text of the letter is below:June 26, 2018The PresidentThe White House1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NWWashington, DC 20500Dear Mr. President:We urge you to reconsider your decision to amend the April ZTE sanctions order and lift the ban the Commerce Department imposed this year that prohibited ZTE from buying U.S. components, and we ask for your support for the Senate-passed ban on the government buying ZTE and Huawei equipment. We strongly believe that the April sanctions orderwhich would have threatened ZTEs survivalshould not be used as a bargaining chip in negotiations with China on unrelated matters.The Senate and the U.S. Intelligence Community are in agreement that ZTE poses a significant threat to our national security. The Senate recently voted 85-10 to reimpose the April sanctions order and the ban on ZTE buying U.S. components, and to prohibit the U.S. federal government from purchasing ZTE or Huawei equipment and contracting with any entity that purchases such equipment. We urge you to heed the leaders of the U.S. Intelligence Community, supported by a strong bipartisan consensus in the Senate, that we must pursue policies that prevent the widespread use of ZTE products in the U.S.At the Senate Intelligence Committees hearing on February 13, 2018, six top intelligence leaders testified about the risk of ZTE and Huawei to American national security:FBI Director Wray stated: Were deeply concerned about the risks of allowing any company or entity that is beholden to foreign governments that dont share our values to gain positions of power inside our telecommunications networks that provides the capacity to exert pressure or control over our telecommunications infrastructure. It provides the capacity to maliciously modify or steal information, and it provides the capacity to conduct undetected espionage.Then-NSA Director Rogers warned: I would agree with Director Wrays characterization here. This is a challenge I think that's only going to increase, not lessen, over time for us. To mayors, county judges, university presidents, and state legislatures, I would say you need to look long and hard at companies like this.The Director of National Intelligence, and the heads of the CIA, FBI, NSA, DIA, and NGA all indicated they would not use products or services from ZTE or Huawei; nor would they recommend private American citizens do so.Additionally, the nations top counterintelligence officer, Director of the National Counterintelligence Security Center Bill Evanina, testified at his May 15, 2018, confirmation hearing that the Intelligence Community and law enforcement is clearly on the record, both in the public and in classified settings, with the threat from Chinese telecommunications companies.As you know, this is not a new threat.

TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRESS CONFERENCE ON THE RELEASE OF THE APRIL 2018 FISCAL MONITORStates News ServiceApril 18, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 4817 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the International Monetary Fund:April 18, 2018Participants:Vitor Gaspar, Director, Fiscal Affairs DepartmentAbdel Senhadji, Deputy Director, Fiscal Affairs DepartmentCathy Pattillo, Assistant Director, Fiscal Affairs DepartmentWiktor Krzyzanowski, Senior Communications Officer, Communications DepartmentMr. Krzyzanowski: Good morning. Thank you very much for joining us this morning for the presentation of the Spring 2018 Fiscal Monitor. My name is Wiktor Krzyzanowski, and I am with the IMF's Communications Department.Let me present the speakers. Vitor Gaspar is the Director of the Fiscal Affairs Department at the IMF. Cathy Pattillo is the Assistant Director, and Abdel Senhadji is the Deputy Director at the IMF's Fiscal Affairs Department.You have seen the Fiscal Monitor, which has now been released to you. There is also a blog authored by Vitor, which is available to you as well.As usual, I will first ask Vitor to say a few words about the main findings of the Fiscal Monitor. And then we will be open to your questions, both in the room -- and we appreciate that you are joining us this morning -- and also online on IMF.org.Vitor, the floor is yours.Mr. Gaspar: Thank you, Wiktor. Good morning, and welcome. Thanks for your interest in our work on fiscal policy in the world.As you learned from the World Economic Outlook, global growth is strong and broad-based. The economic upswing should be used to accumulate fiscal buffers for difficult times that will eventually come. Countries are advised to avoid procyclical fiscal policies that exacerbate economic fluctuations and ratchet up public debt.Financial stability and financial risks are, as you have listened to, the focus of the Global Financial Stability Report. Countries will be better placed to tackle looming risks if they build strong public finances in good times.At $164 trillion, or almost 225 percent of GDP, global debt hit a new record high in 2016. Most of this debt is in advanced economies. Nevertheless, in the last 10 years, emerging market economies have been responsible for most of the increase. China alone has contributed 43 percent to the increase since 2007. In contrast, the contribution from low-income developing countries is barely visible on the slide.Public debt is currently at historic highs in advanced and emerging market economies. Average debt-to-GDP ratios, at more than 105 percent of GDP in advanced economies, are at levels not seen since World War II. In emerging market economies, debt at almost 50 percent of GDP on average is at levels that in the past have been associated with fiscal crisis. In contrast, for low-income developing countries, average debt-to-GDP ratios at 44 percent of GDP are well below historical peaks, but it is important to recall that these peaks involve debt levels that countries were unable to service and were eventually tackled through debt relief initiatives by the international community.Since the completion of the HIPC/MDRI initiatives, debt levels have been picking up on average. The increase has been about 13 percent of GDP in the last five years. Our debt sustainability analysis indicates that 40 percent of low-income countries are currently at high risk of or are already in debt distress. This ratio doubled in five years.Furthermore, debt service has also been rising rapidly, particularly in countries with high inflation rates. The interest burden has also doubled in the past 10 years to 20 percent of taxes. The escalating cost reflects in part the increasing reliance on market instruments. Almost half is now non-concessional debt, up from a quarter in 2007.It is imperative that low-income developing countries strengthen their tax capacity. This will allow them to meet their debt service obligations. It will also allow them to finance spending priorities, such as health, education, and public infrastructure, to attain the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.Overall, our forecasts do indicate that public debt-to-GDP ratios will come down over the next five years in about two-thirds of countries, but that is conditional on countries delivering on their fiscal plans.There is no room for complacency. For the period 2018 to 2023, debt ratios will be declining in three-fifths of low-income developing countries and in about two-thirds of emerging market economies. As for advanced economies, debt ratios will be declining in almost all countries, but one country stands out as an exception.In the United States, the revised tax code and the two-year budget agreement provide additional fiscal stimulus to the economy. These measures will give rise to overall deficit above $1 trillion over the next three years, and that corresponds to more than 5 percent of U.S. GDP. Debt is projected to increase from 108 percent in 2017 to 117 percent of GDP in 2023. If tax cuts with sunset provisions are not allowed to lapse, public debt would climb even higher.And now allow me to conclude, repeating what I said right at the beginning:In the Fiscal Monitor, we urge policymakers to avoid procyclical policy actions that provide unnecessary stimulus when economic activity is already pacing up. Instead, most countries should deliver on their fiscal plans and put deficits and debt firmly on a downward path.As I said, there is no room for complacency. No one can predict with precision the ebbs and flows of countries' economies. However, experience shows that successful governments are those that prepare ahead for storms looming on the horizon.I thank you for your attention. My colleagues and myself are eager to answer your questions.Mr. Krzyzanowski: Thank you very much, Vitor.Questioner: Your report reminds me of Reinhart and Rogoff's book, which was required reading after the financial crisis. And it points out the link between run-ups in debt, in particular sovereign debt, and the financial crises. I mean, $164 trillion is a very big number. Why should people think it is going to be any different this time?Mr. Gaspar: Thank you for reminding us of the title of the best-selling book by Reinhart and Rogoff, "This Time Is Different."Indeed, in the Fiscal Monitor, our emphasis is on debt. We have put out an update of the data that we released first in the fall of 2016. And now we are in a position to show that global debt is at a new record high. That is something that I very much emphasized in the opening statement, and I think it is a very important finding from the Fiscal Monitor.Very high levels of debt -- in particular, if associated with rapidly increasing debt -- have been shown to bring risks to financial stability and risks to broad economic activity. That is one of the reasons why we emphasized that now in these good times, in this cyclical upswing, it is timely for countries to rebuild fiscal buffers, to build solid foundations of public finance, so that they are prepared for harder times that eventually will come. That is the central message of the Fiscal Monitor, and thanks for giving me the opportunity to emphasize it.Questioner: The U.S. administration rejects your analysis of its fiscal outlook and suggests that its tax cuts will so galvanize the U.S. economy that they will pay for themselves. What is your message? And why are you right and they are wrong?Mr. Gaspar: Thank you. Our message on the U.S. is predicated on the various scenarios that we included in the Fiscal Monitor. We regard the tax reform in the U.S. as a complex policy reform that should be looked at from various perspectives: the impact on the business cycle in the United States, tax policy as structural reform, and implications for spillovers. And we use different analytical instruments to look at these various aspects. So the message is necessary, subtle, and multifaceted.The point that I emphasize as the primary message of this Fiscal Monitor is that countries should use the business cycle upswing to conduct countercyclical policies and build fiscal buffers.In the case of the United States, it is in a strong business cycle position. The recovery started in the United States a long time ago. Our chief economist emphasized yesterday that levels of unemployment are low in the United States. And in our forecast, they are deemed to go even lower.In that context, we would not recommend an easing of fiscal policy. And in our baseline, we do have quite substantial deficits in the U.S., and we have an accumulation of public debt. In making this forecast, we are actually in line with U.S. organizations, like the Congressional Budget Office.The point that I also want to stress is that, in line with the recommendations that we have been making to the U.S. in the context of Article IV consultations, we do recommend that the U.S. adopts a medium-term framework which will not only help in the points that we have been discussing but also help the U.S. tackle the long-term challenges associated with the demographic change and population ageing, as they are reflected in future pension liabilities and the dynamics of health spending.Questioner: What concerns are there, if any, around excessive bond issuance? We have seen elevated levels in recent times. Do you think there are any concerns around that? The Nigerian authorities are balancing debt structure in favor of external borrowing. They said this should be cheaper than domestic borrowing. Do you think this is a better option? Or how do you think we could handle this?Ms. Pattillo: The first point to make on the borrowing in Africa and Nigeria, in particular, is that we can all agree for Sub-Saharan African countries that sustained development and increasing per capita income growth, which is built on macro stability, is the main priority. And the Fund has been working with African countries to help build tax capacity so that countries can sustain levels of public debt and so that they can mobilize spending for health, education, and infrastructure.The composition of borrowing in countries is changing, as you mention; and those rising public debt levels and the change in composition is creating some vulnerabilities and risks. Borrowing by countries can create benefits if it is used for productive investment and the returns are captured. However, evidence suggests that it is not the case in some countries. So rising debt creates these vulnerabilities -- there can be interest rate risk, market risk, and large interest burdens that can squeeze out then spending on other priorities.With high debt, countries need to deliver on their fiscal plans for adjustment and use borrowed funds for a high-return investment.The choice between external debt and domestic debt, as you say, reflects the levels and the costs, but the main point is that countries need to use all borrowed funds for high-return investment and to deliver on their fiscal plans and to build tax capacity.Questioner: You delivered the projections for the deficit in Portugal, which are more negative than the projections by the Portuguese Government. Could you clarify the difference between one and the other?Mr. Senhadji: First, I think it is important to mention that the economic outlook for Portugal has improved significantly since last year. I think growth has picked up quite a bit in line with the upswing in Europe. Inflation is moving toward target. And I think consolidation is progressing relatively well.Of course, as Vitor said, there is no room for complacency in all countries and particularly in Portugal, where the debt ratio still remains very high. At 126 percent of GDP, it is still the third highest in Europe. Therefore, sustained progress in terms of fiscal consolidation and structural reforms that would put firmly the debt ratio on a downward path is important.Regarding the specific question that you mentioned, I think the numbers that were publicized recently came after our forecast in the World Economic Outlook. Therefore, as you know, we revise these forecasts on a regular basis, and we will do so in the context of the upcoming Article IV mission, which is planned for late May.Questioner: Could you please walk us through your decision to revise upwards the primary surplus numbers for Greece? I mean, what led you there? And what has changed in the last six months? Thank you.Mr. Gaspar: Thank you. Let me be very brief and refer you to the briefing by the European Department on Friday. But I want to repeat a couple of things:The recent trends in the Greek economy have been favorable. The situation and prospects have improved in Greece. The position of the IMF concerning policies in Greece going forward has not changed, as emphasized yesterday, by the chief economist. We insist on the necessary balance between policy in Greece and debt relief. And a combination of fiscal adjustment, structural reforms, and debt relief are fundamental, in our view, to put Greece on a sustainable growth path.Questioner: In the Fiscal Monitor, the projections show that Brazil is going to postpone by a little the primary surplus. Instead of 2021, it is going to be 2022, with 0.1 percent of GDP. On the other hand, the IMF says in the report that Brazil is supposed to take advantage of the momentum of the economy at this time to speed up the fiscal adjustments. The question is this, if you could elaborate a little bit. And in your projections, IMF considered some social security reform happening next year or in a couple of years or not? Thank you.Mr. Gaspar: Brazil is a very good example because, as you have learned by now, our main emphasis is on debt, private and public debt. And in the case of Brazil, what we do see is that going forward, the public debt-to-GDP ratio under the policy assumptions in the World Economic Outlook and the Fiscal Monitor will be pacing up.By the end of the forecast horizon, which is 2023, the debt-to-GDP ratio in Brazil would stand at about 96 percent of GDP, and that level is very high in the context of emerging market economies. It would be a very high debt level. Moreover, if you look at changes in the debt-to-GDP ratio around the world and in emerging market economies, you see again that Brazil stands out. The increase that is forecast for the public debt-to-GDP ratio in Brazil is substantially more pronounced than the increase in the U.S. public debt-to-GDP ratio that I emphasized a moment ago.So this is, in a sense, to emphasize that the issue of tackling public debt in Brazil, adopting a medium-term plan to bring it down and to bring it under control is crucial.Our understanding is that under current plans, the government of Brazil is of the view that public debt-to-GDP would be stabilizing in 2024, which is one year after our forecasting horizon. Our recommendation would be to try to tackle the issue of public debt accumulation in Brazil earlier on and to try to bring forward the adjustment.Now, the timing of these policy actions is, of course, predicated on the political evolution in Brazil that you, of course, know much better than I do.Mr. Krzyzanowski: Let me quickly turn to our colleagues online. El Economista in Spain is asking: What kind of measures does the government need to take to achieve its deficit reduction goal of 0.5 percent of GDP by 2020? Is it too ambitious?Mr. Gaspar: No. We do not think that the goal of the government is too ambitious. We we do support adjustment in Spain.Spain is a part of a group of economies in Europe that we would characterize as high debt. And in those, we do recommend not only that the countries avoid procyclical fiscal policies but also that they continue to adjust in order to control and bring down high debt levels, which we have emphasized are a source of vulnerability.We insist that this should be done in a growth-friendly way, but apart from that, the exact combination of policies, which better serves these goals, is something that the country authorities are responsible for.Mr. Krzyzanowski: Thank you very much, Vitor. We are looking forward to other questions on IMF.org.Questioner: The Chinese Government has lowered its deficit target from 3 percent to 2.6 percent of its GDP, along with other measures. Do you think China has a good policy mix to rein in its debt challenge? Thanks.Mr. Gaspar: If we look at China, the main concern has to do with the level and pace of accumulation of overall debt, private and public. So the control over the debt level -- in particular, the rhythm of debt accumulation -- is a major challenge for the Chinese economy.In terms of public finances, the official numbers for the debt and deficit are modest. The issue is that China does carry out quite a substantial share of its public expenditures at subnational levels; specifically, the proportion is 85 percent. And in the context of the 2014 budget law, there was an assumption of debt associated with the financial vehicles that are linked to local governments. In a substantial amount, it exceeded 20 percent of GDP.That means that in the Fiscal Monitor and the World Economic Outlook, we monitor a set of aggregates that go beyond the official definition of debt. And if you focus on that, you do see that there is a projected accumulation of debt which is sizable in the period 2018 to 2023.Again, to put it in perspective -- I just commented on the debt accumulation in Brazil -- the increase in debt in China, according to this concept, would be faster and more important in terms of percentage points of GDP than the increase in Brazil.There are two challenges that China has to tackle. One, how can the government, in terms of its decisions on public finance, best support the overall rebalancing of the Chinese economy, including the slowdown and the increase in the level of debt? So that is the first challenge.Second, as recognized by the State Council in 2016, there is an issue of vertical imbalance in the public finances in China, and in order for China to be able to organize itself efficiently in the provision of public services and ensure fiscal discipline at all levels of government, it is necessary to rethink the sources of revenues for subnational governments. That reform process, as you know better than me, is ongoing, and it is an issue which is recognized and is being tackled by the Chinese authorities.Questioner: Where is India placed in your debt-to-GDP ratio? Is it an issue of concern for the IMF? And do you think the Indian Government is taking enough steps to address that? Secondly, on China's BRI initiative, how is it adding to the debt-to-GDP ratio and are there any concerns to the developing and developed third-world countries?Mr. Gaspar: On the Belt and Road Initiative, it is a very ambitious one that promises to increase public investment in an ample set of countries. Increasing public investment, if it is productive, is very important in many countries. So that is something that deserves to be supported. But you are absolutely right in asking about levels of debt. Public investment contributes to fiscal sustainability in case the investment is efficient and effective, in case the investment is productive. And in order to have that, it is very important -- in many countries -- to upgrade their public investment management systems. And the IMF has been engaging over the years in capacity development in many countries, precisely to contribute to have the right conditions in place.Moreover, when it comes to debt, it is extremely important that the debt commitments be transparent and transparently assumed so that they can be appropriately reflected in the medium- and long-term programming of public finances.Mr. Senhadji: For India, the outlook for both the short and medium term remains quite favorable. Growth has picked up to about 7.5 percent in 2017 -- it is planned, actually, or projected to pick up in 2018. And over the medium term, it is projected to reach above 8 percent, one of the highest growth rates in the world.Of course, debt remains relatively high, you are right, at 70 percent of GDP in 2017, but the authorities are well aware of the problem. And, of course, in terms of their fiscal consolidation plan, in fiscal year 2017-18, they are planning to continue with the consolidation in the current fiscal year and over the medium term.They are, in fact, targeting their federal deficit of 3 percent over the medium term, and they are targeting also a debt ratio of 40 percent over the medium term at the federal level, which corresponds to about 60 percent at the general government level. And we believe that those targets are appropriate.So I think you are right. The debt level is relatively high, but the authorities are planning to bring it down over the medium term with the right policies.Questioner: Could you please talk more about Africa and give us some specifics about the debt and the challenges and what the African continent has to do. And finally, last year you made similar forecasts and projections. Do you have the feeling that African leaders listen to you? Are they implementing all these forecasts or recommendations that you make here at the IMF?Ms. Pattillo: For Africa as a whole, in terms of the fiscal policy priorities, I will mention three.First, prudent fiscal policy is needed in most countries to rein in the buildup in public debt. And when you look at Sub-Saharan Africa, of course, there is a lot of variety. There are many countries. Africa is not a block. And it is important, in particular, to look at the different experiences and policy priorities for oil-exporting countries and other commodity-exporting countries and then also for the non-commodity-exporting countries.In terms of this first priority for oil exporters in particular, there is a need to adjust their fiscal positions, taking advantage of the uptick in commodity prices. And a high priority is building up the capacity for more non-oil revenues, as well as enhancing the efficiency of public spending. So that is oil.For non-commodity exporters, some of them have accumulated high levels of debt associated with public investment. So they will need to make spending more efficient. And in some cases where there has been large public investment, it might be time for the governments to hand over the reins of investment to the private sector. So that is the first point.The second point is that overall for Sub-Saharan Africa, domestic revenue mobilization is really one of the most pressing challenges. Countries have very low levels of tax-to-GDP, but there is great potential there. Over the next several years, countries could mobilize on average 3 to 5 percent of GDP in additional tax revenues by strengthening VAT systems, reducing exemptions, expanding income tax coverage, and harnessing new technologies, which is the subject of our Fiscal Monitor chapter on digitalization. So that is a second priority.And, of course, fiscal policies should strike the appropriate balance between debt sustainability and addressing important development needs. The revenue mobilization that I talked about can give countries the ability to spend on pressing development needs, human capital, physical capital, and protect social spending, even during fiscal consolidation.Questioner: I had asked you if you made a similar projection last year, do you have the feeling that African leaders implement your recommendations?Ms. Pattillo: The emphasis that we put is that exactly as you say, countries are very much planning strong policies, fiscal consolidation, recognizing that the time is now. The key is implementation, delivering on those plans. And we work very closely with countries -- both countries that are involved in IMF-supported programs and other countries -- through our policy advice and technical assistance, to help them then with the push for implementing their plans.Mr. Gaspar: Allow me one example.I was, myself, recently in Cote d'Ivoire. And in Cote d'Ivoire, we organized a hackathon, which is a session that brings together people who deal with public policy, people who are representing civil society, corporations, people who are IT experts. And in this specific case of the Cote d'Ivoire hackathon, we were trying to challenge this crowd to solve longstanding problems in tax administration.This was a very creative process that took about two days. And at the end of the two days, we had 10 competing ideas, 10 competing projects. We, together with those responsible from the tax administration, from the Ministry of Budget, picked up the three winning proposals. And those are now being worked on to be implemented in Cote d'Ivoire.So I do not think that your question allows, as Cathy was emphasizing, a blanket type of answer. It is about bilateral engagement with countries. And often, as it was the case for the Cote d'Ivoire hackathon, it is a very worthy and useful experience for, I believe, the authorities of the country and for us as well.Questioner: Some emerging and especially low-income countries increase public debt trying to move out of financial crisis circumstances. For example, Ukraine directs external borrowing at trying to maintain national currency rate, central bank reserves, infrastructure reforms. Could you concretize which fiscal buffers or fiscal stimulus could be implemented for the countries that have the same situation as my country?Mr. Senhadji: I think Ukraine has made remarkable progress in the first years of the program with the Fund. Particularly in 2014 and 2015, there was significant progress that was made. Unfortunately, in subsequent years, progress has been slow, and the Fund is trying to re-engage with the authorities on the issue of continuing with the program and its objectives.In terms of priorities, obviously, one of the main priorities to continue with the reform of the mechanism for gas pricing. As you know, there was a formula, an automatic formula for the evolution of prices, and we would like the authorities to go back to that formula. We would like them more so to tackle the problem of corruption and governance, which is quite important. And we would like them also, of course, to continue with the consolidation program that they have agreed upon at the beginning of the program.I think this would certainly put the program again on track, and we hope that the discussion going forward will reach an agreement very soon.Questioner: Forty percent of low-income countries are in debt distress or will soon be in debt distress. A lot of them have borrowed from the capital markets, and global interest rates are going up. How close are we to a new developing country debt crisis?Ms. Pattillo: Specifically for Sub-Saharan Africa, debt vulnerabilities have risen in some countries in the region, and six low-income countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are in debt distress. The causes are country-specific, but most of the countries are in fragile situations or they are facing adjustment to the price of their major export commodity.Our projections show that if countries fully implement their fiscal consolidation plans, debt levels will stabilize and remain sustainable. There is variation. The projections show that in two-thirds of countries in the medium term debt would be going down; that means another third not. The average public debt levels are projected to stabilize, but the forecasts are predicated on strong fiscal adjustment and/or an acceleration in growth.As Vitor said at the beginning, there is no room for complacency. Also in the case of Sub-Saharan Africa and low-income countries more generally, they have to deliver on their planned adjustment. And to do this in the most growth-friendly way, countries have to strengthen their tax capacity. So those are the priorities for addressing the debt.Mr. Krzyzanowski: Vitor, why don't you say a few words to conclude?Mr. Gaspar: The first thing that I want to say is to amplify what Cathy has just said. When we insist that low-income countries should be improving, increasing their tax revenue mobilization, we see that as an instrument for sustainable development. In that context, higher tax capacity will also help sustain debt service, but that is not an end in itself. The end in itself is sustainable development, which is served by state capacity and the ability to spend on priority areas that Cathy has already emphasized: health, education, public infrastructure, and much else.I will just beg your indulgence for 30 seconds more to insist that our main topic in this Fiscal Monitor was debt. Very high debt levels, public and private, in the context of a very favorable upswing, in the context of good times. Governments are well advised to build fiscal buffers so that they are ready to tackle the challenges that will inevitably come.Thank you for your attention.IMF Communications DepartmentMEDIA RELATIONSPRESS OFFICER: Wiktor KrzyzanowskiPhone: +1 202 623-7100 Email: MEDIA@IMF.orgLoad-Date: April 19, 2018End of Document

Security concerns have Australia reportedly reconsidering a 5G contract with China's HuaweiBusiness Insider USJune 14, 2018 Thursday 03:12 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 525 wordsByline: feedback@businessinsider.com,  (Tara Francis Chan)Highlight: Australian national security agencies are recommending the government not allow Chinese firm Huawei to work on new 5G networks. In 2012, the Chinese firm was flagged for cybersecurity concerns and the NSA reportedly warned Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull about Huawei earlier this year.Body• Australian national security agencies are recommending the government not allow Chinese firm Huawei to work on new 5G networks.• Sources told the Australian Financial Review that the "very direct" advice is based on national security concerns.• Huawei, and another Chinese firm ZTE, have repeatedly been flagged as potential risks to US and Australian intelligence, defence, and individual citizens.National security concerns may prevent Chinese firm Huawei from providing equipment to Australia's new 5G networks, the Australian Financial Review reported Thursday.Numerous security sources told the AFR that Huawei is almost guaranteed to be excluded from contributing to the country's 5G wireless network after national security agencies recommended against involving Huawei. One source said the advice will be be "very direct" and provide "very little wiggle room."In 2012, Huawei was not allowed to tender for Australia's National Broadband Network (NBN) due to cybersecurity concerns, a decision that was based on advice from the national security agency, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO).And earlier this year, during a visit to the US, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was reportedly briefed by the head of the National Security Agency and Department of Homeland Security regarding concerns over Huawei supplying equipment for the 5G network. It was subsequently announced the Australia's Home Affairs Department would conduct a full national security assessment before Huawei could contribute.Six intelligence chiefs - including the heads of the CIA, FBI, and NSA - testified in February that they do not use, and would not recommend private citizens use products from Huawei or Chinese company ZTE."We're deeply concerned about the risks of allowing any company or entity that is beholden to foreign governments that don't share our values to gain positions of power inside our telecommunications networks," FBI Director Chris Wray said. "It provides the capacity to maliciously modify or steal information. And it provides the capacity to conduct undetected espionage."Since then, Australia's defence department told Business Insider it no longer uses Huawei phones and is phasing out ZTE handsets. And the Pentagon announced in early May that it stopped selling Huawei and ZTE phones and modems in stores on its military bases because they "           may pose an unacceptable risk."The other bidders for Australia's 5G contracts are Finland's Nokia and China's ZTE.Business Insider has contacted Huawei for comment and will update this post when it receives a response.NOW WATCH: How Apple can fix HomePod and SiriSee Also:• Amazon criticized for 'secretly oppressing' workers at its Echo Dot and Kindle factory• A top tech investor says cameras watching your every move is inevitable in the US: 'It's not my fault what the future holds, so if it's scary I apologize'• The world's largest producer of bitcoin mining chips, which is run by a 32-year-old billionaire, is reportedly considering an IPOSEE ALSO: Australian MPs may call Mark Zuckerberg to a committee hearing over Facebook data and Chinese phonesLoad-Date: February 11, 2019End of Document

Trump promises ZTE deal, but questions and concerns remainFierceWirelessMay 29, 2018 Tuesday 11:31 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Questex Media Group LLC All Rights ReservedSection: ARTICLELength: 488 wordsByline: Mike DanoHighlight: President Trump announced on Friday that he would rescind a Commerce Department ban on U.S. business with China’s ZTE, an action that lawmakers had previously warned against. The action appeared to signal a further slackening of tensions between the United States and China over trade.BodyPresident Trump announced on Friday that he would rescind a Commerce Department ban on U.S. business with China’s ZTE, an action that lawmakers had previously warned against. The action appeared to signal a further slackening of tensions between the United States and China over trade.However, Tuesday morning, the White House announced $50 billion of tariffs on goods imported from China “to protect domestic technology and intellectual property from certain discriminatory and burdensome trade practices by China.”Meanwhile, Reuters reported that Qualcomm expects to meet with Chinese regulators this week and believes it may receive final approval from that government to consummate its purchase of NXP. And            Bloomberg reported that China will approve Qualcomm's deal for NXP if Trump successfully lifts the restrictions on ZTE.And, casting a pall over the entire situation, the New York Times reported that Ivanka Trump, President Trump’s daughter, received seven new trademarks from the Chinese government for her various businesses. The publication noted the timing of the awards wasn’t out of the ordinary, but nonetheless raised concerns over the separation of Trump’s family business connections with his role as U.S. president.Taken together, the movements indicate that U.S.-China relations over trade remain tenuous, and hanging in the balance are a number of major tech players in the global wireless industry.Kicking off the latest round of actions was President Trump, who tweeted at the end of last week a plan to allow ZTE to restart its business:The action drew criticism from a number of legislators including Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and            Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.But this morning the White House announced that “the United States will impose a 25 percent tariff on $50 billion of goods imported from China containing industrially significant technology, including those related to the ‘Made in China 2025’ program. The final list of covered imports will be announced by June 15, 2018, and tariffs will be imposed on those imports shortly thereafter.”It's unclear whether Qualcomm’s attempts to purchase NXP will be affected by today’s latest developments. Reuters reported Sunday that, according to unnamed sources, the company is making a final push with Chinese regulators to close its purchase of the chipmakers. The Chinese government is the last regulatory agency that Qualcomm needs to sign off on its purchase of NXP, a deal that the company is hoping will give it the ability to expand its business far beyond the slowing smartphone market.How U.S.-China trade relations play out could have a serious effect on the U.S. wireless market. After all, companies like Apple and Qualcomm collect significant revenues from the Chinese market.

SOCIAL SCIENCE OF THE INTERNET INTRIGUES STANFORD SENIOR QITONG CAO, 2018 RHODES SCHOLARStates News ServiceApril 26, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1362 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: STANFORD, Calif. BodyThe following information was released by Stanford University:By Kathleen J. SullivanIt didn't take long for Qitong Cao (pronounced cheeTUNG tsao), an international student from Nanjing, China, to find his intellectual passion at Stanford.Stanford senior Qitong Cao will represent his native country, China, as a 2018 Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University. (Image credit: L.A. Cicero)During his first year on the Farm, Cao heard that a renowned political scientist would be giving a guest lecture, "Reverse-Engineering Censorship in China." After finishing classes for the day, Cao walked to the Huang Engineering Center, eager to hear Gary King, director of the Harvard Institute for Quantitative Social Science, talk about his research.I have always considered myself a huge beneficiary of the internet, because it allowed me to gain access to a tremendous amount of knowledge, including how to apply to Stanford, Cao said. I developed a keen interest in the sociopolitical impacts of the internet and social media.In the 2014 lecture, King talked about the methods he and his colleagues, including Jennifer Pan, now an assistant professor of communication at Stanford, employed to study social media censorship in China. They found that posts that criticized the Chinese state, its leaders and their policies were routinely published, but posts with collective action potential were much more likely to be censored regardless of whether they were for or against the state."Their Science paper, which I read very closely after the talk, really got me interested in political science," Cao said. "I was really intrigued by how big data could be used to reveal sociopolitical phenomena."Forging an academic path on the FarmIt was the beginning of an exciting intellectual journey for Cao, who is now a Stanford senior majoring in political science and an honors student in the Center on Democracy, Development and the Rule of Law. Cao is simultaneously earning a master's degree in management science and engineering, with an emphasis on computational social science a field that uses computers to model, simulate and analyze social phenomena."I deeply appreciate the breadth of my Stanford education, especially the opportunity to pursue a liberal arts bachelor's degree and a technical master's program at the same time," Cao said. "That has allowed me to think about an issue from multiple standpoints and to understand how different methods may complement and reinforce one another in coping with real-world problems."Cao said he was grateful to the mentors who have guided him on his academic journey, including three senior fellows at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies Francis Fukuyama, Larry Diamond and Jean C. Oi, who is also the William Haas Professor in Chinese Politics in the Department of Political Science.Studying the internet's sociopolitical impactIn this, his last quarter at Stanford, Cao is putting the finishing touches on his honors thesis, "The China Wide Web," a topic that reflects his abiding interest in the sociopolitical impacts of the internet and social media."When there is no universal election to gauge public political inclination, a regime will have to face what I call the 'information dilemma,'" Cao said. "It needs accurate political information from its citizens to understand their political attitudes and adjust policies accordingly. But simultaneously, it has to prevent citizens from exposing such information to each other, which could lead to protests threatening its rule. The dilemma becomes more complicated in the era of the internet and social media, whose borderless nature impedes governmental efforts to collect citizens' information from foreign content platforms, or to insulate citizens from exposure to unfavorable information."I started to get the feel of the English language reading Harry Potter, which was very helpful, because I was reading other materials in English, such as Wikipedia. Learning English opened a new window for me.Qitong Cao2018 Rhodes ScholarIn his thesis, Cao argues that the Chinese government has come up with a new way to resolve the information dilemma by constructing a domestic cyberspace, in which internet platforms restrict the spread of political information among their users but provide user data to the government."This way, the government can get an overview of the political orientation of its population while preventing circulation of signals that could generate social instability," he said."But issues related to social media are not only a problem in China," Cao said, noting that several prominent internet companies in the United States also possess significant portions of user data from their online activities. "These data can be used to train algorithms to make predictions about certain user groups, which could give rise to huge sociopolitical effects."Cao looks forward to delving deeper into those issues at the University of Oxford, where he will begin his graduate studies as a 2018 Rhodes Scholar representing China in the Oxford Internet Institute, a multidisciplinary research and teaching department dedicated to the social science of the internet.Cao is the first Rhodes Scholar from China whose degree is not from a Chinese university. When he graduates in June, his parents will be in the audience for Commencement and their trip to the Farm will mark their first time abroad.Learning English at HogwartsLike children around the world, Cao was entranced by the adventures of Harry Potter at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and could hardly wait for each book in the J.K. Rowling series to be published. After reading the first five books in Chinese, he became impatient waiting for the sixth, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. So, he convinced his parents to buy the entire set in English, and sat down, dictionary at the ready, to read them from the beginning."As I proceeded through the novels I looked up words thousands of times, I would guess," Cao said. "I didn't know how to pronounce a lot of those words, so I came up with my own pronunciation. I started to get the feel of the English language reading Harry Potter, which was very helpful, because I was reading other materials in English, such as Wikipedia. Learning English opened a new window for me."At the Nanjing Foreign Language School, Cao continued studying English, though most of his classes were in Chinese. After receiving a scholarship to study abroad, he spent one semester as an exchange student at St. Louis University High School, a Jesuit college preparatory school for young men, and as a guest with two host families.Rhodes Scholar profilesStanford Report profiled each of the 2018 Rhodes Scholars. Following are links to other profiles in the series:Jelani MunroeMichael ChenMadeleine ChangAlexis KallenCao said his American classmates were very interested in all aspects of China and his life there, and asked him and the other two exchange students from his high school lots of questions."In retrospect, I think it was a great way for people from different cultures and different countries to interact," he said. "Telling them about my life was a great way to address some of their misunderstandings about China."During his first year at Stanford, Cao joined the Forum for American/Chinese Exchange at Stanford (FACES), which holds an annual two-part summit for 40 delegates that opens in October at Stanford and concludes in March at Peking University. Cao, who served as the organization's co-president in 2016-17, led summit programming efforts for three years."I believe strongly in the importance of cross-cultural communication," he said. "It is an extremely touching experience to see how our 40 delegates from China and the United States and elsewhere develop friendships and how their bonds deepen when they meet again a half year later," he said. "Tremendous tension could arise between the two countries from a lack of mutual understanding. Given the importance of U.S.-China relations to the future of the world, person-to-person exchange between university students in the two countries are all the more crucial."Load-Date: April 26, 2018End of Document

Forbes Media Chiarman and former Republican Presidential Candidate, Steve Forbes. And the President of Maslansky & Partners, Lee Carter. Great to see you this morning.LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS: Happy Monday.BARTIROMO: And to you. Good morning everybody.STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA: Great to be with you.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning.BARTIROMO: Great to see you Steve.MCDOWELL: So much to talk about. Glad that's wedding is over. We can get in -- get back to business.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well --FORBES: That's why the markets are up today.MCDOWELL: Yes.BARTIROMO: So what's your take on what went down this Sunday? You had Steve Mnuchin telling Chris Wallace on FOX News Sunday, "We have put the trade war on hold," what do you see? What do you think about that Steve?FORBES: Well as the president would say, that's huge. That's why the markets are up today.BARTIROMO: Right.FORBES: Trade war, yes, China may hurt -- get hurt more than we would but we would be hurt. The economy would be hurt, our agricultural sector would be hurt, we've got elections coming up. So, yes, trying to get this thing resolved without hurting the economy, enormous.BARTIROMO: There's a story in the Journal this morning, Dagen, I'm sure you saw it, that the -- that the messages are mixed. You got Steven Mnuchin saying, "Yes, we are putting tariffs on hold but then Mr. Lighthizer coming out with a statement later on the day saying, "We continue to expect that we are going to see tariffs going to effect. So, what happened? Where is the progress?MCDOWELL: I think that this just exemplifies the tension within the economic team within the White House. Steve Mnuchin, Larry Kudlow, Robert Lighthizer, the U.S. Trade Representative and Peter Navarro that they can't get on the same page.And just because the Secretary of the Treasury was the first to get on TV with a microphone on doesn't mean that everybody's in agreement. In a Lighthizer statement, he said that, "Tariffs remain an important tool to protect our technology." And we should point out that although the markets are reacting to good news, that China agreeing to reduce our trade deficit, there wasn't any hard number.The administration went into these negotiations with $200 billion number in terms of reducing their trade deficit, that seemed a little pie in the sky and so the statements from both China and the U.S. after these trade negotiations didn't have a hard and fast numbers.BARTIROMO: There's no number there. But what's even more concerning to me which we spoke about last week is this deal if it is in fact an agreement does nothing to address the actual real issues that face American business today. And that is the theft of intellectual property and the forced transfer of technology, what do you say about that Steve?FORBES: Well that's the thing, this focus on the trade deficit. If we have a booming economy, imports are going to go up, you can't control that number. What you can do is reduce trade barriers and those two big issues that you all talked about in terms of a trade theft of our intellectual property and --BARTIROMO: Well I think that's why they're not on the same page.For -- and opening up their markets.BARTIROMO: Because China is not agreeing to any of that --FORBES: But then --BARTIROMO: -- they're not even admitting that they do it.FORBES: But then you have another factor, North Korea. I think that's why the president's been relatively passive on this. He knows he needs their cooperation if he's going to get any kind of deal with the North.BARTIROMO: Yes. You don't want to conflate these two things but they're very much in line, aren't they?FORBES: Oh, they're all mixed. Yes.BARTIROMO: We're talking about all of this this morning. We have an exclusive interview coming up this morning with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. He will walk through this trade deal and what the progress actually really is.Georgia Senator David Perdue is with us this morning along with former GE Vice Chairman and former NBC Universal Chairman, Bob Wright in the studio this morning. Former Presidential Candidate and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee is here. And then AM 970 Radio Host, Saturday Night Alumni and Actor, Joe Piscopo, Saturday Night Live Alum, you don't want to miss moments of that. That's coming up.But first, we want to talk about this, hammering out a trade agreement with China, the two countries apparently coming together putting a trade war on the back burner. The U.S. will not impose tariffs while China says it will buy more American goods, that's according to one part of the administration this morning. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin outlined that progress with Beijing on FOX News Sunday yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MNUCHIN: We're putting the trade war on hold. So right now we are -- we have agreed to put the tariffs on hold while we try to execute the framework. The president has been very clear since the first meeting with President Xi in Mar-A-Lago that it is -- we are going to reduce the trade deficit, we have an agreement with China that they will substantially agree to it.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: So Steve Forbes, from the beginning some people were skeptical of attacking the trade deficit. We've lived with trade deficits and seen economic growth for some time. You think this is progress. Well obviously the markets think so this morning.FORBES: Well that we're not going to get in a trade war which nobody wants and ultimately nobody wins.BARTIROMO: Right.FORBES: And the key thing is, how do you make progress on intellectual property? How do you make progress and force the transfers of technology? That's the real thing. If they come up with metrics for that, I think you can start to make some real progress especially if we start to work with our European partners, we'll also have the same complaints about dealing with China on those issues.BARTIROMO: If you read between the lines though Dagen, do you think maybe it's China pushing back and not agreeing to anything with regard the theft of intellectual property and the force transfer of technology, that's why you're getting such mixed messages from Lighthizer and Mnuchin?MCDOWELL: Potentially. One thing I'll -- with respect to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, he was in on those negotiations along with Lighthizer and Mnuchin over the weekend, I failed to mention him.There's a quote in this Wall Street Journal article that's attributed to a person familiar with the China negotiations. "There's growing frustration with Secretary Mnuchin getting ahead of both the president and the trade team on the direction of the Chinese negotiations. His eagerness to do a deal significantly undercuts the U.S. negotiating position."So, again, there is disagreement there. And you have to be careful that you do a deal with the Chinese and you have a framework in place and then you take it to the president and he just shocks it in the garbage can --BARTIROMO: Right.MCDOWELL: -- because he's been very clear on how he feels about trade not just during the 2016 campaign, but going back to the 1980s for Pete sake. And one other thing to Secretary Mnuchin, don't use the words, Lee, trade war, don't ever utter that and say, "A trade war is on hold." My reaction when I heard that was --CARTER: When are they going to start again?MCDOWELL: -- "Oh, good." Right. Again, how long is it on hold?CARTER: Right.FORBES: But there's another big issue though coming up soon is NAFTA, what's going to happen on the NAFTA front? That's --MCDOWELL: Nothing, right?FORBES: -- even more significant.MCDOWELL: Nothing.FORBES: Well if nothing happens, what's the president going to do about it?BARTIROMO: Yes.FORBES: You can have a real fight in the Republican Party.BARTIROMO: And we thought we would see a market upset when we -- when it became clear last week that we weren't getting a deal last week because now we're heading into, well, the Mexican elections are going to start and that happens in July 1, and then, of course, the midterm elections. So if you don't get a NAFTA deal soon, you're not getting it until after the midterm.FORBES: Well the thing is, they can get what they call a skinny NAFTA, they'll bring this thing up --BARTIROMO: Right. Just on autos.FORBES: Yes. Without having Congressional approval.BARTIROMO: Yes.FORBES: Would we go that way? That would actually be a positive.BARTIROMO: But let's not forget what happened just hours after Steve Mnuchin made the comment that said no trade war, then you had Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer releasing a statement that said the tariffs remain an important legal tool to protect our technology.Yesterday, I spoke with House Armed Services Chairman, Mac Thornberry on Sunday Morning Futures about concerns over China as it relates to their military. And then earlier this month, former Vice President of the U.S., Dick Cheney also weighed in on why he thinks Beijing is such a threat.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. MAC THORNBERRY (R-TX), HOUSE ARMED SERVICES CHAIRMAN: China doesn't just take an all of government approach, they take in all of nation approach. Any company, any individual will be a tool of the Chinese government to steal, to buy, to borrow whatever it takes intellectual property that can be used in their military to -- against us.DICK CHENEY, FORMER U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: I think the Chinese long-term are the most serious, have the most capability and made some phenomenal gains economically which they're now converting to better military capability and so forth.2(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: And Lee, that was his answer to my question, what is the U.S.'s biggest threat in terms of foreign policy right now? Out of all of the things we discussed, Dick Cheney says China.CARTER: Yes. I mean it's a fascinating thing because it used to be we thought that China was going to just keep to itself. And now we have a whole new -- you know, China is clearly trying to expand its borders and, you know, I think what's so interesting about some of this trade war messaging is that the inconsistency and the messaging I think is going to make it harder for them to negotiate.You need everybody to be on the same page because there's some level of trust that needs to happen between negotiators. And if you think that one person is going to take one position, you don't know who's in-charge, you don't know what their position is going to be, it's going to make it very hard for a deal to get done and I'm really concerned that they can't get themselves on the same page.BARTIROMO: And, again, one of the issue here is China is not even admitting to the IP theft. They continue to say, "No, we are not stealing your intellectual property" and "No, we are not forcing the transfer of technology." So how do you get them to make changes to some of these things if they won't even admit?FORBES: Well, the thing is, when you put the proof on the table in the negotiations, we do have that. And number two, what priority isn't? Getting the focus on the trade deficit which is really how prosperous our economy is instead of focusing on trade barriers which I think Kudlow and others want to focus on. And that Lighthizer statement that came out, that was almost like a face-saver, "Oh, tariffs are still important, they're not off the table."BARTIROMO: Right. OK.FORBES: But I think the key thing is, it is a theft issue not deficit per se which is beyond our control.BARTIROMO: I agree with you. I agree with you.MCDOWELL: But in terms of the messaging, they do not -- these individuals within the White House do not seem to be on the same page.BARTIROMO: No.MCDOWELL: And I think that President Trump maybe -- needs to put them all in the room and give them some cookies and milk and treat them like the children that they're behaving like, maybe. You know, you get in a fight with the Treasury Secretary when you're in China, I think that's a problem. We're talking about Peter Navarro.FORBES: Well I think the president though was discovering sometimes a little confusion and haziness is a good thing --BARTIROMO: Yes.CARTER: Yes.FORBES: -- especially when you get those Korea negotiations coming up.MCDOWELL: Not for the market.CARTER: Seem to be his style though.FORBES: The markets like it.MCDOWELL: I mean the market -- Steve, the markets haven't even opened yet.BARTIROMO: Well, the market likes that one soundbyte, we put a trade war on hold for the moment.FORBES: Yes.BARTIROMO: You know, it seems they are making some movements on the opening of markets in China. That was another thing that's very important for American business, being able to sell to the Chinese people, the 1.3 --FORBES: Absolutely.BARTIROMO: -- person population, billion population but not over the near- term. So China made a suggestion that it will open up its auto market in five years. An automaker will be able to own a company in five years, so good new but not overnight.MCDOWELL: But --BARTIROMO: They recognize that things have to change it seems.MCDOWELL: To Steve's point on North Korea that Secretary Mnuchin's statement seems to put off the threat of tariffs until at least after the summit with Kim Jong-un on June -- it's still scheduled for June 12th. So that's what --BARTIROMO: They're tying these things together.MCDOWELL: Right. It -- their --BARTIROMO: Trade with North Korea.MCDOWELL: Yes. Absolutely.BARTIROMO: All right. We'll talk all -- more about this, this is a big story this morning and I'll be speaking exclusively this morning with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross about this ongoing trade talk with China at 7:00a.m. Eastern this morning. So join us for that special interview coming up with the Commerce Secretary.First though, looking out for every day Americans. President Trump getting trades for the boost in the nation's economy, we'll explain that.And then another risky bet by Tesla, despite production delays, a new Model 3 with a sky high price tag that hit the market, we'll tell you all about it when we come back, stay with us.BARTIROMO: Well looks like it will be a strong start of the week for markets, take a look, Dow Industrials up 230 points right now, that's one almost one percent. The S&P is up 15 points, two-thirds of a percent, and the NASDAQ up two-thirds as well, that's 45 points higher this morning.Meanwhile, the Kilauea Volcano is spewing new danger on Hawaii's big island this morning, Cheryl Casone has headlines now, Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: They just can't catch a break there Maria. Video showing a fast-moving lava crashing into the sea forming a toxic steam cloud that can irritate the skin and the eyes and cause people breathing problems.The hazardous clouds are spreading as far as 50 miles downwind. And now we have the first major injury to report, a man's lower leg shattered by flying molten rock. He was standing outside of his home.Well, new questions about the power and reach of Google, a report on CBS's 60 Minutes last night explored Google's dominance in online search suggesting it become a dangerous monopoly.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GARY REBACK, ANTITRUST LAWYER: People tell their search engines things they wouldn't even tell their wives. I mean, it's a very powerful and yet very intimate technology and that gives the company that controls that a mindboggling degree of control over our entire society.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Well the report said that Google conducts 90 percent of the world's internet searches. Consumer groups are trying to reduce that dominance. A group called "Focus on the User" has released a browser plug in that ditches Google's current local resort -- result, excuse me.Well General Electric is reportedly closing in on a deal to merge its transportation business. Report say the company is in talks with Wabtec, that's an equipment manufacturer in the rail industry. The results in company could be worth more than $20 billion. Shares of G.E. are higher in the premarket over stock though, up almost two percent right now. And later this morning 7:30 a.m. Eastern Time, Maria is going to be interviewing Bob Wright, former Vice Chairman of General Electric.Well Starbucks has told its employees that anyone is allowed to use its restroom. The announcement details that any person on Starbucks property is considered a customer and are not required to purchase anything. The policy changed following last month's arrest of two black men in a Philadelphia Starbucks who were denied access to the restroom. The two men were waiting for a friend and hadn't bought anything when police were called?Taking a look at of Starbucks, down nearly seven percent over the last year Maria. And those are your headlines on this Monday, back to you.BARTIROMO: All right. Thank you so much Cheryl. Lee, your thoughts on this change at Starbucks now?CARTER: You know, I think that Starbucks is really, really powerful in that they really understand the power of the symbolic gestures. So closing the doors for training, making sure that they have a policy changed.So whenever there's a crisis for them, they take action and those actions speak a lot louder than any other words that they could otherwise have. So I think that they deal with this very, very well. I think -- I think it's an important step for them.FORBES: It's also good news in New York since New York doesn't have any public bathrooms unlike any other major city in the world.BARTIROMO: Yes.FORBES: Starbucks going to get a line of traffic.BARTIROMO: Yes.FORBES: And if you're there, you might buy something.MCDOWELL: Steve, their public restrooms, you just have to talk to me during the break, I'll tell you where they are. They're all along the Westside highway.BARTIROMO: Really?MCDOWELL: Yes. In the parks. But, again, it -- I understand why restaurants lock their bathrooms because in New York City they become beyond disgusting, beyond. But now have at it.BARTIROMO: Yes. We'll see what happens with Starbucks here.MCDOWELL: Yes.CARTER: I mean I understand that there are reasons for businesses to do that as he say but I think that Starbucks right now because of the crisis they're in, because of what they're facing, they have to take action (INAUDIBLE)BARTIROMO: They had to do something.CARTER: They had to do something and I think this speaks really loud that they're taking this whole issue very seriously.BARTIROMO: All right. We'll take a break. Then another top story this morning, presidential demand, now action, the Justice Department Inspector General will look into whether or not an FBI informant who infiltrated President Trump's campaign was planted there and paid for political purposes, the disturbing new twist in this probe coming up.And then a breathing a sigh of relief, markets and the dollar getting a boost this morning as trade war fears are easing. How the White House win is setting the tone for the markets ahead, back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Markets are on fire this morning check it out, Dow Industrials up better than 200 points this morning, up about one percent as investors feel that a trade war is now put on hold after some agreements between the U.S. and China.Coming as a new CBS poll shows that President Trump is getting credit for the robust U.S. economy, 18 percent of voters are now rating the economy as very good while 46 percent say it is somewhat good. Thirty five percent believed the president's policies are a great deal responsible for America's economy success.And joining us right now to talk more about that is Investmark Advisory Group Principal, Michael Lee with $700 million under management. Michael, good to see you, thanks so much for joining.MICHAEL LEE, PRINCIPAL, INVESTMARK ADVISORY GROUP: Good morning. How are we doing?BARTIROMO: You're pretty bullish on this economy as well.LEE: Yes. Everywhere I look it seems not only things are good but they continue to get better. So, you look across the consumer, consumer confidence, consumer sediments, you look at the job market.Look at the rolling four-week average of Java's claims, it's the lowest it's been basically on the history of record and that's not adjusted for population growth. You look at things like the Quits Rates, add, you know, multiyear at the high levels, you look at the jolts at the highest level it's ever been. So everywhere I'm looking, it seems to me that not only things are good but they continue to improve and you haven't really seen the effects of the largest deregulatory event in the history of the United States. In addition to the largest fiscal stimulus we've ever had, so --BARTIROMO: Is that a reason to put money into stocks right here?LEE: Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. I don't -- look, people are going to say. "Well, stocks maybe slightly expensive. The thing is, what you need to remember is you can look at the PE multiple, now on a forward basis we're looking at 16.5, 16, somewhere along those lines.In 1999 we got the 24 and what happens is, the long-term average of the PE is like a 14 to a 15, somewhere in there and we're either way below it or way above it. And the expansionary times and in growth times you get way above it. So, people calling for and looking for a recession, I just -- I don't know what they're looking at or where that would come from.CARTER: Now, one of the things that I look at too in addition to the poll to that you're talking about is how people are feeling about the markets. So while people have -- feel very, very good about the economy, they're also still very, very nervous about their retirement savings, and about volatility.And so my concern is then what happens if there's -- if there's reason for people to be concerned, if China does go into a trade war and other things. What do you think about the fact that people are so nervous? Because emotional investors don't necessarily make the best decisions.LEE: Well, what I would say, the fact that everybody's so nervous and that hesitancy is precisely the reason why we're not or anywhere near a top. No one ever -- no one's -- the consensus is never always right, right?So if we are at the top of the market or we're about to go into a recession, this will be the first time where everyone's been right.BARTIROMO: Yes. It's like the saying, Steve, stocks climb a wall of worry.FORBES: Yes. No, it's a good thing. Do you worry a little bit about the Federal Reserve throwing a cold water on this and the idea that the economy is overheating and that kind of nonsense? Do you think they're going to try to tamp this thing down as it starts to picks up steam?LEE: So, I think the Fed is way behind the April, right? So you look at where the Federal short-end -- the front-end is right now, Fed funds, we're at 175, right? For us to be in a neutral standpoint, we need to get to close to 275 or 300.So, five or six more rates hikes from where we are right now to begin to even start slowing. I mean we still have a $4.3 trillion, $4.4 trillion balance sheet. So for the Fed to have a material impact of slowing down the economy that we need to raise rates eight or nine times looking at two to three years. It's so far away from where we are right now and I would actually say these next few rate hikes will be simulative and inflationary in that borrowers on the front-end and short-term investors and conservative investors are going to actually start to get some sort of interest and we're already starting to see that in the economy.BARTIROMO: But, you know Dagen, you've brought this up in the past, the Journal this morning is reporting that U.S. government bonds are now paying more than debt from other developed nations for the first time in roughly 20 years. This coming as the 10-year yield is hitting new highs, 3.08 percent is where we are right now.MCDOWELL: Right. It hit 3.1 to 2 percent last week. We're coming up on the two-year anniversary of the low on the 10-year yield. It was down at 1.36 percent two years ago this July. We're in the beginning of a -- what appears to be -- you talked to Jim Grant on Maria Bartiromo's Wall Street, what could be a 35-year bear market and longer term treasuries potentially.That's how long the bull markets been in -- as interest rates have been declining. The last bear market was a 35-year kind of rise in interest rates and yields. The biggest picture is, we also have a Federal Reserve that is unwinding and unprecedented balance sheet, it's going to unwind $420 billion this year. And I don't think any person in the market as smart as they might be understands what the implications for that are this year, next year, and the coming years.BARTIROMO: Never been done.LEE: Well what I would say is, you think about it, what is a U.S. Treasury and what does that yield represent? It represents the insurance value of the United States economy. And so as -- why are interest rates going higher? It's because for me to stand in the sidelines and not participate in risk assets, I need to be paid a lot more money.So, it is somewhat bullish that rates are rising off these ultra lows, right? Anybody that disagrees with that can take a look at Japan. If the insurance value of your country's treasury is worth one percent or negative with inflation, what does that say about the prospect of future growth? So, the yield curve steepening and increasing and bond selling off on the longer end, it is a very positive sign, better times come for our economy.BARTIROMO: All right. We -- yes.MCDOWELL: Yes. No, I was just going to say, but that assumed that that's the only reason that yields are up and quite frankly, when you have the Federal Reserve doing what it's doing in terms of winding down this giant $4 trillion portfolio, there's a lot more at play than just people's optimism about the economy if you look at Treasury.LEE: Well I would say that there are some positive factors to rates going higher particularly with large banks, right? And the velocity of money. If you look at the velocity and to money stocks since quantitative easing began, it hasn't really increased.So one of the main goals of quantitative easing just didn't work. And so as rate start to increase and regulation pulls back from the banks, we're going to see the velocity of money increase. So I would say, again, that there are negatives to it but the positives are far outweigh those and this is good for economic growth.BARTIROMO: All right. So real quick because we just had a GDP report that showed consumer spending was at the slowest pace in five years and there are a lot of people out there who think that we will see a recession in 2020, real quick.LEE: Well, you now, the only thing that people have to look towards, the only data point that you can use that is the yield curve inverting, right? And so that's where the short-term interest rates are higher than long-term interest rates and that's typically an indicator of recession.What I would say is in this instance it's completely different than a lot of other times we've seen it because when you are going towards a recession, when the economy is slowing down, and you have a sign of excess and the yield curve doesn't invert because the Fed's rising on the front- end, it's because investors are seeking protection and duration on the long-end. We haven't seen that. You're seeing the 30-year selloff not decrease because of the leading in recession. So, anybody's coin for one in 2020 is just going darts at the law, it is no doubt they'd approve it.BARTIROMO: All right. We'll be watching. Michael, great to have your insight.LEE: Well thank you.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much. Michael Lee joining us there. Coming up, a massive manhunt is underway this morning in South Carolina. Two men, both charged with murder, have escaped from jail. The very latest on that search, there. And then one of the biggest nights in music, taking a seriously serious tone, Texan Kelly Clarkson issues an emotional plea at the Billboard Music Awards, last night, as she pays tribute to the Santa Fe high school shooting victims. That's next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, good Monday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us this Monday. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Monday, May 21st, your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast. Back from the brink of a trade war, the U.S. is taking tariffs off against China off the table, apparently temporarily, and in return, China will start buying more American goods to narrow the trade deficit, that, if you believe one part of the administration.Final details still have to be hammered out this morning, but investors are liking the news. Futures are rallying, this morning, better than 200 points, up almost one percent. The S&P and the NASDAQ, up half a percent, this after stocks were little changed on Friday amid geopolitical uncertainty. Global markets, this morning, in early trading, look like this, in Europe, German markets are closed for a holiday, but the FT 100 is up three quarters of a percent and the CAC Quarante in Paris is up tw0- thirds of a percent.In Asia overnight, gains across the board, as you can see there. Meanwhile another investigation into the 2016 campaign, this time, it's the Justice Department's Inspector General, looking into alleged spying on the Trump team because the President demanded it. Here's what House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes told me yesterday, on Sunday Morning Futures.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: If they ran a spy ring or an informant ring, and they were paying people within the Trump campaign, if any of that is true, that is an absolute red line.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: We're taking a closer look at the Justice Department's response to the President. The President is demanding investigation into this. A call for action, meanwhile, singer and Billboard Music Awards host, Kelly Clarkson, speaks out, following the school shooting in Santa Fe, Texas on Friday. The Texas native says she's sick of moments of silence.Elon Musk not slowing down despite production problems for the model 3 vehicle, Tesla CEO is tweeting details of a new faster version of the mass market vehicle. It comes with a bigger price tag, though, the stock, this morning, up almost two percent. And Avengers, dethroned this weekend, the film losing the top spot at the box office after three weeks at number one.We have the full recap, coming up, later this hour. But first, this, Justice Department Inspector General will look at whether political motivation affected the FBI investigation of collusion with Russia in President Trump's campaign.The announcement coming yesterday, just hours after President Trump tweeted this, I hereby demand and will do so officially tomorrow that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI and the Department of Justice infiltrated or surveilled the Trump campaign for political purposes and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama administration. Here's what House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes told me yesterday on Sunday Morning Futures about the FBI interference with the 2016 campaign.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NUNES: If they ran a spy ring or an informant ring, and they were paying people within the Trump campaign, if any of that is true, that is an absolute red line. There's not an honest person in this country who can believe that taxpayer dollars going to fund this ring and operate like this, like what's said in "The New York Times", I think, it would have had quite a bit -- you know, quite a bit of detail on it, if any of that is true, there's a red line in this country.You can't do this to political campaigns, I mean, this was done -- I mean, according to them, this was done in the spring, I mean, before the counterintelligence investigation was even open. If that's true, we need to know about it.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now to talk more about it is the Daily Caller Editor-in-Chief, Christopher Bedford, Christopher, it's good to see you this morning.CHRISTOPHER BEDFORD, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE DAILY CALLER: Good morning.BARTIROMO: So what's your take on all of this?BEDFORD: Well, I'm cautiously optimistic that the DOJ has done anything at all in response to the President's tweets, but not just the President's tweets in response to all the things that we've learned about this investigation possibly having begun or spying, having begun before counterintelligence investigation. But I'm really not that optimistic at all in the end because I'm not sure what an Inspector General is going to be able to do.That's not going to be -- an Inspector General doesn't have subpoena power, they won't be able to speak to anyone in the Obama administration, they won't be able to speak to Clapper, or Comey or Brennan or anyone else in the intelligence community who has since -- who has since left. I'm not sure exactly how -- what we're going to find out from doing an internal review with people who are currently at the Department of Justice.BARTIROMO: Well, Bob Goodlatte has subpoena power, the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and he certainly has been subpoenaing documents and all. Look, this investigation that Devin Nunes is doing, is trying to understand what triggered the investigation into the Trump campaign.What intelligence was out there to actually come up with this idea that there could be collusion between Trump and Russia? We've had no evidence of it. And they can't get the documents that they are asking for in order to get to the bottom of this because Devin Nunes told me two weeks ago -- three weeks ago, that there was actually no official intelligence used to launch such a campaign, Steve Forbes?FORBES: No. It is outrageous, even (INAUDIBLE) in his hayday of abuse, never did something like that, put spies in a political campaign. And the fact that Brennan and Clapper are behaving the way they are, not trying to turn over documents, you know, there's a huge cover-up and it goes right to their ultimate boss, President Trump's predecessor.BARTIROMO: President Obama?FORBES: You bet.BARTIROMO: So you think he was calling the shots here?FORBES: I think he knew what was going on.BARTIROMO: Yes. And John Brennan -- Chris, this is incredible, I got to take your take on this, John Brennan is now threatening Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell, the former CIA director weighed in on the DOJ's review of the FBI campaign infiltration, taking aim at GOP leaders, Senator Mitch McConnell and Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan.Look at this tweet that Brennan put out this morning, Senator McConnell and Speaker Ryan, if Mr. Trump continues along this disastrous path, you will bear major responsibility for the harm done to our democracy, you do a great disservice to our nation and the Republican Party if you continue to enable Mr. Trump's self-serving actions. Your take on this?BEDFORD: Brennan is not doing himself any services, talking out like this. Brennan is somebody who should be also careful about what's going on in his own house. We know that Brennan told Congress when Congress was trying to investigate exactly what started this counterintelligence investigation, for example, the Steele dossier had nothing to do with it.He was, of course, said that -- some of his associates said that that was incorrect, it actually had been used. And then Senator Harry Reid who was then at the time in office, said that when Brennan was briefing him on possible Russian collusion, he took that as a signal that Brennan wanted this information leaked to the press.And once there were briefings going on about this ridiculous dossier, then (INAUDIBLE) places in the press where it's leaked, to places like Buzzfeed said, well, now that there have been briefings at high levels, we've got a reason to leak this now and damage the -- and damage President Donald Trump. This seems like it's a set-up. And he's not a reliable person and maybe he ought to consider getting a lawyer.BARTIROMO: Every time you think the story has gotten incredibly worse than you thought before, it gets even worse again. It's incredible.MCDOWELL: And Christopher, to lay out what we found out in the last few weeks, in part, because of Kimberly Strassel's reporting at the Wall Street Journal, is this FBI informant. It's very obvious to many who this individual is, who set up meetings with Carter Page, George Papadopoulos and Sam Glovis during the 2016 campaign. Again, it raises the question of, when was this FBI counterintelligence investigation opened, who knew what and when? And the public deserves to know that, and instead, Devin Nunes, at the House Intelligence Committee, is being treated like a traitor. Like somebody who's abusing power rather than somebody trying to get to the bottom of what was essentially -- it appears as if spying on a Presidential campaign.BEDFORD: And we mentioned Steven Halper's name as a potential person who could be this mystery guy on this show, just, I think, two weeks ago now.BARTIROMO: That's right.BEDFORD: And he came on. He was in contact with three members of the Trump campaign, talking to all of them. He only actually raised a suspicion that we have been able to find with Papadopoulos because he came out of nowhere it seemed. According to Papadopoulos, for someone who's familiar with his thinking, he came out of nowhere, asking about the Russian collusion and Russian emails and if they had anything to do with anything. And at that point, Papadopoulos pulled back.But this person got in touch with Carter Page right after he gave a talk on Russian relations. He got in touch with Papadopoulos reaching out and if he was funnelling information back and using his connections to MI-6, as former CIA connections, a former U.S. government employee, this is spying on U.S. citizens and people like Brennan don't have a good reputation for spying on U.S. citizens and then lying about it already.FORBES: Christopher, where is Sessions on this, the attorney general? Is he -- what's he doing?BARTIROMO: Yes. What is he doing?BEDFORD: He's upsetting the President, that's for certain. He's rescued, he's on the sidelines, somebody earlier called him absent without leave because the President is obviously annoyed on his absence on this situation. But maybe there ought to be some movement for Attorney General Jeff Sessions. And here is something I have noticed about him and have long career in the Senate. You can always count on Sessions to do the right thing, eventually. It just takes a little bit of time with the gentleman. CARTER: I think that's awfully generous. I'm fascinated, though, by the fact that they are not using the word, spy. They're making a really big deal about calling the informant not a spy.BARTIROMO: Yes, like Jim Comey and his so-called leak. Not a leak, right.BEDFORD: What's interesting about that is that he seems to have done more than simply informed. He wasn't somebody who was just quietly present and then said, you know what? I saw some suspicious activity. He reached out to Carter Page, he reached out to George Papadopoulos, he asked searching questions, he invited them back to his farm. He wasn't just a fly in the wall. He's someone who went out there, fishing.BARTIROMO: That sounds like a spy, Christopher. And by the way --BEDFORD: Exactly.BARTIROMO: And by the way, you mentioned this goes all the way up the ladder, potentially, to President Obama, calling the shots. We know for a fact that Sally Yates and Loretta Lynch were briefed, on the Trump Campaign in March of 2016. Couple of months later, we learned of a dossier, then we learned that Loretta Lynch told Jim Comey to refer to the investigation as a matter, not as a criminal investigation, it was all coordinated.BEDFORD: Yes. It stings all the way up to the very top.BARTIROMO: Wow.FORBES: And that coincidence of meeting with Bill Clinton to discuss golf scores and grandkids.BARTIROMO: Right. They wanted to discuss the grandkids on the Tarmac in Arizona, right, just extraordinary.CARTER: It is extraordinary. I think it's really important to the American people whether they support the President or not, look at this and say, this is not OK, because if you look -- if you took the players out, and said this behaviors were happening with anyone else -- there'd be outrage.BARTIROMO: Yes, the left throws out the constitution when it's -- when it's about Donald Trump. It's not okay unless it's about Donald Trump and conservatives.MCDOWELL: If you can't call it spying, what do you call it?CARTER: Informing, what is that?BARTIROMO: Christopher, more will be revealed, we will see, and we'll be watching the Daily Caller, of course. Thank you so much, sir.BEDFORD: Thank you.BARTIROMO: We'll see you soon, Christopher Bedford there. Coming up, heartbreak and demands for action from Texan, Kelly Clarkson, this weekend, the musician issues an emotional plea last night during the Billboard Music Awards in the wake of the Santa Fe school shooting, and then, stepping on the gas, Elon Musk, announcing a powerful new Tesla model 3 with eye- popping price tag, details, coming up, back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. An intense manhunt underway this morning for two escaped murder suspects, Cheryl Casone with the details now and headlines, Cheryl.CASONE: That's right, Maria, authorities are searching for 27-year-old Teshan Johnson, and 20-year-old Curtis Green after a jailbreak in South Carolina -- they overpowered a correctional officer on Saturday night and then escaped. The two were charged with murder in separate incidents. A third man, who escaped with them, has now been recaptured.Well, it was a night of celebration and remembrance. The Billboard Music Awards in Las Vegas, host and Texan, Kelly Clarkson, opened show with tearful plea in the wake of Friday's shooting at a Santa Fe, Texas high school that left 10 people dead.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KELLY CLARKSON, SINGER AND SONGWRITER: I'm so sick of moment of silence. It's not working. Why won't we do moment of action, why don't we do moment of change, why don't we change what's happening because this is horrible? We need to do better. The people are failing our children, we're failing our communities, we're failing their families.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Well, meanwhile, Taylor Swift attending her first award show in two years treated to her performance of her own music. Swift with a sarcastically sassy reaction to Clarkson's rendition of "Look What You Made Me Do". She was rolling her eyes, glancing in her nails, and casually singing along before breaking out into laughter -- that was interesting. Later in the night, Swift went home a winner as top female artist. As for the night of the big winners, Ed Sheeran dominated the night, taking home four awards, including top male artist. While Kendrick Lamar was named the top streaming artist of the year.All right, "Deadpool 2" taking out "The Avengers" at the box office.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Doing the right thing is messy. But if you want to fight for what's right, sometimes you have to fight dirty.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: "Deadpool 2", starring Ryan Reynolds, racked up $125 million in its opening weekend, ending a three-week run of "Avengers: Infinity War", is the box office winner in North America. "Avengers" to second place with an estimate of $29 million. In third place was "Book Club"; that's Jane Fonda, Diane Keaton, and Candice Bergen, that brought in $12.5 million. "Life of the Party", Melissa McCarthy, and "Breaking In" rounded up the top five, Maria. So, a lot of entertainment, and that whole wedding thing over the weekend.BARTIROMO: A lot of stuff to tell you about today -- oh, there's that, of course. Thank you, Cheryl. Coming up, despite production delays, pressure from investors and report that the company is burning more cash than rubber, Tesla is rolling out an all-new Model 3 with this summer with staggering price. We got the details on the other side of this break. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Tesla's Elon Musk, announcing new high- performance Model 3, but get this, $78,000. Gerri Willis with all the details this morning, Gerri.WILLIS: That's right, Maria. If you got a little extra change, and want to buy a car, well, maybe this (INAUDIBLE). There may be production delays at Tesla, but a brand-spanking-new Model 3 is on the way. And CEO Elon Mush said, hey, deliveries are going to start in July. Elon Musk announcing details about a high-performance upgrade for Tesla's Model 3 electric cars in a series of tweets including one version that more than doubles the sedan's cost. The performance version of the Model 3, as Maria said, will cost around $78,000 and will feature a top speed of 155 miles per hour going from zero to 60 in 3.5 seconds.The Tesla chief executive compared the suit-up model to BMW's high performance M3 -- if you're familiar with that line -- which starts around $67,000. Musk tweeting this, "about the same as BMW M3, but 15 percent quicker and with better handling, will beat anything in its class on the track." I guess we'll have to wait and see. The regular dual motor version will a top speed of 140 miles per hour and hit 0 to 60 in 4.5 seconds, adding $5000 to the base price 35,000. The Model 3 was intended to be Tesla's first affordable mass market sedan. The range of both all- wheel drive dual motor version will be the same as current Model 3 about 310 miles per hour.And as we've reported, Model 3 plagued by production delays and last week report said the car maker would shut down production again later this summer to upgrade production lines and hit targets of making 5,000 per week. I don't know how this makes this easier, but I can tell you that the stock was down pretty mildly on Friday, about 2.7 percent -- down 11 percent on the year. It looks like it's going to open higher today.BARTIROMO: It's interesting that they're building a new Model 3 even if people question the liquidity of this company, that they're going to be running out of cash.WILLIS: Right. That's a big question, I think, for a lot of investors in the stock. And I think that the promises of more, you know, production, more models, more this, more that is people are starting to question this, right?CARTER: I think at one -- I mean, the question I have is where is the focus? It seems to be all over the place for him, and that makes it harder to understand what is the future this business is going to be.MCDOWELL: It is a national brand extension, though, for the car. It's a national brand extension to appeal to the people who like Tesla in the first place. Although, I have issues with Elon Musk, the personality. I think that this is a natural move. But, again, maybe it's to change the focus away from the production problems to a more positive narrative to your point.FORBES: Do you think another car maker will pump capital into this company?BARTIROMO: That's a good question. You mean, is it too expensive, though, to get -- you mean just as an investment or a takeout?FORBES: Takeout.WILLIS: Well, everybody says they need to have somebody else to build cars because they can't seem to do it. So, maybe, you know, do a deal with G.M., or Ford, or somebody to actually produce these cars. Big question is if they can actually get these on the road.MCDOWELL: As a car enthusiast, I would --FORBES: Or foreign car maker like Korea.MCDOWELL: Right. And as a car enthusiast, I would recommend buying a used M3 from BMW, rather than forking over nearly 80,000.WILLIS: They're pretty cool.MCDOWELL: Exactly. Nothing wrong with just internal combustion engine.BARTIROMO: But you think Tesla gets acquired?FORBES: Ultimately, yes.BARTIROMO: Gerri, thank you.WILLIS: You're welcome.BARTIROMO: Gerri Willis. Still ahead, an exclusive interview with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on the fast-moving developments on the China trade deal that's just moment away, right here in MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Monday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us this morning. Happy Monday! I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, May 21st.

5 things for May 30: Roseanne, South China Sea, ex-USC gynecologistCNN WireMay 30, 2018 Wednesday 10:23 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 980 wordsByline: By AJ Willingham, CNNDateline: (CNN) Body (CNN) --  So, how did anti-bias training sessions at Starbucks work out? Here's a recap, plus everything else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. (You can also get "5 Things You Need to Know Today" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.)1. RoseanneWelp, there goes that. If "Reboot of nostalgic TV show canceled after beloved star of yesteryear is racist on Twitter" isn't a 2018 headline, we don't know what is. The oft-discussed ABC show was axed Tuesday after Roseanne Barr tweeted an insult to a former Obama aide, referring to her as a product of the "Muslim brotherhood" and "Planet of the Apes." She also targeted Chelsea Clinton, falsely saying Clinton was married to a nephew of George Soros, whom she called a Nazi in another tweet. Within hours, the network canceled the show, and the president of ABC Entertainment released a statement calling the ape tweet "abhorrent." Entertainers and figures from around the TV world supported the network's decision to cancel the show. Despite its high ratings, the reboot has been a source of controversy since the first episode because of its pro-Trump angle and the volatile musings of its star.2. South China SeaTensions over the disputed South China Sea have heated up in recent weeks. The Chinese government, which claims much of the region as its sovereign territory, has established a significant military presence there, but other countries such as the United States say the strategically important and resource-rich area is in international waters. Tuesday, US Defense Secretary James Mattis said the United States will continue "a steady drumbeat" of naval exercises to challenge China's increased militarization of the area. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte also has strong feelings about the South China Sea: He says if China unilaterally mines the region's rich natural resources, which include oil and natural gas reserves, the Philippines is prepared to go to war. 3. Ex-USC gynecologistFifty-two former patients of a gynecologist who treated thousands of women at the University of Southern California have reported they may have been victims of inappropriate and possibly criminal behavior. Police estimate Dr. George Tyndall may have seen 10,000 patients during his nearly 30 years of work there, and they suspect there could be more victims among these women. Tyndall was fired in 2017 for inappropriate behavior, USC says. The scandal is already leaving a mark on the campus: Last week, university President C.L. Max Nikias agreed to step down after current and former students signed an online petition demanding his resignation. CNN has been unable to reach Tyndall for comment. But he has told the Los Angeles Times, "I have never had any sexual urges" toward patients. He also described his examinations as thorough and appropriate. 4. ImmigrationThere has been a lot of rhetoric and misinformation about immigration issues recently. You know those 1,500 children the government reportedly "lost" or said are "missing?" They're probably not lost or missing. The viral photo of children in a detention center that's been shared by both liberals and conservatives alike? It's from 2014, but it likely doesn't show children who were ripped from their families at the border. The White House has been sharing misinformation, too. White House adviser Stephen Miller said Tuesday that Democrats are to blame for the "crisis" at the border and for defending "loopholes" that migrants exploit. In reality, there is no "crisis" at the border in terms of number of crossings. The "loopholes" Miller seems to refer to are in fact long-held asylum protocols, and there have been several Republican factions that have rejected some of the administration's more hard-line immigration proposals. 5. Puerto RicoA shocking new figure is raising questions about the real toll of last year's Hurricane Maria. According to a report in a prestigious medical journal, an estimated 4,645 people died in Maria and its aftermath in Puerto Rico. That figure dwarfs Puerto Rico's official death toll of 64, which the article's authors called a "substantial underestimate." The death toll has long been a source of argument, but before this study, it was assumed Maria contributed to about 1,000 deaths. The exact death toll will probably be hard to pin down since unsafe conditions in the US territory have persisted for so long after the storm. TODAY'S QUOTE"Pornography. It's available. It's available on the shelf when you walk in the grocery store. Yeah, you have to reach up to get it, but there's pornography there."US Rep. Diane Black, R-Tennessee, who says pornography, along with violent movies and the deterioration of families, contributes to gun violence in schools.BREAKFAST BROWSEPeople are talking about these.

TRADE NEGOTIATIONS REQUIRE A STEEL SPINEStates News ServiceMay 25, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1322 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Campaign for Americas Future:President Donald Trump dealt himself a strong hand before negotiating with China.He held three aces. He'd placed tariffs on imported aluminum and steel in response to unrelenting Chinese overproduction. He'd threatened tariffs on $150 billion in Chinese imports in retaliation for theft and forced transfer of American intellectual property. And for trade violations, he forbate U.S. companies to sell parts to Chinese cell phone giant ZTE, forcing it out of business.And then, inexplicably, his lead negotiator, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, quickly folded in talks in Washington, D.C., last week. He left two days of negotiations with top Chinese officials with what amounts of an unenforceable letter of intent.This "joint statement" says the Chinese will buy some more American made stuff, improve its protections for American intellectual property and patents, and remove some barriers preventing U.S. companies from operating in China. But there are no specifics and no enforcement.Vague PromisesIn exchange for these vague promises, Mnuchin suspended the tariffs. In addition, on Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that the United States and China had reached a tentative deal to save ZTE, despite the fact that ZTE failed to honor an earlier agreement made after it violated trade embargoes against Iran and North Korea.Now China holds all the aces. It is bragging that it trounced the United States in trade talks. The stock market shot up 350 points Monday on Mnuchin's assertion that he'd stopped a trade war between China and the United States. And maybe certainty for investors was all Mnuchin, a former Wall Street banker, wanted.But steel stocks slumped Monday. And that's not what President Trump promised on the campaign trail. It's not what tough negotiators would have achieved for the United States when it had the upper hand. No potent negotiator would have surrendered that hand for vague promises, especially considering China's long history of disregarding its trade pledges.Violating TradeDonald Trump won the presidency in part by connecting with working people who'd been hurt by Chinese trade violations. That includes tens of thousands of members of the union I lead, the United Steelworkers (USW).China improperly subsidizes its industries, enabling them to charge prices that often are below production cost. Beijing requires U.S. companies to transfer intellectual property in exchange for operating in China. It has engaged in cyber theft of U.S. trade secrets, including from American steel companies. It commits other violations, including currency manipulation and trans-shipping to circumvent tariffs. As a general case, it flouts international trade rules and regulations so that it can dominate markets.American manufacturers and their workers wanted Donald Trump to stop all of that. And, for a while, it looked like he might.Bringing It All BackAfter a yearlong investigation to determine whether imports of steel and aluminum had so diminished the U.S. capacity that national security was threatened, the Trump administration on March 1 placed 25 percent tariffs on imported steel and 10 percent on imported aluminum. The intent was to preserve enough of the U.S. industry that filling defense needs domestically would not be at risk.These sanctions followed a decade of the United States and Western Europe trusting China to keep repeated promises to stop overproducing, only to watch the Asian giant ramp up production even more. In 2001, China produced only slightly more steel than the United States, about 150 million metric tonnes.By 2017, China produced 831.73 metric tonnes, half the steel forged in the world that year. It dumps an average of 90 million metric tonnes on the international market annually, suppressing prices and threatening the viability of mills worldwide.In announcing the tariffs, President Trump said, "People have no idea how badly our country has been treated by other countries. They've destroyed the steel industry; they've destroyed the aluminum industry, and other industries, frankly. We're bringing it all back."U.S. industries did begin to gear up, restarting cold furnaces and recalling some 4,000 laid-off workers.Tech TrafficA month after the tariff announcement, the Commerce Department forbade U.S. companies from selling components to ZTE for seven years. This crippled the Chinese telecom equipment maker, which depended on the U.S. for as much as 30 percent of its parts. Commerce punished ZTE for violating a previous agreement concerning sales to Iran and North Korea.Also in April, the Trump administration imposed 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese technology imports. This followed an investigation by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer's office that determined improper practices by the Chinese government, including cyber theft and forced technology transfer, were costing the U.S. economy $50 billion a year.China retaliated within days. Complaining about the aluminum, steel and technology sanctions, it slapped tariffs on U.S. exports including agricultural products such as soybeans, meat and fruit and on high-tech products such as Boeing aircraft.Hitting back, President Trump ordered the U.S. Trade Representative to consider tariffs on an additional $100 billion in Chinese imports.That's where the dispute stood when U.S. officials went to Beijing in May to begin negotiations. There, a feud within the Trump administration over trade policy erupted in public as Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and White House trade adviser Peter Navarro engaged in an expletive-punctuated confrontation.Freewheeling Free TradeMnuchin and National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow are freewheeling free traders. Navarro and Lighthizer are demanding fair trade that is international trade respecting trade regulations.Mnuchin is responsible for the weak-kneed joint statement on trade last week after talks in Washington, D.C. Because Navarro's name is not on the statement, it appears Mnuchin succeeded in excluding him from the meetings.The joint statement does not require China to reduce its $375 billion trade deficit with the United States by $200 billion, a figure U.S. negotiators demanded at the outset.In fact, experts say China's promise to import additional agricultural and energy products from the U.S. would not even get close to $200 billion, and that China was likely to increase these imports because it needs them, not because of any concession to the United States.The statement does not require China to reduce its overproduction and overcapacity in aluminum and steel. And it contains no specifics on China's forced technology transfer and cyber theft.Smoke and MirrorsMnuchin gave up the tariffs in exchange for smoke and mirrors. Maybe he was great on Wall Street. He certainly wasn't on Pennsylvania Avenue.It's not clear, though, where President Trump stands. Just before the negotiations last week, the president tweeted that he'd instructed the Commerce Department to ensure that the penalties imposed on ZTE, which employed 75,000, didn't kill the company."President Xi of China, and I, are working together to give massive Chinese phone company, ZTE, a way to get back into business, fast. Too many jobs in China lost," he wrote.The first concern of a U.S. president should be the millions of jobs Americans lost because of China's predatory trade practices. On the campaign trail, candidate Trump told workers he cared and that he alone could fix it.Mnuchin did not fix it. He made matters worse by relinquishing America's leverage in exchange for nothing.U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who is aligned with the tough-on-trade faction in the administration, is scheduled to go to Beijing next week.To fix this mess, he'll need Trump's unwavering support and a spine of steel.Posted by Leo GerardLoad-Date: May 25, 2018End of Document

The 'Tiananmen sanctions' should be strengthened, not liftedCNN.comJune 3, 2018 Sunday 10:47 PM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: OPINIONSLength: 817 wordsByline: Michael CasterBodyThe US-China trade war may be heating up, with US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross departing China Sunday with no clear end to negotiations.One of China's long term goals in any trade negotiations with the US has been the lifting of what remains of an embargo put in place following the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, which left hundreds, if not thousands, dead 29 years ago this week.Following the massacre Congress enacted the so-called "Tiananmen Sanctions" as part of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 1990 and 1991, suspending arm sales and export licenses to China for "crime control and detection instruments and equipment."The European Union passed similar restrictions on exporting arms, which China has also pushed to be lifted.While over the years some of these rules have been relaxed, under US law they are only to be fully lifted once China has, among other things, made progress in political reform, including ending reprisals for the nonviolent expression of political beliefs, and increasing respect for international human rights.This week, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reiterated previous calls for the Chinese government "to make a full public accounting of those killed, detained or missing; to release those who have been jailed for striving to keep the memory of Tiananmen Square alive; and to end the continued harassment of demonstration participants and their families."CrackdownNearly three decades after Tiananmen, repression in China is worse than ever.My friend Wang Quanzhang was detained more than 1,000 days ago and family and friends have not received word about his whereabouts and condition, amid a widespread crackdown on human rights defenders as China has systematized enforced disappearances and extralegal detentions.The government has also developed a vast system of digital surveillance that intrudes into people's daily lives, nowhere more so than in Xinjiang, in the country's far west.Public security spending in Xinjiang has risen eight times faster than the rest of China, according to Adrian Zenz, an expert on the region's securitization. Spending has gone to drones, advanced facial recognition cameras, and other digital surveillance systems that track the minutia of what Xinjiang's Uyghur population read, share in private messages, or who they speak with. Preemptive tools have also been developed using artificial intelligence and DNA to track and surveil people.In Xinjiang, China has perfected a technological police state, replete with Orwellian "political education centers," into which tens of thousands of Uyghurs have been detained. These techniques are already beginning to spread to other parts of the country.What China pioneers will likely be copied by other authoritarian governments; states who proclaim support for democracy and human rights must act to prevent their own companies profiting from the Chinese police state.Need to sanction complicityFar from weakening restrictions on China, from a human rights perspective, we should be moving to punish those companies who supply the tools of repression.At the China International Exhibition on Police Equipment in Beijing in May, foreign companies competed to demonstrate technologies at an event hosted by the Ministry of Public Security, including vehicles on a list of items banned by the US and EU under the "Tiananmen sanctions."Last year, companies from around the world met in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen for the 16th China Public Security Expo, one of the largest surveillance trade shows in the world.The San Diego-based Qualcomm was there to demonstrate new facial recognition tools, designed in partnership with the Chinese company SenseTime, and Seagate, also headquartered in California, premiered improved hard drive storage for surveillance footage, according to the Wall Street Journal.Allowing US or European companies to win contracts such as these which directly support Chinese police technologies should clearly constitute a violation of restrictions under the "Tiananmen sanctions" on granting export licenses for "crime control and detection instruments and equipment," which according to some interpretations of the EU sanctions includes anything "which might be used for internal repression."This is about more than merely blocking certain technology transfer to China.Even though most of China's surveillance state is built on homegrown technology, foreign companies must not be allowed to continue to trade in support of the perfection of repression. US or European companies which seek to profit from the Chinese police state are ultimately as complicit in its human rights violations as the perpetrators themselves.As we mark the 29th anniversary of the massacre, the "Tiananmen sanctions" should be strengthened to include greater punitive measures to penalize those who seek to profit from China's ongoing assault on human rights.Load-Date: June 5, 2018End of Document

Under New Deal, US Fines ZTE $1 Billion, Embeds Compliance TeamThe FrontrunnerJune 8, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 1147 wordsBodyUSA Today (6/7, Fritze, 11.4M) reports "the Trump administration stuck a deal Thursday with Chinese telecom ZTE to let the company do business in the US even though it previously violated sanctions against Iran." Under the deal's conditions, "ZTE will pay a $1 billion penalty and will embed a US-appointed compliance team, terms that are similar to those President Trump discussed last month when he revealed that Chinese leaders had asked him to look into the matter." Commerce Secretary Ross said in a statement, "We will closely monitor ZTE's behavior. ... If they commit any further violations, we would again be able to deny them access to US technology." The AP (6/7, Wiseman) notes "the fine announced Thursday comes on top of $892 million ZTE has already paid for breaking US sanctions by selling equipment to North Korea and Iran." The Commerce Department also "said that ZTE must also put $400 million in escrow - a sum that it would forfeit if it violated Thursday's agreement."The Washington Post (6/7, Lynch, Denyer, Long, 15.68M) reports that the deal "eases a seven-year ban on ZTE buying American parts, which Commerce levied in April." The Post notes that, "at the time, the Chinese government complained that the action could put the company, a major employer and star of the Chinese technology industry, out of business." Ross is quoted as saying, "We are literally embedding a compliance department of our choosing into the company to monitor it going forward. ... This is a pretty strict settlement. The strictest and largest settlement fine that has ever been brought by the Commerce Department against any violator of export controls." According to Bloomberg News (6/7, Leonard, 4.46M), "an agreement that allows the crippled company to reopen was seen as a key Chinese demand as the world's two largest economies try to avoid a trade war that could undermine global growth." However, the New York Times (6/7, Swanson, De La Merced, Subscription Publication, 19.33M) says "it is not clear what the United States received in return."Ross said on CNBC's Squawk Box (6/7, 128K) that the agreement "imposes the most strict compliance that we've ever had on any company, American or foreign. We are literally embedding a compliance department of our choosing into the company to monitor it going forward. They will pay for those people, but the people will report to the new chairman because we are also having them replace the entire management and the entire board." Ross added that "in addition to the billion dollars they're paying us right up front, we have them put $400 million in escrow. So the total deal is a billion 400 million. That money will be forfeited if they violate anything...and we still retain the power to shut them down again."The Hill (6/7, Thomsen, Lane, 2.71M) and Wall Street Journal (6/7, Davis, Strumpf, Wei, Subscription Publication, 6.13M), among other news outlets, also report on the deal. Reuters (6/7, Zengerle) notes, meanwhile, that Senate Republicans and Democrats introduced legislation today "that would roll back an agreement" the Commerce Department "announced to ease sanctions" on ZTE. The Senate legislation "would restore penalties on ZTE for violating export controls and bar US government agencies from purchasing or leasing equipment or services from ZTE or Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, another major Chinese firm."Sen. Mark Warner, ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on CNN's Situation Room (6/7, 723K), "This is a horrible deal for our country's national security and don't take my word for it .Take the word of Trump's CIA Director. Take the word of Trump's Director of National Intelligence. Take the word of the fact of the Pentagon which has in effect banned ZTE equipment. Take the word of all the folks that say this is comprised equipment." Warner added, "I was pleased when the President first put these strict requirements on ZTE and said we were going to stop purchasing this kind of equipment. What concerned me was he immediately buckled once the Chinese pushed back."Sen. Chris Van Hollen said on CNBC's Closing Bell (6/7, 139K) that he and Sen. Tom Cotton have "filed a bipartisan amendment to really hold ZTE accountable. You know, Wilbur Ross did the right thing back in April when he found ZTE repeatedly and flagrantly violated US law and he put really strong penalties on them, and then, of course, the President tweeted he wanted to help ZTE, wanted to help jobs in China, and they essentially reversed course. What happened today amounts to a slap in the wrist. I can tell you there is strong bipartisan opposition to letting them off the hook."US Embassy In Beijing Sends New Alert For Mystery Health Issue.The AP (6/8, Chan, Kang) reports the US Embassy in Beijing "sent its second alert in two weeks Friday to its citizens over unexplained health issues that have prompted the evacuation of a number of US government employees working" at the US Consulate in Guangzhou. The alert urged Americans to seek medical help in the event they suffered any "unusual, unexplained physical symptoms or events, auditory or sensory phenomena, or other health concerns." NBC Nightly News (6/7, story 5, 0:25, Holt, 8.26M) reported Thursday night on "the mystery that triggered the evacuation of several American diplomats and their families from China. The State Department confirming employees at the US Consulate there suffered unexplained health problems, similar to the concussion-like symptoms American Embassy staffers in Cuba reported last year. US officials are investigating both China and Cuba have denied any role." ABC World News Tonight (6/7, story 6, 0:25, Muir, 14.63M) reported, "A number of American Consulate workers and their family members returning to the states after complaining of strange noises, headaches and other symptoms. Those complaints similar to those to the US Embassy in Cuba that effected dozens. All of those cases still remain unexplained tonight."Fox News' Special Report (6/7, 2.15M) said China "is promising to help give to the bottom of another round of illnesses affecting American diplomats." The New York Times (6/7, Perlez, Myers, Subscription Publication, 19.33M) reports the Chinese Foreign Ministry "said that the government had already carried out an investigation in May after the first case of an American diplomat becoming sick in the city of Guangzhou was reported in April," but "had not been able to determine the source of the diplomat's illness." Spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Thursday, "If the US comes to us regarding this case again, we will investigate it seriously and keep close cooperation with the US." The Washington Post (6/7, Denyer, Morello, 15.68M) reports Hua said the Ministry "had not yet been formally informed by the US government about the new cases, having only heard about them through media reports."Load-Date: June 8, 2018End of Document

5 things for May 30: Roseanne, South China Sea, ex-USC gynecologistCNN.comMay 27, 2018 Sunday 6:23 AM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: USLength: 974 wordsByline: By AJ Willingham, CNNBodySo, how did anti-biasÂ training sessions at StarbucksÂ work out? Here's a recap, plus everythingÂ else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. (You can also get "5 Things You Need to Know Today" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.)1. RoseanneWelp, there goes that. If "Reboot of nostalgic TV show canceled after beloved star of yesteryear is racist on Twitter" isn't a 2018 headline, we don't know what is. The oft-discussed ABC show was axed Tuesday after Roseanne Barr tweeted an insult to a former Obama aide,Â referring to her as a product ofÂ theÂ "Muslim brotherhood" and "Planet of the Apes." Barr also targeted Chelsea Clinton, falsely saying Clinton was married to a nephew of George Soros, whom she called a Nazi in another tweet. Within hours, the networkÂ canceled the show, and theÂ president of ABC Entertainment released a statement calling the ape tweet "abhorrent." Entertainers and figures from around the TV world supported the network's decision to cancel the show. Despite its high ratings, the reboot has been a source of controversy since the first episode because of its pro-Trump angle and the volatile musings of its star.2. South China SeaTensions over the disputed South China Sea have heated up in recent weeks.Â The Chinese government, which claims much of the region as its sovereign territory, has established a significant military presence there, but other countries such as the United States say the strategically important and resource-rich area is in international waters. On Tuesday,Â US Defense Secretary James Mattis said the United States will continue "a steady drumbeat" of naval exercises to challenge China's increased militarization of the area.Â Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte also has strong feelings about the South China Sea: He says if ChinaÂ unilaterally mines the region's rich natural resources, which include oil and natural gas reserves, the Philippines is prepared to go to war.Â 3. Ex-USC gynecologistFifty-two former patients of a gynecologist who treated thousands of women at the University of Southern California have reported they may have been victims of inappropriate and possibly criminal behavior. Police estimate Dr. George Tyndall may have seen 10,000 patients during his nearly 30 years of work there, and they suspect there could be more alleged victims among these women.Â Tyndall was fired in 2017 for inappropriate behavior, USC says. The scandal is already leaving a mark on theÂ campus:Â Last week, universityÂ President C.L. Max NikiasÂ agreed to step downÂ after current and former students signed an online petition demanding his resignation. CNN has been unable to reach Tyndall for comment. But he has told the Los Angeles Times, "I have never had any sexual urges" toward patients. He also described his examinations as thorough and appropriate.4. ImmigrationThere has been a lot of rhetoric and misinformation about immigration issuesÂ recently. You know those 1,500 children the government reportedly "lost" or said are "missing"? They're probably not lost or missing. The viral photo of children in a detention center that's been shared by both liberals and conservatives alike? It's from 2014, but it likely doesn't show children who were ripped from their families at the border. The White House has been sharing misinformation, too.Â White House adviser Stephen Miller saidÂ TuesdayÂ that Democrats are to blame for the "crisis" at the borderÂ and for defending "loopholes" that migrants exploit. In reality, there is no "crisis" at the border in terms of number of crossings. The "loopholes" Miller seems to refer to are in fact long-held asylum protocols, and there have been several Republican factions that have rejected some of the administration's more hard-lineÂ immigration proposals.Â 5. Puerto RicoA shocking new figure is raising questions about the realÂ toll of last year's Hurricane Maria. According to a report in a prestigious medical journal, an estimated 4,645 people died in Maria and its aftermath in Puerto Rico. That figure dwarfs Puerto Rico's official death toll of 64, which the article's authors called a "substantial underestimate." The death toll has long been a source of argument, but before this study, it was assumedÂ Maria contributed to about 1,000 deaths. The exact death toll will probably be hard to pin downÂ since unsafe conditions in the US territory have persisted for so longÂ after the storm.Â TODAY'S QUOTE"Pornography. It's available. It's available on the shelf when you walk in the grocery store. Yeah, you have to reach up to get it, but there's pornography there."US Rep. Diane Black, R-Tennessee, who points to pornography, along with violent movies and the deterioration of families, as contributing to gun violence in schools.BREAKFAST BROWSEPeople are talking about these.

Rep. Ryan Issues Statement on Trump Administration, ZTE AgreementTargeted News ServiceJune 7, 2018 Thursday 7:51 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 543 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyRep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, issued the following statement on the Trump administration's agreement with Chinese telecom company ZTE:"Days after President Trump took a sledgehammer to our relationships with Canada and Europe by imposing harmful tariffs -- jeopardizing alliances that helped us win the Cold War - his Administration has formally announced its golden parachute for Chinese telecom giant ZTE. This is a company that repeatedly violated sanctions against Iran and North Korea, and with which the NSA, FBI, and CIA all have cyber security concerns."The Pentagon even stopped selling its phones on military bases. Nevertheless, they continue to get VIP treatment from President Trump and his inner-circle while communities like Youngstown and Akron suffer because of the President's own actions. President Xi and the Chinese government are celebrating, while President Trump got rolled. There's no other way of putting it. China has a long-term economic plan, a 20-year plan, a 30-year plan, a 50-year plan, 100-year plan."We're operating in a 24-hour news cycle. We should be facilitating a massive reinvestment into communities across the U.S. that have been left behind by rapid globalization, and by abusive and illegal Chinese trade practices. Instead, it's Trump first, China second, America last."Earlier this week, Congressman Ryan joined with Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Congressman Mike Conaway (R-TX) to introduce the Fair Trade With China Enforcement Act. This legislation would take sweeping steps to safeguard American economic and national security interests against abusive Chinese trade practices by specifically safeguarding American assets from Chinese influence and possession.Specifically, the Fair Trade with China Enforcement Act would:- Prohibit the sale of national security sensitive technology and intellectual property to China.- Increase taxes on multinational corporations' income earned in China at a rate similar to the lost value of stolen IP and technology.- Cancel an income tax treaty signed in the 1980s and tax China on their "investment" in the U.S., including their holdings of the national debt.- Prepare duties on, and impose Chinese investor shareholding caps on U.S. companies producing, goods targeted by the Made in China 2025 plan.- Prohibit the federal government, or subsidiaries/contractors, from purchasing telecommunications equipment or services from Huawei and ZTE.Congressman Tim Ryan has been fighting illegal and unfair Chinese trade practices for his entire Congressional career. He has been leading the fight to reform trade deals so that U.S. workers are not at a disadvantage. This includes leading the charge to hold China accountable for currency manipulation. The Currency Reform For Fair Trade Act, which was introduced alongside Representatives Sander Levin (D-MI) and Bill Pascrell (D-NJ) in April of last year, takes aim at currency manipulators by enabling the Department of Commerce to impose countervailing duties to offset the impact of currency manipulation on a U.S. industry.An earlier version of this legislation which was introduced in 2010 passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 348-79 on September 29, 2010.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6322881 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: June 8, 2018End of Document

Good Monday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. Happy Monday on a snowy Monday in New York. It is Monday, April 2nd. Y our top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast. China is striking back this morning. Beijing imposing new tariffs on 128 U.S. goods following the White House's move to implement strict sanctions against the country.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Mexico has got to help us at the border. They flow right through Mexico, they set into the United States. Can't happen that way anymore.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Betrayed concerns come as stocks kick off the first trading day of both April and the 2nd quarter today. Markets are at the los right now. Dow Industrials expected to be down better than 100 points. NASDAQ expected to be out about 55 points. It comes after a rough month for stocks. The major indices all fell roughly three percent in the month of March. Markets in Europe this morning closed for a holiday even a lot of holidays in Asia, the Asian markets were down fraction, although Hong Kong was closed as I mentioned for a holiday there.A race against time in California meanwhile. Authorities are searching a draining ditch in Los Angeles this morning after a 13-year-old boy reportedly fell into it. The very latest on the rescue efforts coming up. Then retail hacks. Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor warning customers they are hit by a massive data breach. What you need to know as millions of people -- users are now exposed. Tesla hitting the gas. The automaker ramps up Model 3 production but Elon Musk plays an April Fool's Day joke on investors. Stock is down again.And have it your way. Burger King tricks customers on April Fools' Day. The whopper of the joke coming out. All those stories coming up this morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Networks Dagen McDowell, former Utah Congressman and former House Oversight Committee Chairman plus Fox News Contributor Jason Chaffetz is here. And the President of Maslansly and Partners, pollster, Lee Carter. Great to see.LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS: Great to be here.BARTIROMO: Happy Monday, everybody.JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: There's no chocolate on those whoppers. I like my whoppers, but chocolate, hold the chocolate.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST: Pleasure here to translate the idiocy that we witnessed down in Washington into plain English because we don't understand it. We don't --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: -- the $1.3 trillion spending bill?MCDOWELL: Yes. And the fact that I still can't get past on the amount of money that was being spent, just billions of dollars for anything and everything but the fact that there were no strings attached to the funding sanctuary cities -- sanctuary states even.BARTIROMO: Did they -- did they not read it, Jason?CHAFFETZ: That's impossible. I mean, it was more than 2000 pages, less than 48 hours. You can't tell me that they actually went through in detail with a fine tooth comb. And remember, the House passed a very conservative package months ago but the Senate never went through the process.MCDOWELL: $41 billion for an infrastructure, $4 billion for opioid treatment. And again, people always -- they get hoodwinked by the -- but you have to do something about the opioid epidemic. Well, we allocated a billion dollars a year or two ago. We don't -- we can't -- we don't have any path towards the efficacy of that spending. We don't know how well it was spent, whether it really did anything to reduce. You know what it reduces that? The dropping of opioid prescriptions being written in this country. That's a big step and that's just from enforcement.BARTIROMO: And then there's the money for the wall which is nonexistent. I mean, I like the way you put it earlier, $47-trillion budget and they couldn't allocate 25 billion that the President is asking for for the wall.CHAFFETZ: I think about the authorization is there to actually build the wall. They needed the funding but the funding precluded the ability of the President to allocate that to fully fund this wall.CARTER: Why wouldn't they do that? I mean, do they just want to do immigration sleeping in a separate bill? And have -- why wouldn't they --CHAFFETZ: Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi have got to be dancing because they fell down when they tried to close the government the first time then this spending bill comes up, they hold the line and that Republicans forget that they have the House and Senate, the presidency.CARTER: That's right.(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: And I was just going to say a caravan of a thousand people coming through Mexico trying to enter the U.S. illegally from Honduras.BARTIROMO: Yes. And the President wants help with -- from Mexico in order to stop that. We're going to get to all of this coming up. But first, I want to show you this. Investors are watching the growing trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Beijing's retaliatory tariffs on 128 U.S. products going to effect today. That's all President Trumps hike on steel and aluminum imports and the plans in place to come up with new restrictions on trade and investment in the U.S. from China. Fox News White House Correspondent Kevin Corke is live at the White House this morning with the latest on the President's trade agenda. Kevin, good morning to you.KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria. China did promise a response, right? And it is finally here. It's a tariff tit-for-tat that is likely to royal the market on this first Monday in the month of April. Let me take you inside the numbers, the numbers actually not a real surprise for some if you sort of studied as we go along. 15 percent increase on fruit, nuts, even wine production. Tariff 25 percent on pork. How about a 25 percent tariff on recycled aluminum. Ouch. Now, for context, the U.S. shipped more than a billion dollars in pork products to China last year making it the number three destination for experts after Japan and Mexico. Also keep this in mind, the U.S. was China's top supplier of apples and cherries and walnuts as well.Now, there is a statement that we're going to read to you, this is from obviously China. We hope the U.S. will rescind its measures that violate World Trade Organization rules as quickly as possible. China and the U.S. are the world's two biggest economies and cooperation is the only correct choice. It concludes by saying both sides should use dialogue and consultation to resolve their mutual concerns. Now, as you can well imagine, White House officials insist what the U.S. is really doing is looking for reciprocal trade, period. But that is trade that will come apparently at a higher price that could affect by the way, Maria, farmers, winegrowers, and others. By the way, the President also meets with his chief economic advisers later today around 2:00 this afternoon, Larry Kudlow stopping by for us all. Have a read up for you but until then back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Kevin. Thank you so much. We will check back as news develops there on Kudlow. Joining us now, a member of the House Homeland Security, Financial Services and Intelligence Committee, he's Congressman Peter King of New York. Congressman, Happy Easter. Great to see you, sir. Thanks for joining us.REP. PETER KING (R), NEW YORK: Great to see you. And I'm still celebrating Notre Dame's victory last night. I'm telling Jason, still trying to see where BYU is in all of this.CHAFFETZ: Oh, Peter.BARTIROMO: He's on Michigan for tonight. He's --(CROSSTALK)CHAFFETZ: This is beautiful Monday morning if you're going there. Oh my goodness. All right. All right. I get to ask a question. We'll get to that.BARTIROMO: OK. OK. What you think about these tariffs, Congressman?KING: Officially I, you know, don't believe in a trade war and tariffs and protectionism. I do believe when though it comes to China that it's important for the President to take action and to me this goes beyond the economy, I think this also involves North Korea, this also involves the fact that China has not been a supportive of the President thought he would be. As far as (INAUDIBLE) North Korea and also it's is a shot against China's expansion in the south pacific. The artificial islands come expansion of the Navy, et cetera. So I think it's -- again, I can't foresee all the consequences, but I understand why the President did it. I think it's on the tariff increases, really, I'm opposed to it when it comes to China. I think the President has a legitimate point to make.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, I feel like the retaliation of $3 billion is not commensurate with what the U.S. is doing. We're waiting on the list from the Treasury in terms of exactly the products from China that will be taxed. But it almost feels China has to do something but it's really not that big of a -- of a tariff at $3 billion.KING: You know, it probably still too early to -- it's probably still too early to tell. I think it could be a sign that the President's policies in Asia. One I believe they're getting North Korea to the table, the way we are, the fact that South Korea is going to be involved and now the fact that China is not over retaliating against us, to me today is a good sign but again it's early in the game and so far I think the President deserves credit for what's happening in Asia.BARTIROMO: Jason.CHAFFETZ: It's Jason Chaffetz here again. The President this morning is tweeting about DACA saying DACA is dead, I think there's frustration that there isn't money allocated in the budget in the appropriations bill to build the wall and didn't deal with sanctuary cities. How does Congress -- how did -- how did they justify what's going on here?BARTIROMO: Congressman, did you sign the bill?KING: I did, and voted for it and I would vote for it again. Let me tell you honestly. You know, I agree with what the President, but the President was involved in this deal from beginning to end. I spoke to the President last week, he wanted us to go along with it. His people in the room, everything that was negotiated was negotiated with White House's approval. The President felt, the Congress felt, it was important to get funding for the military it was -- to me was very important to get the funding restored for Homeland Security which Mick Mulvaney has knocked out. That was violently essential. Also from the New York, New Jersey perspective, the gateway tunnel is absolutely essential. Might just from New York to New Jersey but the entire northeastern seaboard. I think again, I would support -- I wish restrictions of sanctuary cities. I also certainly believe the wall would -- should be built, it was bill back in 2006, you know, that passed originally to have the wall in there. But again, to fund the military, to do what had to be done and now I think in many ways, the deck is cleared, we can deal directly with DACA and the wall without having to worry about a government shutdown between now and October.BARTIROMO: Well, here's what he said yesterday. Listen to this. Here's the President on that issue.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Will has got to help us at the border. If they're not going to help us at the border, it's a very sad thing between two countries. Mexico has got to help us at the border. And a lot of people are coming in because they want to take advantage of DACA. And we're going to have to really see that a great chance the Democrats blew it.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARTER: Congressman, I have a question for you because I've seen that the polling after the bill has been signed, Independents actually support this. They want Congress to get things done. They want the President deciding and say move things forward. So now what's the plan? You're saying that now the deck is cleared, you can get DACA, you can -- and negotiations done. Who's going to take a lead on this and what do we expect?KING: I think -- I think the President has to take the lead and he instigated with Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer and do everything possible to get it done. But wall is essential and not just as far as the immigration issue but as far as, you know, the transnational markup games. I mean, this is such few from Central and South America coming across the border. Yet, people all over the world were using this as an entryway to the U.S. as far as opioids for instance, you know, opioid crisis. So I think we have to again make it clear, make this the issue, make this an issue between now and the Election Day and that's one way to get it done. I support the wall. I do believe that we have to make adjustments on DACA. I think the President's proposal several months ago was extremely really generous and equitable but again, there's no reason why this deal can't be done. But Chuck Schumer and Donald Trump in the same room and they have to make this deal.BARTIROMO: Hmm. Now, right now Chuck Schumer is a happy man in terms of what this deal looks like for his side. Congressman, I know combating him as 13 on Long Island has been a big issue for you. What is the status check?KING: Actually, tremendous results on that. The war is far from over, but there's been hundreds and hundreds of arrests. The President has sent more assistant U.S. attorneys, there's been large went to the Suffolk County Police Department that has done a phenomenal job on this. There's more ICE agents, there were more raids being carried out and we're getting more cooperations for the community. Ever since the Attorney General and the President actually came in, it really reach the belly of the beast, essential ICE from Brentwood last summer, this was extraordinary progress made. But this has -- again a fight that has to be continued. These are brutal vicious murderers like within blocks to my house they're digging for bodies. These are people who have been dismembered in counter pieces by M.S.-13, the horrible, evil human beings.BARTIROMO: That is horrible. Speaking of the A.G., what did you think about Jeff Sessions saying his naming a prosecutor to investigate the allegations of wrongdoing at the top of the FBI and the Justice Department. Not a special counsel.KING: Yes. I support the special counsel but I do think this is a significant step in the right direction. I would have gone all the way to special counsel. But having said that, I think Horowitz as Inspector General does an excellent job. I don't know, I assume Jason does from the Utah. I think he's going to -- all I hear, he's totally honest, he's totally a nonpartisan and probably this is the, you know, the most precise way to get it done in that you have an inspector general, you have an outside attorney, somebody from outside of Washington looking into all the facts and details and then determining whether or not a special counsel is warranted. I would've gone right to the special counsel. But I think this is going in the right direction. I wouldn't write it off at all. And I think just as what we've done here, if any case it didn't require a special counsel is this one. Not the one what Bob Mueller was appointed because in the Mueller situation there was absolutely no evidence at all that a crime was ever committed by President Trump or his campaign. And yes, a special counsel is appointed. In this case, there is significant evidence that there has been criminality and that's why I think a special counsel --BARTIROMO: That's absolutely right.(CROSSTALK)KING: But again, this a good first step.BARTIROMO: And Huber, you like Huber from Utah?CHAFFETZ: Yes. John Huber, he's -- Huber, he's a -- he's a good man. Peter King is absolutely right. He's one of the best members of Congress as far as I'm concerned in any spot on and exactly right at this investigation.BARTIROMO: Well, 27 people produced 3000 documents over a year. Now, what is he -- what is raising it for 54 people, are they going to produce 6000? I mean --CHAFFETZ: They have 110,000 people at their disposal. So, you know --BARTIROMO: Make it a priority, FBI. That's the bottom line. Congressman, good to see you, sir. Thank you. Peter King. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well, an intense search is underway this morning for a teenager who fell into a drainage pipe. Cheryl Casone with the details now. Cheryl?CHERYL CASONE, FBN HOST: Oh, Maria, authorities in California's still this morning are searching for a 13-year-old boy who fell into a drainage pipe at a park. Investigators say Jesse Hernandez was playing in the area with some other kids when he fell to the roof of a 20-foot concrete building into the drainage sewage system below. More than 100 members of the Los Angeles Fire Department and other agencies are working in this search to try and find him.Well, the Justice Department is reportedly looking into Live Nation's business practices. The New York Times is reporting that Live National is accused of using its control over concert tours to pressure those venues into contract with their subsidiary Ticketmaster. Ticketmaster's President responding saying "it is absolutely against Live Nation and Ticketmaster policy to threaten venues that they won't get any Live Nation shows if they don't use Ticketmaster. We should say that shares of Live Nation are about 40 percent from one year ago.OK. April Fools' Day brought a fresh round of fake products. Burger King's chocolate walker, one of the highlights, the fake burger had a flame-grilled chocolate patty, raspberry sauce, white chocolate rings and vanilla frosting. Actually looks kind of good. They said the chocolate wafer is coming soon maybe. So no, it's never coming. Burger King wasn't the only one, beauty service Glamsquad announced they were going to have a partnership with the Wag! App (INAUDIBLE) walk your dog. They tweeted out that dog owners can now share the same hairstyle as their pet. But you can't. Well, guess you could.And then SodaStream even advertise SodaSoak, it's a new product that carbonates your bathwater. That's not really there. OK. Finally, check this out. Leslie Edwards, a Tuskegee airman, 93 years young busting a move on the dance floor in Ohio.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LESLIE EDWARDS, TUSKEGEE AIRMAN: I'm a Tusk man and I'm on my last flight. I said I'd like to make a good landing. I said, can you help make a good landing me with some kind of dance?(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Edwards' dance teachers so impressed with his drive. She made up some special just for him. She says, nothing slows him down and she wants to be just like him when she decides to grow up. And those are your headlines.BARTIROMO: That was great.CASONE: Pretty good, right?BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Cheryl. Coming up. Nearly 50 Democrats including Debbie Wasserman Schultz reportedly waved background checks for I.T. worker Iman Awan and his family members. Details on the shocking report and questions why. Then Amazon shares down in the free market this morning after President Trump slammed the company over the weekend over at the cost of shipping. We break down the impact and the fight later this hour. Plus, we're taking a break. As we take that break, take a live look at the White House this morning before the annual Easter egg roll over 30,000 are expected to be attend this year. And it's snowing the way it is in New York and Washington. So, it looks like the Easter egg roll goes on. We'll take you there. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Another major data breach to tell you about this time hitting Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor. Kristina Partsinevelos is the newest member of our Fox Business News family, She's covering this story. Welcome aboard.KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Thank you.(CROSSTALK)PARTSINEVELOS: Yes, yes. I'm very excited. I'm very excited.BARTIROMO: This is day one.(CROSSTALK)PARTSINEVELOS: Yes. This is my first minute on-air right now. And so I mean as well get ready into another data breach hitting retailers, Lord & Taylor as well as well as Saks Fifth Avenue having knowledge they've been compromised. Hudson's Bay Company which is the parent of those two department stores announced yesterday evening around 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time that yes, they were hit by a cybersecurity data breach. They said that it affected all Lord & Taylor outlets as well as about 83 Saks Fifth Avenue stores and a few Canadian stores too because the parent company is Canadian. How does something like this happen?According to cybersecurity from Gemini, they said that employees received an e-mail. So these are employees that are on the floor dealing with customers. They received an e-mail, click on the link that they thought was trustworthy and then immediately that type of software was downloaded every single time a customer swipe their card, that information was stolen. According to Gemini, about five million credit cards were stolen and several of them are already starting to put on the black web or dark web. What we're seeing though at Hudson's Bay is this is coming in a very difficult time for the company. There's been reports over the last year that the company was looking to go private, you had the CEO that stepped down just this past October and most recently, we know real estate is so important for a lot of these retailers. They did sell their Lord & Taylor flagship store in Manhattan. And the company has been -- the stock prices actually have been a little weaker as of late.Just this past march, just a few days ago they release their earnings, fell short of analyst expectations which is why we've seen it kind of a trail. We'll bring that hot graph up in just a moment. We're seeing a trail just a little bit lower and reason being is that they did turn a profit but if anything it felt short of analyst expectations or seeing across the board (INAUDIBLE) CIBC, all of these guys downgrading the stock and so now a data breach to hit them. And according to Gemini, the consulting firm, they're saying that Russians are behind this attack. A very well-known Russian hacking group called (INAUDIBLE) and so they've already started to release some of these credit card numbers online. Not all of them. So, getting five million cards compromised from May 2017 all the way until just this past March. So at least companies are getting quicker in terms of telling us since this just happened.MCDOWELL: Are they going to sending I get literally discount alerts or sale alert from Saks multiple times a day. Are they going to send their customer saying your credit card information has been compromised , will people be getting an e-mail?PARTSINEVELOS: I reached out to them this morning but they did say that they -- for other media outlets that they would be notifying customers. You can go on their website. They said that should you be hit by this attack, you're not going to be responsible for the fraudulent charges, but the problem is a lot of people, the type of customers that go to these stores spend a little bit of money. They spend on electronics, on designer shoes and so they may not notice these charges. And so it's just a matter of keeping track because this has been going on for the past year.BARTIROMO: Wow. Yes. People need to keep track of it because you could be getting rob and not even know it.PARTSINEVELOS: Exactly.BARTIROMO: So that was another data breach. Kristina, welcome to the Fox Business family.KING: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Tell us about yourself. We know that you love to travel, we understand.PARTSINEVELOS: Yes, yes. I just flew literally from the U.K. straight to here. So I came here about a week and just a week and half ago. What you're seeing right now, that's Cyprus, I was there, just last year. That's at Oxford at Keble College. So I did -- I was living in the U.K., doing my MBA at Oxford University, it was about a year program, that's Iceland that you're seeing diamond --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Oh, wow. Look at Iceland.PARTSINEVELOS: Oh, yes. It's beautiful.BARTIROMO: You really did some great travel.PARTSINEVELOS: I highly, highly recommend going there before it gets overrun with tourists. And that's a camper van that we used to drive around because you got to do it, you got to do the -- I'm Canadian, so you got to do with the Canadian way of just going in the snow and living amongst nature.(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: Have you ever driven -- have you ever driven across the U.S. on a camper van?PARTSINEVELOS: No. But I definitely--MCDOWELL: OK.(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: That's your challenge because I've done that.PARTSINEVELOS: It's fun. I should do it.MCDOWELL: When I was much younger. It's -- I mean, North America is beautiful.PARTSINEVELOS: Of course, of course. And driving across the U.S., like I'm excited to try out the different food spots, like I know I have a lot to choose. Honestly that would dictate wherever I go --(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: I've got a list of 200 places in the south.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Cool stuff. Great. Kristina, welcome.PARTSINEVELOS: Thank you very much.BARTIROMO: Great to see you.PARTSINEVELOS: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Kristina Partsinevelos, we are happy you're on the team.PARTSINEVELOS: Thank you.BARTIROMO: We will take a break. When we come back, I'll speak with White House Principal Deputy and Press Secretary Raj Shah, he's going to weigh in on a lot in particular, China's reaction to President Trump's tariffs, the future DACA and a lot more. Then, mounting pressure for Tesla. The automaker's crunch to boost Model 3 amid rising concerns from investors. Liquidity issues. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.

Here's what Congressman Peter King said earlier this hour.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. PETER KING (R), NEW YORK: I think the President should take the lead and, (INAUDIBLE) Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, and Chuck Schumer and do everything possible to get it done. Look, the wall is essential, there's no reason why this deal can't be done. With Chuck Schumer and Donald Trump in the same room and they have to make this deal.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: We are taking a closer look this morning coming up. Background check exemptions, details on the shocking new reports this morning that dozens of congressional democrats hired IT workers without subjecting them to background checks. Why so much protection around Imran Awan?President Trump raising the stakes in his battle against Amazon, he went after Amazon this weekend and its deal with the U.S. Postal Service again.Meanwhile this, no laughing matter, why investors are not happy with Elon Musk's April Fool's Day joke, joking about bankruptcy as the stock continues to trade down.Celebrating Easter, President Trump and the first lady, Melania Trump welcoming thousands to the White House this morning for the annual Easter Egg Roll. We're going to take you there live later this hour.But first, let's turn to our top story this half an hour and that is markets pulling back amid escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Beijing is retaliating against President Trump's hike on steel and aluminum imports and brand new tariffs on 128 products from China -- the -- China is retaliating on 128 U.S. products. Starting today, China will raise its import duties by 15 to 25 percent on American pork, fruit, wine, aluminum, and other commodities.Joining me right now is White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah. Raj, good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.RAJ SHAH, WHITE HOUSE PRINCIPAL DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY: Good morning Maria, thanks for having me on.BARTIROMO: And we should point out that the Treasury is coming up with its list of specifically what goods will be facing tariffs from China. And they're also coming up with lists of restrictions that China is going to face when investing in America. When should we expect that list?SHAH: Well the Treasury will provide the details regarding that list butt with respect to China, look, the President wants free, fair, and reciprocal trade with China but that hasn't been the U.S.-China trade relationship for the past several decades.So he took action under 232 to defend our aluminum and steel industries which are essential to national security and he's taken action under 301 to defend U.S. intellectual property. So the United States is going to defend our interest, going to defend American workers and businesses.If the Chinese government uses that as a pretext for further unfair trade practices, we think that that's very unfortunate but the President's going to continue to work with China, with President Xi to ensure that we have a free, fair, and reciprocal trade arrangement with the Chinese and we're lowering our trade deficit.BARTIROMO: You know, I think it's really interesting that China is not only stealing our intellectual property and putting all these restrictions on foreigners investing in China but they're also investing in infrastructure around the world to get key spots on the sea line and then creating and building military bases at those places. So, do we have a sense of what China is trying to do with all of these new military bases that they're building?SHAH: Well, I want to -- I don't know exactly what China is up to with respect to its foreign policy both with respect to building military bases within China proper and its engagements around the world.But the United States is rebuilding our military. We have secured $700 billion in the recent Omnibus Bill to help rebuild our ships, to rebuild our military basis, to help increase troop pay, and ensure that the United States has the strongest and most powerful fighting force, continues to add powerful fighting force in the world to pursue our interest around the world.BARTIROMO: Yes.SHAH: But we really don't need to be engaged in that kind of talk when it comes to China because then the President has a great relationship with President Xi, Secretary MNuchin, other members of the administration have been talking to our counterparts.They have expressed a willingness to work with the United States and reduce our trade deficit which is something we really want to do. It stands at several hundred billion dollars, they've talked about $100 billion reduction, we want to see more, we want that trade deficit to be zeroed out because when the United States can compete at a level playing field, American workers and businesses can compete with anybody around the world including those in China.BARTIROMO: Yes, I know. I totally understand and I think everybody gets that about China but I'm glad you brought up the Omnibus because there's a lot of upset over this spending bill, Raj, you know it.The President actually considered not signing it. We understand the need for military money and the need to pump up the defense, our defenses after they got pummeled by sequestration. But did you have to agree to so much else? In a $47 trillion budget, they could not come up with $25 billion to build the wall, no mention of sanctuary cities, money spent on planned parenthood, how do you explain all of this?SHAH: Well, it is an imperfect deal. The President said as much when he signed it. The bill contains too much domestic spending, we think that Chuck Schumer and the democrats should not have held the military, should not have held our border security and border patrol hostage to domestic spending.BARTIROMO: But they did and the President signed it. So definitely -- Ann Coulter called Schumer, President Schumer this weekend. He got the upper hand on that, didn't he?SHAH: That's right. I don't -- I wouldn't agree with that. I think that $700 billion to rebuild our military is essential. The United States must protect our national security even if Chuck Schumer doesn't care about that.We need to rebuild our military, we needed the $700 billion to increase troop pay, to rebuild our weapon systems, and other things that are essential. This is what Secretary Mattis, what the President's generals or the national security team have said are essential to preserving the United States national security that are preeminent in terms of the military around the world.But, yes, it did come at a cost, one that we didn't like with respect to domestic spending. But the President, his solemn and most important duty is to protect the national security and the safety of the safety of the American people and he did just that in signing that bill.BARTIROMO: All right. So when do deficits become a priority? When does out of control spending make it to the priority list for the President Raj? Let me ask you that way because now we know given all of this spending, we're looking at $1 trillion deficits from here on out and we know that the money being spent in terms of deficits is really not about domestic spending but about the entitlement. So is the President considering making any changes to things like the Social Security program or Medicaid?SHAH: Well he has introduced both in his budget and then the healthcare bill that was back in 2017. As series of reforms to Medicaid that cuts spending by several hundred billion dollars, block granted the program to states and allow them to make more spending decisions on how to best care for indigent individuals in their own states.BARTIROMO: Yes. But you got a big thumbs down on that from John McCain you know.SHAH: That's right. And -- but look, the President's actually been talking about reforms in Congress to help us pass our agenda like ending the filibuster. President wants to see the filibuster and he wants to see not a handful of democrats, maybe 10 democrats hold up all action in the United States Senate.That's a big problem that we continue to see thwarting this President's agenda, he wants to see it end. So, we're going to continue working with Congress to get this President's agenda passed. We are frustrated with some of the domestic spending that had to be a part of the Omnibus. The President's going to continue to work, continue to push for both rebuilding a military but also obtaining deficits.BARTIROMO: So what's the story on DACA then? The President is talking about it this morning, he says DACA is dead, that's what he said in the tweet. He says, "DACA is dead because the Democrats did not care or act and now everyone wants to get onto the DACA bandwagon. That no longer works. Must build Wall, secure our borders with proper Border legislation. Democrats want No Borders, hence drugs and crime." So Raj, is there a change in the President's immigration policy now to report?SHAH: No. The President's position is still the same but he's reflecting reality which is the democrats aren't serious about a deal on DACA. They aren't serious about border security, they have rejected deal after deal after deal.Generous offers made by this President and now we need to see real border security on the southern border. Right now, you have a caravan of over a thousand individuals going through Mexico with the assumption that they're going to come to the United States and then seek asylum. We need the Mexican government to do more but also there are legal loopholes in the United States from catch and release, and other policies that the democrats aren't willing to work with this administration and republicans and Congress to fix.So we need more border security, we need to close the legal loopholes and the President actually is being compassionate, wants to deal with the DACA population humanely, wants a legal program in place that gives them a permanent solution. And so, the President has shown leadership but it takes two to tango and democrats have been totally unwilling to work with this on this issue. They've just been at -- on the sidelines playing politics from day one.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, we'll see what that means come to midterm elections and whether or not the American people hold them to account since now it seems they don't want DACA done, they just want to make it a campaign issue.Is the President now attaching the Mexico doing more to stop the flow of illegals into the U.S. to NAFTA? He's threatening NAFTA tweeting this, "Mexico is doing very little, if not nothing at stopping people from flowing into Mexico through their Southern Border, and then into the United States. They laugh at our dumb immigration laws. They must stop the big drug and people flows, or I will stop their cash cow. NAFTA need wall." So he's attaching the two now.SHAH: Yes. Look, the President is talking about our relationship with Mexico. We want the Mexican government to do more, we want them to do more with respect to people who come across the Southern Mexico -- Mexican border and plan to come to the United States.Remember, Mexico actually deports hundreds of thousands of individuals that come across their southern border. They don't have the kind of legal loopholes that the United States has to deal with that democrats don't want to close. We want the Mexican government to do more to stop individuals that are coming across their southern border with the intent of coming across our southern border and into the United States.So the President's going to continue working with the Mexican government to try to secure their help in doing more to stop the flow of illegal immigration in the United States. But, again, we think that the U.S. government should be doing everything that it can and that means Congress. That means democrats and Congress working with us to close legal loopholes and secure our southern border and actually find a responsible solution for the DACA population.BARTIROMO: Yes. No, we understand what the President's saying. Let me ask you Raj, what is the President doing with Amazon? Over the weekend, he sent out a series of tweets targeting Amazon reading this in part, "It is reported that the U.S. Post Office will lose $1.50 on average for every package it delivers for Amazon. That amounts to billions of dollars. The Failing "New York Times" reports that the size of the company's lobbying staff has ballooned and that does not include the Fake "Washington Post" which is used as a lobbyist and should so register as one. If the Post Office increased its partial rates, Amazon shipping cost would rise by $2.6 billion. This Post Office scam must stop, Amazon must pay real costs and taxes now." Raj, what's the position for -- on Amazon?SHAH: Well the President is articulating what he's talked about for some time which is that a lot of these companies, internet-based companies like Amazon and others have grown to such tremendous size and have kind of taken advantage of parts of our laws and our system whether it be the Post Office for shipping and it infrastructure that Post Office has paid for and set up.That's really meant for mom and pop shops and to help consumers and individuals, it's now supporting a very massive business in Amazon as well as online sales taxes versus brick and mortar retail taxes. So he's talked about how Amazon and other companies but particular Amazon take advantage of laws and regulation that have been in place for decades that weren't really built to deal with a company of this size and stature.BARTIROMO: Yes. All right. Well we will leave there. People are questioning, is it (INAUDIBLE) Amazon or is it just the President not liking "The Washington Post?" We'll keep watching that Raj.SHAH: This isn't personal, it applies to all companies. But thanks a lot for having me on Maria.BARTIROMO: There you go, not personal. Thank you Raj, Raj Shah. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Amazon is under pressure this morning after President Trump accused the company of scamming the U.S. Postal Service. He did so on Twitter. Lauren Simonetti on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with the details. How did you get down there so early, Lauren?LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN HOST: I'm fast. Even amidst weather, there was no traffic, Maria.BARTIROMO: You're good. You're good.SIMONETTI: Everybody's off today. Let's see Amazon's shares in the premarket because they are down 1.8 percent. Obviously, the past month has been very tough for the company. As President Trump goes after not only the way they do business with the post office, but also the way they pay taxes.I also want to talk about Tesla today. This is the stock getting hit very hard in the premarket. It's down almost four percent for the month of March, and we'll show you this chart is down 22 percent. Worst month in seven years. There are so many issues with the company. The CEO over the weekend as if he's tone deaf sends a tweet saying, despite intense efforts to raise money, we're sad to report that Tesla has gone completely and totally bankrupt. Well, there are analysts out there who think this company could go bankrupt in the next four months, Maria. So, we're watching the stock and we're watching the production numbers of the Model 3 when they get from this week. Back to you.BARTIROMO: Yes, you're right, Lauren. There's real liquidity issues, everybody is writing about it. It's no longer a rumor. A lot of people are talking about it now. And (INAUDIBLE) down greater the debt.SIMONETTI: Yes, they downgraded the debt last week, further into junk status. And there are lot of questions about this company's ability to perform. In the fourth-quarter, they delivered 1,500 Model 3s a week. 1,500. We're going to get the key one numbers this week, but how do you go from 1500 to a goal of 5,000 for this quarter? I don't know if they're going to be able to do that. We had an analyst on the 5:00 a.m. show, Maria, and he goes, yes, and I'm going to be in the NBA if they meet their numbers.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: Thanks, Lauren. Lofty goals to say the least.MCDOWELL: Feel free to joke about bankruptcy if you actually own a company, but when it's a publicly-traded company, maybe you don't make that joke, given the fact that your bonds were trading at $0.86 cents on the dollar last week. Tell me.BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly. Exactly.CARTER: Well, do you think maybe he's making the tweets that we're talking about that instead of the fundamentals?MCDOWELL: No, I know he's not stupid, but that's a stupid thing to say.BARTIROMO: That was a stupid thing to say, 100 percent. Meanwhile, there's this, President Trump says the DACA deal is dead thanks to the Democrats' unwillingness to work on an agreement for border security. Stuart Varney has a thing or tell -- thing or two to say about that. Stu, good morning to you.STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST: Good morning. You must have heard about the caravan, I take it. That's this group of illegals, maybe 1,000, 1200 people starting out in Honduras, marching through Mexico to arrive at our southern border. What are we going to do when that large group of migrants arrives? Will we just let them in? They stay? Or, will we have some kind of border wall there to keep them out? I think this is a real challenge to the Democrats. What are they going to do? It reminds me of that migrant march in Europe where over a million flooded into Western Europe, Angela Merkel let them in with disastrous consequences.BARTIROMO: That's right.VARNEY: There's a parallel here. I think this caravan situation will become an issue in the November elections.BARTIROMO: Yes.VARNEY: I want to talk politics because, you know, that's what I do.BARTIROMO: Luckily, we have catch and release, right, Stu? Or, not.VARNEY: Yes. Well, not.BARTIROMO: Stu, we'll see you in 10 minutes.VARNEY: You will.BARTIROMO: "VARNEY & COMPANY" top of the hour. Back in a minute right hereBARTIROMO: All right. It's that time of the year, the annual Easter egg roll, hopping back onto the south lawn of the White House this morning. Adam Shapiro live with a preview of all the festivities, and it's not snowing there, Adam.ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: No, but it feels like it should be. It's quite cold, no walking on sunshine here, but no one (INAUDIBLE) for us. This Easter eggroll, Maria, goes back, what, to 1878. It actually goes back before that, the Lincoln administration they say had some Easter egg festivities here at the White House. But take a look, you can see the kids who are doing their part for the Easter egg roll. I just want to point you out, there was that problem with the Soviet judge who added 10 seconds back onto the clock, that has been taken care of.But there are 30,000 people here today taking part of this. Take a look, they're down over here. And the way you get invited to do this is there's a lottery here in Washington, D.C. and that was in February, and these are all of the people who were lucky enough to get the invitation to come. There are all kinds of events for the kids, not only the 25,000 eggs that are getting rolled, but there are reading nooks in which different people from the administration, cabinet members, are reading to the kids, among them, by the way, is First Lady Melania Trump.So this is the festivities. The President will be out here a little bit later on. It is chilly, but it is a lot of fun. Maria, back to you.BARTIROMO: It does. It looks like a lot of fun. I'm struck by the fact that you don't have the bad weather that we do, but maybe it's coming your way.SHAPIRO: It's cold.MCDOWELL: Did you just wish that on him, Maria Bartiromo?(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: No, I'm just saying -- I'm just saying, like, what a shot, the difference in shot.CARTER: It usually starts there.MCDOWELL: What's behind -- it's insane if you look out of the window.BARTIROMO: New York looks -- it's insane. But the Easter eggroll looks like a lot of fun. Adam Shapiro, thank you. We got final thoughts from this all-star panel after this short break. Back in a minuteBARTIROMO: Welcome back. Final thoughts from this all-star panel. Lee Carter?CARTER: Listen, I think it's fascinating how people are covering the DACA tweets by the President. Not surprising that he's going after this, just wished he didn't and the spending bill.BARTIROMO: And the spending bill as opposed to Twitter. Jason Chaffetz?CHAFFETZ: Earlier in the show, we talked about the data breach, the stolen information, and Debbie Wasserman Schultz refusing to do background checks on these people. That is a bigger, more devastating story than I think most people realize. And it'll continue to play out. It should get a lot more attention, and the federal authorities need to go after these people in a hard, hard way.BARTIROMO: In fact, I'm not surprised that they got hacked. There you go.MCDOWELL: Right.CHAFFETZ: Especially when you don't do a background check, and you bypass the --BARTIROMO: What's required.CHAFFETZ: -- what's required. And you bypass the places where you can actually catch this stuff.BARTIROMO: But why? It's amazing, Dagen.MCDOWELL: Real quick. A story. I promised a conversation with a lady in my neighborhood. I said I wish that fighting animal cruelty was a bipartisan issue. And she goes, it's Trump. And I went, ma'am, it's a problem before President Trump. Who are you going to blame when he's gone for all of your problems?BARTIROMO: God, resist of getting old. That'll do it for us. Have a great day, everybody. Here's Stuart Varney and "VARNEY & COMPANY." Stu, over to you.VARNEY: What was that, resist getting old? Yes, ma'am!BARTIROMO: Well, resist is getting old, Stu.Load-Date: April 2, 2018End of Document

Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Thursday, June 7.Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.Markets this morning are higher, take a look. But that was the high of the morning, actually. Futures indicating a gain of about 56 points on the Dow Industrials; the S&P and Nasdaq are up but just barely, 3 points higher on the S&P. This after the Nasdaq and the Russell 2000 indexes closed at new highs again yesterday. The Dow and the S&P 500 finished at their highest levels in three months.In Europe this morning, mixed performances, take a look. It was a rough start for London this morning. Trading on the London stock exchange was delayed this morning due to a technical issue. The FT 100 is now up just seven points. The CAC 40 is up a fraction, a third of a percent and the DAX index is also higher by a fraction in Germany.In Asia overnight, markets finished mostly higher, take a look, with the exception of China which was down a fraction.Trade tensions -- Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe headed to the White House today ahead of the G-7 meeting this weekend. President Trump at odds with the other six nations in the G-7 going into the summit over the tariff and trade policy out of this White House.The administration's top official, Larry Kudlow, says this is not a major fight.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR: I regard this as much like a family quarrel. I'm always the optimist. President Trump is very clear with respect to his trade reform efforts that we will do what is necessary to protect the United States, its businesses and its workforce.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: We have the very latest on trade coming up.Plus, a high stakes meeting on f Capitol Hill -- Republican lawmakers coming together to try to hammer out a deal on immigration. It comes amid a startling new report on illegal border crossings -- 50,000 people were arrested just last month.An unbelievable scene in Wyoming to show you -- a powerful tornado touching down in Wyoming. We've got the very latest. Look at those pictures. Wow.Meanwhile soaring oil prices set to cost you, airlines are now raising the price of tickets. The details coming up.And a new twist on bridal bouquets, a pizza parlor now offering arrangements made of pizza. But how do you throw it?All those stories coming up this Thursday morning. And joining me to talk all about it: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Rosecliff Capital CEO and managing partner Mike Murphy, and the "Wall Street Journal's" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman. Who would want to catch it if it's all pizza?JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, "WALL STREET JOURNAL": Well how about maybe just the dough where, you know, you're working on the dough and then you toss it out to the crowd.BARTIROMO: But you're in a wedding dress.MIKE MURPHY, CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL: Everyone's always wanted to do that, right. Whenever you go in a pizza joint you always want to do it.BARTIROMO: I did it.FREEMAN: Oh, very good.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST: She can -- this is Maria Bartiromo's wheelhouse that you just entered. She can toss dough in the air.FREEMAN: Really.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: Yes. We've seen this.FREEMAN: Has this been a segment on the show, yet or --BARTIROMO: I did a segment on "FOX AND FRIENDS" with my sister when we made my father's pizza.MURPHY: We need to do that again, for sure.FREEMAN: Yes, it could be an annual --BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: More than annual.(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: We're going to send a camera crew to your house, like when you're with your family, making pizza. It would be awesome.BARTIROMO: I'll show you how to make pizza.Look, we've got to get into the story about Iran. You mentioned it earlier and what went on in the Obama administration --FREEMAN: Yes.BARTIROMO: -- in terms of allowing Iran to have access to the U.S. financial system.FREEMAN: Yes. So the President had said as part of his terrible nuclear deal, don't worry -- he said this to Congress -- I'm not going to let the Iranians into the U.S. banking system. That's one sanction I'm not going to remove.Well, they figure out that if they want to give Iran access to billions of dollars, that Iran wanted it in dollars and then to convert that to euros. So they decided secretly to issue a license allowing Iran to transact in the U.S. banking system.Well, the plan failed because U.S. banks would not participate. And I know over the last decade especially, people have really beaten up on the big banks. I've been among those people. And I think this is a time where you've got to say hats off to bankers for --BARTIROMO: Two major banks said no, we're not doing it.FREEMAN: Yes. And good for them to say no, we're not going to participate in this secret deal to fund the Ayatollah.MCDOWELL: I remember right after the Iranian nuclear deal was inked, because of the sanctions on U.S. banks, John Kerry took a trip to I think it was London and met with all these banking heads and all these executives in the financial system and was trying to encourage them to do business with Iran --BARTIROMO: -- which would have been illegal.MCDOWELL: -- literally said we've got restrictions on U.S. banks but you guys, you can go ahead and start transacting business with Iran because they were so desperate for the deal to work and for money to get funneled.MURPHY: Yes. The banks had regulators they had to answer to -- that's why they couldn't do it when the President --BARTIROMO: Exactly.MCDOWELL: And they knew --BARTIROMO: The banks were afraid of breaking the law.FREEMAN: Yes. I think we ought to give more credit -- I don't think it was just compliance. I think they made the right decision and they realized the customers wouldn't like this either.BARTIROMO: This is a big story. We're going to talk about this about coming.We've got Financial Services Committee member and Wisconsin Congressman Sean Duffy coming up so we will ask him about that along with Ways and Means Committee member and New York Congressman Tom Reed. We'll see what they think about this whole Iran situation.Plus, Murray Energy founder and president and CEO Bob Murray has a thing or two to say about trade and tariff as well.So stay with us on all of that coming up. Big hour coming up.But first this top story and that is trade tensions. President Trump meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe today ahead of the G-7 meeting and the President's summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.Fox News' Doug McKelway is live at the White House this morning with more. Doug -- good morning to you.DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning -- Maria.And this marks about the start of the President's busiest week since he assumed office. It begins this afternoon with the visit of Japanese President Shinzo Abe who arrives here at 12:00 noon. The two men are planning for a joint press conference at 2:00 p.m.They have hit it all very well as you well know. Shinzo Abe was the first foreign leader to visit the Trump Tower during the transition, later invited to Mar-A-Lago where the two men enjoyed golf. They seemed to have hit it off very, very well.No country has a greater interest in reining in North Korea's nuclear capability than Japan. That country is truly facing an existential threat from Kim Jong-un's ballistic missiles. His meeting with Trump today points out that the upcoming summit in Singapore is not really a bilateral meeting, although it is that by name, but that the interest of many countries -- Japan, South Korea, China, the Pacific Rim countries and many others -- all have a very important stake in this.Complicating the preparations for the summit is the G-7 meeting in Quebec tomorrow which the President will attend. It comes amid heated debate over President Trump's pursuit of more tariffs against Canada, against Mexico, against the European Union and the President's ban against the Japanese -- excuse me, the Chinese phone company ZTE which has been accused of evading the ban on sanctions against Iran and North Korea.Larry Kudlow was asked about whether there's been a consideration of lifting the ban on ZTE yesterday. Here's what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KUDLOW: No decisions on both sides as of now. And of course, I refer you to Wilbur Ross, the Secretary of Commerce. But as of this moment, no decision has been reached by both sides.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCKELWAY: Trump leaves for the G-7 summit tomorrow. From there he will jet off to Singapore where so much is at stake, so much is unknown, and so many countries are awaiting eagerly to find out what happens and whether there will be subsequent meetings at all.Back to you.BARTIROMO: All right. And we check back as news develops. Doug -- thank you. Doug McKelway there --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: -- at the White House this morning.Facebook fallout -- Senator Ed Markey is calling for CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify before Cngress again following backlash over the social media company's data partnership with Chinese phone maker Huawei.Yesterday, the Senator tweeted this, "For more than 10 years Facebook has shared users' personal data with Chinese companies including one with close ties to the Chinese Communist Party. I'm calling for Mark Zuckerberg to come to the Senate and explain how U.S. national security was not jeopardized."Here's a look back to what Zuckerberg said during his testimony on the hill back in April.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: We didn't take a broad enough view of our responsibility and that was a big mistake. And it was my mistake and I'm sorry. I started Facebook. I run it. And I'm responsible for what happens here.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is a former mentor to Mark Zuckerberg, early investor in Facebook certainly, and managing director and co-founder of Elevation Partners, Roger McNamee here with us. Roger -- great to see you.ROGER MCNAMEE, CO-FOUNDER & MANAGING DIRECTOR, ELEVATION PARTNERS: Always great to be here -- Maria.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us.So you've previously voiced your concerns over Facebook and the business model. How do you feel about the response from Facebook? Where are we now on this issue?MCNAMEE: We're nowhere near the end, unfortunately. The company had this model for years called "move fast and break things". The notion was don't let anything get in the way of growth.The reality is it was really "move fast, break things, apologize and then move on" as though nothing has happened. And that's really where Mark is now. He's apologizing because every rock we turn over has another scandal hidden underneath it.And this one in China, we don't know exactly how bad it is. What we know, though, is that Facebook was not monitoring these companies. And if the Defense Department is telling us they won't buy Huawei products because they're afraid of bugging and hacking, I think we have to be concerned that Huawei with 10 years or whatever of control of Facebook user accounts is going to have had the opportunity to download all that data.BARTIROMO: I think this is one of the biggest stories of our time, frankly. When you look at China and what has occurred and the fact that there's this massive technology transfer going on, where China acquires American companies, forces the transfer of technology and then you see Facebook, it's not the technology or secrets but it's all their user data.MCNAMEE: And Mark has worked so hard to try to get in the good graces of the Chinese government in order to have the opportunity to participate there --BARTIROMO: That's the thing though, yes.MCNAMEE: -- and so I do not find their response even remotely comforting, because their practice has been deny, deny, deny and then only admit to the bare minimum when they're forced to. And the situation here is they weren't paying attention. They have no idea what these guys did and they had years to mess with this data.BARTIROMO: Yes. And there are other technology companies that wanted a foothold in China but would not adhere to China rules, in terms of forcing the technology. Look at Google.By the way, Google now reportedly bracing for a fine of up to $11 billion following an anti-trust issue in the European Union. That of course, investigation into the company according to the "Financial Times" is coming to a head. This would be the second major penalty for Google coming from the European competition regulators.What's going on in terms of regulation within tech? We're just at the beginning of this.MCNAMEE: We are. And it's really important that we have some threat of regulation because the companies have done a terrible job of self- regulation. I mean, they have been given all the room in the world to manage themselves and yet we've clearly seen one disaster after another.And the issues that Google faces in Europe are not unique to Google. Amazon has competitive issues in many markets around the world. Facebook is clearly behaving like a monopolist around the world. And as a consequence, regulators I think are appropriately worried that the entrepreneurial economy, especially in this country, is being stifled.These guys are blocking the new startups from getting going. They're really limiting the rate of innovation in this country. And that's not the American way. The American way is we let a thousand flowers bloom. We let entrepreneur create new things.And these guys can be really successful without blocking every new thing that comes along. And it's important for regulators to make that point and find ways to constrain them so that we can have this kind of economy that really supports jobs all across America.BARTIROMO: Are there other companies out there that are also selling the data right now that we don't even know about?MCNAMEE: I assume so. In fact, I think you have to assume that whatever data you had that was in one of these systems has been compromised somewhere. The only company that has made a strategy of protecting your data is Apple and even there I don't think you can feel 100 percent safe. But you're going to feel much safer there.The worst offenders on this have been the Android operating system that Google owns and Facebook. Both of which have been so porous that frankly, you just have to assume everything has been compromised.And so that's why when regulators look at this, the important thing to look at is to protect users from inappropriate usage of their data going forward -- there's no way to get the data back. So what you have to do is place restrictions on how it's used. We have to be given control over what any company does with the data that they have.BARTIROMO: There's that. There's also the issue of conservative ideas being crushed, being, you know, eliminated. So we had Kevin McCarthy on the show recently, the majority leader, he said that. That, you know, these companies are editing the information that we all see. We had Devin Nunes, the chairman of the Intel Committee Sunday who said the same thing.MCNAMEE: There's no question that they edit like crazy. But I think the perception they edit one side more than the other is not actually correct. I think what's going on is that these companies are not transparent. We have no idea what they're doing when they edit.I think in reality, what they're doing is creating what is known as a filter bubble around each person. They give each person what that person wants and their idea of what that person wants may or may not be correct. But their notion is they give you your preferences all the time and reinforce that.BARTIROMO: But you saw the story last week where if you typed in GOP in California, you pulled up a list of ideologies on Google and one of them was Nazism.MCNAMEE: No, no, no. That kind of stuff is --BARTIROMO: How does that happen -- Roger?MCNAMEE: The answer is this stuff is totally automated and these people have no idea, right. They're trying to sell ads. They're not worried about truth. They're not worried about fact. They're worried about engagement. They're worried about their revenue. They want to give you what they think you want.BARTIROMO: Now they can be worried --MCNAMEE: They obviously thought somebody wanted to know the party sentiment.BARTIROMO: Now they're going to have to worry about regulation. I mean Devin Nunes said look --MCNAMEE: They should have to worry about regulation.BARTIROMO: -- if somebody doesn't come in the free market and do what Google does and make sure to promise us that they're not going to be editing things like this, then it's fine. If not, we're going to have to look at this as if they're monopolies.MCNAMEE: You have to look that way. Now, I think it's about time people started to look at them that way. The right answer in the short run is to force them to have a button at the top that gives you a choice of view. You can give me what you think I want. But I want to be able to see an unfiltered view as well.BARTIROMO: That's a great point.MCNAMEE: Ok.BARTIROMO: Real quick -- would you put money into this sector today? Do you want to buy any of these stocks?MCNAMEE: I don't want to buy any of them. I own -- I still own some Facebook, I still own Apple, I still own Amazon. I would not -- I think we're very late in the market cycle. I think rates are still rising. There's a lot of uncertainty on global trade and the tech industry's really sensitive to global trade.So I think it looks good relative to the market but I'm nervous about the market.BARTIROMO: You are so good. How's the band going? Moonalice?MCNAMEE: Awesome -- playing a lot of rock and roll. It's summertime. Moonalice.com for anybody who wants to check it out.BARTIROMO: You are my rock and roll mentor. Roger -- good to see you.MCNAMEE: Always great to see you.BARTIROMO: Roger McNamee. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: welcome back.Las Vegas police releasing 9-1-1 calls from the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.Cheryl Casone with the details now and headlines -- Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: They're tough to listen to -- Maria.You hear things like panic, you hear fear, you hear the desperation in these voices; as you said, Las Vegas police releasing these 9-1-1 calls eight months after the mass shooting. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: My friend just got shot. We need an ambulance.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We have three gunshot wounds and I have no idea where we re.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You need an ambulance.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: And there's so many calls to listen to, folks. Authorities also releasing this video from surveillance cameras that show people frantically fleeing the scene. The gunfire came from the 32nd floor windows of the Mandalay Bay Resort; 58 people were killed that night.Well, incredible video of a powerful tornado touching down in Wyoming last night. The National Weather Service said the tornado was on the ground for at least 45 minutes. Some brave people heading outside, snapping photos of the monstrous twister -- brave or maybe just crazy, I don't know.You can see the massive thunderstorm that sparked the tornado hovering above. No word yet if there was any damage or injuries but incredible pictures.Well, a more than 50 percent jump in fuel cost is hitting air travelers right in the wallet as airlines start to raise their fares. Delta Airlines cutting its profit forecast for the year, adding it could take anywhere from six months to a year to make up for increase fuel costs. United Airlines also expected to raise ticket prices very soon. Shares of Delta Airlines are down about 3 percent this year. United Continental up about 4 percent.Ok, here's something a little more fun. For a bride to chew on as she walks down the aisle, who doesn't want this? Via Italian Kitchen announcing this week couples tying the knot this summer could enter to win an exclusive pizza bouquet and they get a boutonniere.They claim it's going to be the first ever of its kind. I think that's true. Entries have to be in by June 15th. Win or lose, entrants will receive a coupon for a free slice of pizza. But for the pizza-loving bride, Maria -- hey, why not girls do it. Go for it. Fully support it.BARTIROMO: Ok. Thank you -- Cheryl.CASONE: You bet.Coming up -- the battle over immigration. House Republicans meet for crucial negotiations today on border control, just as a startling new report says illegal border crossings had hit 50,000 in the month of May.Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.The GOP getting ready for a crucial debate on immigration later today; there are stark divisions within the Republican conference. This, as the DHS Reports that border arrests have exceeded 50,000 just for the month of May. And this is the third month in a row that they've exceeded 50,000.Here now, Republican Congressman Tom Reed of New York, a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, who has signed a discharge petition which could force votes on immigration. Congressman -- good to see you, Thanks so much for joining us.REP. TOM REED (R-NY), HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE: Thanks for having me on -- Maria.BARTIROMO: Why did you do that? You need to force a decision on immigration because it's so in the background at this point.REED: This has been going on for months. This is now seven months into this issue of resolving it, not just for the Dreamers and these kids that are caught up in a broken immigration system, but more fundamentally to secure our borders and get this wall and structures constructed to secure the border so we're starting to fix the problem.And this discharge petition is just going to have an open debate on four bills that will say let's go on record, put the position of the House out there so that we can then go with the senate and see if we can get to the White House to sign this and start legislating for the people back home.BARTIROMO: And Congressman -- the House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows sounded hopeful on the debate. Here's what he said yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. MARK MEADOWS (R-NC), HOUSE FREEDOM CAUCUS: We're still not in a situation where there's an agreement. I think there is great progress that's being made. Hopefully what we'll see is the objections get smaller and less of hurdle in the hours to come.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: So what are the hurdles -- Congressman? Because, you know, at the same time, you also hear Mitch McConnell saying this is never getting anywhere before the midterm elections.REED: Well, I'm glad to hear that type of conversation. And I think this petition is forcing and leveraging the pressure that is necessary to finally say let's get this done. And some of the issues that are out there is what is the path for potential citizenship for the Dreamers, how much money will go into the wall? How much money will go into technology? But those are issues that we can work out and should have worked out months ago. But now we're getting to the point where it will get resolved because they have no other option because the clock is ticking.BARTIROMO: So let me switch gears here because we're waiting on the IG report. Jim Comey apparently defied authority when he was the FBI director. That's what we understand is in the IG report. Does this chip away at credibility there? What are you expecting in terms of the inspector general report which is forthcoming -- we expect this week.REED: Well, first of all, absolutely it chips away at Mr. Comey's credibility. And remember who the IG is. This is essentially the internal affairs, the police of the police if you would, whose job is not to conduct a political investigation but to hold accountable our government officials such as James Comey to say look, I'm going to call balls and strikes here.And that they are clearly saying and the information I'm hearing is troublesome. You acted insubordinate, in an insubordinate manner. And at the end of the day, when you have your FBI director doing that, we should learn from it, we should hold people accountable and move forward in a stronger fashion.FREEMAN: Congressman -- hi, James Freeman with the "Wall Street Journal". We've been talking about the revelations this week that in order to facilitate the Iran nuclear deal, President Obama secretly sought to give Iran the ability to transact through the American financial system in order to get frozen assets converted into dollars and then euros.Does this -- does this change the politics in terms of how people on Capitol Hill view the President's decision to abandon that deal? Or is this kind of a partisan rut where it doesn't have much impact?REED: I hope it does. But it definitely illustrates what I've been saying all along about the Iranian deal. That was, President Obama's administration saying they were out of time, they needed to cut a deal, they wanted to put this win up on the board. And they were willing to negotiate everything away in order to get the Iranian deal signed into law in my humble opinion.And this is yet just another sign of how they were doing that and trying to move the ball for political deadlines rather than what we should be focusing on, is substance of a deal that is going to keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of Iranians.And now what has happened is the President has gone forward in a leadership role to say we're going to hold these guys accountable. We're not going to honor a deal that was done in a hasty manner in order to achieve some type of deadline because they were leaving the White House.BARTIROMO: Good for those banks to push back and say we're not going do it.REED: Amen. Thank God they did.BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly. Go ahead.MCDOWELL: I just want -- I want to add one thing, Congressman -- in terms of it was almost as if American banks and even businesses knew that this was a bad deal from the start.REED: Yes.MCDOWELL: And would not step up because, again, you had just myriad businesses in Europe immediately beginning to transact business with Iran after this deal was done, oh so anxiously going into that country. You did not have that in the United States.Boeing is kind of one of the only examples that we can cite of inking a deal with Iran. So it wasn't just the banks. It was scores of other companies.FREEMAN: It's a great point. And this is why we have a process for treaties where people in this country, people overseas -- they understand it's a real agreement. The United States has made a decision.President Obama didn't do that. He basically got around the need for a treaty. They had this cheap maneuver in the Congress --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: For the U.N.(CROSSTALK)FREEMAN: Yes, good for American businesses and banks in this case saying this isn't going to fly and it won't fly with our customer.REED: And if I could add, a great point, and that is why when President Trump did this with the Iranian deal, it squarely is going to put American businesses as well as European businesses, who are you going to side with? The Iranians or America?And that is going to be further leveraged to say I know where people will want to do business. That's with us as proud Americans.BARTIROMO: Congressman -- real quick before you go. Are you going to do phase two of the tax cut plan before the midterms?REED: We're definitely moving forward on the committee. We're drafting that. We're working on it, having conversations. And we want to do it. We want to protect those individuals and make this code permanent for individuals as well as the expensing provisions for businesses across the country.BARTIROMO: And you think that will be something we'll see before the midterms?REED: I do believe so. We're on track to get that done and that's exactly where I think we're going to land.BARTIROMO: Congressman -- good to see you sir. Thank you.REED: Thanks for having us on.BARTIROMO: Tom Reed joining us there.Coming up, the power of big tech -- the Nasdaq and the Russell 2000 hitting record highs, boosted by the technology sector. We're taking at look at how long this rally can last.Then bottoms up at Wal-Mart -- the retailer going upscale with wine at bargain prices.Back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Good Thursday morning everybody. Welcome back. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Thanks for joining us. It is Thursday, June 7th. Your top stories right now, 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast.It is looking like a mixed picture for markets at the opening of trading this morning. Take a look at Futures indicating a gain of 70 points on the Dow Jones Industrial average. This right here, this is the high of the morning, Dow industrials up 70, S&P and NASDAQ are up just a fraction. But it is -- the Dow that's really going to be the splash. Yesterday it was a record-breaker for the NASDAQ and the Russell meanwhile. The Russell 2000 Index and the NASDAQ hitting all-time highs while the Dow and S&P 500 closed the day at their highest levels in three months. Take a look at those numbers, pretty strong performance.In Europe this morning, mixed story. London's trading day got off to a late start. The market got hit by a rare technical glitch delaying the open. The FT-100 is up 20 points right now, the CAC Quarante and DAX index are higher by a quarter of a percent at this hour.In Asia overnight markets finished mostly higher as you can see there, with the exception of China. Shang Hai Composite was down a fraction.Coming up, more Americans banking on the big inheritance (INAUDIBLE) to secure their future. We'll take a look at this trend and how we're investing it.Starbucks customers, getting awakening this morning. A cup of coffee just got more expensive. How much it is going to cost you for your cup of Joe every morning now?Jessica Alba wants to take her Honest Company global. The consumer goods company just got the big bucks to back it up. We've got the details.And why Wal-Mart's bargain thirsty shoppers will soon be drinking up wine at a discount.Plus this, lady gaga hitting the stage in the first trailer for the highly anticipated "A Star is Born."(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LADY GAGA, SINGER AND ACTRESS, AS ALLY: No, I can't do that.BRADLEY COOPER, ACTOR, AS JACKSON MAINE: You're coming, here we go.GAGA: Jack, Jack, please, it's not funny. Jack.COOPER: Look at me. All you got to do is trust me. That's all you got to do.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: That's sneak peek, already sparking Oscar buzz online. We've got more for you coming up.But first, this top story this half an hour, big tech continues to power the markets. The NASDAQ, the Russell 2000 index hitting at record highs and the S&P is not far behind. Joining us right now is the chief investment officer at Federated Investors, who just throw in there $15 billion in (INAUDIBLE) management, Stephen Auth is with us. Stephen, good to see you. Thank you so much for joining us.STEPHEN AUTH, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, FEDERATED INVESTORS: Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: You're fully invested here.AUTH: Well, pretty close. Yes, we think that the market's heading higher. The consensus I -- the consensus really is that we're going to roll over as we approach the peak from back in early January and I think people think we're late cycle. Market's expensive. We think we're not late cycle. We don't think the market's expensive. And we're heading into an earnings season, probably going to be the best earnings season in almost a decade.BARTIROMO: We just came off of a great earnings season. 26 percent profit growth.AUTH: We did. And this one's even going to be better. You know, earnings will be up about 20 percent. And we're only weeks away now. And I think that's the next focus on the market. I think when once we power through the January highs, you know, technically you could have the market head considerably higher.MURPHY: And Steve, you pointed out that a lot of people are not bullish this market, you know, they're giving a lot of reasons why the market should roll over here. And having been through 2000 and been through 2008, but prior to those two periods you had everybody sell your house, invest in the market.AUTH: Right.MURPHY: Everybody was uber bullish. Whereas now, I feel the consensus is very negative which I think is a great opportunity for the market because the earnings are really showing real growth in certain sectors.AUTH: Yes, it's really funny, we've got this great fundamental backdrop, yet the overall consensus is very cautious. I put out a piece a couple of weeks, I called the five myths. And to me, you know, talking a lot to investors, there's this belief that what goes up must come down, that we're late cycle. That the market's over expensive. And it's just, we're not. We're not late cycle. If you look at where we are. The expansion -- the average expansion in this cycle per year is about 2.1 percent. Whereas most economic expansions would be more than double that. You could argue - - you know, in time it's been long. But in distance it hasn't been.BARTIROMO: But the age of it, like we're on our tenth year right now.AUTH: Yes, people are worried about the age.BARTIROMO: That's why we're bringing it up, that's what skeptics bring up.AUTH: I think age is potentially a good thing.BARTIROMO: Age is just a number. Come on.AUTH: Absolutely.FREEMAN: Whatever you are is the new 30. 30 I'm wondering with the -- with the stocks, you're saying they're not expensive. So, I thin traditional analysis, you look at trailing earnings and you say, wow, that's expensive. You look at forward earnings it looks kind of reasonable.AUTH: Right.FREEMAN: Is there a specific yardstick you use to say stocks are cheap, stocks are not cheap?AUTH: Well, our yardstick is we look forward. We try to analyze the fundamentals of where we're heading. And people have been saying this market's expensive all the way up and it's mostly because they're looking at trailing numbers. But on a -- on a forward basis, this market is not expensive. And on individual stocks it's not expensive. I mean, some of the stocks we like, you mentioned some of the tech stocks, like Facebook as an example.BARTIROMO: You like that?AUTH: Yes, stock's trading in, 24 times next year's earnings. That's not expensive. Particularly with the --BARTIROMO: Not compared to Amazon.AUTH: Probably understated, yes, not compared to Amazon, Apple's 16 times, J.P. Morgan stock we like, it's trading at 13 times.FREEMAN: Wait, why do you say Facebook's earnings are understated? What does that mean?AUTH: Well, if you look at the traditional accounting in this country, based on widget production basically, right? So, when you invest in a factory, you get to expense that over two decades. But if you're investing in tech and data, its immediate expensed. But there's assets on the balance sheets of companies like Facebook that are not even on the -- they're off-balance sheet.BARTIROMO: Well they're not monetizing WhatsApp, they're not monetizing the Messenger.AUTH: Yes, all this data has enormous value. And it's not showing up on the balance sheets, they're already been expensed and in fact the acquisition of it hasn't been. So, you know, if you look on a cash flow basis, these companies are generating enormous amounts of cash flow.MURPHY: How much harder is your job right now? Because the velocity of change, with new technology coming out, you know, you have a company going from a start-up, early stage company to a multibillion dollar company in a couple of years. Does that make your job and analyzing and valuing these companies that much harder?AUTH: I think in general investing in stocks has become more and more difficult. At the same time, more and more investors have just gone passive and that's what creates the great opportunity for the active manager and active managers have now been outperforming the last 12 to 18 months. There's so much money in the market that just -- is blindly investing. In some ways, it makes our job a little bit easier in effect. But yes, I mean, is the complexity high? That's what you're exploring on the show every morning. It's gotten more and more complex.BARTIROMO: Yes.AUTH: It is a complex world.MCDOWELL: But even looking back 10 years, are investors still shaken from the financial crisis and overinvested in fixed income, thinking that fixed income, particularly treasuries -- longer term treasuries are some sort of haven, is that the real concern here?AUTH: Well, I think --MCDOWELL: Again, we're staring at a bear market for something, right?AUTH: Right.MCDOWELL: It's either, it's going to be equities or --AUTH: I mean, you're half full, half empty. But I would say that the half full element here and one of our thesis for what we call the secular bull. We think we're in this long cycle secular bull is just that, the base of this expansion is the worst economic crisis since really the great depression and every economic actor out there has been negatively affected by this and they all think sooner or later it's going to roll over. Even the regulators. So they've been very kind to this market as a result. So when everyone's expecting something to happen, that's usually doesn't happen. And that's why stocks we think are still undervalued. Is there a bubble in bonds? We're not a believer of that. We think bond yields are low for a reason and we think they're going to grind higher but we only anticipate -- and certainly if we had a big selloff in bonds, that would hurt equities for sure.BARTIROMO: Let me ask you this, the Federal Reserve meeting next week, you're expecting the Fed to raise interest rates?AUTH: Well, me and everyone else.BARTIROMO: And everybody else?AUTH: Yes.BARTIROMO: OK. Let's just talk about this for a second, during the break we were talking about and noticing some of this price increases, the price of coffee, Starbucks coffee's going up, airline tickets are going up. What else did we say?MUROHY: Gas.BARTIROMO: Gasoline prices are going up. Is inflation an issue? How does the Fed deal with that? And what does the markets do as rates starts going higher?AUTH: So, some things are going up. But there's a lot of stuff not going up. Price of diapers isn't going up. Most staples the prices are not going up.BARTIROMO: OK.AUTH: But there's not a lot of pricing power. And you've got the Amazon effect out there, literally with the Gatling gun on top of the mountain top, waiting for anyone to volunteer there here (INAUDIBLE).MCDOWELL: Absolutely.BARTIROMO: You're right -- you're right.MCDOWELL: But I'll throw it at you this way. Maybe consumers aren't getting those price increases passed along, that inflation, but it is hitting businesses. Steel prices even before these tariffs go into effect are up 40 percent in the United States year-to-date or were through the end of last week, even more year over year. You have freight costs going up and Cisco, the food company is saying our costs have gone up. We can't pass them under our customers. That hits profit margins. So, is that a concern if you own stocks?AUTH: Yes, Dagen, we're about to produce a 20 percent year over year quarterly gains in earnings in the upcoming quarter. So yes, cost pressures are affecting some companies and active investors like us, we're very carefully watching which companies don't have enough pricing power or aren't. But there's other ways to offset commodity price increases as you get productivity. You get a corporate tax cut and maybe you use some of that money to pay your workers a little --BARTIROMO: What about the trade issue? Are you worried about the trade issue, aluminum and steel tariffs, China fight?AUTH: No. We're trying to get free and fair trade. I mean, you've been talking about this on the show. But we just see that as a powerful negotiation. The president has most of the cards. He's a very good negotiator. And you go into China, the good cops go in there, Kudlow and - -BARTIROMO: Mnuchin.AUTH: Mnuchin, right? And they say look, here's the deal. You guys are shipping $500 billion to us a year. We're shipping you 120. We want that number to change. You've got to take down some of your barriers so we can ship more to you. Give us $200 billion or the bad cops are going to be over here, Navarro, etcetera. That's what's going on.BARTIROMO: Right, you know what? I'm so glad you're here. Because this was the top of our show. This was the first words we said. Dagen brought this up at the top of the show saying, why we're all worried about all this trade stuff and look at the markets new record highs. This is why. Stephen Auth just told us the sentiments of Wall Street.AUTH: Yes.BARTIROMO: You're not buying it. You think this is all a negotiation. You just want a better trade deal.AUTH: And you know, a month ago we were talking about do the Chinese cheat or not? Now we're talking about how much is it? You know, we're up to $80 billion, right?BARTIROMO: Right.AUTH: Well OK, that's not going to work. But we'll carry, the bid ask is now 8200. I couldn't find a number.BARTIROMO: Well, the last time I check, $300 billion cost, to the theft of intellectual property a year?FREEMAN: You're saying basically you think these larger problems are going to be pushed aside. I don't think this is progress that the government says we're now going to set numbers for imports and exports. Is it?AUTH: Look, to me the press is hysterical about this and if you think about it, all the president wants is free and fair trade. The tariffs is a cajole he's using to negotiate better terms. BARTIROMO: That's right.AUTH: The rest of the world, we're dealing with an entitlement here.BARTIROMO: Yes.AUTH: Even our so-called allies in Europe.BARTIROMO: Right.AUTH: We rebuilt the world after World War II. We gave them all these deals. And now we're saying end of the entitlements.BARTIROMO: And yesterday Kudlow called the tariffs a tool. There you go.AUTH: Yes.BARTIROMO: Stephen, good to see you.AUTH: Likewise.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Stephen Auth joining us, Federated Investors.Coming up, get ready to pay more for your coffee. You just heard it. Starbucks is raising prices again. We'll tell you how much. Back in a moment.BARTIROMO: welcome back. Starbucks hiking the cost of your morning cup of coffee again. Cheryl Casone with the details, Cheryl.CASONE: OK, this is going to get expensive, Maria. Starbucks fans are going to have to dig a bit deeper for the cup of Joe in the morning. The company raising prices between $00.10 and $00.20 on all sizes of its brewed coffee in most of its stores here in the U.S. Starbucks blaming the move on the nine percent increase in operating expenses for the first half of its fiscal year. That's compared to last year. Starbucks shares are down less than one percent so far this year.Well, Jessica Alba's Honest Company receiving a fresh round of funding. The company is getting a $200 million investment from private equity firm L Catterton. The Honest says, that the new investment is going to help expand its business globally, increase product supply and funds of innovation. The company has not disclosed the size of the stake that L Catterton is actually going to receive in all of this.Well, bargain hunters can now grab a fancy bottle of wine at Wal-Mart. The company trying to appeal to more upscale tastes, launching its own wine label called Wine Makers Selection. Customers are going to be able to buy 10 fine wines from California, France and Italy. Retailing for about $11.00 a bottle. The retailer says the wine will be higher quality than other brands of wine that it actually currently sells. This puts them of course in direct competition with their rival Costco. Costco's got its own private wine label. Shares of Wal-Mart down 14 percent this year. Costco shares are up six percent.And then I'm so excited about this, Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga are teaming up for the fourth rendition of a "Star Is Born" and Oscar buzz is already swirling.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)COOPER: Do you write songs or anything?GAGA: I don't sing my own songs.COOPER: Why?GAGA: I just don't feel comfortable.COOPER: Why wouldn't you feel comfortable?GAGA: Almost every single person has told me they like the way I sound, but they don't like the way I look.COOPER: I think you're beautiful.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Bradley Cooper is directing Lady Gaga's feature debut as a Hollywood lead. Cooper plays an aging performer who takes a shy, talented young singer played of course by, Lady Gaga. Under his wing, she of course brings her musical expertise to the film. There's a slew of original songs for this one. She wrote a handful of them with Cooper and other artists like Mark Ronson and Willie Nelson's son, Lukas. "A Star is Born" hits theaters October 5th. I was actually looking at the trailer last night.BARTIROMO: Wow that really does look good. I'm looking forward to it too.CASONE: Her songs are incredible on this.MCDOWELL: Just real quick, she's going to be compared to Janet Gaynor, Judy Garland and Barbra Streisand who all played this role. So, that's what she will be compared to.BARTIROMO: OK, so, you're saying --MCDOWELL: She's awesome.BARTIROMO: High expectation. Coming up, windfall as the pathway to wealth, we'll tell you why a third of Americans are banking on an inheritance to shore up their financial futures. Are you one of them, next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. More Americans are relying on their parents for money, that's according to a new report from Merrill Edge that finds one in three Americans are relying on an inheritance for financial stability. Joining us right now in a FOX Business Exclusive is Bank of America Merrill Edge head Aron Levine. Good to see you, Aron. Thank you so much for joining us.ARON LEVINE, MERRILL EDGE HEAD, BANK OF AMERICA: Hey, good to see you again. Thank you so much.BARTIROMO: So, this survey finds that number jumping to 63 percent.LEVINE: Yes.BARTIROMO: When narrowed down between generation z or those aged between 18 and 22. Tell us about it.LEVINE: Yes, you think about that 18 to 22, that youngest generation is facing three really serious challenges, right? One, student debt. It's now up to $1.5 trillion. 29 percent increase in just the last four years. All right, that's one huge one. Second one, it is a fact that their parents are living longer, they have a perception they're going to live longer. So now, I'm thinking about what if I live in to my 80s or 90s. And how do I finance that? Over the course of time. And third is, they are now at point now where they're starting college and thinking about well I need to save for a home someday. I have always competing priorities. So, when you take in those three things, student debt, longevity and competing priorities, they're saying, boy, I hope I get some inheritance to solve this problem. Because I'm really not sure how to do it.BARTIROMO: Yes, especially since, I know an 18-year-old is not thinking about their retirement. But they're not getting Social Security, today's 18-year-old, I don't think, now that we know that the Social Security going to be dipping into its trust fund for the first time in 36 years.LEVINE: Right. Yes. So, it's really creating a new normal in a lot of ways. In terms of how to redefine retirement. I think we talked about the last time I was on, if you're in your young 20s, you're not sincerely saying at 65 I'm going to have this pot of money and I'm just going to get out of the workforce.BARTIROMO: Right.LEVINE: I think there's a clear view that says, you know, I may continue working, hopefully it's not in the same job I'm in and I have some financial freedom. But the question is, how do I finance that over the course of time versus some lump sum I have to have by a certain age?MURPHY: So, Aron, one thing I see as a big change in the landscape, this would be access that the younger generation has to information, it's education. I think 18 to 22-year-olds today are starting to learn more and focus more about their money, about retirement, about what they're going to need. And I think that's a huge benefit to the entire country.LEVINE: You're absolutely right. So, I think all those fears that I sort of talked about, that the upside is they're very self-aware and they are actually taking advantage of the access. So they go online, they're starting to educate themselves. And it's our job, places like Merrill Edge and Bank of America to provide that education access and then say, what would you like to do about it? And I think what you're seeing is, that's leading towards where this generation has a kind of profits and purpose mindset. So if I'm going to invest my money, I want to invest in something that's a little more socially conscious. And that's why it's important that all of the industry is delivering those kinds of investment vehicles so that generation can say boy, I do want to invest. I'd love to invest in a company that has a certain sort of moral compass.FREEMAN: And so, when you advise Generation Z, step one, do you say OK, your parents by the way are going to live maybe to 100 and by the way, we're looking at the finances of Social Security and Medicare, you're probably on your own.LEVINE: Yes, I think the -- hopefully not in your -- on one ways you're not on your own, as you can get some advice and there are ways to reach out. I think what we're trying to do is say, one, you're your self- educated and focus on a plan. Like anything, like, you can't just do it without a very clear plan. So that's what we key on is getting them a life plan.BARTIROMO: All right, thank you. Good to see you. Aron Levine, Bank of America. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Thursday morning everybody. Thank you so much for joining us this morning. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Thursday, June 7th.Load-Date: June 7, 2018End of Document

Here's what you need to know.What just happened?The White House on Monday started the process to impose tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods, on top of $50 billion already announced.The Trump administration said the penalties will be applied if China goes through with its promise to retaliate against US tariffs announced last week. Beijing has promised to respond with penalties of equal scale.Economists are worried because neither side shows signs of backing down.Also on Monday, Trump threatened to impose more tariffs on another $200 billion worth of Chinese goods if Beijing continues to retaliate.That sounds big. Is it?China and the United States traded goods and services worth over $650 billion in 2016. It's the world's largest bilateral trading relationship.Most of that trade is in goods -- not services -- and most of it flows from China to the United States.China shipped far more goods to the United States ($505 billion last year, according to US figures) than came back in the opposite direction ($130 billion).The Trump administration has announced plans to target products from China including machinery, electrical goods and vehicles.Even if Americans don't buy these items directly, they could still feel the impact as US companies raise their prices to help them pay for more expensive machines and industrial goods.How will China respond?Because China can apply tariffs to US goods worth only $130 billion, Beijing will have to find other ways to execute a proportional response.Analysts say the Chinese government could target trade in services between the two countries rather than physical products. That means things like tourism and education, industries from which the United States benefits a lot more than China does.What would that look like?When China was locked in a dispute with South Korea last year, the unofficial order was given for Chinese travel agencies to halt tour groups to South Korea. Chinese tourism to South Korea was cut nearly in half, hurting hotels, duty free stores and other travel businesses.The companies caught in the middleBeijing could seek to make life difficult for US companies that rely on the Chinese market."History shows that there are various other measures [China] could take to inflict pain on US companies ... including scaled up health, safety and tax checks, delaying the imports of goods, and boycotts," warned Louis Kuijs, the head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics.US companies including Apple, GM and Boeing generate large amounts of sales in China.American companies could be affected in other ways, too.The Semiconductor Industry Association, which represents major American chipmakers including Intel and Qualcomm, said it was alarmed to find the US government was considering tariffs on computer chips imported from China.US companies often send mostly finished chips to China for assembly, testing and packaging.

Morlan student scammed to wire money to China after threatening callThe Panther: Chapman UniversityApril 29, 2018 SundayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 554 wordsByline: Jack EckertBodyAn undisclosed student recently received a threatening phone call and was swindled into transferring money to China.A student living in North Morlan Hall received a call between April 10 and 11 from someone claiming to be a representative from an unnamed Chinese government agency, threatening consequences unless the student wired money, said Dean of Students Jerry Price.The student, who university administrators would not identify, complied with the request.There are about one to two fraudulent phone calls per year that are directed toward members of the Chapman community, although there could be more that go unreported, Price said."My understanding is that someone contacted the student, portrayed themselves to be from some agency of a foreign government," Price said. "(They delivered an) urgent message that (the student) owed 'x' amount of money and that there were going to be serious consequences if they didn't wire the money."[Related: You've got blackmail: Chapman student falls victim to social media 'sextortion']This type of scam is most commonly targeted toward U.S. students studying abroad, Price said. In this case, money was wired to a subject in China, but the exact origin of the call - due to IP address masking software and computers with falsely registered IP addresses - is unknown.After learning about the incident, Public Safety sought assistance from the Orange Police Department to investigate, although the department hasn't issued any warrant or made an arrest.Randy Burba, the chief of Public Safety, said that these types of calls happen less than once a year.[Related: Sugar and spice, just name your price]"I've been at Chapman for 12 years. This kind of thing has only happened maybe three, four times that I can recall. It's not very common (that the scam is successful)," Burba said.Western Union, a credit union that doesn't trace transactions between parties, has admitting to aiding in transfer scams, agreeing to return $586 million to customers who haven't been "adequately protected from fraud," according to the Federal Trade Commission. A customer service representative from Western Union declined to comment on wiring fraud.Jess Quimpo, a junior kinesiology major, said she would go to the police if she received a similar call."Of course, I would freak out a bit, but it's best to just take it to the authorities or the bank so they could help at least get me through it," she said.Fraudulent calls are not commonly targeted to Chapman students, Burba said. But scam calls are prominent in the U.S., with the IRS putting out public alerts.According to the Federal Trade Commission, scammers might seem friendly, call you by your first name, make small talk or claim to work for a trusted company.Asking for personal information, like credit card information or Social Security numbers, can also be a red flag.Price said the university is trying to prevent this type of crime by spreading the word about it. Chapman students and their families should sign up for the Orange iWatch, Burba said, a free, subscription-based service where subscribers can stay up to date on crimes in the surrounding area through email notifications.There will most likely be a crime prevention fair in the fall semester, Burba said, with this incident being one of the points of discussion.Load-Date: August 24, 2020End of Document

Munster: Even If China Levies Taxes On iPhones, Your Cost Will Likely Stay The SameBenzinga.comJune 20, 2018 Wednesday 8:28 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Accretive Capital LLC d/b/a Benzinga All Rights ReservedLength: 309 wordsByline: Elizabeth BalboaBodyApple Inc.(NASDAQ: AAPL) CEO Tim Cook is concerned iPhones could be caught in the crossfire of a U.S.-China trade war and jeopardize the 20 percent of Apple revenue exposed to the Asian nation, according to a New York Times report.What To KnowAs yet, the company s safety status is uncertain. President Donald Trump was said to have told Cook that iPhones assembled in China would be exempt from damaging tariffs. However, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro saidTuesday he had no knowledge of such a deal.One Street expert maintains optimism that Apple will elude the potential blow."We don't expect any tariffs to be levied on any iPhones given the extent of campaigning Tim Cook has done with the Trump Administration and separately with the Chinese government,  Loup Ventures managing partner Gene Munster told Benzinga.  It is most beneficial for both governments to leave things unchanged. No Sticker ShockIn the chance that Munster s wrong, some expect a price increase for American iPhone consumers, which could affect sales.But Munster has a more bullish read. He expects a 5-percent increase in the average production cost of the iPhone X from $655 to $690, which he doesn't expect to affect U.S. consumers or iPhone sales. We think Apple would leave the retail cost of the iPhone X unchanged,  Munster said.  Given Apple would likely absorb a 5 percent increase in cost of good, there will be no  sticker shock.  Related Links:Trump's Trade Strategy: Pros And ConsMunster: Buybacks Will Help Distinguish Apple From Its ContemporariesLatest Ratings for AAPLDateFirmActionFromToJun 2018ArgusMaintainsBuyBuyMay 2018Maxim GroupDowngradesBuyHoldMay 2018Morgan StanleyMaintainsOverweightOverweightView More Analyst Ratings for AAPL           View the Latest Analyst Ratings© 2018 Benzinga.com.

Mexican Minister Says Fate Of NAFTA Talks Will Be Clear Within DaysThe FrontrunnerMay 11, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 853 wordsBodyReuters (5/10) reports that earlier today, Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said he "expected to find out within the next two days if a new NAFTA deal with the United States and Canada was possible in the short term." According to Reuters, "As time runs out to secure some kind of agreement, major differences remain between the three members of the North American Free Trade Agreement after more than eight months of negotiations." Reuters goes on to report that "a source close to the talks said US officials have told Canada and Mexico that May 17 or 18 is the deadline for a deal that could be dealt with by the current US Congress." Reuters says "a second source confirmed that those dates had been discussed."Toomey Warns Administration Against NAFTA Ultimatum.Sen. Pat Toomey, in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal (5/10, Subscription Publication, 6.17M), warns the Administration against seeking to pressure pro-trade Republican to support a revised NAFTA agreement that diminishes free trade by threatening to withdraw from the agreement entirely. Toomey warns he would vote "no" in the face of such an ultimatum and argues that the Constitution does not give the President the power to drop out of NAFTA on his own. Toomey calls one Republicans to oppose such a move, acknowledging the political difficulty in doing so but casting it as necessary to avoid economic harm and executive overreach. He concludes that the Administration should instead take the advice of many members of Congress and update NAFTA by expanding trade opportunities.NYTimes: Trump Trade Policies Could Hurt US Automakers.The New York Times (5/10, Tankersley, Swanson, Subscription Publication, 18.33M) reports that, in spite of his rhetoric about reviving the American auto industry, President Trump's trade policy may hurt US automakers, whose chief executives are scheduled to meet with the President on Friday. Due to is "increasingly global" production and sales, "the auto industry is among the sectors most vulnerable to trade disruptions," and Administration "efforts to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, to impose tariffs on imported aluminum and steel and to reduce America's trade deficit with China could limit the reach of companies that produce cars in the United States and depend on access to growing markets outside the country."AP: Chinese Tech Firm's Collapse Evidence Of Brewing US-China Trade War.The AP (5/10, Chan) reports on "the early signs that the widening trade dispute between China and the US is exacting a toll on both sides." The AP notes that on Wednesday, ZTE, "the tech giant, telecommunications equipment and smartphone maker," said "it's ceasing 'major operations' after the US last month banned it from doing business with American suppliers for seven years as a punishment for illegal exports." At the same time, according to the AP, "businesses and officials reported that American products are running into delays in customs clearance because of stepped-up inspections at Chinese ports, suggesting Beijing may be making life tougher for US companies as the dispute drags on."Tightened Chinese Inspections Of US Goods Causing Delays.The Wall Street Journal (5/10, Craymer, Chiu, Kubota, Subscription Publication, 6.17M) reports that increased inspections have US goods piling up at Chinese ports. Business groups say this is the country's way of reminding the US of its market's importance, as well as identifying sectors that could be used to pressure the US to change its polices. The delays are causing concerns that some produce will spoil before it can be sold.Hearing On Proposed US Tariffs On Chinese Goods Extended.Bloomberg News (5/10, Niquette, 4.02M) reports the US extended by two days "a public hearing on the Trump administration's proposed tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods" to accommodate the approximately 130 companies and industry groups who want to testify. "The meetings are part of the process for imposing tariffs...to punish China for its alleged theft of intellectual property and unfair trade practices." While business is "generally supportive of US action to level the playing field on trade and investment with China," many want talks between the two "to focus on resolving differences rather than the pursuit of tariffs."China Clamping Down On Risky Lending.The New York Times (5/10, Stevenson, Subscription Publication, 18.33M) reports, "Faced with the looming consequences of a decade-long borrowing binge, the Chinese government is intensifying its efforts stamp out risky lending and speculative froth," clamping down on its "unruly shadow banking sector," as well as "making public spectacles of the worst offenders." The sentencing of Wu Xiaohui, founder of Anbang Insurance Group, to 18 years in prison caps "a monthslong effort by Beijing to make Anbang an example for other big Chinese conglomerates that borrowed heavily to buy up high-profile trophy assets," and is "the most recent and visible sign" of the government's efforts. Other signs include an increase in companies' load defaults and rising interest rates.Load-Date: May 11, 2018End of Document

RIGHTS GROUP HITS OUT AT DUAL CHECKPOINT PLAN FOR HONG KONGStates News ServiceJune 18, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 754 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:The passage of proposals allowing mainland Chinese law to be enforced within Hong Kong city limits represents an erosion of the city's promised autonomy under the terms of the 1997 handover treaty between Britain and China, a U.S. based rights group said.Hong Kong's Legislative Council passed the proposals into law on June 13, creating a human rights black hole within the city's supposedly separate legal jurisdiction, the New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) said in a blog post on Sunday.Under the plan, Hong Kong law, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and other existing provisions for the protection of human rights, will not apply to part of Hong Kong's West Kowloon railway terminus, or any trains running between Hong Kong and mainland China, HRW China researcher Maya Wang wrote."Instead, Chinese authorities will be able to enforce Chinese criminal law in the heart of Hong Kong," Wang said, adding that Chinese law includes vaguely worded and sweeping national security and public order laws commonly used by the Chinese government to charge its peaceful critics.Offenses such as "creating a disturbance" or "inciting subversion" are frequently used to target dissidents by the ruling Chinese Communist Party, Wang said.Hong Kong's status as a separate legal jurisdiction had until recent years protected its residents and visitors from arbitrary prosecutions carried out for political reasons.But student protesters, pro-democracy lawmakers, and "localist" politicians who want a greater degree of separation from mainland China have been jailed, disqualified, and stripped of office in recent years as Beijing's National People's Congress standing committee has staged a string of high-profile interventions in the city's political life.Last week, former colonial governor Chris Patten hit out at the jailing of localist politician Edward Leung, as being the latest in a series of "politically motivated" convictions in Hong Kong courts.City's status ignoredCritics say the new arrangements for the West Kowloon rail terminus linking Hong Kong to the nationwide high-speed network ignores the city's status as a separate immigration, policing, and customs jurisdiction, enshrined in the terms of its 1997 handover to China, and in its mini-constitution, the Basic Law.The city's Bar Association (HKBA) has hit out at the arrangement, saying it constitutes an irreparable breach of the Basic Law. The city's lawyers say the Hong Kong immigration department, not the mainland Chinese border police, should be in charge of entry and exit control checks for passengers entering and leaving the city, citing Article 154(2) of the Basic Law.Chinese and Hong Kong government officials say the arrangement will streamline the immigration process, however."This is yet another disturbing example of China's blatant disregard for Hong Kong's rule of law," HRW's Wang wrote."This new arrangement, which will facilitate arbitrary detention and unjust prosecutions for exercise of fundamental rights in Hong Kongalongside these other encroachmentsshould be seen as a concerted threat to rule of law and basic rights by Beijing," she said."They may not seem as dramatic as tanks rolling across the border, but the effect is likely going to be the same."The passage of the legislation has prompted calls for the resignation of Legislative Council (LegCo) president Andrew Leung, who set a 36-hour time limit on debating the bill before forcing a vote.Abuse of powerDemocratic Party lawmaker Au Nok-hin said Leung had abused his power as LegCo's speaker to push the legislation through."It sets a very bad precedent for there to be a time limit to members' proceedings in LegCo," Au said. "Many LegCo members ... intended to speak, but [Leung] didn't give them enough time.""I feel that he has acted unreasonably and abused his power."Alvin Yeung of the Civic Party said that while a proposed no-confidence motion against Leung was unlikely to gain traction in a LegCo dominated by pro-Beijing members, it was important to register pan-democrats' protest on the record."We all believe that he violated the rules of procedure," Yueng said. "We also none of us expect the motion to be supported by pro-establishment members, but we believe that everything that can be done, should be done."Reported by Lam Kwok-lap for RFA's Cantonese Service, and by Chen Pan for the Mandarin Service.

TOPIC: TRADE POLICYStates News ServiceApril 9, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1035 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Cato Institute:How To Deal with China's Trade PracticesBy Simon LesterIn a recent Washington Post op-ed on China's trade practices, Fareed Zakaria concludes by saying: "Getting tough on China is a case where I am willing to give Trump's unconventional methods a try. Nothing else has worked." In my view, he gets a number of things wrong in this piece, but he does raise some important issues, and it's a good jumping off point for a discussion of how China actually behaves in its trade policy, and what the possible responses are.Zakaria's main claim is that, "on one big, fundamental point, President Trump is right: China is a trade cheat." Many people say this, or some variation of it. But what exactly does it mean to be a "trade cheat"?What Zakaria seems to have in mind is that China is breaking some World Trade Organization (WTO) rules or taking actions that undermine them. Zakaria refers to the recent Section 301 report by USTR, which he says finds evidence that China "uses formal and informal means to block foreign firms from competing in China's market." According to this report, he explains, "the Chinese government has increased its intervention in the economy, particularly taking aim at foreign companies," and he notes that "[a]ll of this directly contradicts Beijing's commitments when it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001." Later, he elaborates on the Chinese behavior at issue:Look at the Chinese economy today. It has managed to block or curb the world's most advanced and successful technology companies, from Google to Facebook to Amazon. Foreign banks often have to operate with local partners who add zero value essentially a tax on foreign companies. Foreign manufacturers are forced to share their technology with local partners who then systematically reverse engineer some of the same products and compete against their partners. And then there is cybertheft. The most extensive cyberwarfare waged by a foreign power against the United States is done not by Russia but by China. The targets are American companies, whose secrets and intellectual property are then shared with Chinese competitors.The difficulty here is that some of this behavior violates WTO rules, while some may not, as WTO rules don't cover everything. There's a good case to be made that the forced technology transfer imposed on foreign investors does violate the rules; but some of the cybertheft issues may not be covered.For the behavior that is covered by WTO rules, the answer is easy: File more WTO complaints. As my colleague Huan Zhu and I have argued, WTO complaints against China are pretty effective. The system is far from perfect, and sometimes governments do not comply immediately and fully, but overall it works and China complies as well as other governments do.But what about areas that are not covered by the rules? Can China be "cheating" in a more general sense, even if it is not breaking any specific rules, by not behaving "fairly"? One key area, which Zakaria does not mention, is state-owned enterprises (SOEs), which China has a lot of and which often don't behave in a market-oriented way. Unfortunately, the WTO does not have extensive rules on SOEs. The best approach here is to add new trade rules on SOEs, so as to require these entities to behave in a manner consistent with commercial principles. The Trans Pacific Partnership has some detailed rules on this, and although China was not a member of the TPP, there was the possibility that it would join, or that the SOE rules in there could be used as a model for applying such rules to China in a different trade agreement. But the Trump administration pulled out of the TPP, and the opportunity for the administration to push this in relation to China may have been lost for now.A similar issue is that China's tariffs are higher than U.S. tariffs, which is something the Trump administration has complained about. This is true, but it's within WTO rules. The reason China's tariffs are higher is that China was fairly poor during the period (1986-1999) when it was negotiating to join the WTO, and therefore it was allowed to take on fewer commitments in some areas. As part of its WTO commitments, China did agree to lower its tariffs from existing levels, but not by as much as wealthier countries had done over the years in a series of trade negotiating rounds.Since then, of course, China has become wealthier, although it is not nearly as wealthy as the United States. There is a case for China lowering its tariffs further now, but the way to pursue that would be another negotiation. Keep in mind that although China had fewer commitments on tariff reduction, it did take on additional commitments in other areas (so-called "WTO-plus" commitments), so a negotiation of this sort might involve a mix of adding new obligations on China and removing some of the existing ones. That's probably the most politically viable approach to this issue.Putting all this together, there should be two components to efforts to address China's behavior in trade policy: (1) File more WTO complaints, and (2) sit down with China to negotiate new rules (on issues not yet covered, and so that China takes on more liberalization commitments in the areas that are covered). Both of these will work better if the U.S. joins with its trading partners in a coordinated effort.I don't mean to make this sound easy. It would be a lot of work. But Zakaria is missing the mark when he says, "Previous administrations exerted pressure privately, worked within the system and tried to get allies on board, with limited results." When previous administrations brought WTO complaints, the results were usually pretty good. But there were a lot of possible complaints that were not filed, and the negotiating efforts were fairly limited. Perhaps there were reasons for this, such as a reluctance to press China on trade because the U.S. wanted China's help on foreign policy issues. But it sounds like now the Trump administration is elevating trade concerns to the fore. If so, there are plenty of opportunities to press China within the system, or to expand and improve that system.Load-Date: April 9, 2018End of Document

The 4th China-Israel Investment Summit to be held in China's Zhuhai in JulyPR NewswireJune 13, 2018 Wednesday 10:50 PM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 547 wordsDateline: ZHUHAI, China, June 13, 2018 BodyOn the back the great results of the 3rd summit achieved last year, with the guidance and support of the responsible Chinese and Israeli government agencies, the International Cooperation Center of the National Development and Reform Commission of China and the Zhuhai municipal government will host the 4th China-Israel Investment Summit in Zhuhai between July 2 and 3, 2018.

2 ETFs for Investing in the Fast-Growing Robotics SectorRealMoneyApril 15, 2018 Sunday 2:00 PM EDTCopyright 2018 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1590 wordsByline: MoneyShow.com .Highlight: Welcome to the age of investing in robotics and cobots (robot co-workers).BodyInvestors can own a basket of successful Japanese robotics firms through two exchange-traded funds writes  , editor of Investors Alley's   and frequent contributor to  .  , The Market Cap When most of us think of robots, we think of the friendly pair of R2-D2 and C-3PO in Star Wars. Or more darkly, of dangerous androids from the Terminator movie series.The reality is that the Age of Robotics is already upon us... the future is here. Robots of all kinds are already among us. Think Alexa, drones and driverless cars.And let's not forget about the tiniest of robots that are reminiscent of the 1966 science fiction film Fantastic Voyage. In February, researchers from Arizona State University and the National Center for Nanoscience and Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences injected nanobots made from a folded sheet of DNA into the bloodstream of mice. These nanobots targeted the blood vessels around cancerous tumors, injecting them with blood-clotting drugs to cut off their blood supply. According to the study, published in Nature Biotechnology, the treatment was successful in shrinking the tumors and inhibiting their spread.There are also a growing number of robot co-workers known as collaborative robots or cobots. Consider Amazon  and its many fulfillment centers around the world. In 2012, it bought robotics start-up Kiva for $775 million. Today, there are more than 100,000 of Kiva's machines globally working in conjunction with Amazon employees, alleviating not only mundane but also potentially hazardous tasks such as lifting a heavy load.It isn't a stretch to think that cobots will become the norm in many industries around the world. But that doesn't mean people will lose their jobs. The industry with the highest usage of robots - the automotive industry - continues to have rising employment globally.There is a certain logic to this. Researchers at MIT found that robot-human teams were about 85% more productive than either humans or robots alone! And the robot technology manager at the Danish Technology Institute, S&oslash;ren Peter Johansen, says that automating the simplest 80% of a production process is significantly cheaper than a fully automated solution. The remaining 20% of the work will be done by human co-workers.Adding robots to the workforce will turn out to be a win-win situation.Robots: The Next GenerationThe prior generation of an average industrial robot cost about $120,000 to install. That served as a damper on the growth of the industry. But now, the newer generation of industrial cobots cost only about $35,000 to install. And they require very little time for training, unlike the old-school robots that needed a programmer to set it up.The old-school robots have been used mainly by the auto industry, with little uptake from other types of manufacturers. That's why sales of cobots are still a very small part of overall global industrial robot sales, accounting for only about 5%.I don't have to tell you that this means there is a very large remaining market that is wide open for the introduction of next-generation cobots. That line of thought is supported by a 2017 study from Research and Markets that forecast that the cobot market will grow by more than 40% annually over the next five years.This growth will be sped along by the continuing drop in price for industrial robots. According to research from ARK Invest, by 2025, robot costs will drop by about 65% to only $11,000. All thanks to technological advances in machine learning, machine vision and connected sensors.Some question whether falling prices for robots will adversely affect companies selling robots. Based on history, the answer is no. During the past decade, robot prices have dropped by about 40%. Yet, gross margins for the world's leading robot manufacturers such as ABB ,Fanuc and Yaskawa Electric have actually been stable to improving.China Leading the WayNot surprising to me is the fact that China is leading the way in this robot revolution. Robotics is one of the industries among the government's ambitious Made in China 2025 program whose aim is to position the country at the forefront of new manufacturing technologies.Despite the recent imposition of U.S. restrictions on technology transfers to China, the country is feverishly automating its factories in response to a labor shortage, rising wages and growing macroeconomic confidence. A forecast from the International Federation of Robotics predicts that from 2018 to 2020, sales of robots in China will jump between 15% and 20% annually.The main driver of this growth in China is its electrical and electronics industries. Among these industries are the semiconductor and battery manufacturing sub-sectors, which are also a focus of the Chinese government's Made in China 2025 plan for its economy's future.However, at the moment, China is not the leader in robot technology and neither is the U.S. The leader, as it has been for decades, continues to be Japan.Japan Says Doumo Arigatou to ChinaAccording to a November 2017 report from the International Federation of Robotics (IFR), Japan delivers 52% of the world's supply of industrial robots. The production capacity of Japanese suppliers hit 153,000 units in 2016, the highest level ever recorded. Japan also exported a record number of robots (115,000) in 2016 that were worth an estimated $2.7 billion.Many of these robots were exported to China. That country, since 2013, has become the largest buyer of industrial robots. In 2016 alone, sales soared by 27% to 90,000 units -- a single country record. The IFR estimates that robot sales in China will rise to 160,000 units in 2019. In other words, China's automating of its factories has been and continues to be a bonanza for Japanese robotics companies.In 2018, thanks to China, Japanese production of industrial robots will grow by 10% and hit for the first time ever the 1 trillion yen (about $9 billion) level. This follows a very robust 2017 when output soared 30% to about 900 billion yen. Robot exports from Japan to China soared nearly 58% to 227.5 billion yen, accounting for 40% of all of Japan's overseas robot exports.These numbers come from the Japan Robot Association. Its chairman, Fanuc CEO Yoshiharu Inaba, said in January, "Output could reach 2 trillion yen in three to five years if things go smoothly." He added, "Demand will expand for more than five years. The 2 trillion yen mark is probably just a checkpoint." By the way, Fanuc is the world's largest maker of industrial robots.Besides Fanuc, other Japanese beneficiaries of China's robotic revolution include Yaskawa Electric, Mitsubishi Electric  and Kawasaki Heavy Industries  .For example, let's look at Yaskawa. China currently supplies a quarter of its consolidated sales, yet the company plans to grow its Chinese presence even more. Besides selling its own robots, Yaskawa will sell machine controllers and servomotors (key components for robot control) to several leading Chinese robot manufacturers. This program will be similar to the Intel Inside campaign in that Yaskawa is considering allowing Chinese firms to use the Yaskawa brand and sales channels when they sell robots containing its parts abroad.Importantly, as part of this program, Yaskawa will offer controllers and servomotors for the types of robots that the company does not build, such as SCARA (selective compliance assembly robot arm) robots, as a way to prevent competition with its own products.Robot InvestmentsYou may be wondering what is the best way to invest into this fast-growing sector. One good option is to buy a company like Yaskawa Electric. Even though it trades over-the-counter here in the U.S., its ADRs (American depositary receipts) are fairly liquid.The other option is to own a basket of these Japanese robotics firms through an exchange-traded fund. Two such ETFs are the Global X Funds Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF  and the ROBO Global Robotics & Automation Index ETF  .The most important difference between the two are the differences in their portfolios. BOTZ has a more concentrated portfolio, with only 29 stocks versus the 93 stocks in the ROBO portfolio.Another major difference is the geographic exposure of the two funds -- with my preference for exposure to the leaders in the industry, which are Japanese -- here BOTZ has the upper hand with about 51% of the fund in Japanese stocks versus only 28% for ROBO.However, when it comes down to the actual stocks in the portfolios, both are outstanding. Here are the top 10 positions for each ETF:Top 10 Positions for the Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETFNvidia    Keyence Corporation (Japan)    Yaskawa Electric (Japan)    Intuitive Surgical    Fanuc Corporation (Japan)    Mitsubishi Electric (Japan)    ABB Ltd. (Europe)    Hyundai Robotics Company (South Korea) Omron Corporation (Japan)    Daifuku Company (Japan)    Top 10 Positions for the ROBO Global Robotics & Automation Index ETFHiwin Technologies (Taiwan) Harmonic Drive Systems (Japan) Krones AG (Germany) Keyence Corporation (Japan)    Yaskawa Electric (Japan)    Zebra Technologies    Fanuc Corporation (Japan)    Daifuku Corporation (Japan)    Omron Corporation (Japan)    Oceaneering International    Over the past year, the two funds have gained 38.52% and 29.88%, respectively, both easily outperforming the S&P 500 index. With the bright future I see for the robotics industry, I expect the outperformance to continue for many years.-- This article was originally published on April 12.Load-Date: April 26, 2018End of Document

China opened robotic bank branch in ShanghaiCE Noticias Financieras EnglishApril 24, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 348 wordsBody A bank owned by the Chinese government opened an automated branch that is equipped with facial recognition software, a virtual reality room, a hologram machine, talking robots and touch screens to pay bills for public services and quotas of the Communist Party, among other functions. .  The subsidiary opened last week in the Huangpu district, in downtown Shanghai, and is touted as the first "robotic bank" in China.  China Construction Bank, based in China, says that the high-tech branch aims to provide a more convenient, personalized and efficient banking. It also reflects the growing competition from digital payment systems that seek to hoard the banks' market.  A robot welcomes customers at the entrance and answers questions using speech recognition software. Clients can pass their official IDs to enter the bank - or scan their faces using the facial recognition device. The machines located in the interior allow users to buy gold, exchange currency or track real estate investments through virtual reality viewers.  The bank is not completely robotized. There are still security guards and a room equipped with teleconferencing equipment allows VIP clients to request help from human employees located in other facilities.  The news about the modern branch spread rapidly in social networks, which attracted hundreds of curious people. Tiang Ting, employed in the finance sector, said she was impressed after touring the facilities on Friday.  "Nowadays, people are less inclined to want other people to come and bother them," Tiang said. "We hope to reach a bank where we can interact with the machines.  China Construction Bank, owned by the state, was founded in 1954 to finance large-scale infrastructure projects, is the second largest bank in the world in terms of its assets, and is an unlikely technological pioneer.  Analysts say the bank responds to pressure from Internet giants such as Alibaba and Tencent, who are transforming consumer finance in China with mobile applications that allow people to transfer funds and pay for their items using their smartphones. Load-Date: April 24, 2018End of Document

Our future projects will also benefit from a likely significant decline in prices for equipment and construction in the second half of 2018. Furthermore, commercial/industrial electricity prices are higher in the eastern provinces in which our DG projects are mainly deployed. We believe the lower equipment cost and stable electrical rates will enable us to find unsubsidized net-metered and self-consumption projects atgrid paritywith reasonable rates of return. We believe net metering and self-consumption projects could experience tremendous growth in the second half of 2018. Distributed generation in China will continue to be an important growth driver for us over the long-term."Li added, "Importantly, China DG is only one driver of our growth. Our China business complements our extensive pipeline of high quality projects around the world. We anticipate significant declines in module prices that will benefit our overseas projects by increasing returns and thus project values. ReneSola has steadily built business momentum since the divestiture of the manufacturing business, and we are confident growth can continue. As a result, we are raising our guidance for Q1 revenue to a range of $40 to $45 million, which is well ahead of the $30 to $35 million we originally expected."About ReneSolaFounded in 2005, and listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 2008, ReneSola (NYSE: SOL) is an international leading brand of solar project developer and operator.

Boozman: Urging Caution on TariffsTargeted News ServiceApril 18, 2018 Wednesday 7:22 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 611 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe office of Sen. John Boozman, R-Arkansas, issued the following weekly column:The benefits of free and fair trade are numerous. Our economy grows when American manufacturers, agricultural producers and small businesses can fairly compete in today's global marketplace. Americans are safer when we have strong trading partners who are in our corner. When fair trade agreements are negotiated with nations that are not natural allies, it enables us to not only trade goods, but ideas. The last point is particularly salient when it comes to our current impasse with China.When it comes to playing by the rules of fair trade, there is no doubt that China is a bad actor. Among other things, the Chinese government has subsidized its steel and aluminum production, blocked importation of certain U.S. agricultural products and imposed significant trade barriers to hurt foreign pharmaceutical companies. By engaging in widespread theft of trade secrets and intellectual property, China has earned the label of "the world's principal IP infringer."In an effort to protect American workers and force China to comply with proper trade practices, President Trump has threatened to impose as much as $150 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods. I certainly agree with the president's goal, but I have serious concerns about the means to achieve it.It's important to note the same commitment to protect American workers and promote America's economic interests has led the president to join with us to pass historic tax reform and cut regulatory red tape. These efforts have unleashed economic growth. I fear applying broad tariffs would be a setback.There is no doubt that American businesses lack a level playing field in China. However, that can be accomplished without descending into a full-fledged trade war. I'm wary that we could be heading in that direction as the Chinese government has responded with its own proposed tariffs hikes, including some that could hit Arkansas farmers especially hard.Agriculture is Arkansas's number one industry. Soybeans, our state's largest row crop, are among China's targets for proposed tariffs. Arkansas is the 10th largest soybean producing state and approximately 50 percent of our crop is exported. Other Natural State products like cotton, corn and beef are also on the proposed tariff list, while pork exported to China is already facing a 25 percent tariff.For the past five years, Arkansas farmers and rural families have been struggling with low commodity prices, high input costs and non-tariff barriers to trade. Now, additional retaliatory tariffs could become part of that list. This amounts to kicking farmers when they're already down.We can appropriately hold China accountable for its unfair trade practices without holding our agricultural industry hostage. I will continue to express to the administration how important it is to help ensure that our nation's farmers, ranchers and producers do not suffer while we work to establish responsible, reciprocal trade with China and our other trading partners across the globe.Fair trade deals, when properly negotiated, should be given a chance to succeed. If one partner is not acting in good faith, the chance at success is significantly impaired. I support the president's goal of getting China to comply with its obligations and remain hopeful that can be accomplished while avoiding an all-out trade war. The escalation in trade rhetoric alone is negatively affecting markets and creating uncertainty. We need to continue to build off the economic momentum of the tax cuts and regulatory reforms, not stifle it.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6252755 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: April 19, 2018End of Document

Widow of late Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo in desperate plea for helpCNN WireMay 3, 2018 Thursday 7:50 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 584 wordsByline: By Steven Jiang, CNNDateline: BEIJING (CNN) BodyBEIJING (CNN) --  The widow of the late Nobel peace laureate Liu Xiaobo has made a desperate cry for help, friends say, as the Chinese government refuses to let her travel abroad for medical treatment nearly 10 months after her husband's death."Xiaobo is gone and there's nothing in the world for me now," Liu Xia on Monday told a longtime friend, who posted her words in a detailed Facebook post along with an audio clip of an earlier conversation."It's easier to die than to live. For me, using death to fight back can't be any simpler."Liu Xiaobo died of lung cancer last July in a hospital in northeastern China, a month after he was granted medical parole from a 11-year prison sentence for "inciting subversion of state power." His conviction in late 2009 stemmed from his co-authorship of a manifesto calling for human rights and political reform in China.Liu Xia's friend, Liao Yiwu, a prominent Chinese writer who now lives in Germany, wrote he was devastated to hear Liu Xia's condition, and wanted to put a spotlight back on her eight-year ordeal, which began when Liu Xiaobo won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 while in prison.In a seven-minute recording of an April 8 phone call uploaded by Liao, Liu Xia, who friends say has been suffering severe clinical depression for years, could be heard sobbing and crying throughout the audio clip, with periodic outbursts of deep frustration."You can record this now: I'm so ... angry that I'm ready to die here," she said. "If I'm dead, it'll all be done with."CNN was not able to reach Liao for comment. A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman on Thursday responded to a question about Liu Xia's status, saying that she is "a Chinese citizen and competent authorities will deal with relevant issues in accordance with law."The Nobel committee awarded Liu the peace prize in 2010 for "his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China" -- a move that infuriated Beijing, prompting the authorities to place Liu Xia under de facto house arrest, where she has remained ever since.After Liu Xiaobo was quickly cremated and buried at sea, the international community -- including US and European officials -- has repeatedly called on President Xi Jinping and his Communist government to free Liu Xia, who has never been accused of any crimes.Friends and activists say, for a while, Liu Xia seemed to be given limited freedom -- allowed to visit a bookstore and talk to a few friends and diplomats from her home phone -- even though she remained under round-the-clock surveillance from state security agents and was denied access to a computer or mobile phone.Despite vague promises from Chinese officials, though, Liu Xia appeared to grow distraught in recent weeks as her hope of leaving China soon was dashed again, with friends saying she increasingly turned to cigarettes, sleeping pills and anti-depressants to get by."You can hear her fear, desperation and even breakdown in the audio clip," said Hu Jia, a leading Chinese human rights activist who has known Liu Xia for years and has served prison terms for his own advocacy. "As her friends, we feel her pain and helplessness.""The Communist Party is clearly not ready to open her prison gate and her shackles," he added. "We are so afraid of her choosing to commit suicide -- how many clinically depressed people have to endure eight years of suffering while facing up to an all-powerful state?"TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

House Passes Pittenger's Landmark BillTargeted News ServiceJune 26, 2018 Tuesday 8:02 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 536 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyRep. Robert Pittenger, R-North Carolina, issued the following news release:Today, the U.S. House of Representatives passed Congressman Robert Pittenger's (NC-09) landmark legislation to modernize the national security review process of potential foreign investments in the United States.Chinese investment in the United States increased more than 900 percent between 2010 and 2016. Much of this investment was part of a strategic, coordinated Chinese government effort to target critical American infrastructure and defense applicable technologies.The Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA, H.R. 5841), strengthens how the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) reviews the national security risks of potential foreign investments."For over two years, we have fought for CFIUS reform and the implementation of stronger policies to combat strategic and disruptive Chinese activities. Today, I am grateful that the House is taking action on this issue. This landmark legislation will take enormous steps to improve our foreign investment review process to prevent further transfers of military applicable technologies to the Chinese government."Companion legislation was included in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which passed the Senate on June 18th, 2018. FIRRMA is expected to be included in the final NDAA conference report.BACKGROUNDThe Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) is the only government mechanism to ensure potential foreign investments do not harm our national security. However, CFIUS has not been substantially updated in many years.Congressman Pittenger and Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-TX) introduced FIRRMA on November 8th, 2017. The legislation has been publicly endorsed by the White House, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Senate and House Intelligence Chairs Richard Burr and Devin Nunes, and hundreds of defense experts, generals, elected officials and private businesses.The Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act:- Allows CFIUS to review sensitive non-controlling investments involving countries such as China, Russia, and state sponsors of terrorism.- Puts special emphasis on investments that could release U.S. citizens' personal data or reveal sensitive information on critical technologies or critical infrastructure to potential adversaries.- Allows CFIUS to review the purchase or lease of real estate near U.S. military installations, as well as government properties that are sensitive for national security reasons, and land at air and sea ports.- Requires that export controls be calibrated and regularly updated to support continued U.S. leadership in science, technology, engineering, manufacturing, and other sectors critical to the industrial base.- Closes gaps in U.S. export controls that could permit the transfer of cutting edge technologies - like artificial intelligence and advanced semiconductors -China and other countries of concern.- Provides explicit authority for an interagency process to identify and appropriatelyCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6348773 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: June 27, 2018End of Document

Today, I am grateful that the House is taking action on this issue. This landmark legislation will take enormous steps to improve our foreign investment review process to prevent further transfers of military applicable technologies to the Chinese government."Companion legislation was included in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which passed the Senate on June 18th, 2018. FIRRMA is expected to be included in the final NDAA conference report.BACKGROUNDThe Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) is the only government mechanism to ensure potential foreign investments do not harm our national security. However, CFIUS has not been substantially updated in many years.Congressman Pittenger and Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-TX) introduced FIRRMA on November 8th, 2017. The legislation has been publicly endorsed by the White House, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Senate and House Intelligence Chairs Richard Burr and Devin Nunes, and hundreds of defense experts, generals, elected officials and private businesses.The Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act:Allows CFIUS to review sensitive non-controlling investments involving countries such as China, Russia, and state sponsors of terrorism.Puts special emphasis on investments that could release U.S. citizens' personal data or reveal sensitive information on critical technologies or critical infrastructure to potential adversaries.Allows CFIUS to review the purchase or lease of real estate near U.S. military installations, as well as government properties that are sensitive for national security reasons, and land at air and sea ports.Requires that export controls be calibrated and regularly updated to support continued U.S. leadership in science, technology, engineering, manufacturing, and other sectors critical to the industrial base.Closes gaps in U.S. export controls that could permit the transfer of cutting edge technologies like artificial intelligence and advanced semiconductors -China and other countries of concern.Provides explicit authority for an interagency process to identify and appropriately###Load-Date: June 27, 2018End of Document

PACIFIC ? These five companies own the futureCNNMoney.comJune 1, 2018 Friday 3:37 PM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: TECHNOLOGYLength: 1787 wordsByline: Dylan ByersBodyWhat's Next: The Trans-Pacific Gilded Age: Five of the world's biggest companies are expanding their empires, consolidating control and moving ever closer to a monopoly or duopoly status that threatens to squash competition and give them unchecked influence over the most essential business and consumer services.Sign up for PACIFIC: The new CNNMoney newsletter about the center of change and innovationThe five companies -- Alibaba, Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook and Tencent -- are at the forefront of a new Trans-Pacific Gilded Age in which US and Chinese companies wield immense influence over commerce and trade. They are also likely to have immeasurable influence over politics, given their spending power and lobbying resources, and culture, given the infiltration of their products and services into nearly every aspect of our lives.We believe their power is unlikely to be checked in either country, because the Chinese government supports their rise and the US government isn't going to impose tough regulation right now. We also agree with the McKinsey Global Institute's assessment that these companies have a long-term "insurmountable advantage" because of their ability to invest heavily in future technologies like AI and robotics.The Latest ..."Tech's Titans Tiptoe Toward Monopoly" by WSJ's Christopher Mims:? Facebook, Alphabet and Amazon are enjoying "profit margins, market dominance and clout that, according to economists and historians, suggest they're developing into a new category of monopolists."? "They may not yet be ripe for such extreme regulatory action, but as they consolidate control of their markets, negative consequences for innovation and competition are becoming evident."? "Apple is considered more vulnerable to competitive disruption, despite the fact that it tops the tech world in revenue, profit and market capitalization.""Chinese Giants Make America's Look Tame" by NYT's Raymond Zhong:? Tencent and Alibaba "are ratcheting up their no-holds-barred contest to dominate the ways 770 million internet users communicate, shop, get around, entertain themselves and even invest their savings and visit the doctor."? "China's internet titans have a powerful ally [in] the Chinese government. Tencent and Alibaba have avoided antimonopoly clampdowns by staying in Beijing's good graces ... Their sheer size also makes them easier for the authorities to control."The Big Picture: The new Gilded Age is global, split between tech companies in the world's two biggest economies. As they compete for control of Asia, Africa, Latin America and Europe, their wealth and influence will balloon to levels even more unthinkable than the levels they're at now.---Today's PACIFICDetails about Apple's WWDC conference are continuing to leak ahead of the June 4 keynote. Apple is reportedly working on an initiative called "Digital Health," which enables users to monitor how much time they're spending on their devices. It's also reportedly looking to expand its digital advertising business with a new network for apps.Spotted at last night's Warriors-Cavs nail-biter: Apple CEO Tim Cook ... and Apple SVP Eddy Cue, who gave up his usual seats to sit with friend and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver ...---State of Surveillance: Google to end 'Maven'JUST IN: "Google will not seek another contract for its controversial work providing artificial intelligence to the U.S. Department of Defense for analyzing drone footage after its current contract expires," Gizmodo's Kate Conger scoops.? "Google Cloud CEO Diane Greene [told employees] Google would not choose to pursue Maven today because the backlash has been terrible for the company ... adding that the decision was made at a time when Google was more aggressively pursuing military work."? "The company plans to unveil new ethical principles about its use of AI next week."? "Thousands of employees ... signed a petition asking Google to cancel its contract for the project, nicknamed Project Maven, and dozens of employees have resigned in protest."The Backstory: The move comes just days after The New York Times that the Maven project was creating internal strife at the company.The Big Picture: As we wrote two days ago, the growing public awareness and concern about big tech's government contracts is likely to become a public relations crisis for America's tech giants because that work seems to conflict with their stated moral values.Sign up for PACIFIC: The new CNNMoney newsletter about the center of change and innovation---Zuck Watch: Facebook's next: TV newsFacebook is on the verge of announcing a new batch of news shows for its Watch platform, per WSJ's Deepa Seetharaman and Lukas Alpert:? "The push for news shows, which will be a mix of daily and weekly formats, is part of Facebook's 'broader push to help reliable information drown out fabricated articles and rumors on the platform.'"? "Possible shows from Shepard Smith of Fox News, CNN, WSJ, BuzzFeed and NowThis, among others."? Facebook is financing the shows and asked potential partners "to detail their ethical standards, including corrections policies, people familiar with the talks said."Facebook has also announced it will shut down its trending topics section.The Big Picture, via my colleague Seth Fiegerman: "Facebook [is] rethinking how news is presented on its platform after more than a year of criticism over fake news and election meddling."The Bigger Picture: The majority of US Facebook users use the platform as a source for news and information, according to Pew Research. The Watch feature has immense potential to burnish Facebook's news credibility and expand the reach of media outlets' programming.About that shareholder call...Facebook shareholders went hard on Zuckerberg and other top Facebook execs over data privacy, election meddling and corporate governance at the company's annual shareholder meeting Thursday.Scenes from the Circus, via Fiegerman:? Christine Jantz, chief investment officer at NorthStar Asset Management: "If 'privacy is a human right,' as stated by Microsoft's CEO, then we contend that Facebook's poor stewardship of customer data is tantamount to a human rights violation."? Another attendee asked if Facebook's board would "commission a study to evaluate the impact on shareholder value of breaking up Facebook's business line" given recent regulatory scrutiny into the company's data practices.? Outside the meeting space in Menlo Park, California, a group called Freedom From Facebook flew a plane carrying the banner: "You broke democracy."---Sounding Board: Spotify's long-term problemThis week at Code Conference I put a very simple question to Spotify founder Daniel Ek about the long-term viability of his company:? "Your biggest competitors are three out of the four biggest market cap companies in the world" -- Apple, Amazon and Google.? "Fundamentally, the content you're offering is the same."? "You don't have a mobile phone, you don't have home devices. So in the longterm, what is to stop Apple, Amazon, Google from basically pushing you out of the market by virtue of the fact that they can bring this music to scale to more people?"Ek:? "Well, I think when you look at that, about the competitive set that we have, I think you could almost universally say that's true about all internet companies."? "The way we think about it though, is one of their real important things is that it remains ... that these platforms remains open."? "When we compete on equal terms with all of these companies, we tend to do pretty well. So that's our focus, is keeping this platform open because we think it's in the interest of customers and obviously we know that we do well when that's the case."In other words ... Ek didn't exactly address the question. At some point Apple, Amazon and Google could be able to box Spotify out because they can offer the same content -- music -- to their users in a more seamless way. That, or one of these three companies buys Spotify.We have yet to hear a reasonable explanation for why that's not the end game.The Big Picture: Even an extraordinarily successful company like Spotify is vulnerable to the overwhelming power of the big tech giants.Bonus: Spotify has changed its "hate conduct and content" policy, again.Sign up for PACIFIC: The new CNNMoney newsletter about the center of change and innovation---Valinsky's LinksSoftbank looks for its next leader (FT)Amazon's AWS fuels its expansion (WSJ)Lyft nears its next acquisition (The Information)Delta pumps $2 billion into LAX (CNBC)Elon Musk rips Boeing (Fortune)---Retail Wars: Walmart's 'Prime Now'What Jeff Bezos is reading: "Walmart's new startup: Text anything and get it delivered within a day," by PACIFIC's Jordan Valinsky:? "The company is launching Jetblack, a new personal shopping service that lets customers order items via a text message with same-day or next-day delivery."? "For now, the invite-only service is only available in parts of New York City and costs a hefty $50-a-month."? "Walmart is positioning the service for 'time-strapped urban parents' that delivers items from Walmart, Jet, Saks Fifth Avenue and other New York shops."The Big Picture, via Valinsky: Walmart and Amazon are at war for consumers both at home and abroad. Jetblack is part of Walmart's 'two-Americas' strategy: Promoting non-Walmart branded companies like Jet, Bonobos and ModCloth to attract urban dwellers while boosting its own website with grocery delivery and expanded inventory.Sign up for PACIFIC: The new CNNMoney newsletter about the center of change and innovation---Talk of Tinseltown: Could DOJ beat AT&T?The Unconventional Wisdom, via NYT's James B.

Trump says 'nothing has happened' with ZTECNN WireMay 16, 2018 Wednesday 2:42 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 549 wordsByline: By Betsy Klein, CNNDateline: WASHINGTON (CNN) BodyWASHINGTON (CNN) --  President Donald Trump on Wednesday dismissed criticism that he was caving to China's trade demands to save Chinese telecommunications company ZTE.The President touched off a new controversy over the weekend when he announced on Twitter that he was working with Chinese President Xi Jinping to give ZTE "a way to get back into business, fast," adding that he had instructed the US Commerce Department to "get it done.""Nothing has happened with ZTE except as it pertains to the larger trade deal," Trump tweeted Wednesday, singling out The Washington Post and CNN for their coverage. "Our country has been losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year with China."He continued, "We have not seen China's demands yet, which should be few in that previous U.S. Administrations have done so poorly in negotiating. China has seen our demands. There has been no folding as the media would love people to believe, the meetings haven't even started yet! The U.S. has very little to give, because it has given so much over the years. China has much to give!"On Tuesday, Josh Rogin, who also is a CNN contributor, wrote in The Washington Post that Trump "(undermined) his own objectives for no visible gain." Trump's weekend tweet signaled a potential shift in administration policy heading into a week of high-level trade negotiations between the US and China. Washington and Beijing have threatened to impose tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of each other's products, fueling fears of a full-blown trade war. ZTE said last week that it halted its main operations after the Trump administration banned American companies from selling it vital components.Last month, the US Commerce Department blocked American firms from selling parts or providing services to the Chinese company, which makes smartphones and other telecommunications equipment. The ban was put in place after Washington said ZTE violated a deal in which the Chinese company agreed to pay a $1.2 billion fine for evading US sanctions on Iran and North Korea. But ZTE has also long been the target of scrutiny for regulators and officials in the United States, which is wary of its ties to the Chinese government. The company's controlling shareholder is Shenzhen Zhongxingxin Telecommunications Equipment, a Chinese state-owned corporation.One 2012 congressional report about ZTE and Huawei, another huge Chinese tech company, said the companies "cannot be trusted to be free of foreign state influence and thus pose a security threat to the United States and to our systems." Both companies strongly disputed the report's findings.Trump's tweet on Sunday was quickly met with bipartisan criticism."#China intends to dominate the key industries of the 21st Century not through out innovating us, but by stealing our intellectual property & exploiting our open economy while keeping their own closed. Why are we helping them achieve this by making a terrible deal on ZTE?" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, tweeted Tuesday.And Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, tweeted that Trump "should care more about our national security than Chinese jobs."CNN's Jackie Wattles, Sherisse Pham, and Daniel Shane contributed to this report. TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Rep. Gaetz Issues Statement on Protecting American InvestorsTargeted News ServiceMay 29, 2018 Tuesday 7:40 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 591 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyRep. Matt Gaetz, R-Florida, issued the following statement in response to the steps President Trump has taken to protect American inventors, entrepreneurs and innovators from China's trade practices, market manipulation and intellectual property theft:"I commend President Trump for taking action against China's ruthless and unfair trade practices, as well as its state-sponsored theft of American innovators' intellectual property. For too many years, China has pursued trade practices and business policies that make it impossible for foreign companies to compete on a level playing field with Chinese companies. These policies, like its "Made in China 2025 policy," hurt American companies and limit economic growth worldwide."In August of 2017, Dr. Neal Dunn (FL-02) and I held a field hearing in Tallahassee: Wanton Loot -- How China is Stealing Ideas from American Entrepreneurs. This hearing featured a panel of experts on Chinese trade and industrial policy. We learned about the many ways in which China consistently and deliberately steals American technology, then profits from it. China's clear violations of patent and trademark law undermine American entrepreneurship. We also heard specific examples of alleged Chinese misconduct from Dean Minardi, CEO of Florida-based Bing Energy. A Chinese investor in his company absconded with intellectual property that had taken years to develop."IP theft costs the US economy over 225 billion dollars a year. The greatest perpetrator is China, and as a member of the Subcommittee on Intellectual Property, I applaud the bold steps President Trump is taking to address this troubling issue. China is one of America's largest trading partners; their predatory behavior is unacceptable."China is engaging in a systematic and multifaceted strategy to steal intellectual property. Beyond the economic costs, this theft presents significant concerns for national security. The majority of Chinese companies that steal or benefit from stolen intellectual property are state-owned. The Chinese government is known for using their military's cyber capabilities to hack into private US tech firms, stealing IP, then transferring the technology to state-run companies who profit from its development."Following the field hearing, I had the opportunity to speak with senior White House officials about this crucial issue facing America. I am pleased that these conversations were productive, and that many of the recommendations we received from scholars and entrepreneurs are being put forth as official policy. Over the past several months, President Trump has been taking concrete steps to address the critical issue of China's aggressive IP theft and unfair trade practices, which have cost America billions, if not trillions, of dollars in lost revenue and thwarted economic opportunities."For too long, Presidents of both parties have failed to curb China's wanton disregard for international law and IP rights. President Trump's "America First" policies are a much-needed step in the right direction, and a victory for American innovation and creativity. America does not need a playing field tilted in its favor; our products are the best in the world, and American manufacturers only need to compete on a fair and level playing field in order to succeed. President Trump is leveling the playing field for the first time in well over a generation, and his actions will help American businesses thrive in today's fast-paced global environment."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6309503 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: May 30, 2018End of Document

'I Hope You Can Help Me;' Daughter of Missing Lawyer Pleads with MerkelChristian NewswireMay 28, 2018 Monday 7:30 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Christian Communication, LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 892 wordsByline: By China Aid Association, Inc.BodyChinaAid, 432-689-6985 office, 432-553-1080 media,            media@chinaaid.orgBEIJING, China, May 28, 2018 /           Christian Newswire/ -- The daughter of a Christian human rights lawyer who has been missing in China since August of last year pled with German Chancellor Angela Merkel to use her current trip to China to help her locate her father.Photo: Grace Geng (right) sits with lawyer He Junren at a press release during the launch of her father's book, Unwavering Convictions -- (Photo: ChinaAid)In a letter published to ChinaAid President Bob Fu's Facebook page, Grace Geng, the daughter of human rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng, described to Merkel how her father has suffered repeated kidnappings, torture, and imprisonment for his legal defense of Christians and practitioners of Falun Gong, a peaceful spiritual practice encouraging "truth, compassion, and tolerance." Both faiths have been repeatedly targeted as threats to the government, even though most of their devotees live peacefully and abide by the law.The government started targeting Gao in 2005, when they revoked his lawyer's license and ordered him to close his practice. In December 2006, authorities convicted him of "inciting subversion of state power" and handed him a three-year prison term with a five-year probation. For unknown reasons, he was released soon afterwards.In 2007, Gao was arbitrarily held in police custody for 50 days. Afterwards, he published an article titled "Dark Night, Dark Hood, and Kidnapping by Dark Mafia," describing the various tortures he underwent.Due to the immense threat to their family, Gao's wife and children fled to the United States in January 2009, but Gao remained in China. Less than a month later, police seized him in his home, and he didn't resurface until March 27, 2010, when he was allowed a brief stint out of prison. He spoke to family and friends and shared his story with international reporters. On his way home from his in-laws apartment in Xinjiang in mid-April, officials kidnapped him again, and no one knew his whereabouts until Chinese state mouthpiece Xinhua News Agency reported on Dec. 26, 2011, that he had supposedly violated the terms of his parole and would serve a three-year prison term in Xinjiang. After spending three excruciating years behind bars, Gao was released but subjected to strict surveillance in his home in Shaanxi province, where he had difficulty eating due to the condition of his teeth after the harsh period in prison. He was not allowed to see a dentist.While under house arrest, he secretly penned a book, which ChinaAid helped out of the country and secured a publishing deal with the American Bar Association and the Carolina Academic Press. It is available for purchase here.In mid-August, two sympathizers, Li Fawang and Shao Zhongguo, helped Gao escape his minders and hid him at a vacation spot in the neighboring Shanxi province. For just more than three weeks, they successfully evaded detection until police officers from Shaanxi organized a large number of officers to cross the border to find him. Once in police custody, Gao vanished, and both Li and Shao were criminally detained. Weeks later, Beijing officials claimed they had Gao in the custody of secret agents within the city, but no one has seen him, and ChinaAid has been unable to verify their claims.Geng's letter can be read in full below.ChinaAid, which exposes abuses suffered by Chinese dissidents such as Gao, joins Geng in urging Chancellor Merkel and other leaders in the free world to pay urgent attention to his case and press their contacts in the Chinese government for his release in order to ensure the nation respects human rights and rule of law.    Dear Chancellor Merkel,My name is Grace Geng. I am the daughter of Gao Zhisheng, the missing Chinese human rights attorney. My father has been missing in China for 284 days now. I learned that you are about to visit China. I am urgently asking you to help find my father, who has been forcefully disappeared in China.My father is concerned about the rights of the vulnerable groups in China, such as the rights of Christians and the persecuted Falun Gong believers. As a result, he has been jailed and brutally tortured numerous times over the past 12 years. He has also been missing many times: the longest period was 21 months. He was confined alone in a small, dark cell that had no windows for a long time. His teeth were knocked out or fell out due to the beatings and lack of nutrition.After he served his jail term in 2014, he was confined in a small village in his hometown. With barely a few teeth left, he could not eat properly or talk normally, but he was never allowed to see a dentist.He is once again missing and has been so since mid August of last year, and we have had no news of him for the last 284 days.My mother, my brother, and I-as well as all of our relatives-are very worried. My uncle sought help from all the local police stations but got no result. He also hired two lawyers to inquire about my father's whereabouts in Beijing but still got nowhere.Dear Chancellor Merkel, I hope you can help me despite your busy schedule. I am very concerned about my father, who has already suffered so much from such severe torture.I sincerely appreciate your help. I wish you a wonderful trip to China!Grace GengDaughter of Gao ZhishengMay 23, 2018Load-Date: May 28, 2018End of Document

The Philadelphia Housing Sector Index was down more than 1.3% Friday afternoon.In economic news:Stocks reversed course again, snapping two days of gains, after President Donald Trump helped rekindle trade tensions by saying he is considering another round of tariffs on China after the Chinese government retaliated against a second set of China-specific sanctions by this week proposing tariffs on additional US products.Largely lost in the renewed trade talk Friday was nonfarm employment growing significantly below Wall Street expectations in March, with employers adding just 103,000 new workers last month, trailing the upwardly revised 326,000 new hires in February and also lagging expert opinion looking for a 175,000 increase in March payrolls. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.1%.Among financial stocks moving on news: - BlackRock (BLK) was tilting lower on Friday, steadily losing ground during Friday trading, following reports the asset manager will introduce five new mutual funds that won't have anything to do with rifles, pistols and other types of guns. The new funds will largely try to mirror the movements of the major stock market indices such as the S&P 500 and the Russell 2000, but will leave out "all producers and large retailers of civilian firearms," a BlackRock spokesperson told CNN Money. BlackRock said it was responding to customer demand for gun-free investments. It also will explicitly exclude gun makers and sellers from some of its existing environmental, social and governance funds, which already rarely include gun makers.In other sector news:+ Colony NorthStar (CLNS) was narrowly higher in Friday trading after the real estate and investment manager said, through its Colony Industrial unit, it has purchased the Enterprise Industrial Park in San Antonio, Texas, paying $52.1 million for the two building, class A complex totaling 639,797 square feet. The property currently is 88% rented to nine tenants with a weighted average of 5.3 years remaining on their leases.+ Gramercy Property Trust (GPT) was edging higher Friday, rising less than 1%, after saying it has completed the first transactions for its e-commerce joint venture, buying six newly built, class A bulk distribution structures on four properties for $537 million. Each building will be fully occupied by an e-commerce company signed to a 15-year lease with rent rising between 1.75% to 2.00% annually, on average. Price: 523.69, Change: -14.71, Percent Change: -2.73Load-Date: April 7, 2018End of Document

At last look, shares of tech companies in the S&P 500 were sinking over 1.2% in value while the Philadelphia semiconductor index was posting a more than 1.5% decline.Among technology stocks moving on news: - Kyocera (KYO) was slumping Friday, sliding more than 3% lower, after the Japanese technology company said it filed a complaint in a regional court in Dusseldorf, Germany against German auto-parts supplier Preh, alleging it infringes a Kyocera patent protecting its haptic feedback technology containing a virtual reality innovation enabling real-touch sensation on any human-machine interface. Kyocera holds patents on this technology in multiple countries and Friday said it has offered Preh several opportunities to license its "All-in-Touch" multimedia interface for automobiles although the two companies so far have been unable to strike a deal. In other sector news:- Netflix (NFLX) has turned lower Friday afternoon, giving back a more than 3% advance that followed reports the streaming video service is looking to soon make its largest acquisition ever, paying around $300 million for a southern California outdoor billboard company. The target company, Regency Outdoor Advertising, owns billboards throughout the Los Angeles region, including the Sunset Strip, which is dressed up with splashy outdoor advertising by the entertainment industry. Netflix currently has around 117.6 million global subscribers and has been expanding its marketing efforts to attract more viewers, industry analysts told Reuters. - Amazon (AMZN) was down almost 1% Friday afternoon, reversing a small gain earlier in the session for the online retailer that followed reports it has been looking to develop a person-to-person payments feature with its Alexa personal assistant. If successful, the move would bring the retailer into direct competition with Square (SQ), PayPal's (PYPL) Venmo and big-bank consumer-payments systems, according to the Wall Street Journal. Amazon also has dicussed creating a checking-account product with JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM), the newspaper said.Price: 54.94, Change: -1.77, Percent Change: -3.12Load-Date: April 7, 2018End of Document

Wilbur Ross: US exploring other remedies for ZTE banCNNMoney.comMay 14, 2018 Monday 6:43 AM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: COMPANY NEWSLength: 505 wordsByline: Donna BorakBodyThe Trump administration may give ZTE a way out.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross says the administration is exploring "additional remedies" to its harsh punishment of the Chinese smartphone maker.Last month, the United States blocked ZTE from buying parts from American companies for seven years. The Trump administration said ZTE had broken its agreement to punish employees who violated US sanctions against North Korea and Iran.On Sunday, President Trump signaled the US should reverse the penalty."President Xi [Jinping] of China, and I, are working together to give massive Chinese phone company, ZTE, a way to get back into business, fast," Trump tweeted on Sunday. "Too many jobs in China lost. Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done!"Ross, speaking at the National Press Club, said ZTE "did do some inappropriate things. They've admitted to that.""The question is: Are there additional remedies to the one we had originally put forward?" he said. "And that's the area we will be exploring very, very promptly."Ross said he wouldn't be surprised if the issue came up during high-level talks this week with Chinese counterparts. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, the country's top economic official, is visiting Washington this week to continue trade discussions with top administration officials."Our position has been that's an enforcement action, separate from trade," Ross said, referring to ZTE.But a few hours later, Trump suggested on Twitter that ZTE is indeed about trade."ZTE, the large Chinese phone company, buys a big percentage of individual parts from U.S. companies," he said. "This is also reflective of the larger trade deal we are negotiating with China and my personal relationship with President Xi."The Trump administration is seeking various concessions from the Chinese government, including removing tariffs on agricultural products, in exchange for easing restrictions on ZTE, according to a Commerce Department official familiar with the discussions.Another possible concession the Chinese could make: removing barriers for US chipmaker Qualcomm to acquire NXP Semiconductors NV ? a deal Chinese regulators were holding up, the source said.The official described a possible deal with ZTE as a "confidence building measure," leading up to broader deal with China. But warned that discussions between the two parties are fluid.The US initially fined ZTE $1.19 million in March 2017 for violating sanctions against Iran and North Korea. But it then went a step further to impose a seven-year ban on US companies buying and selling ZTE products.White House principal deputy press secretary Raj Shah on Monday defended the president's move when asked whether the president was using ZTE as leverage to gain China's cooperation on North Korea."It's part of, again, the US relationship with China, which is complex. It has economic factors, it has national security factors, this is just one of many factors," Shah told reporters at a briefing.? CNN's Cristina Alesci contributed to this report.Load-Date: May 16, 2018End of Document

Widow of late Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo in desperate plea for helpCNN.comMay 3, 2018 Thursday 3:50 AM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: ASIALength: 567 wordsByline: By Steven Jiang, CNNDateline: Beijing BodyThe widow of the late Nobel peace laureate Liu Xiaobo has made a desperate cry for help, friends say, as the Chinese government refuses to let her travel abroad for medical treatment nearly 10 months after her husband's death."Xiaobo is gone and there's nothing in the world for me now," Liu Xia on Monday told a longtime friend, who posted her words in a detailed Facebook post along with an audio clip of an earlier conversation."It's easier to die than to live. For me, using death to fight back can't be any simpler."Liu Xiaobo died of lung cancer last July in a hospital in northeastern China, a month after he was granted medical parole from a 11-year prison sentence for "inciting subversion of state power."His conviction in late 2009 stemmed from his co-authorship of a manifesto calling for human rights and political reform in China.Liu Xia's friend, Liao Yiwu, a prominent Chinese writer who now lives in Germany, wrote he was devastated to hear Liu Xia's condition, and wanted to put a spotlight back on her eight-year ordeal, which began when Liu Xiaobo won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 while in prison.In a seven-minute recording of an April 8 phone call uploaded by Liao, Liu Xia, who friends say has been suffering severe clinical depression for years, could be heard sobbing and crying throughout the audio clip, with periodic outbursts of deep frustration."You can record this now: I'm so ... angry that I'm ready to die here," she said. "If I'm dead, it'll all be done with."CNN was not able to reach Liao for comment. A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman on Thursday responded to a question about Liu Xia's status, saying that she is "a Chinese citizen and competent authorities will deal with relevant issues in accordance with law."The Nobel committee awarded Liu the peace prize in 2010 for "his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China" -- a move that infuriated Beijing, prompting the authorities to place Liu Xia under de facto house arrest, where she has remained ever since.After Liu Xiaobo was quickly cremated and buried at sea, the international community -- including US and European officials -- has repeatedly called on President Xi Jinping and his Communist government to free Liu Xia, who has never been accused of any crimes.Friends and activists say, for a while, Liu Xia seemed to be given limited freedom -- allowed to visit a bookstore and talk to a few friends and diplomats from her home phone -- even though she remained under round-the-clock surveillance from state security agents and was denied access to a computer or mobile phone.Despite vague promises from Chinese officials, though, Liu Xia appeared to grow distraught in recent weeks as her hope of leaving China soon was dashed again, with friends saying she increasingly turned to cigarettes, sleeping pills and anti-depressants to get by."You can hear her fear, desperation and even breakdown in the audio clip," said Hu Jia, a leading Chinese human rights activist who has known Liu Xia for years and has served prison terms for his own advocacy. "As her friends, we feel her pain and helplessness.""The Communist Party is clearly not ready to open her prison gate and her shackles," he added. "We are so afraid of her choosing to commit suicide -- how many clinically depressed people have to endure eight years of suffering while facing up to an all-powerful state?"Load-Date: May 4, 2018End of Document

Cyberattack Shows Vulnerability Of Gas Pipeline Network; Good Samaritans Rescue Stranger From Fiery Aurora Crash; Global Stocks Up As Tariff Tensions Ease; Facebook CEO Will Testify Before House And Senate Panels Next WeekMORNINGS WITH MARIA MORNINGS WITH MARIA 8:00 AM ESTApril 5, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; FinancialLength: 8406 wordsByline: Maria Bartiromo, Kristina Partsinevelos, Adam Shapiro, Connell McShane, Stuart Varney, Hillary Vaughn, Pete HegsethGuests: Lee Zeldin; Scott Wren, Larry KudlowBodyMARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Welcome back. Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Thursday, April 5th. Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast. A wild ride for stocks on Wall Street. Stocks recovering from steep losses yesterday. Losses at the open but finished the day sharply higher at the close. The Dow rallied more than 700 points from the session low to finish up 230 points on the session. Investors were concerned after China unveiled plans and a list of products that will be tariffs on more than 100 American goods including soybeans and airplanes despite the fears though, the White House standing firm in President Trump's commitment to fixing the company's trade deficit.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: We're very lucky that we have the best negotiator at the table in the President. We're hopeful that China will do the right thing. China created this problem, not President Trump. But we finally actually have a President who's willing to stand up and say enough is enough, we're going to stop the unfair trade practices.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Futures are indicating another gain at the start of trading this morning as the momentum from the close continues. Dow Industrials expected to be up 60 points, a quarter of a percent higher. NASDAQ also up about 50 points right now, up three-quarters of a percent. Monsanto earnings just hitting the tape. A miss on earnings, as you can see, 322 a share versus 330 expected. The stock will check in a moment but check European indices right here and we are looking at gains across the board. European markets are higher with the FT up 1-1/2 percent. And the DAX Index right now up 2-1/4 percent. Revenue on Monsanto also a miss by the way. Asian markets higher with the exception, of course, Hang Seng and China were closed for a holiday but the Nikkei Average in Japan up 1-1/2 percent, KOPSI in Korea up 1-1/4 percent.A huge mistake, that from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologizing yet again as the company reveals a number of Americans who have their exposed was actually nearly double what the company first reported. The very latest blunder as Zuckerberg prepares to testify before lawmakers on Capitol Hill next week. 87 million people. Another day -- another day to breach to report, what you need to know as both Delta Airlines and Sears warn customers that their credit card data may be in danger.Nunes is on the attack. Why the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee is threatening legal action against both the FBI and Department of Justice. The stonewalling continues. And shocking footage out of Illinois this morning. Good Samaritans rushed toward the scene of an accident and pull a man from a fiery crash. More on these heroes coming up this morning.Then riding in style. What it will cost you to get behind the wheel of a different BMW every month? Hot stuff. All those stories coming up this Thursday morning. And joining me to break it all down. Fox Business Network's Kristina Partsinevelos, Iraq and Afghanistan war veteran and Fox News Contributor Pete Hegseth and former Presidential candidate, former Arkansas governor, Mike Huckabee. Great show so far guys.KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Yes.MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR: Thank you.BARTIROMO: It was fun.HUCKABEE: I've never been in a BMW for one month, let alone.(CROSSTALK)HUCKABEE: Come and see me (INAUDIBLE) and put you in one of those for just 199.99.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Well, we got a lot on the table this morning. Joining the conversation, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow is going to talk with us about what's happening on economic policy, from trade to tariffs and tax policy as well. Also, House Financial Services member and New York Congressman Lee Zeldin is here. Don't miss a moment of it. We kick it off this hour with this. Investors are eyeing the fallout from tariffs tit-for-tat between the U.S. and China as President Trump heads to West Virginia today to tout tax cuts. Adam Shapiro is at the White House covering the story. He got the very latest. Adam, good morning to you.ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria. The President will be in Sulphur Springs, West Virginia. It's his fourth trip to that state and he's going to be meeting with people and employers who have benefited from the tax reform bill that enacted last year. And how they have experienced not only in some cases, the $1000 bonuses but the increase in wages. So they're going to be talking about the benefits of tax reform. Let's talk about trade. Joni Ernst, the Senator from Iowa, Farm State, worried about the tariff China might impose said this. There is a real danger that increased tariffs on U.S. exports will harm Iowa producers and undermine the rural economy. It's my hope that the Trump administration will reconsider these tariffs and pursue policies that enhance our competitiveness rather than reduce our access to foreign markets. The administration has been saying for quite some time that they believe China has more to lose than the United States. Maria, back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Adam. Thank you so much. Adam Shapiro with the latest there at the White House. Joining me right now, House Financial Services and Foreigner Affairs Committee member Congressman Lee Zeldin of New York. Congressman, good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.REP. LEE ZELDIN (R), NEW YORK: Happy to.BARTIROMO: What's your reaction to all of this? The trade dispute, this back-and-forth between China and the U.S.?ZELDIN: The President is trying something new. Obviously the status quo isn't working. The President during the campaign said that he was going to be taking action with regards to the patent infringement and the trade deficits that exist. The President did spend over a year -- first year in office, building a relationship with the Chinese leader. Hopefully all of that work that was done on his part and others with his administration will be able to bear fruit because both sides right now are putting a lot of specific threats of putting up walls, but what is also happening at the same time and Larry Kudlow is going to be a great asset to the President and it's great that he's come on the show to talk about it. At the same time, Larry Kudlow is able to be speak to his counterparts with the Chinese government and try to get what is the ultimate goal here is actually both sides of bringing down walls even though right now what we're seeing are specific threats of walls going up.BARTIROMO: So, you're not worried it sounds like. Are you in the camp and feels this is just a negotiating tool that the two sides work it out because markets are acting a little nervous about it.ZELDIN: The President's goal is to have both sides at the end of the day be bringing down walls to be able to have more balance in the relationship between our two countries and our two economies. A trade is incredibly important for the United States. The President has support from a whole lot of people who work at manufactures where they are exporting products for our United States companies that want to grow many of them, view 97 percent of the opportunities being abroad as supposed to here in the U.S.So, I believe that the President, his goal here is not to just keep building up walls, but I think ultimately he's looking for leverage. He's the ultimately dealmaker and built relationships beforehand. He has the right people around him for a battle like this. And I'm hoping that it will yield the results we're looking for. Now, we don't want it to go on too long because what can ultimately happen at the end of the day is even if you're getting China to bring down some of its walls if it takes too long in a way both sides will lose.BARTIROMO: Congressman, let me switch gears because President Trump and apparently the leadership in the House is considering forcing votes to cut billions of dollars from the $1.3 trillion funding deal, the omnibus deal. White House officials working closely with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and other Republicans on the rescission package. Would you support this effort?ZELDIN: I think this is great. We absolutely have to do it. I did not vote for the budget caps agreement about a month ago, I did not vote for the most recent omnibus bill that passed. Where we are spending hundreds of billions of dollars more over the course of a couple years that quite frankly we just can't afford. I don't like the idea that in order to spend a dollar on something that is imperative for us to do our constitutional duty of providing for the national defense, that we have to spend the multiple dollars on all sorts of other things. They're totally unrelated because Senator Schumer knows how to abuse the filibuster and use it as leverage to affect -- effectively get money out of the process that we can't afford. So, this is something that I strongly support. It's actually is imperative. It really isn't an option for is not to do this.BARTIROMO: And when do you think we'll get clarity on it in terms of what spending gets cut?ZELDIN: Well, for one, there, you know, the President doesn't have to spend even, you know, with me executive branch, they don't have to spend every dollar that's appropriated to them. So from one standpoint, a Congress won't need to act for the executive branch to find efficiencies and to be able to just return money to the treasury and have money that gets to pay down and what our deficits that we're seeing in perpetuity if we don't crack down on this. As far as Congress goes we're going into another appropriations process.BARTIROMO: Right.ZELDIN: The big question is ultimately was Senator McConnell, Senate Republicans going to deal with filibuster rule? They'll say that -- and to a certain extent, I mean, there -- it's true, they'll see that you'll -- the filibuster rule has helped us more in the minority that it will hurt us in the majority. I would argue that you won't ever have a budget again, you won't have an appropriations process in the Senate until you change it because the minority has figured out how to abuse it.BARTIROMO: So, apparently there is Section 107 of the ICA providing for floor consideration of a rescission bill by the Senate, it means that the question of whether or not they take it up, maybe decided by a majority vote on a non-debatable motion. So, you could actually get this done because it requires only 50 votes in the Senate, not 60, is that right?ZELDIN: Yes. If the -- if the senate can bring this us privilege , it would only require 50 votes, the Vice President can be the tiebreaker, so one, if every Democrat voted no, you can only lose one Senate Republican and as we saw in healthcare in August, when Senator McCain gave a thumbs- down instead of a thumbs-up, you know, literally one Senate Republican can be the difference between having the largest entitlement reform that this country has seen in a generation.BARTIROMO: Yes.ZELDIN: Even at 51 points, it's still close.BARTIROMO: The margins are small but getting to 50 obviously a little easier than 60. So, we'll watch that. I want to get your take on Facebook, Congressman, because Mark Zuckerberg obviously set to testify before House Energy and Commerce Committee next Wednesday as the company is now saying that the data of 87 million users were shared with Cambridge Analytica. Should the company be regulated?ZELDIN: The first step is for Facebook as Mark Zuckerberg comes in next week is for Facebook to talk about what they're going to do to regulate themselves. For them to talk about exactly what took place and answer members' questions both Republicans and Democrats, we're going to be asking questions where we are going to learn more about not just the data breach but also of Facebook. Additional regulation is something that I would expect to happen however, you know, for a company like Facebook, additional regulation ends up becoming a mote for -- between them and the competition.Remember, J.P. Morgan Chase referring to Dodd-Frank as a mote between themselves and the competition. So, what we don't want to do is, you know, trying to figure out how to regulate a really large company like Facebook that can afford it, that goes over abroad and ends up resulting in less innovation and competition and the next Facebook, the next great idea is never even able to grow because in order to actually get into the industry, they're going to have to have a whole compliance department before they make their first -- a huge compliance department before they --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Is it more problematic -- sir, is it more problematic to see the data misused or the fact that some of these technology companies control what we see. Should the regulation be around ensuring that people are seeing everything and not just what is chosen by technology companies for us to see?ZELDIN: I think it's very important for consumers to be able to know exactly what of their personal information is going to get shared. There needs to be more transparency to expect a new user of a particular social media service to read through a very long legalese document that really even after you read it, you still don't know everything of your data that's being shared. That's something that you need to make more progress. That needs to become easier. Now --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: OK. So that's more onerous. Yes. I want to --ZELDIN: Yes. We're talking about Facebook here. Go ahead.BARTIROMO: Well, no. I'm going to switch topics on you.ZELDIN: Yes. Well, we talk about Facebook -- OK.BARTIROMO: No, please, go ahead. Finish your thought, sir.ZELDIN: Yes. While we're talking about Facebook which is, you know, this is something that's very important for us to flush out. Right now on the internet with our smartphones, with the multiple ways that we're able to track people's locations to certain apps to have been downloaded, the cookies that get set on to our computers when we go from one Web site to the next. It should really be no surprise that our data, this isn't just an issue with Facebook. It's all over the internet and to all of our smartphones.BARTIROMO: The stock continues to move higher this morning. It's up 3-2/3 percent pointing out for our audience. Devin Nunes, Chairman of House Intel Committee threatening to take legal action now, Congressman, against Department of Justice and the FBI for what he says is a failure to turn over documents related to the investigation into the Trump campaign. Congressman, would you support Nunes' subpoena for these documents?ZELDIN: I totally support Chairmen Nunes. He has been leading the charge on this effort. It's very important that while you have a special counsel that exists, investigating the President and his family for winning an election without any evidence they committed, any crime to win an election at the same time we have all of this actual evidence of misconduct at the highest levels of the DOJ and FBI with regards to FISA abuse. How and why the Clinton probe ended. How and why the Trump-Russia probe began. So Chairman Nunes is trying to get information from the DOJ and the FBI with regards to the how and why the Trump-Russia probe began and he's getting stonewalled and Chairman Nunes is someone who, you know, he takes his job very seriously, that information gets provided and he knows how to keep what needs to be confidential but there needs to -- there needs to be more cooperation between us and the Justice Department.BARTIROMO: Congressman, thank you. Thanks so much. Lee Zeldin, good to see you, sir.ZELDIN: You too.BARTIROMO: We will see you soon. We will be right back. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A cyberattack targeting the country's natural gas pipelines. Connell McShane with the story. Connell?CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes. Hey there, Maria. It's -- this cyber attack force to get at least four of the natural gas pipeline operators to shut down their electronic communications with customers over the last week at this point. It's not clear, whether any customer data was actually stolen and gas service was not interrupted. Experts say though that the attack highlights the vulnerability, a big picture of the nation's energy system. There are about 2.5 million oil gas and chemical pipelines across the country.A fiery crash in Illinois prompted a couple of good Samaritans to jump into action. This is dash cam video showing a 34-year-old man being pulled out of a burning car. The man who took heroic action was across the street and came running when he saw the crash. Another good Samaritan was there as well to pull the driver even further out of harm's way. The driver has been charged with a DUI but suffered only nonlife-threatening injuries.Now we have a story about BMW launching a monthly subscription service giving customers unlimited access to its new models. This starts the subscriptions service at $2000 per month, it's called Access Available for the X5 SUV for the 4 series and for the 5 series, sedans as well from BMW which says the fee includes insurance, maintenance, and roadside assistance. Customers use an app where they can request a vehicle and they can then switch the vehicles as often as they wish, it debuted yesterday, the service did in Nashville.And purchasing Square Capital's future as a private hedge fund is now in doubt. The Wall Street Journal with the story this morning saying that Bill Ackerman's firm is losing investors at a rapid pace. The majority of the investors the story says asking for their money back. There are big losses on bets you might remember. The drug maker valiant pharmaceuticals is one of those big bets where they lost out Herbalife as well costing the firm billions of dollars over the course of the last three years. Ackman is not giving though. He has his partners are said to plan to buy $300 million of the firm's stock signaling a believe maybe in the value of the portfolio. Those are your headlines, Maria.BARTIROMO: All right, Connell. Thank you. We'll take a break. When we come back. President Trump headed to West Virginia today to talk about a potential second round of tax cuts. National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow weighs in on the upcoming roundtable meeting coming up. And then economists are expecting 193,000 new jobs added to the economy in the month of March. The unemployment rate is expected to tick down one-tenth of a percent to four percent. We break down all the expectations ahead of tomorrow's big report. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We are watching markets this morning amid a back-and-forth over trade and the head of the job's report tomorrow. Futures currently indicate a gain at the start of trading up 90 points on the Dow, up 14 on the S&P and up 60 points on the NASDAQ. Comes after a wild ride yesterday. Joining us now to talk more about markets and investing today. Scott Wren, a senior global equity strategist with Wells Fargo Investment Institute. Scott, good to see you.SCOTT WREN, SENIOR GLOBAL EQUITY STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT INSTITUTE: Good morning, Maria.BARTIROMO: How do you invest in all those market volatility?WREN: I tell you, it has been a wild ride and, you know, we've been trying to get our clients to do. You know, retail investors are general and general, have been underinvested in stocks for, you know, years and so our outlook is good, it's not great, we're looking for 2.9 GDP, we're looking for the CPI to crawl up a little bit to 2.4. So that, you know, that's a good outlook which means that on these pullbacks, we want our clients stepping in and, you know, that's easier said and done when, you know, the markets, you know, trade in, you know, 1,000 and 800-point range in the S&Ps and a 70-point range on a day but we've tried to encourage them to think a little bit more like traders. It would be a little bit more nimble.In other words, if they have cash on the sidelines that they want to dedicate to the stock market. When you have these pullbacks and your outlook is good, you need to find levels to get in. And so, we've talked to them a lot about, you know, 100-day moving average and obviously, you know, yesterday was all about the 200-day moving average. It was the same thing on Monday. We ran through that, we ran a lot of stops, we didn't see any follow-through which we expected. So, we've been trying to encourage them to look at some of these technical levels and step in at those points.PARTSINEVELOS: Scott, this is Kristina speaking right now. What do you think about Federal Reserve interest rate hikes and what that means for multiples especially going forward?WREN: Well, for us, you know, hiking cycles traditionally, you know, that's a multiple contraction kind of a story and if you look at the multiple last year, you know, it was near 20, we're, you know, we're well below that right now, so we've seen a little bit of contraction of course, earnings estimates jumped up due to this new tax code but I think the Fed is going to hike two more times this year. The market certainly isn't pricing in four. You know, we've argued really for the last 12 months or more that anything more than three hikes in 2018 is a mistake. I still think the Federal Reserve making a mistake is the biggest risk out there, not a trade war. I think that's a pretty low probability. So, the Fed -- 2018 in the end I believe is going to be all about what the Fed does and it's probably going to be that way in 2019 as well.BARTIROMO: Interesting that you only see three hikes even though this economy is booming. We got a jobs report out tomorrow, we're looking for 193,000 jobs added to the economy last month, unemployment rate almost in full employment at four percent. And then when the doorstep of earnings where people are expecting 16-1/2 percent profit growth for the S&P 500. You put new money to work ahead of all of that.WREN: You know, we would and I tell you, Maria, here's the thing, for the next six months at least in a row, tomorrow when that number comes out, you know, the biggest nugget of information is going to be what happened to year-over-year average hourly earnings. How much did that change? It's expected to be 2.7. Of course on February 2nd we when we heard the January report, you know, that higher than expected 2.9, I mean, that -- in my mind, that triggered the 10 percent pullback. So, you know, the market is very sensitive to wages.If we would see 3.0 print tomorrow, I mean, it is not going to be a good day in the market and I don't think that's going to happen. You know, anything below, you know, 2.8 or below I think -- I think is friendly toward the market but there is a lot going on, there is going to be continue to be a lot going on, you know, there's four or five things that the markets really concerned about but to me the bottom line is what's wage pressure -- what's going to happen with wage pressure, what's going to happen with general inflation and how is the Fed going to react? A lot of this other stuff is noise. You need to focus on what is actually going to drive the market over the course of, you know, not a day or two but what's going to drive the market over the course of the next 12 months or so.BARTIROMO: All right. Nice clarity there, Scott. Appreciate it. Good to see you, sir. Thank you.WREN: Thanks, Maria. Have a great day.BARTIROMO: You too. Scott Wren joining us there. Remember, stay with us and stay tuned for our coverage of jobs in America tomorrow, 8:00 a.m. Eastern. We're going to identify where the jobs are and tell you about wage growth as well. First though, the National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow will join me next live. He's weighing in on tariff negotiations with China. President Trump's tax plan and growth coming up next. And then, Facebook under fire. CEO Mark Zuckerberg's new strategy after revealing up to 87 million users may be affected by the data scandal. Back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Good Thursday morning. Welcome back, everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Thursday, this morning, April 5th. Your top stories 8:30 a.m. on the east coast, Markets extending gains this morning. Futures indicating a rally at the start of trading to the tune of 70 points on the Dow Industrials, 50 points higher on the NASDAQ, after a wild day on Wall Street yesterday. The Dow swinging more than 700 points from the low to the high of the session as fears over trade wars with China eased by the close.In Europe, gains across the board this morning. Take a look at the European Indices, where the FT-100 is up 1-2/3 percent, the CAC Quarante is up two percent, and the DAX Index at the high of the morning, up 2-1/4 percent right now. In Asia overnight, Japan and Korea were higher, markets in Hong Kong and China closed for a holiday.A bit of a mergermania on Wall Street. Intercontinental Exchange, the parent of the New York Stock Exchange announcing it will acquire the Chicago Stock Exchange. The price of the deal not disclosed. We are looking at ICE's, Intercontinental Exchange's chart. And as you can see, it has been going higher in the last year.A pullback on spending, President Trump is working on a deal right now to rein in some spending from the $1.3-trillion omnibus bill he signed last month. Plus, Monsanto under pressure, the company reporting weaker-than- expected earnings and revenue. The stock is down, fractionally. Then, Mark Zuckerberg says sorry, again, Facebook reveals nearly 90 million people had their data exposed, almost double what the company initially told us. The jobs' report is out tomorrow. Economists are expecting a job growth of 193,000 added to the economy last month. The unemployment rate is expected to edge lower to four percent even. We are talking about almost full employment. Kristina, this number tomorrow is important --PARTSINEVELOS: It is.BARTIROMO: -- in terms of the backdrop.PARTSINEVELOS: Right. And this number was revised. Originally, it was 195, now it's 193. We haven't seen this unemployment number either since 2000, that low at four percent, so the economy is doing very, very well right now, and that's being reflected in the numbers, not as high as the previous month. So, we need to (INAUDIBLE) that. Some are saying it's because of the weather, but --PETE HEGSETH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: That is my question, is there -- I mean, 195 strong number, but a softening certainly from 313 last month and a 3-month average of about 240,000. I don't know enough to know what that -- where it comes from but --BARTIROMO: Typically, the first-quarter is slower than other quarters just because, think about it, in the fourth-quarter, we've got the holidays. Everyone spent a lot of money on Christmas or what have you. And then, in the first-quarter, they pay the bills.HEGSETH: Sure.BARTIROMO: So, the first-quarter is typically slower, and we did see a little bit of a slowdown in terms of broad economic growth in the last couple of months. Still though, these are very strong numbers. And you mentioned wage growth earlier. I thought it was interesting was Scott Wren said. He said a three percent number would be a problem for markets, but 2.9, 2.8 percent not so much.HEGSETH: So, wage increase has become a problem for the markets.BARTIROMO: Because it is looked at as inflationary, and it is looked at as the cost to earnings, which of course, has been the great story of the Markets, earnings growth double digits.MCSHANE: Good problem to have then.BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly. You're right. And by the way, with the better economic backdrop comes higher wages.HUCKABEE: I would say set your (INAUDIBLE) next Wednesday, April 11th, Mark Zuckerberg is going to be testifying before Congress. It may exceed the Roseanne ratings because it's going to be much must-watch television, for sure.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, we'll see what happens. I think you made really an important point earlier when you said it's also how they structure what we see.HUCKABEE: Yes.BARTIROMO: Because that's an issue I know for Congress, that's something that they're looking at.PARTSINEVELOS: Algorithm, right.BARTIROMO: It's not just the data, but these algorithms that allow you to see news and not see other news.HUCKABEE: And what people need to realize is that a lot of people get most of their news now, over 50 percent of the American population get their news from Facebook, not from television, not from newspapers, they get their news from Facebook. So, if Facebook --PARTSINEVELOS: And the other apps, too. Don't forget them.HUCKABEE: Yes. But if they are manipulating the news and giving me a particular slant that I'm not getting the news, I'm getting opinion.HEGSETH: It's like a modern-day nightly newscast. You think you're getting it from an unbiased source, but you're not.HUCKABEE: Yes.HEGSETH: I also talked to editors from conservative Web sites, they say they're one tweak away on an -- one tweak in the algorithm away from going out of business some time. Their ad revenue is dependent on Facebook, and Facebook decides to move, but there's Breitbart or any sort of conservative Web site. There's a serious challenge to their business scheme -- and that's my alarm.(LAUGHTER)HEGSETH: Maybe that's telling me to just wrap it up.BARTIROMO: No, that's funny. You know, I didn't realize it was that important to some of these Web sites.HEGSETH: Very important to these Web sites. They need the traffic and the traffic goes through Facebook and Facebook could control that.BARTIROMO: All right. We will keep watching that. And obviously, next week is going to be important for Zuckerberg. We want to look at President Trump's agenda, Washington and Beijing are starting to negotiating a new normal on trade. The White House has remained tight-lipped on when the tariffs will go into effect.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SANDERS: We're in the review process right now, but certainly, we expect China to make changes, and stop the unfair trade practices that they participated in for decades.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The tariffs will take effect.SANDERS: Again, I'm not going to give -- I just said I'm not getting ahead of the review process but I would anticipate that if there are no changes to the behavior of China and they don't stop the unfair trade practices then we would move forward.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: This comes as President Trump is headed to West Virginia in just a few hours for a roundtable event on tax cuts and jobs. Joining me right now is the director of the National Economic Council, Larry Kudlow. Larry, it's great to see you. First off, a friend of yours for a long time. Congratulations, Larry. I love to see this new job for you.LARRY KUDLOW, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL: Thank you, Maria, thanks always. You're a great pal. We were co-anchors together in another network.BARTIROMO: Yes, we were and it was really a beautiful thing. Let me -- let me ask you this, Larry, because we want to talk about trade. Yesterday, you made some really important point to Stuart, and I think it turned the entire market around, frankly, when you told us that this was the beginning of a conversation with China, and the beginning of basically coming to the table. What do you want to see out of this, Larry?KUDLOW: Well, look, the essential point that the President has been working on for quite some time, and you heard Sarah Saunders refer to it, you've got these unfair trading practices -- by the way, in WTO terms, many of them are illegal trading practices. And, you know, you know the list, it's stealing technology, or transferring technology, stealing our intellectual property rights. They have high tariffs, They've got main barriers, there's not near enough market access for, you know, foreign countries like the USA, so all that stuff has got to be discussed, negotiated, and eventually changed, eventually changed. And there is a process here, there's going to be some back-and-forth but there's also some negotiations, and we may talk about that, but that's the key point.Look, end of the day, China's unfair and illegal trading actions are damaging to economic growth for the U.S., for China, and the rest of the world. They are preventing a much stronger global economy and they're doing damage to American exports and, you know, the President, he's the first guy with the backbone in decades, Maria, to actually go after it, not just you know, whisper but to go after it with at least preliminary actions.BARTIROMO: Well, you're right. I mean, we all get this on China because we know that they've been stealing our intellectual property for a long time and putting all these restrictions in place. Do you want to see the same kinds of restrictions in terms of China being allowed to invest in American industries? I mean, I know that there are like 10 industries in China that are off limits, they won't allow an American business to own more than 49 percent of a joint venture, that's the kind of restrictions you'd like to see here in America?KUDLOW: Well, look, I don't like to see restrictions, but as part of this potential deal, and I think we are going to get a deal over a period of time. Yes, I think these barriers will come down on both sides. And that's a key point for the President, he understands perfectly well, that economies do better when trading barriers are reduced rather than raised. You know, the tit-for-tat idea really doesn't work in economic terms over a period of time, and that includes market openings, and as you noted, that includes investment decisions as well. At the moment, the USA is properly wary of China. And of course, the technology transfers and the hacking and the cyberspace hacking is part of that. Now, that could be changed, and fixed, I hope it will, but all that is on the table.BARTIROMO: Larry, I always refer to you as a growth guy. You always -- as long as I know you have focused on economic growth, supply-side economics, Reagan White House -- so let me ask you what's possible, knowing what the President has already put in place in terms of this tax cut reform as well as the rollback in regulations, we're talking about 2.9, 2.7 percent growth so far. What kind of growth number would you like to see or is possible for '18 and '19, Larry?KUDLOW: Look, I think it's possibly, Maria, to be in the three to four percent growth zone. The last three-quarters which is really Trump's first year in office. The last three-quarters, we picked up from under two to 3.1 percent at an annual rate. Now, three-quarters is not a lifetime, I get that, but it's a good start. And as I'm sure, you know, you can look at ISM numbers that came out this week, they're booming. Confidence is booming, business and consumers, all that looks good, capitals X -- capex, you know, investment spending which is part of the tax cut design has also picked up steam. I think the factory orders showed core capex -- core investment spending, Maria, up to around nine, 10 percent year and year. So, that's good. You know, we're moving forward in the right direction. A lot of good things happening, and I believe that our idea was Reagan, which was supply side, lower marginal tax rates, the Laffer curve, need I say more.BARTIROMO: Yes.KUDLOW: You know, Maria, I come down here to work in the White House once every 35 years, so this -- I'm going to come down at may be my last hurrah but I want it to be a good one.BARTIROMO: Well, you see the President going to tout these tax cuts in West Virginia today, and now we're talking about a phase two tax plan. What do you want to see in that? I know you've been very focused on expensing and also focused on removing barriers for small business. Larry, what do you want to see in effect at phase two tax reform plan, and will we see one?KUDLOW: Well, I don't know. It's probably not going to be immediate. It's being discussed now. We had a discussion with Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady who's terrific. The President was talking to him two days ago about this. I don't know. I can't predict the precise elements of the package but I think, Maria, it's fair to say that most people in the GOP, and the President Trump, they do want the expensing to be permanent and they do want the personal income tax rate reductions to be permanent. That's very high on everybody's list, and I think you'll get more bang for the buck on these tax cuts if you do make them permanent. There may be other issues, it's possibly to legislate inflation indexing of capital gains. That's a possibility. I don't want to predict the outcome. There are other good ideas floating around. But perhaps later this year, we'll see something more concrete.BARTIROMO: With a better backdrop, Larry, obviously, you're going to get a little inflation, you're going to see little wage growth. That's, I guess, what you want to see but do you worry that wage growth is going to get too hot?KUDLOW: You know, Maria, real wages basically haven't jumped -- let's see -- since about the year 2000 so I'd love to see some hot wage growth. I never understood this idea. You've heard me on this before, more people working, and more people getting raises, you know, for their successful work effort, how can that be bad? I mean, then why do it? Why have policies? We should -- we should be so happy that there's some signs of better wages and some signs of additional employment. This is great stuff. Growth does not cause inflation, OK? Inflation is the excessive money creation by the Fed. You'll know it. I think if the dollar exchange rate falls a lot, Maria, that's a sign to be -- you'll know it in the tips market, the inflation expectations in the tips market, you might know it in the gold market, but my point is, I don't see it. The actual numbers are about 1-1/2 percent core inflation.Gee, growth is wonderful. That's what we're here to help, we want to remove barriers including trading barriers. I want to remove tax barriers regulatory barriers and energy barriers. Now, President Trump, guys, is like an editorial but I believe this stuff. Trump has ended the war on business, he's ended the war on investors, he's ended the war on success. He doesn't want to punish people, he wants to reward them. You can see the pickup this year in activity. This is great stuff. And no, people working in -- listen, in the Reagan years, we went four, five percent over the whole period without inflation, and in fact, inflation came down. In the Clinton years, same story, in the John F. Kennedy years, OK, recommend my book, Maria, "JFK and the Reagan Revolution" pardon me for the plug. But it's all there. Kennedy had five percent growth after his tax cuts and they kept the dollar steady, and inflation was down.BARTIROMO: Yes, the dollar -- the dollar really baffles me because you would think as an economy, it's better the dollar would go up, Larry. That's exactly the opposite of what we've seen.KUDLOW: You're right. And that's something to keep an eye on. I would bet on it but I'm not in the forecasting business anymore. But I think you're right, it hasn't gone down, and it had a huge increase as you know in, what, 2014, '15, '16, and we're still way ahead of that. But it's off 10 percent, I get that. And we'll keep an eye on that.BARTIROMO: I want to get your take on this spending efforts, the rescission efforts to the $1.3-trillion omnibus spending bill that was recently passed. We are confirming that the President is working with the GOP leaders to cut billions of spending from that funding bill, and I guess he can do that and only need 50 votes in the Senate, right? What can we expect in terms of action on this? A lot of conservatives are upset by that bill, you know that, Larry.KUDLOW: I do know it and count me as one of them. I think that (INAUDIBLE) authority or hand rescission authority, I think you're, Maria. I think you're right, but I'm not sure. Reconciliation rules only once a year, once a fiscal year. I got to check that. I mean, I think the deal is if the President impounds excess spending, I think he just needs a majority vote in both houses to get that through. I think those are the rules. I'm going to have to check that. The intention is great, the legislative (INAUDIBLE) we'll have to wait and see.BARTIROMO: You know, Larry, there's an op-ed in the Journal today, it's called "Trump's Irrelevant Tariffs" that you probably saw by Dan Henninger. He's talking about a shortage of workers. Now, of course, we have been talking a lot about immigration restrictions and border restrictions. And he says demographics alone predict a worker shortage of 8.2 million people over the next 10 years. That there are jobs, there aren't enough people in America to fill those jobs and you say --KUDLOW: I'm sorry. It just -- look, Dan Henninger is a great friend and that point of view is certainly important, but, Maria, I'm not so sure right now. I mean, the labor force participation rates and the employment to population ratio is still low, they're both rather low which suggests that right here in the USA, we could have, I don't know, 8, 10, may be 12 million workers with the right incentives and the right opportunities that we are seeing in some sectors, a bit of a shortage, I agree. But wages rising will bring people into the workforce. That's very important. So, that's another reason why I don't think wages are inflationary, they're just good rewards for work. But, but, but, but I got to believe, Maria, merit-based immigration rules, legal immigration -- merit based feeds the family chain. I think that's absolutely essential. And merit based will include a lot of people with good work histories, with -- hopefully, they speak a bit of English and know a little bit of American history and they will have skillsets that we can use here. So, I think that's why the President's reform on merit-based system for immigration is very important.BARTIROMO: And Larry, let me switch gears about the President's comment and attacks on Amazon. Do you foresee a regulatory crackdown here? How will things change for tech? And I don't know, a lot of people are uncomfortable when they see the President calling out one company, how do you feel about it?KUDLOW: Well, I understand, a lot of friends of mine in business are uneasy about this. Look, the way I read it, I haven't had extensive conversation, the President has made his position clear, he wants a level- playing field but simply regarding taxes. So, you're going to get a Supreme Court decision on that which I think will bolster that view, and we'll have to work through, there probably might be some legislation, but he wants a level-playing field. I don't want to judge Amazon. I don't know the beginning, I don't know the end, I'm not an analyst, but I'm just saying his principle issue here is to make sure that the online retailers paying the same taxes and the same tax rates at the state and local government as the land-based retailers. I think that's a very reasonable point of view.BARTIROMO: Larry, let me wrap it up with your plans. New job, what are your priorities?KUDLOW: Growth, Maria. Growth, growth, growth, we have to have a --BARTIROMO: And a minute -- a minute ago you said Reagan years five percent. Could we get to five percent in the coming couple of years in the U.S.?KUDLOW: We could. We could. It might not be forever, but you know, we've had such a slow recovery so called, it's really a growth recession during the Obama years, not a real recovery. So, yes, will we get five percent forever? No. But there's catch-up here, you know, any economist will show you, long-term trend line for real GDP versus the actual now, we're like several trillion dollars below where we should be, based on the long-term trend lines. I want to get back to that full potential. And so, somebody asked me, you know, what's the next big idea, what's the next big priority, I think the administration, myself included, we have to keep messaging growth, we have to keep messaging lower tax rates and incentives and rollback regulations and energy. You know, as I said earlier, this is not -- this is not just a rhetorical point, this is a gut point. President Trump is saying America is open for business, prior Presidents -- I hate to name names -- made a completely opposite point of view. Remember that?BARTIROMO: Yes.KUDLOW: You didn't build this business, that kind of stuff, making fun of investors, that kind of stuff.BARTIROMO: Pay your fair share.KUDLOW: Right, right. Your fair share and, you know, let's attack rich people. Those days are over. They're over.BARTIROMO: Yes, apparently.KUDLOW: And the animal spirits have already started to jump under this President and his policies. And therefore, I hope for more of the same and I want to devote myself to that message and those actions.BARTIROMO: You got it. Larry, great to see you. Thanks so much. We'll be watching.KUDLOW: Thanks, Maria. Thank you very much.BARTIROMO: We're all wishing you luck, Larry, Larry Kudlow at the White House today. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Now, the latest on Facebook, CEO Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged his mistakes on the data sharing scandal. We now know may have affected up to 87 million users, that's almost double what they told us initially. He will be headed to Washington to face the music on Capitol Hill next week. Hillary Vaughn is in Washington with the very latest there. Hillary, good morning to you.HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Hey, good morning, Maria. Well, Zuckerberg says that his testimony in front of two different committees on the Hill is going to cover a lot of ground yesterday in a call with reporters. He didn't shut down the idea that the government may need to rein in his company. Yesterday, Facebook almost doubled the number of users caught up in this data mess to 87 million, but Zuckerberg says, no one has been fired over the scandal and he plans to stay in charge. He also is reminding users that any data that was stashed and sold with information users chose to share with Facebook in the first place.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: The vast majority of the data that Facebook knows about you is because you chose to share it, right, it's not tracking. For some reason, we haven't been able to kick this notion for years that people think that we sell data to advertisers. We don't. That's not been a thing that we do. It's actually -- it just goes counter to our own incentives.(END VIDEO CLIP)VAUGHN: Zuckerberg says they still don't know how much information Cambridge Analytica still has on hands. The company is juggling several lawsuits from users and shareholders and also facing multiple investigations launched by state attorneys general across the country.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ZUCKERBERG: I don't think there's been any meaningful impacts that we've observed. But look, it's not good. I mean, it's like, you know, I don't want anyone to be unhappy with our service. I do think this is a multi- year effort. That doesn't mean it's not going to get better every month, but I think it will continue to get better.(END VIDEO CLIP)VAUGHN: Zuckerberg says his company is gearing up for a three-year push to resolve this. He will be here Tuesday and Wednesday, back on Capitol Hill to face lawmakers. Maria?BARTIROMO: All right. We will be watching that. Hillary, thank you. Hillary Vaughn in D.C. Coming up, final thoughts from this all-star panel. Back in a minute.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KUDLOW: Look, I think it's possible, Maria, to be in the three to four percent growth zone.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: That was National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow speaking with me moments ago. I want to get final thoughts from our all- star panel. He also said when I asked him about five percent in the Reagan years that that was possible as well for a time, but not forever. Final thoughts --HUCKABEE: This is so important. So important because at four percent growth of the economy, we fully fund Social Security and Medicare. People don't fully understand how vital it is to see that kind of economic growth.PARTSINEVELOS: Well, he is a growth guy but we did have a guest on earlier before that said if it's three percent or higher that could be bad for markets.BARTIROMO: On wages.PARTSINEVELOS: Wages, OK. So, that's --BARTIROMO: Yes, wages above three percent would be problematic because we've been seeing wage growth under three percent for so long. I guess, the last couple of months was 2.9 percent, 2.7 percent. But growth, the markets want to see above three percent, for sure.HEGSETH: An important indicator -- great interview by the way.BARTIROMO: Thanks.HEGSETH: And you could see why the President wants a guy like this, who's all about growth, laser-focused on the economy. We talked a lot about tariffs in China today. I have a good friend (INAUDIBLE) trader in Minnesota, he said soybeans come from South America and the U.S., that's -- China is going to feed something like 750 million pigs. They're not going to get that from Mars. Ultimately, we have a lot of leverage. We shouldn't be freaking out as if markets are going to collapsed in commodities if we have a showdown with China on this. It's about leveling the playing field in the long --PARTSINEVELOS: It was overreaction yesterday.BARTIROMO: So, you're saying -- you're saying that they're going to buy soybeans from us, they have to?HEGSETH: Yes, yes. So, stare them down and get a better term -- get better terms of the deal which ultimately helps those industries.BARTIROMO: That's a great comment. Thanks, everybody, for joining us. Great panel today.HEGSETH: Thank you. Nice to be here.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Governor Huckabee, thank you, Kristina and Pete. That'll do it for us. I'll see you here tomorrow. "VARNEY & COMPANY" begins right now. Stuart, take it away.STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Maria, you gave me an --BARTIROMO: Night's an early to you, Stu.VARNEY: You gave me an extra 10 seconds. What am I going to do?BARTIROMO: You know what, because we didn't hear from you, and I felt bad about that.VARNEY: Oh, OK. We'll see you tomorrow though. Thanks very much.Load-Date: April 5, 2018End of Document

China robbed military documents of US secret weapon: TWPCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 9, 2018 SaturdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 279 wordsBody Washington, Jun 9 (Notimex) .- Cybernetic pirates of the Chinese government penetrated the computer systems of a Navy contractor and stole military documents from a secret weapon, the Washington Post reported today.  At least 614 gigabits of information from the operation "Sea Dragon" (Dragon of the Sea), a project to develop a supersonic anti-ship missile that is scheduled to be installed on US submarines from 2020, according to US officials.  The contractor that was the target of cyber-theft and whose identity was kept secret was working for the Naval Warfare Center, located in Newport, Rhode Island.  The theft also included the theft of documents related to sensor data, cryptographic systems and library information for the development of electronic warfare.  The Washington Post reported having withheld part of the information at its disposal, at the request of the Navy, which argued that its disclosure could affect the national security of the United States.  "The stolen data were of a highly sensitive nature despite having been stored in a cybernetic network of non-classified information on the servers of the contractor company," according to the report.  The newspaper noted in that regard that the incident raised concerns about the Navy's ability to supervise companies that are in charge of the development of sophisticated high-tech weapons.  "This violation is part of China's long-term effort to seek to decimate the US advantage of military technology and become the dominant power in Southeast Asia," the newspaper said.  The investigation of the incident is carried out by the Navy, with the support of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Load-Date: June 9, 2018End of Document

RUBIO: TRADE AND ZTE'S NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT SHOULDN'T BE MIXEDStates News ServiceMay 22, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 908 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Florida Senator Marco Rubio:U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) appeared on Fox News The Story with Martha MacCallum to discuss the need to rebalance U.S. trade with China and the national security threat posed by Chinese state-directed telecommunications firms like ZTE, in light of recent news reports indicating that the Administration has agreed to the broad outlines of a trade deal that would lift a ban on U.S. companies selling components and software to ZTE.Earlier this month, Rubio delivered remarks on the Senate floor and introduced legislation to protect American workers from Chinas economic aggression. The bill would prohibit the federal government, or subsidiaries/contractors, from purchasing telecommunications equipment or services from Huawei and ZTE. Rubio also recently wrote an op-ed on his legislation, outlining how to counter these economic tools of aggression used by Beijing.A partial and rough transcript of Rubios remarks are transcribed below.VIDEO: RUBIO: TRADE and ZTE SHOULDNT BE MIXEDRubio: Heres what concerns me. First of all, trade and ZTE are two separate issues. They shouldnt be mixed. We have a huge trade problem with China. Its structural, its not just how much they buy from us, its what they do to our companies. They force our companies to turn over intellectual property, secrets. You cant do business in China unless you do that, if you can do it at all. Meanwhile their companies can do whatever they want here. Thats what has to be fixed because thats long term and its problematic. ZTE is a cell phone and technology company. They got caught violating the Iran sanctions and North Korea. And they got hit with a billion dollar fine and they were told they had to fire the employees who did that. You know what they did? They didnt do it. They lied. They didnt fire those employees, they gave them a bonus and they tried to cover that up as well like they tried to cover up the violation. So now we hit them, and said fine, you cant buy our semiconductors anymore and that put them out of business. And thats a good move. Thats what we need to be doing when people are violating these things. But now it appears as though some are saying, well, lets fine them again and lets make them change the board of directors. Thats the same deal they broke already once. Meanwhile, all these phone companies, they have to report to the Chinese government. You use those phones, and they can steal those secrets, they can spy on us, they even have subcontractors in ZTE that work for but people right now could be using ZTE and Huawei technology and not even know it because it says ATandT or something on it. But its theirs.You've said something that I actually disagree with. This is not the way we've always done it, the way we've actually always done it is the way they're going now. That is the Chinese go to a bunch of American companies and that is the semiconductor companies or some others and they go to them and say, can you go to the White House and Congress to lobby them and change their mind? That's what they do, and then we back off. Every President before now has backed off on China and that's why theyve gained this advantage on us. Number 2, here is the problem, North Korea is in China's interest, it's in China's interest because if North Korea and Kim Jong-Un goes down you will have a bunch of North Koreans coming across the border. They're not doing us any favor helping us with North Korea, they're closer to that crazy guy than we are. They should be worried about it. Number 3, what kind of deal is it where they say, okay we're going to buy more agriculture from America in return we're going to that - by the way so they're not giving anything -in return we're going to keep stealing your stuff. In about 5 or 8 years they're going to dominate bio-tech, aerospace, they're going to be able to listen in all of our military secrets and use those. They are building airplanes, our airplanes, that took us 20 years to innovate, these guys are coming up with these things in 2 years. Theyre either that brilliant, which they're not, or they're stealing it from us. They're using ZTE in places like that to do it.There needs to be balance. Right now its imbalanced and when you have an imbalance, the other place is going to take advantage of you. And sometimes you have wars because of these imbalances. Right now it is a total imbalance. Chinese companies come to America and can do whatever they want. Whatever they want. American companies, some of them are not even allowed into China, and if they let you into China they make you partner with one of their companies until they steal your secrets. That has to be balanced. Until that is balanced, we are going to have this problem.So China is taking advantage of the fact that for 20 years, American presidents before this one, made the decision that, dont worry about it. Well let them keep cheating. Because once theyre rich, theyre going to act more like us.Well it didnt work out that way and now we finally realized it. And its almost too late. So I dont want China to be an enemy. We are actually turning them into an enemy in some ways by allowing this imbalance to exist. They are taking advantage of that imbalance like any country in the world would. And until we get this thing balanced out again structurally, the threat of a conflict is actually going to grow, not diminish.Load-Date: May 23, 2018End of Document

The exchange market analyst at Banco Bx +, Mariana Ramírez, mentioned that at this moment the only factor that could put pressure on the peso-dollar parity would be that the signing of the NAFTA be postponed until after the presidential elections in Mexico.  He warned that if the trade agreement is not renegotiated, which is scheduled to start on April 8, the peso would show prices above 18.50 pesos per dollar. Load-Date: April 3, 2018End of Document

(Read here: Dog meat consumers defend their party in China)  They also demand that he impose heavy fines and confiscate the animals and place them in the care of activists.  It is estimated that more than 10 million dogs and 4 million cats die every year throughout China for their meat, and thousands die in the annual Yulin festival, which is celebrated on June 21.  Many of the dogs and cats, the organizations denounce, are stolen and lost pets from the streets , which endure being driven for days throughout China to Yulin, huddled in cages until they reach the slaughterhouse where they are generally beaten to death.  Unlike popular belief, most people in China do not eat dog meat and, in addition, Yulin's is not a traditional festival, activists say, and was only invented in 2010 by dog ??dealers to increase their earnings.  As part of the protest, the HSI organization also encouraged Internet users to upload photos with their pets to social networks, in solidarity with the suffering of animals in Yulin.  "The annual festival of Yulin symbolizes the cruelty of this abhorrent trade and in a few days thousands of dogs and cats, mostly stolen pets, will give their last terrified breaths in a slaughterhouse," said Adam Parascandola, HSI.  The activist claimed to have witnessed "the horror of that scene first hand" and demanded that, since China celebrates the Year of the Dog this year, "there is no better opportunity to end suffering."

Oil spikes again: US crude futures hit their highest levels since late 2014 on Friday, trading at $71.60 per barrel. Prices of Brent crude, the international benchmark, topped $80 per barrel Thursday.Oil prices have risen significantly in recent weeks, mostly because of concerns about Iranian supplies after President Donald Trump ditched the nuclear deal, and a collapse in Venezuelan production.The rise is starting to trouble big energy consuming nations. India's energy minister said he called his Saudi Arabian counterpart late on Thursday to express his concern.2. PayPal's biggest takeover: PayPal announced Thursday that it is buying iZettle for $2.2 billion. It's the online payments firm's biggest ever acquisition and gives the company a bigger footprint in physical stores.A Swedish startup, iZettle provides small businesses with card readers that can be connected to smart phones and tablets. It also offers platforms for sales and inventory tracking.3. China-US trade talks: US officials said Thursday that China had proposed boosting its imports of American goods by around $200 billion in an attempt to reduce the massive trade imbalance between the two countries. China bought $130 billion of American goods last year, according to US government figures.However, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang denied on Friday that such an offer had been made.

Dong Qi, CEO of FINUP FINTECH GROUP, Arrives in Boao, Hainan and is Interviewed by CGTNPR NewswireApril 9, 2018 Monday 10:00 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 605 wordsDateline: BOAO, China, April 9, 2018 BodyOn April 8th, Dong Qi, the founder and CEO of FINUP FINTECH GROUP, arrived in Boao, Hainan and attended the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2018. In the afternoon, Dong Qi gave an interview to a CGTN reporter and expressed his views on the future development of China's open financial market and Fintech enterprises."Over the past three years, China's Fintech companies have undergone fierce competition, which has led to a growing size of leading enterprises in the industry so that better financial science and technology services can be provided for the public. The massive and rapid application of various technologies in China's Fintech fields, such as artificial intelligence, big data and others, is also a driving force behind the development and growth of China's Fintech" said Dong Qi.This year's Boao Forum for Asia, themed "An Open and Innovative Asia for a World of Greater Prosperity," has been a stronger advocate for openness. In recent years, China's financial market has gradually opened its doors, which has also propelled many Chinese financial companies to actively expand their international market operations and participate in international competitions at the same time. Speaking of the development of China's Fintech, Dong Qi emphasized that artificial intelligence was the core driving force for China's Fintech enterprises. He said that in the past few years, FINUP FINTECH GROUP had formed several technical and data teams to improve the efficiency of service delivery.As for the future development of the company, Dong Qi revealed that according to its development plan, the company will continue to focus on Fintech innovation to drive financial services, and provide users with full life-cycle financial information services that are more scenario-based by applying emerging technologies such as big data and artificial intelligence so as to cover all aspects of users' lives. He believed that despite the speedy growth of China's Fintech market, there was still much room for further development. With the use of various technologies, Fintech services will be further enhanced to facilitate the development of China's Fintech.In fact, the development of China's Fintech industry can't do without government regulation. To effectively forestall financial risks, the Chinese government has gradually tightened its financial regulations over Internet finance. After more than a year of special overhaul, the regulatory system has gradually been improved, and Internet finance has been developing in an increasingly standardized manner. Moreover, the merger of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission and the China Banking Regulatory Commission has opened a new era of regulation. Based on the above, Dong Qi stated that a Fintech service enterprise should place the most emphasis on customer needs, guided by which corresponding services were provided. Therefore, a more comprehensive and systematic regulatory policy is actually more conducive to development.When asked by CGTN about the Sino-US trade dispute, Dong Qi said, "I think its impact on China's Fintech industry will be limited." The reason lies in that American financial companies have deep penetration in their domestic market, leaving less market share for foreign companies. In comparison, markets outside the United States such as South America and Southeast Asia would be more favorable for Chinese Fintech enterprises. View original content with multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dong-qi-ceo-of-finup-fintech-group-arrives-in-boao-hainan-and-is-interviewed-by-cgtn-300626355.htmlSOURCE FINUP FINTECH GROUPCONTACT: Chuan Shen, +86-182-0103-5873, shenchuan@yogepr.comLoad-Date: April 10, 2018End of Document

Global Electric Vehicle Battery Market Analysis, Growth, Trends & Forecast 2018-2023 - ResearchAndMarkets.comBusiness WireMay 3, 2018 Thursday 12:32 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Business Wire, Inc.Distribution: Business Editors; Environment Writers; Automotive WritersLength: 501 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "Global Electric Vehicle Battery Market - Growth, Trends, and Forecast (2018 - 2023)" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.In 2016, China lead the electric vehicle battery market, with 336,000 new electric cars being registered during the year. The electric car sales in China alone was more than double than the number of electric vehicles sold in the United States, where there were only 160,000 new registrations of electric vehicles.Policy support is among the major factors driving the electric vehicle battery market, as policies have been lowering the barriers for electric vehicles adaptation. Policy support enables the growth of the market studied, by making vehicles appealing to consumers, reducing risks for investors, and encouraging manufacturers willing to develop electric vehicle or EV production on a large scale. In Norway, electric cars are exempted from acquisition tax, and BEVs or battery electric vehicles are exempt from 25% VAT on car purchases.The Chinese government has been providing both financial and non-financial incentives. Electric vehicles are exempted from acquisition and excise taxes, ranging between CNY 35,000 and CNY 60,000. Some cities in China have also been allowing total or partial waivers, from license plate availability restrictions. The robust electric vehicles sales in China can be attributed to the imposition of license plate restrictions, electric vehicles adaptation encouragement programs, and financial incentives. In the country's national plan for 2016-2020, the Chinese government announced that subsidies for EVs would be reduced by 20%, from 2017.Low-speed electric vehicles have been garnering attention in the global electric vehicle market, primarily in China, where they have emerged as a competitor to both electric vehicles and two wheelers. LSEVs have speed ranging between 40 to 70 kmph, and in some cases use lead-acid batteries and basic motor technology. It is estimated that the sale value of LSEV grew by roughly 50% in 2016 to reach about 1.3 million.Companies Mentioned• Panasonic• LG Chem• BYD• Samsung SDI• Johnson Controls International PLC• GS Yuasa• Hitachi Group• Automotive Energy Supply Corporation• Blue Energy Co.

Thanks so much for joining us this morning. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Happy Friday. It is Friday June 8th, your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.Trade tensions running high this morning. President Trump will be making his way to Quebec for the G7 meeting shortly. He will take on our key allies over tariffs. He set to leave the White House shortly and we will show you those pictures when he does.Tough talk, of course weighing on global markets as well. Futures indicating a decline of the start of trading this morning. Although I should point out that we are well off of the lows of the morning. Dow Industrials had been down about 120 points. We are now looking at a decline of 80 points on the Dow, down 52 points on the NASDAQ. It was a mixed performance yesterday. The Dow actually was up, hitting its highest level nearly three months yesterday. Had gains in energy, stocks, offsetting the weakness in technology, but the weakness in tech hit the NASDAQ hard down three quarters of one percent yesterday with 54-point decline.In Europe, we're looking at declines across the Board. As you can see, the CAC quarante in Paris just flipped into positive territory. It's been back and forth, really flat on the session. The CAC quarante in Paris is up three points right now. But the F.T.-100 is down a point and the DAX Index is down 45 points. This is a complete reversal. The F.T. and the DAX were down much more, so we are seeing some buying interest just in the last 20 minutes both in U.S. and European markets. We are off of the lows in a big -- in big time. In Asia overnight weakness across the Board, take a look, worst performer was Hong Kong, Hang Seng index down, one and three quarters percent.Breaking news this morning, Anthony Bourdain is dead at 61 years old. The well-known chef and television host died of an apparent suicide in Paris, according to CNN. Facebook is facing another privacy glitch. Fourteen million users affected after some of their private posts were actually made public. And Apple is under pressure. A new report says the company warned its suppliers of a 20 percent decline in new component orders for the iPhone. The fallout coming up as the stock is down one and a quarter percent. House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi takes aim at President Trump once again.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. NANCY PELOSI (D), CALIFORNIA, HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: Isn't just about the unemployment rate. It's about wages rising in our country. So that consumer confidence is restored because our economy will never fully reach its possibilities unless we increase the confidence.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: incidentally, consumer confidence is currently at an 18-year high.All those stories coming up this Friday morning. And joining me talk all of that is Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell. Fox News contributor, Rachel Campos-Duffy. And Kadina Group president and Fox Business contributor, Gary B. Smith. Great to see everybody this morning.GARY SMITH, PRESIDENT, KADINA GROUP: Nice to be here.BARTIROMO: You have to wonder if Nancy Pelosi actually does understand the economics of what's going on.SMITH: I don't know if it's a lack of understanding or a lack of just getting some briefing notes each day. To see that consumer confidence -- I think you just pointed out is in all-time high.BARTIROMO: Yes, 18 years.SMITH: We talked about household network at an all-time high.BARTIROMO: Hundred trillion dollars.SMITH: The wage is increasing. I'm not sure what good numbers that she needs to see in order to say, yes, the economy is OK.RACHEL CAMPOS DUFFY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Whenever Trump tweets, why would I ever take advice from these Democrats? This is a case in point. She doesn't understand. The Republicans are very happy that she's still --SMITH: Well, and most of America is very happy that Trump is with what Trump is doing.BARTIROMO: Absolutely. The policies are obviously having an impact.SMITH: Exactly.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR: Your $2,000 bonus, crumbs.SMITH: Crumbs.MCDOWELL: Companies put a schmooze on.BARTIROMO: But surely, going into the midterm elections, this is not going to work.MCDOWELL: But she's not telling the truth.BARTIROMO: Right.MCDOWELL: The point is, does she know the numbers because if she knows them and then is preaching this then she's -- well, she's lying to the American people.CAMPOS-DUFFY: No credibility on economy.BARTIROMO: Yes, they don't. We want to join the conversation this morning with the White House principal deputy press secretary, Raj Sha. He is coming up shortly. House republican conference chair and Washington congresswoman, Cathy McMorris Rodgers is with us this morning. And the host of "VARNEY & COMPANY," Stuart Varney weighs in as well. Big hour ahead. Don't miss a moment. We've got a lot coming up.And we kick it off right here at this hour with this, President Trump is leaving the White House this morning for the G7 summit in Quebec. He will meet with world leaders over controversial trade tariffs, Blake Burman is live in Canada this morning, with the very latest. Blake, good morning to you.BLAKE BURMAN, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Maria, good morning to you from Canada on Friday morning going into this G7 Summit. Larry Kudlow tried to down play the tensions saying, hey, look this is just a family quarrel that is playing out right now. It might indeed be a family quarrel. I'm not sure that this is a family that's going to go out for ice cream after dinner later this evening. On the menu for President Trump later today once he arrives. He will meet with the French president, Emmanuel Macron. He will also meet with the Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau. Those two met ahead of the G7 and continued their public disdain of the president's trade policies. Macron tweeting at one point yesterday, "The American president may not mind being isolated, but neither do we mind signing a six-country agreement if need be." Meaning as if not including the U.S.The president also sent out a handful of responses on Twitter, among them he wrote at one point, "Please tell Prime Minister Trudeau and President Macron that they are charging the U.S. massive tariffs and create non- monetary barriers. The E.U. trade surplus with the U.S. is $151 billion. And Canada keeps our farmers and others out. Look forward to seeing them tomorrow." He ends that tweet. In another tweet that we also said that Trudeau was being, "Indignant."The commerce secretary last night, Wilbur Ross said, "Hey, look, don't blame us."(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WILBUR ROSS, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF COMMERCE: It's their own fault that the tariffs went into effect. Now, they're trying to somehow pretend that they are free traders, when they really are the most protectionist people around on the planet.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURMAN: President Trump running a little bit behind this morning. He is set to leave the White House any moment now to come here for Canada. By the way, Maria, he is also cutting his trip short a few hours. Expected to leave a few hours early tomorrow morning. The White House says there is that other major meeting just a few days from now as well in Singapore. That's the reason.BARTIROMO: Yes. There sure is. He said, he's going to leave early just to go to Singapore, get there early for Kim Jong-un. Thank you, Blake. Blake Burman is in Quebec City this morning.Joining me right now to talk more about all of the above, White House principal deputy press secretary, Raj Sha. Raj, good to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.RAJ SHAH, WHITE HOUSE PRINCIPAL DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY: Good morning, Maria. Thanks a lot for having me on.BARTIROMO: What is the president expecting? I mean, what are the chances that anything gets resolved at the G7 today with regard to the tariffs?SHAH: I don't want to set too many expectations. What I will say though is to echo both what Larry Kudlow said and what Secretary Ross said which is that the president's position both on the steel, aluminum tariffs and on dairy tariffs that the Canadian government has is that the United States wants to see free, fair, and reciprocal trade. We want to see other countries allow for American exports and support American jobs and American workers, and have a free and fair and frankly level-playing field when we negotiate not just with countries that we have a more complex relationship with but also 2with our allies. So that includes the E.U. That includes Canada, includes Mexico and many other countries.BARTIROMO: Yes, I know. But I mean, isn't this going to send prices higher, Raj? We keep talking about the implications of these trade tariffs. And obviously, it's going to ultimately impact the consumer because when you look at these tariffs on these imports coming in, those producers are just going to raise prices, forcing the price to go up for consumers. The president worried that these tariffs on aluminum and steel is going to cut into economic growth.SHAH: We've had decades of policy that hasn't worked, decades where other countries have taken advantage of the United States, have had tariff and non-tariff barriers have done goods, have done many things that put our workers, our farmers, our businesses at a disadvantage and the president has been very clear about that. He's stated kind of screamed from the rooftops during campaign and has said as much afterwards that that status quo can no longer be sustained.And so he's been taking actions. He'd been confronting bad trade practices. He's actually led to renegotiations in principal with U.S.- South Korea free trade agreement. There's an ongoing back-and-forth with China. We're trying to renegotiate NAFTA. So the president is going to piece by piece start fixing what has been a broken system that had worked against the United States and we have a several hundred-billion-dollar annual trade deficit with countries around the world. We are hemorrhaging money and the president wants to fix that. So there may be some short-term hiccups, but his long view is to ensure that American goods, American products are respected overseas and are allowed to enter foreign markets just as they're allowed to enter our markets.BARTIROMO: Right. And he has said there could be short-term pain for long-term solutions. But my question to you is, isn't the bigger issue China and the theft of intellectual property and the forced transfer of technology, Raj? So, what does deal with ZTE do for any of that? People today, businesses today, do not care if trade deficit with China is $375 billion or $200 billion. I recognize the numbers look better. If he does a more fair situation here, but the real issue is intellectual property theft and the forced transfer of technology. What are we going to do about that?SHAH: Well, the president has begun to confront China over forced technology transfers and the theft of intellectual property. That's why the 301 tariffs have been proposed. The president has $50 billion on the table. He's going to look at that come a few weeks from now and around mid-June. And the president is going to potentially take action. You know, we've been working back and forth with our Chinese counterparts. They're tough negotiations. But they've also operated under status quo in which Chinese companies and frankly the Chinese government has been stealing American technology, has been you know, forcing American companies --BARTIROMO: And they won't even admit it. They won't even admit it.SHAH: Yes, they won't admit it, but if you go to talk to any technology company in Silicon Valley or across the country, they know what's going on. So the president has been confronting this issue. We're going to work with the Chinese president and the president has a great relationship with President Xi.BARTIROMO: Right.SHAH: But protecting American intellectual property, protecting the technology investments that many investors and other folks make in United States and make in American companies from Apple to Oracle, is essential.BARTIROMO: Of course.SHAH: We need to ensure that those rights are protected. So it's an ongoing process, but the president is raising it for the first time. This president is raising these issues in a way that frankly previous presidents from both parties failed or were just simply unwilling to raise and raise different issues.BARTIROMO: And we know that China has been helpful to an extent when it comes to North Korea. The president says he's ready for this historic sit- down with Kim Jong-un. It's happening this upcoming Tuesday. Here's what he said yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think I'm very well prepared. I don't think you have to prepare very much. It's about attitude. It's about willingness to get things done, but this isn't a question of preparation. It's a question of whether or not people want it to happen. It's going to be much more of their photo-op. I think it's a process. I told you that many times before. I think it's not a one meeting deal. It'd be wonderful if it were.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: So, Raj, what the president is expecting? I mean, he said that he's also willing to invite the North Korean leader to the White House if this summit goes well?SHAH: Absolutely. Look, if there is a willingness on the North Koreans which they have expressed through Secretary Pompeo to denuclearize, to actually put down their arms and end their nuclear program and open up to the west, and to, you know, South Korea and other countries, in the region, we think that's a historic opportunity and the president is taking leadership on and sees it. And we think that if a summit in the United States or meetings elsewhere around the world subsequent meetings, we think whatever is necessary to kind of meet willingness from the North Koreans to take action with actual action, we're willing to take those steps.BARTIROMO: Let's turn to the economy, Raj. The president handling of the economy now at a new high according to this latest Fox News poll. It finds 52 percent of registered voters approve of his handling of the economy. This comes as House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi continues to downplay the improving economy. Here's what she said yesterday, Raj.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PELOSI: Unless we have an increase of a very significant increase in in wages and -- bigger paychecks, we are going to increase the frustration of America's families because they'll be saying hip, hip hooray unemployment is down. What does that mean to me and my life?This isn't just about the unemployment rate, it's about wages rising in our country. So that consumer confidence is restored. This is -- our economy will never fully reach its possibilities unless we increase the consumer confidence.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Raj, I'm not sure if she knows, but consumer confidence is actually at a near 18-year high right now.SHAH: Right.BARTIROMO: But she, along with her colleagues are going along with this narrative that things are not going very well.SHAH: Well, I think what Nancy Pelosi was talking about there was politics. It's not about economics, because, as you said, consumer confidence is at a near two-decade high, while unemployment is at a near two-decade low. You have African-Americans, veterans, female unemployment at near historic lows. You have wages rising for the first time since 2006. Everything about the economy, all things are pointing toward prosperity, are pointing toward higher wages, are pointing towards upward mobility for millions of Americans. I think you've mentioned at the top of the show that household wealth is at a new high, you know, home prices are rising. There's so much good news out there. And frankly, Nancy Pelosi is talking about politics. She's trying to downplay significant economic gains. The fact is that if these -- if the health of this economy and that the policies of the previous administration worked as well, you would have seen her praising the economy.BARTIROMO: Right. And by the way, what a switch from Mitt Romney, right? I mean, Mitt Romney once called Donald Trump, "A Conman." Now, the Republican Senate candidate is predicting quote this, "I think President Trump will be re-nominating by my party easily and I think he'll be re- elected solidly. Romney bases his prediction on the improving economy and the likelihood that Democrats will choose a candidate outside the mainstream. What was your reaction when you heard Romney?SHAH: Well, I think he's right. I think that the president is leading us toward a safer, freer, more prosperous country and I think lives for Americans are going to be much better. I think Mitt Romney is right.BARTIROMO: Raj, good to see you this morning. Thanks so much.SHAH: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Raj Shah at the White House. Stay with us. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Apple reportedly issues a warning to its suppliers. Cheryl Casone with all the news now, Cheryl.CASONE: Maria, we are watching shares of Apple this morning. The stock is trading lower on the premarket. The company reportedly asked companies that make parts for the iPhones to cut production by about 20 percent. Japanese newspaper reported this; they're reporting that Apple expects total iPhone shipments this year to fall to 80 million down from 100 million a year ago. There's the stock. It's down 1-1/2 percent in premarket. And Apple is not commenting on this for now, but, again, we are watching the stock that is certainly under pressure ahead of your opening bell.Well, some sad breaking news to bring to you this morning: Anthony Bourdain is dead in apparent suicide. This is according to CNN, that announced his is death this morning. He had been in France working on an upcoming episode of a CNN show "Parts Unknown". Bourdain was found dead in a hotel room by his close friend, French Chef, and the Founder of New York's La Bernardin, Eric Ripert. In a statement, the network saying, "his love of great adventure, new friends, fine food and drink, and the remarkable stories of the world made him a unique storyteller. His talents never cease to amaze us and we will miss him very much." Anthony Bourdain, Maria, was just 61-years-old. Back to you.BARTIROMO: Such a terrible story. And this week, we heard Kate Spade also killed herself. And Dagen, you have research from CDC that suicide rates are up in every state but in half the country, what?MCDOWELL: The suicide rates since 1999 in 25 of the states are up more than 30 percent, overall from 99 to 2016. The overall nationwide suicide rate has gone up 30 percent. So again, it's a call to action for everybody in this country to do more, in terms of making -- to -- there's the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. I think that that's one of the most incredible phone numbers that everybody can have access to, and one -- we should point out that Anthony Bourdain leaves behind a young daughter, she's around 11 years of age.Again, Kate Spade also had a young daughter who she left behind. And I speak from personal experience on this, that for all those people who've ever had a loved one, a close friend, or family member who took their own life, this kind of national news you might not have ever known -- Anthony Bourdain or Kate Spade -- but it revives grief and the hurt, and the guilty that goes along when you have a loved one who takes their life.And so, there are a lot of people out there who are grieving, who are struggling to cope with the news of Anthony Bourdain and Kate Spade, so look out for them. Look out for them and think about them because, again, the hurt, that people experience and the burden that individuals carry with them for the rest of their lives when they have a loved one who takes their own life is indescribable and some instances, it's insurmountable.BARTIROMO: Yes. Suicide is one of only three sicknesses that are actually rising -- Alzheimer's, drug abuse/drug overdose, and suicide, actually rising. Just terrible. Our thoughts with his family. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Facebook is apologizing for a software glitch this morning that made millions of users' private posts, public. Susan Lee is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange this morning with details. Susan, good morning.SUSAN LI, FBN REPORTER: Good morning to you, Maria. That's right Facebook may have exposed private posts of 14 million of its users owing to what they're calling a software glitch. So, basically the user settings were changed from private to public, and this goes back to 10 days in the month of May. They say that they have now fixed this software glitch, but of course, you know, this is a long stretch of P.R. smears for the social media site after Cambridge Analytica scandal, and this week. The New York Times report saying that Facebook has shared without consent, some of their users' data for some of these hardware device makers like Apple, and Samsung, and the like. The stock is down some three percent on a week when the NASDAQ hit a record.And since it's Friday, let's end on a happy note. Taco Bell, which is a division of Yum! Brands is testing frose at some of their Taco Bell cantinas in Chicago and California. So, it's a slushy, pink, boozy drink that you can enjoy, as well with your tacos. And speaking of tacos, who doesn't like free tacos -- and that's what you're getting on June 13th, from 2:00 to 6:00 p.m. at participating at locations, Maria. This goes back to a promotion that Taco Bell said that they would do if one of the teams from the Golden State Warriors or the Cleveland Cavs in the NBA finals steals a game from home team, and that's what happened, of course, with the Golden State Warriors winning game three. Back to you.BARTIROMO: Susan, thank you. Susan Li on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.MCDOWELL: And Maria Bartiromo, congratulations, for being named one of the top three journalists followed by major CEOs on Twitter -- this is according to Rational 360's Influencer Index. Get down, Maria Bartiromo, followed by almost 17 percent of CEOs.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Even minor CEOs follow her, not just major ones, Maria, minor ones too.BARTIROMO: Thank you very much. I was pleased to see it. It was a study -- and 50 journalists.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And moms in Wisconsin follow you too.MCDOWELL: The folks follow you, because again, plain English and you are completely in touch. Because of your roots, you're totally in touch with what the American people are thinking about, how they feel about their finances, their health, their safety all of it.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And first journalist to call it after the election that it was going to be a good economy.MCDOWELL: They hadn't even -- she called it and they hadn't even called the election yet.BARTIROMO: Can I just say, can I be any more fortunate to work with this woman every day, Dagen McDowell? Can I be any more fortunate? And our guests, we love you so much, all of our guests we have this morning show on television, in my humble opinion, thank you for being so generous all the time, Dagen.MCDOWELL: Can I tell a story? I was running in here late this morning, and looked at you, and I was like: I know you're feeling me. I know you're feeling me --BARTIROMO: I was.MCDOWELL: And we just laughed at each other.BARTIROMO: True. And we had a great week this week. We had a lot of great guests. We had some fantastic news flow as well. Check out some of the top moments from this week on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. STEVE SCALISE (R), LOUISIANA: If you see that the president is standing up for our country, I think that's going to help us in other trade deals. And look, we don't have enough trade deals with the Asian countries, all with European countries. So, hopefully, this helps as the president goes to expand our trade agreements around the world.MICK MULVANEY, DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET: Do you have to break some eggs to make an omelet? Absolutely. Do you have to be tough with people in order to get them to change their behavior? Absolutely. You cannot just ask other countries to treat us better and expect them to do it. That's not the way that the world works. Look at what he's done already. And there is the proof that what he's doing is good for the economy.JACK GERARD, CEO, AMERICAN PETROLEUM INSTITUTE: All of a sudden, we're told we've increased the cost of that, 25 percent or we're told there's been quota imposed. And by the way, you've already reached your quota.BARTIROMO: Right.GERARD: So, you see the disruption and the uncertainty it creates in the marketplace. That's not good for us.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Unemployment is down 18-year low, back orders are at 14-year high. Industry really isn't that afraid about these tariffs on a whole, in my opinion. In our sector, we're not going to stop building just because something goes up by a few pennies.NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Every country which negotiates with us, is at a disadvantage because of the size of our economy. Trump says this is fine. If I can negotiate one-on-one -- (INAUDIBLE). If I can negotiate one-on-one, I will get a better deal for America every single time.GEN. JACK KEANE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: The president seems go in here very clear. They're not going to give up on the sanctions that we have in place, certainly. We can't do anything like that until the actual dismantling of the nuclear program is under way and is a commitment to continue it.BRE PAYTON, STAFF WRITER, THE FEDERALIST: It is time to accept lessons of 2016 on both sides of the aisle. Every day, we're rehashing the same thing, we're rehashing November 2016 all over again. I think it would be great if people would take the lessons away from that and move along.MATT BRAYNARD, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, LOOK AHEAD AMERICA: Every time he shows up in public, the Democrats lose another house seat. To continue to treat this guy, with such kid gloves -- I mean, when is the last time you've heard somebody on the right being given: oh, you didn't do so well yesterday, would you like a do-over?JACK BREWER, CEO, BREWER GROUP: If you're talking about a ball club that stood up for every national anthem this season. I was really hoping to see that team come together, go to the White House, sit across from my president, and have these discussions. BURGESS OWENS, FOOTBALL PLAYER: The NFL has a brand now, a brand problem. The brand now has become anti-American, anti-flag. Civil conversations, what I think the women missing out on. And right now, the NFL brand needs to stand up and stop this protesting problems.BARTIROMO: Yes, good point.MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND FORMER GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS: If he were to run and win, the good news is: we would always be able to find an available restroom near the White House -- which is very hard to do if you're in D.C. My gosh, if I can run for president, surely anybody can, right? I wanted to beat you to it.BRUCE TURKEL, SPEAKER AND AUTHOR: He's taking the page exactly out of the Trump success story. We've already shown that Americas are willing to vote for a successful businessman, here's a guy whose built so many stores, you can see one of his stores from another one.MARSHA BLACKBURN, FORMER TENNESSEE CONGRESSWOMAN: We need to have privacy legislation. It's like the Wild West, without your consent. They share you, your virtual you online.ROGER MCNAMEE, ELEVATION PARTNERS MANAGING DIRECTOR: Their practice has been deny, deny, deny and then only admit to the bare minimum when they're forced too. They weren't paying attention, they have no idea what these guys did and they had years to mess with this data.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Money isn't an elective in life, it's a necessary skill. I'm not saying sit them down with spreadsheets and have them have pocket protectors for nine days but let's give them some skills in a fun way.MCDOWELL: Don't make fun of pocket protectors now. I always need a pocket protector in my jean jacket.CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR: Now we're flipping our name to iHob.BARTIROMO: Breakfast, how about breakfast?KEVIN KELLY, BENCHMARK MANAGING PARTNER: There you go. Nailed it.MCDOWELL: We can say Rooty Tooty Fresh N' Fruity.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: It sure was a great week this week. We want to check markets. We're off of the lows right now, Dow Industrial is down about 60 points, that's a quarter of a percent lower. This morning, we're expecting a lower opening from the NASDAQ as well, down 43 points right now, down two-thirds of a percent. Gary B. Smith, you like this market here?GARY B. SMITH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I do. I think it's remarkably in good shape Maria. I woke up this morning and I think the Futures as you've kind of implied, they were down almost 175.BARTIROMO: That's right. The lowest stock there.SMITH: It looks like it was going to be this morning. The market is showing a great deal of resiliency no matter what is thrown at it, I'm very positive.BARTIROMO: All right. We want to get to this breaking news, President Trump speaking to reporters as he left the White House moments ago, let's listen.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)TRUMP: Well you know it's coming out on my birthday, maybe that's appropriate, let's see it is. Look, he's a very dishonest man, I've been saying it for a long time.I think I did our country a great fire, a really great favor when I fired him and we'll see what happens. We'll see what the report says. But I guess it just got announced it's coming out on June 14th, so that will be maybe a nice birthday present, who knows.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you glad they (INAUDIBLE)TRUMP: We're going to deal with the unfair trade practices. If you look at what Canada and Mexico, the European Union, all of them have been doing good for many, many decades, we have to change it. And they understand it's going to happen.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What are you going to do if they formed an agreement without you?TRUMP: We are going to do very well. Now, if we're unable to make a deal, we'll terminate NAFTA, we'll have a better deal. If we are unable to make a deal, we will be better off. Right now, we are not going to leave with the deals the way they are.European Union treats us very unfairly, Canada very unfairly, Mexico very unfairly. With that being said, I think what probably very easily make a deal.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Why isn't --TRUMP: Go ahead.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Were you serious about this (INAUDIBLE)TRUMP: No, I didn't say that. I said I've been preparing all my life. I always believe in preparation but I've been preparing all my life. You know, these one week preparations, they don't work. Just ask Hillary what happened to her in the debate.So I've been preparing for this all my life and frankly, it's really just a fake news because if you run Peter just a little bit longer the clip, you would see I've really been preparing all my life, I said that. But apart, you know, the news doesn't pick that up because it's fake news.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you glad they caught the leaker?TRUMP: It's very interesting that they caught a leaker and a very important -- it's a very important leaker. So it's very interesting. I'm getting information on it now, happened last night, it could be a terrific thing. I know I believe strongly in freedom of the press, I'm a big, big believer in freedom of the press.But I'm also a believer in classified information has to remain classified and that includes Comey and his band of thieves who leaked classified information all over the place. So, I'm a very big believer in freedom the press but I'm also a believer that you cannot leak classified information.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you have a reaction to Anthony Bourdain's death?TRUMP: Yes. I think it's very sad. In fact, I want to extend to his family, my heartfelt condolences. That was very shocking. When I woke up this morning, Anthony Bourdain is dead. And I enjoyed his show, he was quite a character I will say. But -- so I just want to extend my condolences and also to the family of Kate Spade.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE)TRUMP: It may be. You could call it anything you want, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter what you call it. It used to be the G-8 because Russia was in it and now Russia's not in it. Now, I love our country, I have been Russia's worse nightmare.If Hillary got in, I think Putin is probably going, "Man, I wish Hillary won" because you see what I do. But, with that being said, Russia should be in this meeting. Why are we having a meeting without Russia being in the meeting? And I would recommend and it's up to them but Russia should be in the meeting, it should be a part of it.You know, whether you like it or not and it may not be politically correct, but we have a world to run and then the G-7, what used to b the G-8, they threw Russia out, they should let Russia come back in because we should have Russia at the negotiating table.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (INAUDIBLE)TRUMP: Say it, what?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (INAUDIBLE)TRUMP: I may leave a little bit early, it depends on the timing. But I may leave a little bit early and it depends what happens here. Look, all of these countries have been taking advantage of the United States on trade.You saw where Canada charges our dairy farmers, 270 percent tariffs. We don't charge them or if we do it, like a tiny percentage. So, we have to - - we have to straighten it out. We have massive trade deficits with almost every country. We would straighten that out and I'll tell you what, it's what I do, it won't even be hard. And in the end we'll all get along. But they understand and, you know, they're trying to act like, "Well, we fought with you in the war."They don't mention the fact that they have trade barriers against our farmers. They don't mention the fact that they're judging almost 300 percent tariffs. When it all straightens out, we'll all be in love again.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Will there be more pardons?TRUMP: There will be more pardons. I thought Alice yesterday was beautiful, I thought Jack Johnson which was recommended by Sylvester Stallone and some great boxers, I though Jack Johnson was a great one.I'm thinking about somebody that you all know very well and he went through a lot, and he wasn't very popular then --UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is it O.J.?TRUMP: And he wasn't very popular then -- no, I'm not speaking about O.J., but he's not -- only you could say O.J. But he's the -- was -- look, he was not very popular then, he's certainly -- his memory is very popular now, I'm thinking about Muhammad Ali. I'm thinking about that very seriously. And some others, and some folks that have sentences that aren't there, but I am thinking about Muhammad Ali.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What will it take for you to fire Comey?TRUMP: Like we're doing right now, recommendations on frank -- you know frankly, we're doing recommendations on Muhammad Ali.PETER: (INAUDIBLE)TRUMP: Say it Peter, what?PETER: (INAUDIBLE)TRUMP: No, no. No. No, I'm not above the law. I never want anybody to be above the law. But the pardons, they are very positive thing for a president. I think you see the way I'm using them and, yes, I do have an absolutely right to pardon myself. But I'll never have to do it because I didn't do anything wrong.And everybody knows it, there's been no collusion, there's been no obstruction, it's all a made up fantasy, it's a witch hunt, no collusion, no obstruction, no nothing. Now, the democrats have had massive collusion, massive obstruction and they should be investigated, we'll see what's happening. Yes.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (INAUDIBLE)TRUMP: I haven't even -- I haven't even thought about it. I haven't even thought -- I haven't thought about any of it. It certainly is far too early to be thinking about that.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. President --UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What about regulation --TRUMP: They haven't been convicted of anything, there's nothing to pardon. It's far too early to be -- it is far too early to be thinking about it.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. President, what would it take to (INAUDIBLE) Scott Pruitt to say enough?TRUMP: Well Scott Pruitt is doing a great job within the walls of the EPA. I mean, we're setting records outside and he's being attacked very viciously by the press and I'm not saying that he's blameless but we'll see what happens.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE) are you not tired of it?TRUMP: That's what I want to do. We have 3,000 names, we're looking at them. Of the 3,000 names, many of those names really have been treated unfairly. You know, this is a group of 3,000 that was -- we've assembled.And I would get more thrill out of pardoning people that nobody knows, like Alice yesterday, I thought Kim Kardashian was great because she brought Alice to my attention. Alice was so great and the way she left that jail and the tears and the love that she has with her family, I mean to me, that was better than any celebrity that I can pardon. So we're looking at it but we are looking at literally thousands of names of people that have come to our attention that have been treated unfairly or where their sentence is far too long.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE)TRUMP: I didn't invite them. No, I didn't invite Lebron James and I didn't invite Steph Curry. We're not going to invite either team. But we have other teams that are coming. You know, if you look, we had Alabama national champion, we had Clemson national champion, we had the New England Patriots, we have the Pittsburgh Penguins last year.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE)TRUMP: I think we'll have the Cavs. I mean, we'll see. You know my attitude, if they want to be here, it's the greatest place on earth, I'm here. If they don't want to be here, I don't want them.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE)TRUMP: I think if you look at what Paul Ryan is saying, it didn't come out that way. The fact is, they had people in our campaign, they had people doing things that have never been done in the history of this country and it really is a disgrace and frankly, that stuff is just starting to come out.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mitt Romney (INAUDIBLE)TRUMP: By who?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (INAUDIBLE)TRUMP: We'll see what happens. We'll see what happens.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What do you think about Mitt Romney? (INAUDIBLE) win again.TRUMP: Mitt Romney said what?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mitt Romney said you're going to find it easy to win again.TRUMP: Well, we're doing well. Look, Mitt's a straight shooter whether people love him or don't love him, Mitt --UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE)TRUMP: -- Mitt Romney is a straight shooter. And, yes, he had some very nice things to say, I appreciate that. That's good.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. President (INAUDIBLE)TRUMP: I love Canada but they treat us very unfairly on trade, very, very unfairly, you see the numbers. Almost 300 percent on dairy. So, they treat us very unfairly. Are you guys all going? You better get going Peter. We'll leave without you.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE)TRUMP: I would only do a deal if I get it through Congress. I wouldn't do it like Obama did. Unfortunately he wasn't able to get it through. You know, he tried to get it through, the Iran deal. He tried to get it through Congress, failed, so he just did it without which is why I was able to break it up so easy.And Iran is now a different country. They're not looking to the Mediterranean anymore. Iran is now a much different company -- country since I did, since I signed that out, Iran is a much different country.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you support Senator Gardner's (INAUDIBLE)TRUMP: I really do. I support Senator Gardner, I know exactly what he's doing, we're looking at it but I probably will end up supporting I guess.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The first lady is great, right there. She has to and she wanted to go. Can't fly for one month, the doctor say. She had a big operation. That was a close to a four hour operation. And she's doing great. I mean, right there. And you know what, she is a great first lady.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE)TRUMP: Terrible. That's -- we'll be talking to him but that's terrible. OK, any other questions?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (INAUDIBLE)TRUMP: Was one of my lawyers. Incredible that you can break into a lawyer's office, that's one thing I can say. And I think that's unfortunate that they broke into a lawyer's office. Not a good practice.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE)TRUMP: Well the democrats, this is a democrat bill. The democrats can end that very quickly. All they have to do is sit down with us and negotiate a real bill that allows us to keep criminals out of this country. It's very easy.You know, Schumer is the guy, he complains but he doesn't do anything. Schumer is a guy who is an obstructer. He can't do anything, all he can do is obstruct. All they have to do is call us and we'll draw a bill that gives us great border safety and security and is fair because I don't like the children being separated from the parents, I don't like it, I hate it. But that's a democrats bill that we're enforcing. We can change it in one day, all they have to do is come and see us.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (INAUDIBLE)TRUMP: I can't hear your question darling, too much competition. Go ahead.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (INAUDIBLE)TRUMP: (INAUDIBLE) you're not prepared. You -- I can't prepared she's not prepared. See, they're shocked, right?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (INAUDIBLE)TRUMP: We'll bring it up. Yes, we'll bring it up.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE)TRUMP: I have work. I have about 15 boxes of work. I will be able to work without being bothered by phone calls where people are writing fake stories about me and we have to respond. Now seriously, I mean I have a lot of work, it's on the plane, so that would be good.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you worried all about the things that (INAUDIBLE)TRUMP: Look, Rudy is great. But Rudy is Rudy. But Rudy is doing a very good job actually. Doing a very good job.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE)TRUMP: He said what?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He said (INAUDIBLE)TRUMP: I'm not going to disagree with him on that.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (INAUDIBLE)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE)TRUMP: I can't hear a word that he says.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Dennis Rodman (INAUDIBLE) North Korea.TRUMP: No, he wasn't but I like Dennis. A great rebounder. You know, when you think, Dennis was a great rebounder and he wasn't relatively speaking at all. So that tells you, you know, there's a rebounding -- there's a genius for that.Dennis Rodman was a great rebounder. One thing that we're thinking about, speaking f sports stars, the power to pardon is a beautiful thing, you got to get it right, you got to get the right people. I am looking at Muhammad Ali, but those are the famous people.And then one way it's easier and people find it fascinating but I want to do people that are unfairly treated like an Alice where she comes out and there's something beautiful. What I'm thinking to do, we have a lot of people in the NFL in particular but in sports league, they're not proud enough to stand for our national anthem, I don't like that. What I'm going to do is I'm going to say to them instead of talk, it's all talk, talk, talk, we have a great country, you should stand for our national anthem. You should go in a locker room when our national anthem is played.I am going to ask all of those people to recommend to me because that's what they're protesting. People that they think were unfairly treated by the justice system and I understand that. And I'm going to ask them to recommend to me people that were unfairly treated, friends of their or people that they know about and I'm going to take a look at those applications and if I find -- and my committee finds that they're unfairly treated, then we will pardon them or at least let them out.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Will you invite them to the White House in a roundtable (INAUDIBLE)TRUMP: You know, I don't have to do that. We're not looking to grandstand. We got enough grandstanders in this town. I'm just saying for the leaks, if they have people, if the players, if the athlete have friends of theirs or people that they know about that have been unfairly treated by the system, let me know.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE) to get a pardon.TRUMP: Well, you know, if you think about it, that's really -- that become celebrity advocates. But they know a lot of things that we're not going to know. They -- they have seen a lot of abuse and they've seen a lot of unfairness. So if they have, how do you like that idea David?DAVID: (INAUDIBLE)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (INAUDIBLE)TRUMP: Oh no, I have absolutely right. I don't have to do it. Never did anything wrong and you know that better than anybody.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you concerned about (INAUDIBLE)TRUMP: I think you have a double edge. Reporters can't leak, you cannot leak classified information. At the same time, we need freedom of the press but you cannot leak. Like Hillary Clinton did, like Comey did, you cannot leak classified information.If you look at the young sales, dossier, I mean he went to jail over not classified a much lower level. And it's very unfair that he goes to jail and that Comey is allowed to do it all over, it's very unfair. Thank you much. I'll see you in Canada.(END VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: All right. That was President Trump obviously on his way now to Quebec for the G-7. At which time, he'll stay there a day and then go on to Singapore. A lot of news that we just heard from President Trump. Dagen, he said that he's considering 3,000 names in terms of people to pardon. They've assembled a list of 3,000 and he also said Muhammad Ali was on that list.MCDOWELL: Muhammad Ali, I actually e-mailed Judge Napolitano about this because Muhammad Ali was sentenced to jail time for evading the draft in the last '60s because of his religion.Remember he -- his original name, Cassius Clay, converted to Islam, it's interesting because the Supreme Court over turned that decision against Ali, so I e-mailed the judge to ask what Muhammad Ali require a pardon because that -- of that initial court decision was overturned. Interesting question, but he covered so much ground.BARTIROMO: Yes, he did. He also got into trade, he got into the G-7 and this is going to be their first face-to-face meeting with our friends in Canada, Mexico, and the European Union.CAMPOS-DUFFY: And whether you agree with the president on the tariffs or not, you have to admit that in this interview and in every other interview, he looks like he is fighting for American industries. And that I think he will get political credit for.SMITH: Well exactly. And the other thing is, he is always brimming with confidence.BARTIROMO: Yes.SMITH: See, I wrote it down. He said about negotiation, "It's what I do. It won't be hard."BARTIROMO: That's the bottom line, we'll be right back. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. President Trump spoke moments ago before heading to the G-7 Summit in Canada. He said a lot of things from pardoning, looking at a list of 3,000 people to comments on trade, to economic growth. Gary, your thoughts.SMITH: Well, I think, you know, Trump understands one thing better than many other past presidents, in all these negotiations, he holds the cards. And what he's willing to do that other presidents don't seem to is a brilliant negotiating tactic. He's willing to walk away.BARTIROMO: Yes.SMITH: He's saying, "If I don't get it, fine, you know, I'm going to go do my thing." I think there's a genius in that.BARTIROMO: Yes, there is because he basically has this uncertainty around him and --SMITH: ExactlyBARTIROMO: -- people -- and countries don't know what's going to happen next. And you know what, I remember, it's the first time the president met President Xi from China was in Mar-A-Lago.And I remember when I interviewed the president last April and I asked him about that meeting and he told me about the chocolate cake moment when they were having this delicious chocolate cake and the waiter came over and just as President Xi was eating his delicious chocolate cake, the president said, "Oh, by the way, right now there are strikes on their way towards Syria."SMITH: Exactly.BARTIROMO: This -- and he told me that President Xi stopped, asked the translator to say it again.CAMPOS-DUFFY: Repeat it.BARTIROMO: Repeat it. And then he just continued eating his cake.MCDOWELL: Just -- a few things -- a few things about the comments, again, it's the G-7 with the G-6 united against the United States at this point particularly on trade --BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: -- and tariffs among others. And these are allies of ours. President Trump said he thinks that, you know, it used to be the G-8, Russia should be let back in to the G-7. Well, they were cut out of the G- 8 because they illegally invaded Ukraine. So let's remind the viewers of that.In terms of Muhammad Ali being pardoned, I e-mailed Judge Napolitano about this and he said the only point to pardon Ali would be political because his fans would love it and historical because he should never have been prosecuted for his political beliefs in the first place. But pardoning a man, even a legend like Muhammad Ali who has passed away -- whose conviction was overturned by the Supreme Court of the United States has zero legal effect. But it's certainly sends a message to everybody who admired Ali.CAMPOS-DUFFY: You said Maria that this was a wide-ranging interview. Pornography was actually brought up in its interview, they asked him about Giuliani's comment that --BARTIROMO: Oh, right.CAMPOS-DUFFY: -- that working in pornography is not a respectable occupation and the president responded, "I can't disagree with that." I can't disagree with that either. And it's interesting to see that when you're learning.BARTIROMO: (INAUDIBLE) Rudy is doing a good job and people are (INAUDIBLE)CAMPOS-DUFFY: Well -- and this whole conversation has put liberals on the -- they're now defending pornography, it turned to the liberal press right now. Many (INAUDIBLE) are defending pornography as a respectable institution. Talk about putting liberals (INAUDIBLE) I mean, they're defending MS-13 and pornography on Trump.BARTIROMO: Right. We'll be right back, a fact.BARTIROMO: What a show, thanks everybody. Great to see you. Gary B. Smith, Rachel Campos-Duffy and --MCDOWELL: Three words, SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES.BARTIROMO: SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES. We'll see you on Sunday. Have a great weekend everybody, thanks for being here. Varney & Co. begins now, Stuart, take it away.Load-Date: June 8, 2018End of Document

The9 Limited Announces Receipt of Nasdaq Notice of DeficiencyPR NewswireApril 9, 2018 Monday 5:00 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 656 wordsDateline: SHANGHAI, April 9, 2018 BodyThe9 Limited (Nasdaq: NCTY) ("The9" or the "Company"), an established Internet company, today announced that it received a notification letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. ("Nasdaq") dated April 4, 2018 indicating that the Company no longer meets the continued listing requirement of minimum Market Value of Listed Securities ("MVLS") for the Nasdaq Global Market, as set forth in the Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(A) because the market value of the Company's securities listed on Nasdaq for the last 30 consecutive business days was below the minimum MVLS requirement of US$50,000,000. Staff notes that the Company also does not meet the requirements of minimum total assets and total revenue of US$50,000,000 each for the most recently completed fiscal year or two of the three most recently completed fiscal years, as set forth in the Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b)(3)(A).Pursuant to Rule 5810(c)(3)(C) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules, the Company has a compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until October 1, 2018 (the "Compliance Period"), to regain compliance with Nasdaq's minimum MVLS requirement. If at any time during the Compliance Period, the Company's MVLS closes at US$50,000,000 or more for a minimum of ten consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide the Company a written confirmation of compliance and the matter will be closed. In the event the Company does not regain compliance with Rule 5450(b)(2)(A) prior to the expiration of the compliance period, the Company will receive written notification that its securities are subject to delisting from the Nasdaq Global Market.The Company's management is looking into various options available to regain compliance and maintain its continued listing on The Nasdaq Global Market, and is also considering other options, including a potential transfer of its listing of securities to the Nasdaq Capital Market. The Nasdaq Capital Market is a continuous trading market that operates in substantially the same manner as the Nasdaq Global Market where listed companies must meet certain financial requirements and comply with Nasdaq's corporate governance requirements.Safe Harbor StatementThis announcement contains forward-looking statements.

The state and central governments of various countries are placing high focus on the development and adoption of advanced systems in high-traffic locations such as public roads, transit stations, and malls, contributing to the growth of the electronic security market. For instance, the Indian government in 2014 set up a USD 125 million fund solely devoted to the prevention of sexual violence among women through the installation of security equipment such as surveillance systems at high-risk public locations. These hardware systems are equipped with video analytics and advanced algorithms that allow the detection of criminals. Furthermore, technological advancements have also aided in the improvement of existing technologies such as high-resolution 4k cameras and IP surveillance units.Request a sample of this premium report at:https://www.marketstudyreport.com/request-a-sample/668596/Crime rates across the world are heavily impacted with the rising penetration of these systems in residential and commercial settings and is anticipated to drive the electronic security market growth. End-users across the world are replacing conventional security systems such as guards and physical body checks with high-tech solutions. Physical body checks in malls and airports can be cumbersome and increase customer discomfort, primarily among women. X-ray body scanners, on the contrary, requires the person to pass through an electronic frame.The rising trend of the development of smart cities in countries such as China and India is contributing to the high growth of the electronic security market. For instance, the Chinese government has undertaken large construction projects for the development of smart cities imbued with advanced security solutions in cities such as Dalian, Hangzhou, Nanjing, and Tianjin. The rise in traveler population across the world is also leading to the growth of the electronic security market.The surveillance and alert system market is anticipated to exhibit substantial growth during the forecast timeframe. The reduction in component and raw material costs is contributing to the decline in the electronic security market price trend. Remote monitoring systems are increasingly finding application in developed regions such as U.S and Western Europe. Installing a home security solution with remote monitoring capabilities allows the homeowner to access security cameras and video units situated inside the residential location in real-time.Public-sector applications are the largest revenue-generating segment. Various government bodies are making use of advanced solutions for surveillance and criminal detection applications. For instance, in September 2017, a police department in Arkansas was reported to be using drones for highly specialized missions such as the tracking of a suspect or obtaining an inside view and additional information in a hostage situation.Request a discount on standard prices of this premium report at:https://www.marketstudyreport.com/check-for-discount/668596/The North America electronic security market is projected to dominate the global business landscape owing to the government initiatives to integrate these systems into their public safety segment. For instance, the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 contains provisions to make the unmanned aerial systems (UAS) licensing process easier and quicker for law enforcement officials. Various U.S states are currently conducting trial operations on drones to understand their capabilities and their operational efficiency.Players operating in the global electronic security market include Axis Communications, BOSCH Security Systems, Hitachi Ltd, OSI Systems, Inc., SDMS Security Products UK Ltd., Siemens AG, MilliVision Technologies, ASSA ABLOY, Scanna MSC Ltd., Thales Group, RedXDefense LLC, etc. Industry players conduct strategic moves such as mergers and acquisitions to sustain growth.

REP. CAPUANO'S E-UPDATE FOR MAY 18, 2018States News ServiceMay 18, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1722 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the office of Massachusetts Rep. Michael Capuano:May 18, 2018Thoughts and Prayers Arent EnoughThis morning, when Texas students should have been looking forward to summer or graduation, they are instead grieving the tragic deaths of their friends. And all Americans are mourning lives lost in another school shooting. The time for action is long past. We owe it to every family traumatized by the murder of precious loved ones, every survivor who will never fully recover from witnessing gun violence. Congress must strengthen gun laws and I will do everything I can to press for action on common sense reform.Community Meeting in DorchesterOn Tuesday May 29th from 6:30 8:00 PM Im holding a community meeting at the Ray and Joan Kroc Corps Community Center, located at 650 Dudley Street in Dorchester. I hope you can join us to talk with me and your neighbors about the issues that are important to you. Well also broadcast on Facebook live for those who cant attend in person.Telephone Community MeetingThanks to those who joined us for a telephone community meeting. We are posting audio files on our website if you werent able to call in and would like to listen to the discussion. There is one more coming up on Wednesday May 23rd from 7:00 8:00 PM. If youd like to participate on the 23rd, just call 877-229-8493 and use PIN 116139. If youd like to ask me a question, press *3 after joining the meeting. I hope you can join us.GazaAny decent person feels anguish over the heartbreaking loss of life at the Gaza border. I opposed President Trumps moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem because I thought it would provoke violence and so it has. I am deeply troubled by reports that Hamas is urging thousands of Gazans to enter Israel and march to Jerusalem. I believe Israel, like every country, has a right to defend its territory - but the Israeli Defense Force should minimize the use of deadly force against protesters, using it only when no reasonable alternative exists. It is deeply regrettable that the Trump Administration is exacerbating tensions in a troubled region and doing nothing to encourage negotiations that might lead to a two-state solution. I am in complete agreement with the letter sent by Senators Sanders, Warren, Markey and others calling on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to "do more to alleviate the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip.An Attempt to Slash SNAP FundingToday House Republicans failed in their attempt to pass a farm bill that would have ripped $23 BILLION from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the food stamp program. H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018 went down to defeat in the House because of opposition from some conservative Republicans. H.R. 2 does much more than simply fund Agriculture Department programs. It contains damaging environmental provisions such as eliminating the Conservation Stewardship Program, limiting endangered species protections and increasing access to federal lands for timber harvesting. The damage to the SNAP program is significant. Cuts of this magnitude will make it much harder for low income families to provide nutritious meals for their families. Almost 2/3 of the nutrition assistance program covers children, seniors and the disabled. Todays vote result was a small victory but this bill will be back. I voted NO. H.R. 2 did not pass and the entire vote is recorded below:YEA NAY PRESENT NOT VOTINGREPUBLICAN 1983007DEMOCRAT 0183010TOTAL 198213017MASSACHUSETTSDELEGATION 0801Codifying Existing LawOn Wednesday the House considered H.R. 5698, the Protect and Serve Act. This legislation establishes a new federal offense related to the intentional targeting of law enforcement professionals for the purposes of doing harm. There was much that could have been added to this bill to make it more comprehensive, but it is already a crime at the federal and state level to target a member of the law enforcement community. This legislation simply codifies aspects of the law at the federal level. I voted YES. H.R. 5698 passed by a wide bipartisan margin. The entire vote is recorded below:YEA NAY PRESENT NOT VOTINGREPUBLICAN 2201103DEMOCRAT 1622407TOTAL 38235010MASSACHUSETTSDELEGATION 9000Creating Uncertainty in Veterans ProgramsOn Thursday the House considered S. 2373, the VA MISSION Act of 2018. This legislation updates the Veterans Choice Program, primarily by consolidating a series of care programs into one large initiative. I have several concerns with the way S. 2373 seeks to address veterans care. It transforms funding for the Veterans Choice Program from mandatory to discretionary but does not address the spending constraints required by the Budget Control Act. This could mean cuts to existing veterans programs or changes to eligibility requirements for some services. The legislation also establishes an Asset and Infrastructure Review Board that would study every existing VA medical facility from clinics to hospitals and make a determination regarding their viability. This puts essential veterans facilities at risk of closure, limiting care options. The legislation also makes it easier to privatize veterans healthcare services. S. 2373 just creates too much uncertainty regarding maintaining and improving essential care for our veterans. I voted NO. S. 2373 passed and the entire vote is recorded below:YEA NAY PRESENT NOT VOTINGREPUBLICAN 231003DEMOCRAT 11670010TOTAL 34770010MASSACHUSETTSDELEGATION 6300Behind the Curtain More House and Trump Administration Actions You Dont Want to MissHere are this weeks additions. If you need to catch up or share with friends, you can find the full list here.In May of 2018 the Trump Administration announced its intention to take federal funding away from any medical facility that provides abortion services. This is directed at Planned Parenthood. Federal law already prohibits taxpayer funds from being used for abortion services. This money that Trump is taking away covers preventive medical care such as pap tests, mammograms and other cancer screenings. Its not just women that this policy impacts. Men also obtain preventive care and cancer screenings from Planned Parenthood clinics. Trumps rule also prevents medical professionals working at facilities receiving federal funds from even talking to their patients about abortion or referring them anywhere else. It is a really outrageous action on a long list of outrageous actions from this administration one that inserts itself between a patient and doctor and limits access to potentially life-saving diagnostic and preventive care.According to a May 2018 Washington Post report, the Trump Administration is not complying with an Obama Administration Executive Order (EO) related to drone strikes. The order requires an annual report with information on how many individuals have been killed as a result of these counterterrorism strikes, including civilians. The intent of the EO was to add a measure of transparency and accountability to U.S. un-manned strikes in Libya and elsewhere. Instead, the Trump Administration is acting like the EO doesnt exist.According to May 2018 media reports, the Trump Administration is basically terminating investigations into for-profit colleges. Education Secretary DeVos hasnt officially ended the probes, but by reassigning investigators, directing them to work on other issues and minimizing their efforts, she doesnt have to take formal steps. Investigators were looking into numerous issues including how schools present employment statistics to students. Maybe one of the reasons DeVos is hitting the brakes on this is because Julian Schmoke is in charge of the investigators (BtC #149). He was a Dean at the for-profit DeVry University. The schools parent company, Adtalem Global Education, paid $100 million as a result of a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) complaint that DeVry was not honest with students about employment opportunities and salary data. So Schmoke leaves a for-profit college fined millions of dollars for a job with Trump overseeing investigations of for-profit colleges, then the investigations mysteriously grind to a halt. Coincidence?According to a May 2018 Politico report, the Trump Administration is interfering in scientific decisions regarding dangerous chemicals in water supplies. The Department of Health and Human Services Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry conducted a study of certain chemicals found in water near military bases and chemical plants around the country. The agency determined that the chemicals tested are dangerous at a level lower than the EPA previously determined. The administration was concerned releasing the report would be a public relations nightmare according to emails sent in January. So they directed the agency not to release the report, which is still not public. This is deeply troubling on so many levels. The Trump administration is playing politics with science and the public health.In May of 2018 Trump took great interest in a cell phone company partially owned by the Chinese government. The company ZTE, has a concerning profile. The United States military just prohibited the use of ZTE cell phones on their bases due to security concerns, including worries that military members could have their movements tracked through the phones. ZTE was fined over a billion dollars last year for violating U.S. sanctions against North Korea and Iran. ZTE has also been prohibited from purchasing U.S. materials for their products which created great financial difficulty for the company. After the Chinese government invested in a project in Indonesia that the Trump Organization is also investing in, Trump tweeted: Too many jobs in China lost. Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done! So Trump orders his Commerce Department to help a Chinese owned cell phone company with a questionable history after China helps his company out financially. What shall we call this? Is it a violation of the Constitutions emoluments clause or something else?Whats Up NextThe next votes will take place on Monday May 21st.

House Commerce Committee Issues Hearing Memo on Quantum ComputingTargeted News ServiceMay 16, 2018 Wednesday 6:40 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1978 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe House Energy and Commerce Committee issued the following hearing memorandum:TO: Members, Subcommittee on Digital Commerce and Consumer ProtectionFROM: Committee Majority StaffRE: Hearing entitled "Disrupter Series: Quantum Computing"I. INTRODUCTIONThe Subcommittee on Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection will hold a hearing on Friday, May 18, 2018, at 9:15 a.m. in 2322 Rayburn House Office Building. The hearing is entitled "Disrupter Series: Quantum Computing."II. WITNESSES* Michael Brett, CEO, QxBranch;* Christopher Monroe, Chief Scientist and Founder, IonQ, Inc. and Professor of Physics, University of Maryland;* Matthew Putman, CEO, Nanotronics. Inc.; and* Diana Franklin, Director of Computer Science Education, the University of ChicagoIII. BACKGROUNDA. Quantum ComputingQuantum computing has been described as "harnessing and exploiting the amazing laws of quantum mechanics to process information."1 Traditional computers operate through instructions that use a binary system represented by the numbers 0 and 1; these numbers represent the "off" or "on" position of a logic gate on an integrated circuit.2 These positions can be expressed using binary digits (or "bits") stored in a computer's memory; when expressed they represent the control of the flow of energy through the circuit. Individually a bit can exist in one of two possible states (on/off).3By contrast, quantum computers "use quantum bits, or qubits, to encode information as 0s, 1s, or both at the same time. This superposition of states-along with the other quantum mechanical phenomena of entanglement and tunneling-enables quantum computers to manipulate enormous combinations of states at once."4 Venture capital firms have invested $147 million in quantum computing startups and governments around the world have invested $2.2 billion in technology that is expected to change how professionals in a variety of industries address problems that require a massive amount of computing power today-from stronger encryption for sensitive transactions to improving battery density technology for electric vehicles.5i. Quantum MechanicsQuantum mechanics is a theory of physics that describes the behavior of matter and light at atomic and subatomic levels. As described by Richard Feynman, one of the leading physicists of the 20th Century:"Quantum mechanics" is the description of the behavior of matter and light in all its details and, in particular, of the happenings on an atomic scale. Things on a very small scale behave like nothing that you have any direct experience about. They do not behave like waves, they do not behave like particles, they do not behave like clouds, or billiard balls, or weights on springs, or like anything that you have ever seen.6Unlike in Classical or Newtonian physics, which allows for the prediction of the movement of bodies at a larger-than-atomic scale with accuracy to a reasonable state of approximation,7 quantum mechanics holds that it is impossible to know both the precise position and precise momentum of a quantum object. Instead, the more that is known about one of these variables, the less that can be known of the other. This theory, know as the Heisenberg Uncertain Principal (HUP) after its discoverer Werner Heisenberg, is a consequence of the fact that at the most fundamental level, matter and light operate as both particle and wave.8The wave-particle duality described in the HUP lies at the heart of quantum mechanics.A consequence of the theory is that at a fundamental level matter and light can only be described probabilistically; it is impossible to know both the position and momentum of a quantum object because the object exists in all possible states simultaneously until it is measured (or observed) - a concept known as superposition.9As noted by Natalie Wolchover:The orthodox view of quantum mechanics . . . holds that particles play out all possible realities simultaneously. Each particle is represented by a 'probability wave' weighting these various possibilities, and the wave collapses to a definite state only when the particle is measured.10Another fundamental concept of quantum mechanics is the idea of quantum entanglement, which holds that particles can interact in such a way that a change to the quantum state of one particle will necessarily result in an equal but opposite change to its entangled twin.11 As described by the physicist John Stewart Bell, quantum entanglement appears to violate the principle of locality, meaning that quantum entangled particles will simultaneously demonstrate changes to their quantum state regardless of the distance separating them.12 This remains true whether the entangled particles are separated across a room or across the universe.13The implications of quantum mechanics are described by Professor Feyman:We would like to emphasize a very important difference between classical and quantum mechanics. We have been talking about the probability that an electron will arrive in a given circumstance. We have implied that in our experimental arrangement (or even in the best possible one) it would be impossible to predict exactly what would happen. We can only predict the odds! This would mean, if it were true, that physics has given up on the problem of trying to predict exactly what will happen in a definite circumstance. Yes! physics has given up. We do not know how to predict what would happen in a given circumstance, and we believe now that it is impossible-that the only thing that can be predicted is the probability of different events. It must be recognized that this is a retrenchment in our earlier ideal of understanding nature. It may be a backward step, but no one has seen a way to avoid it.14ii. The Use of Quantum Mechanics in ComputingThe use of quantum mechanics as a basis for computation creates new possibilities in terms of the speed at which results can be calculated.As noted by Joseph Altpeter:Quantum computers are fundamentally different from classical computers because the physics of quantum information is also the physics of possibility. Classical computer memories are constrained to exist at any given time as a simple list of zeros and ones. In contrast, in a single quantum memory many such combinations-even all possible lists of zeros and ones-can all exist simultaneously. During a quantum algorithm, this symphony of possibilities split and merge, eventually coalescing around a single solution.15Traditional bits can at one time be in only one of two states (0 or 1; "off" or "on"). Superposition allows a qubit to exist in all states simultaneously. This means that the computational power of a qubit increases exponentially:(a) 2-qubit machine allows you to do four calculations at once. A 3-qubit machine can do eight calculations. A 4-qubit machine gives you 16 calculations, all simultaneously. By the time you get to 300 qubits, you've got a computer that can do more 'calculations' than there are atoms in the universe.16The ability to run billions of calculations using all available data at the same time would allow analysis of problems that were previously deemed incalculable because of time constraints.17B. The Current State of Quantum Computer DevelopmentQuantum computing has attracted a great deal of interest both within the United States as well as abroad. According to a 2017 report by the consulting firm Deloitte, "in the last three years, venture capital investors have placed $147 million with quantum computing startups" and "governments globally have provided $2.2 billion in support to (quantum computer) researchers."18 Private-sector leaders in the area include IBM, QxBranch LLC, Ionq, Google, MagiQ Technologies, Rigetti Computing, and Station Q- Microsoft, all based in the United States, as well as D-Wave Systems Inc. and 1QB Information Technologies Inc., both from Canada.19 In addition to private sector initiatives, there are dozens of universities engaged in quantum computing research world-wide.20 In the U.S., leading academic centers for quantum research include MIT,21 the University of Southern California,22 and the University of Maryland.23Outside of the U.S., China is a leading source of quantum computing research. The Chinese government has invested $20 billion in a national laboratory for quantum sciences, which is scheduled to open in 2020.24 The Chinese companies Baidu, Alibaba Group Holdings, and Tencent Group Holdings are also working on quantum computers, with Alibaba announcing in February 2018 the opening of a quantum computing cloud platform for researchers that operates on an 11-qubit processor.25 The Chinese government has announced plans to lead the world in quantum-enable technologies: in August 2016, the country launched the world's first quantum satellite, called Micius, and used it for conducting experiments such as a quantum- secured video conference call between Beijing and Vienna, Austria.26In 2016, the European Union announced a "quantum flagship" program to advance the technology in the Union. The program is aiming for achieving a "ramp-up" phase by this year, which will ultimately result in one billion euros joint public-private investment over a ten-year period.27C. Quantum computing applicationsThe potential ability of a quantum computer to process multiple calculations simultaneously makes it particularly well suited to some of the most complex problems faced by programmers. These include the "optimization" problem, which involves finding the best of all possible solutions among various alternatives; machine learning derived from detecting patterns among large datasets; materials simulation, which involves the modelling of materials at the atomic and smaller level; and "Monte Carlo" simulations, which requires the repeated random sampling of simulations to predict the probability of a given outcome.28Applying these advantages to real world problems, a quantum computer could help logistics companies find optimal routes for parcel delivery, reducing both time and expense;29 personalized medicine and drug development, where it might be possible to model candidate molecules and genetic factors for faster drug discovery;30 and other areas including financial services, aerospace engineering, data storage optimization, electric battery design and oil and gas exploration.31Cryptography has the potential to be massively disrupted by quantum computing. Underlying one of the mostly widely used methods of encrypting electronic data is the use of prime factorization (the reduction of a larger number into its factorials, where those factorials are both prime numbers). Calculating the factorials of a large number scales rapidly exceeds the capacity of classical computers: for example, a 128-bit advanced encryption standard (AES) cipher is for all purposes unbreakable today given the volume of possibilities needed to guess with a brute-force attack to break the encryption.32 However, using the power of quantum computing to decode the same 128-bit AES cipher could take as little as six months.33 The potential of a quantum computer to decode formerly impenetrable data has spurred both public and private efforts to develop new forms of encryption.34IV. ISSUESThe following issues may be examined at the hearing:* What are some of the uses of a quantum computer, what advantages would a quantum computer hold over conventional computers, and what dangers would it present?* What are the barriers to the development of a commercially available quantum computer?* Where does the United States stand in relation to other nations in developing a commercially available quantum computer?V.

Huawei moving on from U.S. market following FCC voteFierceWirelessApril 17, 2018 Tuesday 12:30 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Questex Media Group LLC All Rights ReservedSection: ARTICLELength: 1085 wordsByline: Mike DanoHighlight: Huawei appears to have largely given up on the U.S. market. The company has reportedly laid off a chunk of its top U.S. officials including William Plummer—actions that preceded a vote by the FCC today to withhold federal money from equipment suppliers “that raise national security concerns,” according to the agency.BodyHuawei appears to have largely given up on the U.S. market. The company has reportedly laid off a chunk of its top U.S. officials including William Plummer—actions that preceded a vote by the FCC today to withhold federal money from equipment suppliers “that raise national security concerns,” according to the agency.According to The New York Times, Huawei last week laid off five American employees including Plummer, who had served for years as Huawei’s top representative in the U.S. market in Washington and at various industry and media events.Further, this this week at a Huawei analyst event in China, the company’s deputy chairman Eric Xu essentially acknowledged that Huawei has been largely blocked from the U.S. market, noting that “with some things, when you let them go, you actually feel more at ease.”It’s worth noting, though, that Huawei continues to move forward as the world’s largest supplier of network equipment. During its event this week, the company announced its 5G-oriented SingleRAN Pro solution that supports 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G, and the company            also said its first 5G smartphone will be released in the third quarter of next year. Interestingly, though, the company’s management also sought to lighten the focus on 5G: “If you look across our entire portfolio, 5G is just one product,” Huawei’s Eric Xu said,            according to ComputerWeekly. “It’s just a natural evolution of the technology from 2G to 3G to 4G, and now we’re going to have 5G, but you don’t have a fundamental difference between 5G and 4G.”Huawei’s apparent final withdrawal from the U.S. market is noteworthy considering the rising momentum against the company. Huawei and ZTE were singled out in a 2012 government report warning that equipment from the two Chinese companies could be used by the Chinese government for espionage. More recently, both AT&T and Verizon            reportedly dropped plans to sell smartphones from Huawei, and the FCC            embarked on a proposal to tacitly block any network operator—big and small—from using Universal Service Funds to purchase equipment from companies that pose a security threat.Indeed, that last issue was brought to a vote today during the FCC’s monthly open meeting, and the five-member commission voted unanimously to move forward with the action. The agency said it will also consider how best to implement the proposal, what types of equipment and services should be covered by the proposed rule, and “how the FCC should identify, and how USF recipients can learn, which suppliers are covered by the proposed rule.”Indeed, the FCC’s notice goes slightly beyond its initial scope to include potential additional threats: “The Notice now explores a broader set of options for remedying any threats that we identify,” explained Commissioner Brandan Carr in a statement. “For instance, we now ask about more than just USF-funded equipment. And the Notice now tees up additional remedies from testing regimes (which have been employed by some of our closest allies) to actions related to the removal or prospective deployment of equipment.”For example, Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel pointed to recent reports that foreign powers are using “Stingrays” to eavesdrop on cell phone communications in Washington, D.C. “These surveillance tools can transform cell phones into real-time tracking devices by mimicking legitimate cell towers and some may even have the technical capability to record the content of calls,” Rosenworcel said in her own statement. “If these reports are true, someone needs to explain how foreign actors are transmitting over our airwaves without approval from this agency. Someone also needs to explain whether the devices being used have been certified by the FCC. The security of our communications is at stake right here, right now in Washington and this agency owes the public more than silence.”The FCC's vote on the issue generated both cheers and criticism.“Many small carriers serve the most costly, remote and hard-to-reach areas, and provide low-income Americans with affordable device options," said CCA President and CEO Steven Berry in a statement. "Any proposed solution should be cognizant of significant economic hardships on many operators, but also, and perhaps most concerningly, must consider rural and low-income consumers’ choice of viable, affordable devices, in an already very limited market.  The government’s actions have injected uncertainty at a time when carriers need stability, and CCA fears this will impact the United States’ efforts to bring wireless broadband services to rural areas and win the global race to 5G."“NTCA continues to evaluate the extent to which proposals and questions in the notice might affect member operations," noted NTCA CEO Shirley Bloomfield in a statement. "NTCA is hopeful that this process will identify with precision any concerns about security of the nation’s networks and seek to address them thoughtfully and appropriately.”"Any effective solution will require close partnership with all parts of the broader technology sector, as well as government agencies that have the necessary deep expertise and experience to evaluate national security risks associated with particular vendors, equipment and services," said USTelecom President and CEO Jonathan Spalter in a statement. "If the Commission prevents the use of universal service support for purchases of communications equipment from vendors deemed to pose a national security threat, rural carriers will continue to benefit from a competitive marketplace for equipment that includes a number of trusted suppliers.And Cinnamon Rogers, TIA’s Senior Vice President of Government Affairs, said in a statement: "TIA takes supply chain security very seriously and supports the Commission’s efforts to address concerns regarding specific vendors. However, we also appreciate the Commission’s recognition that addressing security concerns requires cooperation across the federal government in partnership with industry. We look forward to working with the Commission on these issues.”This week’s actions sit in the wider context of a brewing trade war between China and the United States—one that could get much more heated. “If the U.S. continues to work against this trend, we will be prepared, we will be ready and we will launch our countermeasures,” a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson told The Wall Street Journal,            in discussing the Commerce Department’s recent action against ZTE.Article updated April 17 with additional commentary.Load-Date: April 20, 2018End of Document

Former CIA Officer Charged With Conspiracy to Commit EspionageTargeted News ServiceMay 8, 2018 Tuesday 8:30 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 836 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: ALEXANDRIA, Virginia BodyThe Acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Tracy Doherty-McCormick, issued the following news release:A federal grand jury returned an indictment today charging a former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) case officer with one count of conspiracy to gather or deliver national defense information to aid the People's Republic of China, and two counts of unlawfully retaining documents related to the national defense."The allegations in this case are troubling," said Tracy Doherty-McCormick, Acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. "Conspiring with foreign agents poses a real and serious threat to our national security. The United States will hold accountable those who conspire to compromise our national security."Jerry Chun Shing Lee, 53, of Hong Kong, is a U.S. citizen who speaks fluent Chinese. According to allegations in the indictment, Lee was a case officer for the CIA until 2007. After leaving the CIA, Lee resided in Hong Kong. In April 2010, two Chinese intelligence officers (IOs) approached Lee and offered to pay him for information. The taskings allegedly requested that Lee provide documents and information relating to the national defense of the United States. According to the indictment, the IOs provided Lee with a series of email addresses so that he could communicate covertly with them. The indictment further alleges that Lee prepared documents responsive to the taskings, made numerous unexplained cash deposits, and repeatedly lied to the U.S. government during voluntary interviews when asked about travel to China and his actions overseas. Lee received taskings from the Chinese IOs until at least 2011."When government officials violate their oath to defend our nation and protect its secrets, the National Security Division will hold them accountable," said John C. Demers, Assistant Attorney General for National Security. "Lee, a former CIA case officer, allegedly conspired to provide information to the Chinese government about the national defense of the United States. Lee's alleged actions betrayed the American people and his former colleagues at the CIA. We will not tolerate such threats to our country or its national security."In August 2012, Lee and his family left Hong Kong to return to the United States to live in northern Virginia. While traveling back to the United States, Lee and his family had hotel stays in Hawaii and Virginia. During each of the hotel stays, FBI agents conducted court-authorized searches of Lee's room and luggage, and found that Lee was in unauthorized possession of materials relating to the national defense. Specifically, agents found two books containing handwritten notes that contained classified information, including but not limited to, true names and phone numbers of assets and covert CIA employees, operational notes from asset meetings, operational meeting locations and locations of covert facilities. Agents also found a thumb drive on which was stored a document later determined to contain information classified at the Secret level. During voluntary interviews with the FBI, Lee admitted preparing the document in response to taskings from the IO."Espionage is a serious crime that can expose our country to grave danger" said Nancy McNamara, Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI's Washington Field Office. "The FBI will continue to aggressively pursue all allegations of espionage."Lee is charged with one count of conspiracy to gather or deliver national defense information to aid a foreign government, and two counts of unlawfully retaining documents related to the national defense. He faces a maximum penalty of life in prison, if convicted. Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after taking into account the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.Tracy Doherty-McCormick, Acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, John C. Demers, Assistant Attorney General for National Security, and Nancy McNamara, Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI's Washington Field Office, made the announcement.

Scam Advisory On Recent Spate Of Kidnap Scams Involving Foreign StudentsASEAN TribuneJune 16, 2018 SaturdayCopyright 2018 ASEAN Tribune All Rights ReservedLength: 714 wordsBody 16 June 2018 (Singapore Police Force) Over the past 2 days, the Police have received three reports where parents and guardians reported on the kidnap of Chinese national students in Singapore.The modus operandi of such scams is as follows:Step 1: Victims, typically Chinese national students, received unsolicited calls from strangers informing that they are government officials. These calls usually employ caller-ID spoofing technology and may look like they are from official government hotline numbers such as '110' or '999'.Step 2: Victims were then informed that they had committed criminal offences and were required to assist in criminal investigations by doing any of the following, in order to prove that the money they owned was legitimate. Victims were asked to withdraw their money and pass it to strangers or transfer the money via cryptocurrency cash deposit machine or to another bank account. Victims were instructed to update their whereabouts to the scammers over the next few days. Thereafter, the syndicate would inform the victims to change their SIM cards and log out from their social media messenger. Victims also gave their personal information on their families in China to scammers who made use of such information to cheat their parents.Step 3: Scammers contacted victims' parents who are based overseas, to inform that their children were kidnapped and demand payment of ransoms.For one of the reports, a female Chinese national studying in Singapore received an unsolicited call on 11 June 2018 from a scammer who claimed to be a Chinese government official. The scammer alleged that the victim is involved in a child smuggling case and requested for her to assist in their criminal investigation. Acting on the scammer's instructions, the victim withdrew S$22,010 from her bank account and handed the monies to an unknown man. She also withdrew another S$4,800 to purchase cryptocurrencies for the scammers. Subsequently, the victim was instructed to provide her personal information, including details of her family in China, to them. The victim was then instructed not to contact anyone in the days that followed. The scammers then contacted her parents to claim that their daughter had been kidnapped by them in Singapore. Even though there was no monetary loss suffered by the victim's parents, the scammers have managed to instil fear and helplessness into them.Police take a serious view against any person who may be involved in scams, whether knowingly or unwittingly. Anyone found to be involved in such scams will be subjected to Police investigations. Under the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act, any person who is guilty of knowingly assisted in dealing with the monies derived from criminal conduct shall be liable upon conviction to a fine not exceeding $500,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or to both.Police would also like to advise members of the public to take the following precautions when they receive unsolicited calls, especially from unknown parties: Ignore such calls and the caller's instructions. No government agency will instruct payment through a telephone call or other social messaging platforms (WeChat or Facebook); or ask you for personal banking information such as your internet banking passwords For foreigners receiving calls from persons claiming to be from Police in your home country, call your Embassy/High Commission to verify the claims of the caller. Refrain from giving out personal information and bank details, whether on the website or to callers over the phone. Personal information and bank details such as internet bank account usernames and passwords, OTP codes from tokens, are useful to criminals. Do not make any funds transfer. Call a trusted friend or talk to a relative before you act. You may be overwhelmed by emotion and err in your judgment.If you have any information related to such crime, please call the Police hotline at 1800-255 0000, or dial '999' for urgent Police assistance.To seek scam-related advice, members of the public may call the anti-scam helpline at 1800-722-6688 or go to www.scamalert.sg. Please share this advisory with your family and friends to prevent them from being the next scam victim.Load-Date: June 19, 2018End of Document

US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was clearly told that it is now up to the US to smooth things over and avoid a trade war, diplomats said after the meetings ahead of the main G7 summit in Canada next week. "We still have a few days to take the necessary steps to avoid a trade war between the EU and the US, and to avoid a trade war among G7 members," French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told reporters. Canada and the EU have both filed cases at the World Trade Organization challenging tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium imports to the US announced by Trump on Thursday. Mexico is also affected by the tariffs. Canada has threatened to impose retaliatory tariffs on the US on items including agricultural products, which could hit rural areas of the US, where Trump has many supporters. The EU has said the bloc will also apply tariffs in retaliation.----------China warned at the end of a top-level meeting with US trade officials Sunday that deals will not take effect if Washington goes ahead and enacts tariffs on Chinese imports. The statement came an hour after a meeting between US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He aimed at finding ways to narrow the countries' trade deficit. Ross, who arrived Saturday in Beijing for two days of talks, said at the beginning of the meeting he had had "friendly and frank" discussions about specific export items with Chinese officials. But after the two teams wrapped up discussions at the Diaoyutai state guesthouse, they left without making any statements to journalists. China's state-run Xinhua news agency later published a Chinese government statement that the two sides had made "positive and concrete progress" and had had "good communication" in areas such as agriculture and energy. Nevertheless, the deals negotiated by the two teams "will not take effect" if the US enacts threatened tariffs on Chinese imports, Xinhua said.----------North Korea should not be rewarded simply for agreeing to participate in dialogue about its nuclear weapons programme, the Japanese defence minister said on Saturday. "In light of how North Korea behaved in the past, it is important not to reward it solely for agreeing to have dialogue," Japanese Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera said. Onodera made the comments during a plenary session at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an international security forum in Singapore. After days of back and forth, US President Trump announced on Friday that he would meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12 to discuss nuclear disarmament. Just eight days earlier, Trump abruptly withdrew from the meeting, citing Pyongyang's "open hostility".----------BROKER RATING CHANGES----------HSBC RAISES GVC HOLDING TO 'BUY' ('HOLD') - TARGET 1135 (880) PENCE----------COMPANIES - FTSE 100----------DS Smith has offered to acquire Spanish-listed packaging business Europac for EUR16.80 per share, valuing the whole company's equity at EUR1.67 billion and giving an enterprise value including debt of EUR1.90 billion. For 2017, Europac reported revenue of EUR868 million and earnings before interest, tax, deprecation and amortisation of EUR158 million. The acquisition will be financed by a rights issue to raise GBP1.00 billion to be launched in June, plus a debt facility of EUR740 million. The rights issue is fully underwritten by Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and has not yet been priced. Subject to shareholder and regulatory approval, the acquisition is expected to be completed in the last quarter of 2018, DS Smith said. So far DS Smith has received undertakings to accept the acquisition from 59% of the entire share capital of Europac. DS Smith said that since the start of the current financial year on May 1, its group performance has continued to be in line with management expectations.----------COMPANIES - FTSE 250----------CYBG said it is in discussions with Virgin Money Holdings over a revised proposal to acquire the fellow challenger bank, increasing its offer to 1.2125 CYBG shares for each Virgin Money share, which would give Virgin Money shareholders a 38% interest in the combined group. The offer reflects a 7.0% increase in the exchange ratio, compared to the previous terms, which was 1.1297 CYBG shares for each Virgin Money share. ----------Airline Wizz Air Holdings reported year-on-year increases in traffic statistics for May. Capacity rose to 3.1 million seats from 2.6 million the same month the year before. It carried a higher number of passengers at 2.8 million, up 18% from 2.4 million. Load factor rose by 0.8 percentage point to 91.9% from 91.1%.----------COMPANIES - INTERNATIONAL----------Italian bank UniCredit is considering a merger with France's Societe Generale, the Financial Times reported. While no formal offer has yet been made, officials from both banks are in the early stages of talks, the newspaper said. UniCredit CEO Jean-Pierre Mustier, who is French and a former SocGen executive, has been developing the plan for months, the FT said. UniCredit and SocGen are among Europe's biggest banks, each with a market cap of around EUR32 billion.----------Commonwealth Bank of Australia said it reached an agreement with AUSTRAC, the Australian government's financial intelligence agency, to resolve the civil proceedings commenced by AUSTRAC in the Federal Court of Australia back in August 2017. The agreement follows Court-ordered mediation between CBA and AUSTRAC and remains subject to Court approval. As part of the agreement, CBA will pay a civil penalty of AUD700 million together with AUSTRAC's legal costs of AUD2.5 million.----------The board of German pharmaceutical and agriculture goods giant Bayer on Sunday approved the sale of 74.6 million shares as it raises the cash to complete its acquisition of US seed and fertilizer firm Monsanto. Company officials said they hope to raise EUR6 billion. The shares are expected to sell at a price of EUR81.

Robotics Market ForecastsPR NewswireMay 28, 2018 Monday 9:48 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 721 wordsDateline: LONDON, May 28, 2018 BodyConsumer Robots, Enterprise Robots, Industrial Robots, Healthcare Robots, Military Robots, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, and Autonomous VehiclesDownload the full report:https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/5402902The robotics market continues to experience a profound and significant restructuring as the traditional industrial robotics sector continues toshrink as an overall percentage of the total robotics industry. According to Tractica's estimates, non-industrial robots represented 70% of the$39.3 billion robotics market globally in 2017, growing from a 64% share in 2016. Most of this growth is being driven by segments like consumer,enterprise, healthcare, military, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and autonomous vehicles. Consequences of this shift are already beginning toplay out, evidenced by the recent acquisition of traditional industrial robot company KUKA by Chinese consumer electronics manufacturer Midea.The epicenter of robotics continues to shift from the traditional centers of Japan and Europe toward the emerging artificial intelligence (AI)hotbeds of Silicon Valley and China. AI technologies like deep learning, computer vision, and natural language processing (NLP) are revolutionizingautonomy and UI/UX capabilities in robots.China is already a powerhouse in industrial robotics with 60% of the revenue share, however the Chinese government has plans in place that put it on atrajectory to lead the market for non-industrial robots by 2025. Tractica anticipates that China will be the leading market for consumer robots, enterpriserobots, and autonomous vehicles by 2025. This trend is in line with China's goal of becoming the leading player in AI, for which it is establishing afoundation that includes home-grown AI semiconductor companies, robust software, and hardware platforms that can leverage AI in a range of commercialhardware products, and a scalable ecosystem of large and small companies that feed into the cycle of innovation. Apart from the rise of China, there area number of other significant trends that are likely to reshape the robotics market, with 16 of the 23 robot categories expected to be multi-billion-dollar markets by 2025.This Tractica report covers the global market for robotics, including consumer robots, enterprise robots, industrial robots, healthcare robots, militaryrobots, UAVs, and autonomous vehicles. These categories are further segmented into 23 robot application markets. Market data within the report includes robotshipments and revenue segmented by world region, application market, and enabling technology. The technologies included in the attach rate analysis are machinevision, voice/speech recognition, gesture recognition, and tactile sensors. The forecast period for this report extends from 2017 through 2025.Key Questions Addressed:What will be the key drivers of robotics market growth between 2017 and 2025?How do declining prices for industrial and non-industrial robots impact their revenue potential in the future?How does demand vary among world regions for both industrial and non-industrial robots?What is the Chinese strategy for leading the robotics market of the future?What is the impact of smart speakers on the consumer robot market?What will be the attach rates of technologies such as machine vision, voice and speech recognition, gesture control, and tactile sensors for each application market?What are the product rollout and adoption timelines for the newer robot categories such as logistics robots, customer service robots, exoskeletons, UAVs, and autonomous vehicles?Who Needs This Report?Robot manufacturersSemiconductor and component suppliersSoftware and application developersAutomotive manufacturersEnterprise and industrial robotics end-user organizationsSystems integratorsIndustry organizationsGovernment agenciesInvestor communityDownload the full report:https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/5402902AboutReportbuyerReportbuyer is a leading industry intelligence solution that provides all market research reports from top publishersFor more information:Sarah SmithResearch Advisor at Reportbuyer.comEmail:sarah@reportbuyer.comTel: +1 (718) 213 4904Website:           http://www.reportbuyer.com View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/robotics-market-forecasts-300655419.htmlSOURCE ReportBuyerLoad-Date: May 29, 2018End of Document

War games 'very provocative'? To S. Korea, so is calling them off; President Trump's decision to call of an annual joint military exercise with South Korea has led some analysts to question if outreach to Kim signals a US retreat from the region.The Christian Science MonitorJune 21, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 Christian Science Publishing Society All Rights ReservedSection: WorldLength: 1121 wordsByline: Michael Holtz Staff writerBodyThe military exercises that the United States holds with South Korea every summer, code-named Ulchi Freedom Guardian, have been a vital part of the two countries' alliance since the 1970s. They're also one of the largest military exercises in the world. They lasted for 11 days last year and involved some 17,500 American forces and 50,000 South Korean troops.The main goal of the exercises, which rely heavily on computer simulations, is to ensure that the two militaries are prepared for a sudden crisis, namely an attack by North Korea. They also send a strong message about American commitment to its allies in the region - a commitment that has been called into question following President Trump's dismissal of the exercises as a waste of money, and their formal suspension earlier this week.Pyongyang routinely decries such exercises as rehearsals for an invasion. It had threatened to call off its June 12 summit with the US, and did call off a meeting with Seoul, over the "Max Thunder" drills in May. This summer's exercises would have been "very provocative," Mr. Trump said at the Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un last week. That's where he first indicated he would suspend the "war games," "unless and until" talks on Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program show signs of trouble.But to critics, suspending Freedom Guardian - particularly without consulting Seoul - threatens to erode the trust holding two longtime allies together. And as countries like Japan and South Korea lose confidence in American commitments to the region, they say, others stand to win: China and North Korea.The US president has surprised many people in his negotiations with North Korea. In late May, he abruptly canceled his June 12 meeting with Mr. Kim, only to announce eight days later it was back on. Both then and again last week, officials in Seoul were caught off guard. "The meaning and intention of President Trump's remarks requires more clear understanding," the office of South Korean President Moon Jae-in said in a statement after the summit.The Pentagon officially announced the military exercises' suspension on Monday. The South Korean Defense Ministry followed on Tuesday, saying it was necessary to put them on hold to support ongoing talks with Pyongyang."South Korea and the US made the decision as we believe this will contribute to maintaining such momentum," Choi Hyun-soo, the ministry's spokeswoman, told the Associated Press.Eroding the relationshipAnalysts warn that Trump's seat-of-the-pants decision-making threatens to erode the relationship between Washington and Seoul. More broadly, it raises questions about whether his outreach to Kim signals an American retreat from the region."If this had been coordinated beforehand with South Korea and Japan, and then it was announced, that would have been one thing. But it was completely the opposite," says Lisa Collins, a fellow at the Office of the Korea Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. "I think there's a lot of concern that not consulting our allies was a huge mistake on the part of Trump that just basically gives more leverage to China and North Korea in the end."To some extent, South Korean officials have grown accustomed to Trump's unpredictability, Ms. Collins says. But, she says, "there are people in Seoul who believe that there is enough history in the alliance and enough people in the Trump administration who can influence Trump to keep the alliance grounded. At least for now."Trump's perspective on the alliance has been clear since his 2016 campaign, when he first said he wanted to withdraw American troops from South Korea. Without any forewarning to Seoul, he reiterated his desire to eventually do so after the summit in Singapore.Officials in Seoul have sought to minimize the damage. The decision to suspend Ulchi Freedom Guardian appears to leave room for routine training between American and South Korean troops that takes place throughout the year. Defense officials in both countries told reporters that no decisions have been made on any other military exercises, including live-fire drills that usually take place in the spring.Driving a wedgeStill, analysts say that the decision to suspend the exercises, combined with Trump's stated desire to withdraw American troops from South Korea, have exacerbated concerns about the country's long-term security, and the region's. Lee Seong-hyon, a research fellow at the Sejong Institute in Seongnam, South Korea, warns that while it's too early to know the full implications of the suspension, it could alter the balance of power in East Asia."It's more than weakening the US-ROK alliance," Mr. Lee says in an email, referring to the Republic of Korea, South Korea's formal name. "It will weaken the US leadership role in the region."Since the end of World War II, the US has maintained a firm foothold in East Asia and provided security assurances to its allies there. It has 28,500 troops stationed in South Korea and 54,000 in Japan. Long considered a stabilizing force in the region, the US, according to Lee, may now be abdicating that role, much to the delight of China."China sees the US alliance structure in the region as the major institutional device by Washington to contain China," Lee says. Under President Xi Jinping, China aims to supplant the US as the predominant power in Asia. Beijing has long called for an end to joint military drills between the US and South Korea and the removal of American troops from the Korean Peninsula.The decision to suspend this summer's military exercises "could be something that actually helps China and North Korea more than it helps the negotiation process with North Korea," Collins says."North Korea and China will take any opportunity they get to drive a wedge between the US and South Korea," she adds. "Their ultimate goal is to have the alliance broken up and for US military forces to leave the region."While Trump continues to test the US-South Korea relationship, Mr. Xi has been working to shore up China's alliance with North Korea. On Wednesday, Kim concluded a two-day tour of China, his third visit since March, during which Xi lauded the "positive" outcome of the Singapore summit and promised strong support."No matter how the international and regional situations change, the firm stance of the [Chinese Communist Party] and the Chinese government on consolidating and developing the relations with [North Korea] remains unchanged," Xi told Kim, according to Xinhua, China's state news agency. "The Chinese people's friendship with the [North Korean] people remains unchanged, and China's support for the socialist [North Korea] remains unchanged."Load-Date: June 21, 2018End of Document

3D Non-Volatile Memory Patent Landscape Analysis 2018 Featuring SanDisk/Western Digital, Micron Technology, SK Hynix, Toshiba, Samsung & Macronix International - ResearchAndMarkets.comBusiness WireApril 19, 2018 Thursday 12:07 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Business Wire, Inc.Distribution: Business EditorsLength: 659 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "3D Non-Volatile Memory Patent Landscape Analysis" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.This report has thoroughly investigated the patents related to 3D non-volatile memories and draws a picture of the current patent landscape and its potential evolution. SanDisk/Western Digital, Samsung and Toshiba are leading the 3D NVM patent landscape. They hold together more than 65% of the patents, Western Digital and Toshiba signed a JV extension until 2029, and Samsung and Western Digital renewed a patent cross-license agreement until 2024. On the other hand, we witnessed the emergence of Chinese players in the IP landscape.Identify Key IP PlayersThis report reveals the relative strengths of the top patent owners derived from their portfolio size, patent citation networks, countries of patent filings, and current legal status of patents. Through this in-depth analysis, each of 6 major market players are profiled in this report: SanDisk/Western Digital, Micron Technology, SK Hynix, Toshiba, Samsung, Macronix International.Each profile includes a detailed portfolio analysis with IP dynamics, IP strategies and key patents linked to 3D NAND products. The 3D non-volatile memory patent landscape involves big companies, and this closed domain is very difficult to enter for newcomers.Nevertheless Chinese companies are entering the landscape thanks to their financial means and will maybe change the 3D NVM development of further 3D memory layers. Note that equipment manufacturers like Applied Materials, Tokyo Electron and Lam Research have less than 20 patents related to a 3D non-volatile memory.Identify Key TechnologiesThe 3,400 patent families selected for this study have been categorized by memory types and main architectures. This report reveals the IP strategy and technical choices of patent assignees. We analyzed the current IP position of key players regarding the type of memory (Flash, MRAM, ReRAM, PCRAM) and the architecture (vertical, cross-point). Some companies concentrate on one memory type such as Micron Technology on PCRAM as we expect it with the research on 3D Xpoint Memory. Others like SanDisk are involved in several 3D Non-Volatile Memories.Focus On ChinaWith all the funds invest by Chinese government in Memory, YMTC/YRST developed last year old generation 3D NAND 36L and try to catch up with major companies. However we can ask us, where do Chinese companies get their IP ? The China memory-related IP landscape is analyzed (2D, 3D, DRAM, SRAM, Flash, Emerging Memories) in order to understand the IP trends and technologies owned by Chinese players such as XMC, YRST, Tsinghua Unigroup, SMIC, etc. We also investigated what IP do the major companies involved in China have like Samsung, SK Hynix or Intel.Useful Patent DatabaseThis report also includes an Excel database containing the >9,400 patents analyzed in this study. This useful patent database allows multi-criteria searches and includes for each patent its publication numbers, the hyperlink to the original document, its priority dates, title, abstract, patent assignees, memory types/architectures, and current legal status.Key Topics Covered:1.

COTTON WARNS ABOUT THE THREAT OF HUAWEI AND ZTEStates News ServiceJune 13, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 873 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton:I ask consent to have a colloquy with the senator from Maryland.Thank you, Mr. President. The Senator and I have done a lot of work together on an issue that is a genuine threat to our national security. And that's the threat of Chinese telecom companies stealing our technology, infiltrating our telecom networks, and hacking into the data not just of our government or our military but also private citizens.Earlier this year I asked the directors of all four major intelligence agencies-the CIA, the NSA, the FBI, and the DIA-if they would use products made by Huawei or ZTE. None of them raised their hand. And I said, well, that may be unfair, you are the leader of an American intelligence agency. What about members of your family, or your neighbors, your friends, church members. Not a single one of them recommended that they use a Huawei or ZTE product. I hope all of you up in the gallery are not using a Huawei or ZTE product, if you are, you might want to go out and buy a different one.And that's because these companies are dangerous to our national security and to your privacy. Huawei and ZTE are nothing more than extensions of the Chinese Communist Party. Huawei's CEO was an engineer for the People's Liberation Army. The company's livelihood consists largely of a steady stream of government contracts. And its greatest claim to fame is shamelessly stealing the secrets of American companies. That's why it's under the investigation by the Department of Justice for that and for violating sanctions against Iran.And ZTE is no better. It broke our laws by doing business with North Korea and Iran and it lied about it to U.S. investigators. That makes it a repeat offender. That's why General Nakasone, the new director of the NSA, committed at his confirmation hearing, to educating all of our allies about the threat that companies like Huawei and ZTE pose to the civilized world.Given this history, I suggest that it would be reckless to let Huawei and ZTE infiltrate their products into our country's critical communications infrastructure. Whether it's routers or switches or any other kind of equipment, allowing them to do so would give the Chinese government a backdoor into our first-responder networks, our electric grid, and a lot more than that.That's why the Federal Communications Commission proposed a rule to prohibit the use of Universal Service Funds to buy equipment from these firms and why I and a number of other members have urged the Department of Agriculture to do the same thing with RUS funds.These companies have proven themselves to be untrustworthy, and at this point I think the only fitting punishment would be to give them the death penalty-that is, to put them out of business in the United States. The only reason Huawei is the second-largest smartphone maker in the world and ZTE the fourth though is because we've let them run wild for too long. We've given them access to our markets even as they've broken our laws and abused the rights of our citizens. But if we refuse to do business with them, things would change very quickly, believe me.Which is why Senator Van Hollen and I introduced our amendment, that was adopted earlier this week. It would prohibit all federal agencies from buying any kind of equipment or services from Huawei, ZTE, or any related companies. It would also prohibit any American company from receiving U.S. taxpayer dollars in the form of grants or loans, should they use Huawei or ZTE products. And finally, our amendment would reinstate the original denial order for the purchase of American goods and service on ZTE to hold it accountable for breaking our laws.And I would say I don't see this amendment as contradictory or harmful to the administration's strategy when it comes to China or North Korea. If anything, I think it's complementary. This administration after all originally imposed the death penalty in the form of a denial order against ZTE. After Xi Jinping pleaded for life without parole, so to speak, the administration agreed to a very tough series of actions. This is the first real concrete action the United States has taken against Huawei and ZTE, but I and the Senators in this chamber believe the death penalty is the appropriate penalty.Just as our maximum-pressure campaign brought North Korea to the table, strengthening our sanctions on ZTE will show China that we are finally serious about stopping its theft of our intellectual property, preventing it from infiltrating our communications network, and from violating the privacy rights of our citizens. If we weaken sanctions against ZTE, we will signal to China, and to the rest of the world, that they can act contrary to our sanctions with impunity.That's a message that we cannot afford to send and that's why I'm pleased that the Senate agreed to include our amendment in the National Defense Authorization Act.And now, I'd like to conclude by turning to the Senator from Maryland, with whom I've worked in such a constructive fashion on this matter, not only on this legislation but in the Senate Banking Committee and ask him how he sees the threat posed by Huawei, ZTE, and companies like them.Load-Date: June 14, 2018End of Document

JinkoSolar Announces First Quarter 2018 Financial ResultsPR NewswireJune 26, 2018 Tuesday 6:30 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 4498 wordsDateline: SHANGHAI, June 26, 2018 BodyJinkoSolar Holding Co., Ltd. ("JinkoSolar" or the "Company") (NYSE: JKS), a global leader in the solar PV industry, today announced its unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.First Quarter 2018 HighlightsTotal solar module shipments were 2,015 megawatts ("MW") (including 209 MW to be used in the Company's overseas downstream solar projects for which no revenue has been recognized), a decrease of 18.8% from 2,481 MW in the fourth quarter of 2017 and a decrease of 2.6% from 2,068 MW in the first quarter of 2017.Total revenues were RMB4.57 billion (US$728.1 million), a decrease of 28.1% from the fourth quarter of 2017 and a decrease of 20.9% from the first quarter of 2017.Gross margin was 14.4%, compared with 11.6% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 11.2% in the first quarter of 2017.Income from operations was RMB125.0 million (US$19.9 million), compared with RMB91.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and RMB56.8 million in the first quarter of 2017.Net income attributable to the Company's ordinary shareholders was RMB3.6 million (US$0.6 million) in the first quarter of 2018, compared with RMB22.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and RMB60.6 million in the first quarter of 2017.Diluted earnings per American depositary share ("ADS") were RMB0.096 (US$0.016).Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's ordinary shareholders in the first quarter of 2018 was RMB11.0 million (US$1.7 million), compared with RMB41.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and RMB80.0 million in the first quarter of 2017.Non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS were RMB0.300 (US$0.048) and RMB0.296 (US$0.048) in the first quarter of 2018, compared with RMB1.272 and RMB1.232 in the fourth quarter of 2017 and RMB2.536 and RMB2.508 in the first quarter of 2017.Mr. Kangping Chen, JinkoSolar's Chief Executive Officer commented, "We shipped 2,015MW of solar modules during the quarter and generated total revenues of $728.1 million. Our gross margin increased to 14.4%, compared with 11.6% last quarter as we benefit from the drop in polysilicon prices and the further optimization of our manufacturing costs as a result of continued technological improvement and reduced OEM usage.""The new policies regulating the solar industry jointly issued by three Chinese ministries on May 31, affected market sentiment and our ASPs. These new policies are aimed at increasing the pace of achieving grid parity, accelerating the removal of outdated capacity and releasing the pressure of new energy fund deficits. As a result, we expect to see a decline in prices across our industrial supply chain which will allow us to further cut both silicon and non-silicon costs during the second half of the year to offset the decline in the ASPs. Despite the strong initial reaction to the new policies, we remain optimistic about the demand of the Chinese market for the full year 2018, which is expected to hit 35G+. Looking into 2019, aside from the Top Runner Program, poverty alleviation and DG projects, we expect to see a large number of grid parity projects under new business models appear in the second of half of 2019.""We already have great visibility for the full year 2018 with over 80% of our order book already filled, which is mostly made up of overseas orders with fixed prices throughout the year, and we have already received a number of prepayments. Our production capacity is fully utilized now and is expected to remain so during the second half of the year. We believe the Chinese government's new policies to have relatively limited impact on our operations over the short term, and we remain confident in our future business prospects and the long-term growth of the industry overall.""Overseas orders will account for about 80% of our overall shipments for the entire year demonstrating our expanding global footprint and the success we have seen in reducing our reliance on any single market. Solar is becoming more and more competitive worldwide. We saw resurgent demand in Southern European markets such as Spain, Portugal and Italy, driven by grid-parity business model, as well as booming demand in new emerging markets such as Latin American, the Middle East and North Africa. We expect to see demand in India rebound strongly as module price goes down." "While the policy changes in China have created a challenging domestic market environment, our extensive global sales network and geographically dispersed manufacturing facilities allow us remain flexible and be prepared to rapidly adapt to any future policy changes. We are fully prepared for the market consolidation and the new era of grid parity.

The sequential decrease was mainly attributable to a decrease in the shipment of solar modules in the first quarter of 2018. The year-over-year decrease was mainly attributable to a decrease in solar module shipments and a decline in the average selling price of solar modules in 2018.Adoption of New Revenue Standard:On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted new revenue guidance ASC Topic 606, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers", and applied the modified retrospective method to contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018.No cumulative catch up adjustment of initially applying this standard was recognized at the date of initial application on January 1, 2018.Adoption of the new standards related to revenue recognition had no impact on the Company's reported results for the current period.Gross Profit and Gross MarginGross profit in the first quarter of 2018 was RMB656.1 million (US$104.6 million), compared with RMB735.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and RMB649.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. The sequential decrease was mainly attributable to a decrease in the shipment of solar modules in the first quarter of 2018. The year-over-year increase was mainly attributable to decreasing solar module cost, which was partially offset by a decrease in solar module shipments in 2018.Gross margin was 14.4% in the first quarter of 2018, compared with 11.6% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 11.2% in the first quarter of 2017. The sequential and year-over-year increases were mainly attributable to a decrease in silicon cost in the first quarter of 2018, which was partially offset by a decline in the average selling price of solar modules in the first quarter of 2018.Income from Operations and Operating MarginIncome from operations in the first quarter of 2018 was RMB125.0 million (US$19.9 million), compared with RMB91.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and RMB56.8 million in the first quarter of 2017. Operating margin in the first quarter of 2018 was 2.7%, compared with 1.4% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 1.0% in the first quarter of 2017.Total operating expenses in the first quarter of 2018 were RMB531.1 million (US$84.7 million), a decrease of 17.5% from RMB644.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and a decrease of 10.3% from RMB592.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. The sequential decease was mainly due to a decrease in shipping cost as a result of decreased solar module shipments, and a decrease of bad debt expenses attributable to the reversal of allowance for doubtful accounts upon subsequent collections. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to a decrease in shipping costs.Total operating expenses accounted for 11.6% of total revenues in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 10.1% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 10.3% in the first quarter of 2017.Interest Expense, NetNet interest expense in the first quarter of 2018 was RMB85.4 million (US$13.6 million), an increase of 53.8% from RMB55.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and an increase of 49.5% from RMB57.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. The sequential and year-over-year increases were due to interest expense associated with discounted notes receivable and an increase in borrowings.Exchange Gain / (Loss), NetThe Company recorded a net exchange loss (including change in fair value of forward contracts) of RMB90.8 million (US$14.5 million) in the first quarter of 2018, compared to a net exchange loss of RMB33.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and a net exchange loss of RMB5.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. The sequential and year-over-year losses were primarily due to the continued depreciation of the US dollar against the RMB during the quarter.Income Tax Expense / (Benefit), NetThe Company recorded an income tax benefit of RMB3.3 million (US$0.5 million) in the first quarter of 2018, compared with an income tax expense of RMB31.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and an income tax expense of RMB1.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. The sequential and year-over-year change was due to one of the Company's PRC subsidiaries receiving a tax deduction certificate in the first quarter of 2018, entitling the subsidiary to income tax deductions for 2017 and 2018.The Company recorded an out-of-period adjustment of RMB4.6 million (US$0.7 million) in the first quarter of 2018 resulting from income tax benefits for one of its PRC entities, which should have been recorded in 2017. Neither the originating amount in 2017 nor the out-of-period adjustment amount recorded in 2018 was material to the Company's consolidated financial statements for the respective periods.Net Income and Earnings per ShareNet income attributable to the Company's ordinary shareholders was RMB3.6 million (US$0.6 million) in the first quarter of 2018, compared with RMB22.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and RMB60.6 million in the first quarter of 2017.Basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share were RMB0.025 (US$0.004) and RMB0.024 (US$0.004), respectively during the first quarter of 2018. This translates into basic and diluted earnings per ADS of RMB0.100 (US$0.016) and RMB0.096 (US$0.016), respectively.Non-GAAP net income in the first quarter of 2018 was RMB11.0 million (US$1.7 million), compared with RMB41.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and RMB80.0 million in the first quarter of 2017.Non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share were RMB0.075 (US$0.012) and RMB0.074 (US$0.012), respectively during the first quarter of 2018. This translates into non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS of RMB0.300 (US$0.048) and RMB0.296 (US$0.048), respectively.Financial PositionAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had RMB2.86 billion (US$456.6 million) in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, compared with RMB2.76 billion as of December 31, 2017.As of March 31, 2018, the Company's accounts receivables due from third parties were RMB4.18 billion (US$667.0 million), compared with RMB4.50 billion as of December 31, 2017.As of March 31, 2018, the Company's inventories were RMB4.71 billion (US$750.2 million), compared with RMB4.27 billion as of December 31, 2017.As of March 31, 2018, the Company's total interest-bearing debts were RMB8.38 billion (US$1.34 billion), compared with RMB7.43 billion as of December 31, 2017.FirstQuarter 2018 Operational HighlightsSolar Module ShipmentsTotal solar module shipments in the first quarter of 2018 were 2,015 MW, including 209 MW to be used in the Company's overseas downstream solar projects.Solar Products Production CapacityAs of March 31, 2018, the Company's in-house annual silicon wafer, solar cell and solar module production capacity was 9.0 GW, 5.0 GW and 9.0 GW, respectively.Recent Business DevelopmentsIn March 2018, JinkoSolar and NextEra Energy announced a supply deal for millions of solar panels and that JinkoSolar will be opening its first U.S. factory in Jacksonville, Florida.In April 2018, JinkoSolar announced that it was named Energy Yield Simulation Winner - Polycrystalline Group at the 4th All Quality Matters Solar Congress hosted by TÜV Rhineland in Wuxi, China.In April 2018, JinkoSolar announced that it supplied solar modules for America's largest solar PV plant in Mexico.In April 2018, JinkoSolar announced that it signed a renewed credit agreement with HSBC (China) Co., Ltd. to increase its credit limit to $47 million from $25 million.In May 2018, JinkoSolar announced that its P-type monocrystalline cell broke the world record again with efficiency hitting 23.95% during certification testing done by the Photovoltaic and Wind Power Systems Quality Test Center at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).In May 2018, JinkoSolar announced that the 60P version of its P-type PV module peak power broke the world record again with power exceeding 370w and the N-type PV module peak power reaching 378.6w.

SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE VOTES 23-2 TO REBUKE TRUMP ON ZTE REPRIEVEUS Fed NewsMay 22, 2018 Tuesday 4:39 PM  ESTCopyright 2018 HT Media Ltd. All Rights ReservedLength: 654 wordsBodyWASHINGTON, May 22 -- The office of Sen. Jack Reed issued the following news release:In an effort to protect national security and send a strong, bipartisan rebuke of the Trump Administration's reported framework to lift restrictions on Chinese telecommunications company ZTE, the Senate Banking Committee today voted 23-2 to limit President Trump's ability to remove the sanctions without first certifying to Congress that the company is complying with U.S. law.U.S. Senator Jack Reed (D-RI), a senior member of the Banking Committee, voted in favor of the measure and says President Trump should put America's national security and American jobs first. Senator Reed also said that President Trump should enforce American laws and hold China accountable."There is serious, bipartisan concern about President Trump going soft on ZTE and putting American interests at risk. Today, the Banking Committee sent a strong signal to the President that if he won't take steps to protect American national and economic security then we will," said Senator Reed.U.S. intelligence, trade regulators, and the Pentagon have all warned that ZTE, China's second-largest manufacturer of telecommunications equipment, poses a significant cyber security risk for the United States and that their devices may be used as a vehicle by the Chinese government to conduct espionage. Earlier this month, the Department of Defense halted the sale of all smartphones, routers, modems, and other hardware that contain any equipment manufactured by ZTE. And the Trump Administration's own Treasury and Commerce departments found that ZTE illicitly sold sensitive hardware incorporating American technology to Iran and North Korea and tried to mislead American investigators in clear violation of U.S. sanctions against those countries.However, that did not stop President Trump from personally seeking relief for ZTE. On May 13, President Trump tweeted: "President Xi of China, and I, are working together to give massive Chinese phone company, ZTE, a way to get back into business, fast. Too many jobs in China lost. Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done!"Today, Reed joined several colleagues in sending a letter the Secretaries of the Treasury and Commerce Departments and to the U.S. Trade Representative expressing concern over reports that they are entertaining China's request to loosen tech transfer rules for China, writing: "we strongly urge you to reject any proposal by China to loosen existing restrictions on the export or other transfer of these sensitive U.S. technologies. Any such move would bolster China's aggressive military modernization and significantly undermine long-term U.S. national security interests."The letter, which was led by U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) also noted: "In addition, we urge you not to compromise lawful U.S. enforcement actions against serial and pre-meditated violators of U.S. law, such as ZTE. This is particularly critical when the violators are state-owned and -influenced, part and parcel of China's policies and practices designed to strengthen its own national security innovation base, and essential tools of efforts to spread China's influence in other countries that pose national security threats to the United States. Export control and sanctions laws should not be negotiable, because fidelity to the rule of law is a key part of what distinguishes the U.S. from a country like China that is ruled by a Communist dictatorship."Additionally, Senator Reed authored two successful amendments with Senator Mark Warner (D-VA) to the underlying Foreign Investment Risk Review Act (FIRRMA) legislation to enhance national security by improving cooperation with our allies and focusing efforts on identifying emerging and foundational technologies.

LONDON MARKET PRE-OPEN: DS Smith Makes Takeover Offer For EuropacLive Briefs PRO Global MarketsJune 4, 2018 Monday 2:44 AM ESTCopyright 2018 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 900 wordsBody Stock prices are set to open higher on Monday, following strong gains by Asian markets overnight and ahead of UK construction data at 0930 BST, as the day in London got underway with more merger & acquisition activity.Packaging firm DS Smith proposed to acquire European packaging business Europac for EUR1.67 billion, funded by a rights issue. Clydesdale & Yorkshire Bank owner CYBG upped its all-share offer to merge with fellow FTSE 250 constituent Virgin Money Holdings.Meanwhile, Wizz Air reported an increase in passenger traffic in May.IG says futures indicate the FTSE 100 index of large-caps to open 26.77 points higher at 7,722.40 on Monday. The FTSE 100 index closed up 0.2% at 7,695.63 on Friday.Sterling was quoted at USD1.3372 early Monday ahead of the UK construction PMI reading, firm against USD1.3350 at the London equities close on Friday."Whilst US index futures remain upbeat, the dollar is showing some signs of strain, dropping 0.1% overnight. The softer dollar is helping the pound claw back lost ground as it pulls USD1.34 into sight," says Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital. "Pound traders looking towards the construction PMI this morning, may be disappointed. The rebound in April following a particularly weak March is set to ease in May, with the PMI easing back to 52 from 52.5. A softer than forecast reading could see the pound aim back down towards USD1.33 and pull house builder stocks lower." FTSE 100 packaging firm DS Smith has offered to acquire Spanish-listed packaging business Europac for EUR16.80 per share, valuing the whole company's equity at EUR1.67 billion and giving an enterprise value including debt of EUR1.90 billion. For 2017, Europac reported revenue of EUR868 million and earnings before interest, tax, deprecation and amortisation of EUR158 million.The acquisition will be financed by a rights issue to raise GBP1.00 billion to be launched in June, plus a debt facility of EUR740 million. The rights issue is fully underwritten by Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and has not yet been priced.Subject to shareholder and regulatory approval, the acquisition is expected to be completed in the last quarter of 2018, DS Smith said. So far DS Smith has received undertakings to accept the acquisition from 59% of the entire share capital of Europac. DS Smith said that since the start of the current financial year on May 1, its group performance has continued to be in line with management expectations.In the FTSE 250, CYBG said it is in discussions with Virgin Money Holdings over a revised proposal to acquire the fellow challenger bank, increasing its offer to 1.2125 CYBG shares for each Virgin Money share, which would give Virgin Money shareholders a 38% interest in the combined group.The offer reflects a 7.0% increase in the exchange ratio, compared to the previous terms, which was 1.1297 CYBG shares for each Virgin Money share. Airline Wizz Air Holdings reported year-on-year increases in traffic statistics for May. Capacity rose to 3.1 million seats from 2.6 million the same month the year before. It carried a higher number of passengers at 2.8 million, up 18% from 2.4 million. Load factor rose by 0.8 percentage point to 91.9% from 91.1%.Italian bank UniCredit is considering a merger with France's Societe Generale, the Financial Times reported. While no formal offer has yet been made, officials from both banks are in the early stages of talks, the newspaper said. UniCredit CEO Jean-Pierre Mustier, who is French and a former SocGen executive, has been developing the plan for months, the FT said.The international economic events calendar on Monday has eurozone producer prices at 1000 BST and South Africa business confidence data at 1030 BST. In the US on Friday, Wall Street ended higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending up 0.9%, the S&P 500 up 1.1% and Nasdaq Composite closing 1.5% higher.China warned at the end of a top-level meeting with US trade officials Sunday that deals will not take effect if Washington goes ahead and enacts tariffs on Chinese imports.The statement came an hour after a meeting between US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He aimed at finding ways to narrow the countries' trade deficit.Ross, who arrived Saturday in Beijing for two days of talks, said at the beginning of the meeting he had had "friendly and frank" discussions about specific export items with Chinese officials. But after the two teams wrapped up discussions at the Diaoyutai state guesthouse, they left without making any statements to journalists.China's state-run Xinhua news agency later published a Chinese government statement that the two sides had made "positive and concrete progress" and had had "good communication" in areas such as agriculture and energy.Nevertheless, the deals negotiated by the two teams "will not take effect" if the US enacts threatened tariffs on Chinese imports, Xinhua said.In Asia on Monday, the Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed up 1.4%. In China, the Shanghai Composite is up 0.5%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is up 1.4%.After days of back and forth, US President Donald Trump announced on Friday that he would meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12 to discuss nuclear disarmament.Just eight days earlier, Trump abruptly withdrew from the meeting, citing Pyongyang's "open hostility".Load-Date: June 5, 2018End of Document
