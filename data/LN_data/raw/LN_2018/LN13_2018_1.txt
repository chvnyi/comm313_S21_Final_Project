Walmart Commits to Reduce Emissions by 50 Million Metric Tons in China; Company unveils sustainability roadmap to engage its Chinese suppliers, seeks to reduce emissions equivalent to the average annual electricity consumption for 40 million Chinese householdsBusiness WireMarch 29, 2018 Thursday 7:30 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Business Wire, Inc.Distribution: Business Editors; Environment WritersLength: 1156 wordsDateline: BEIJING BodyToday Walmart announced a goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in its China value chain by 50 million metric tons (MMT) by 2030 - equivalent to the emissions associated with the average annual electricity consumption of 40 million Chinese households. To do this, the company aims to enroll all of its export and domestic suppliers in China, starting with 100 of its top suppliers, into an emissions reduction program. Walmart president and CEO Doug McMillon announced the China launch of the program, called Project Gigaton, in a speech at Tsinghua University."As a global company, we are proud to use our reach to help create a more sustainable future, for our customers, associates, and the communities we serve," said McMillon. "We believe that business can accelerate environmental progress while delivering economic growth. That's why we're committed to taking a shared value approach to our work in China and around the world."McMillon delivered the speech to professors, students, Walmart associates, suppliers and NGO representatives at the Tsinghua Forum, the University's renowned lectureship series. Expanding Project Gigaton into China is part of Walmart's global approach to sustainability, in which China plays an important role.Walmart was the first retailer to set an emissions-reduction plan approved by the Science Based Targets initiative and Project Gigaton falls under this plan, in alignment with the Paris Climate Agreement. Through Project Gigaton, Walmart aims to work with its suppliers to reduce emissions in its global value chain by one billion metric tons - a gigaton - by 2030, equal to the emissions from more than 211 million average passenger vehicles in a year. The 50 MMT emissions reduction target in China is part of this goal."Walmart has a rich history of collaboration with key stakeholders in China and we're excited to bring our latest sustainability initiative, Project Gigaton, to China," said Wern-Yuen Tan, president and CEO of Walmart China. "Integrating more sustainable practices into our operations, resource management and sourcing efforts can spur technological innovation, inspire brand loyalty and increase associate engagement."Over 400 suppliers in China, India, the U.S. and other countries have joined Project Gigaton and Walmart plans to continue to expand the program. To help provide resources to suppliers in China, Walmart has created a digital resource center in Mandarin and English with tools, case studies, and program resources on emissions reduction in the value chain: www.walmartsustainabilityhub.com .Enhancing energy efficiencyChina's Project Gigaton goal builds upon Walmart's longstanding Factory Energy Efficiency Program through which the company is working with its suppliers in China to promote energy efficiency. Walmart launched this program in 2014, with a commitment to have 70 percent of its China-sourced export businesses participating in the factory energy efficiency program by the end of 2017. The company has exceeded the goal and to date, more than 800 factories have joined the program, reporting a savings of US$40 million in operating expenses and emissions reduction of more than 270,000 metric tons per year. This program complements the China government's five-year goal of reducing energy intensity by 15 percent by 2020."We are pleased with the strides Walmart is making in efficiency initiatives while growing and investing in its business in China," said Dr. Zhang Jianyu, China representative, VP Environmental Defense Fund, China. "Their collaboration and innovation within the industry is paving the way for others to do business responsibly in the country."Investing in sustainable operationsMcMillon revealed Walmart's new commitment to reduce the carbon intensity (on a per revenue basis) of Walmart's own operations in China, which include stores, clubs, distribution centers and other facilities, by an additional 25 percent by 2025, 70 percent below 2005 levels. This is part of a global goal to reduce emissions in company operations 18 percent by 2025. The company plans to accomplish this goal through continued innovation in operational efficiency and sourcing clean renewable energy, such as wind and solar, reducing our emissions impact while continuing to expand our business in China. In 2018 alone, Walmart will open 30 to 40 new stores, including five Sam's Clubs and a new supermarket format.These new commitments in China are an extension of sustainability efforts Walmart has already started in the country. For example, the company recently completed 1,400 retrofit projects to transform its existing facilities to reduce emissions and create a better shopping experience for customers. The projects included converting lighting to energy-efficient LEDs, upgrading HVAC systems, and improving refrigeration fixtures to protect food quality and save energy. These efforts, along with other operational improvements, cut emissions by more than half on a per sales dollar basis over the last decade.As a complement to the Chinese government's goals to dramatically increase usage of renewable energy, Walmart plans to expand on-site solar systems and work with developers to bring new large-scale off-site projects onto the grid. The company plans to support renewable energy access by working with government, industry peers, suppliers and development partners. Walmart will also be participating in the Chinese government's Green Building Program for Hypermarkets in the coming year.Additionally, Walmart is working with the government in China to develop new Green Packaging Standards for the logistics industry in China and is committed to working with suppliers and organizations to reduce materials waste and support recycling in our value chain through Project Gigaton. By sharing best practices in developing sustainable packaging, the company aims to help promote "green consumption," a priority for the China government this year.About WalmartWalmart Inc.

SUBMISSION TO THE UNIVERSAL PERIODIC REVIEW OF CHINAStates News ServiceMarch 29, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 2484 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:31st session of the Universal Periodic Review; 3rd cycleSummarySince President Xi Jinping took office in March 2013, China's government has tightened its control over society and stepped up its campaign against independent activists, lawyers and others deemed a threat to the Chinese Communist Party. The death of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo in a hospital while under heavy guard in July 2017, highlighted the authorities' deepening contempt for fundamental human rights. China's deteriorating rights record is also being felt beyond its borders as it seeks to undermine international human rights institutions.The Chinese government has taken no action toward ratifying the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), despite accepting the recommendations to do so during its previous UPR review in 2013. China accepted recommendations on ensuring freedom of expression, yet authorities have continued to arrest journalists, writers, and human rights activists for their peaceful speech. The government also further tightened restrictions on the internet and adopted new measures to limit access to circumvention tools that allow netizens to scale the Great Firewall to access the global internet uncensored.Since the previous UPR review, in which the government promised to "prevent torture," torture and ill-treatment in detention facilities continue to be routine. The government also agreed to "immediately inform relatives about arrests and effective legal representation," yet in numerous cases police denied detainees access to lawyers of their choice and held them incommunicado.China accepted the recommendation on "protect[ting] the rights of ethnic minority groups," but the situation in some minority areas have only worsened. In Xinjiang, authorities stepped up mass surveillance and the security presence despite the lack of evidence demonstrating an organized threat. And since around April 2016, tens of thousands of Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities have been sent to extralegal "political education centers" where they are held incommunicado indefinitely, without charge or trial.The government also accepted recommendations to ban gender discrimination and discriminations based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Yet it remains hostile to activism by women's rights groups and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) groups.Deaths in DetentionIn its previous UPR, China accepted numerous recommendations to respect the rights of human rights defenders, including their ability to engage in the UPR process and international mechanisms without reprisal; to ensure that prison systems meet international standards; and to cooperate with United Nations human rights mechanisms.Yet since that time, a number of human rights defenders have either died in detention or shortly after being released, calling into question China's willingness to implement accepted recommendations from that review. Those cases include:Cao Shunli, a veteran human rights activist best known for pressing the Chinese government to include input from independent civil society into China's state report for its UPR, died on March 14, 2014, after being held in a detention facility for several months without needed medical treatment.Tenzin Delek Rinpoche, a revered Tibetan lama who defended culture and the environment, was wrongly imprisoned in 2002 and for 13 years denied family visits, medical help, and the right to practice his religion. His family was informed of his death in July 2015.Liu Xiaobo, a longtime pro-democracy voice and winner of the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize, died July 13, 2017, two years short of completing a baseless 11-year sentence for his role in drafting Charter '08.Yang Tongyan, a dissident writer, was released on medical parole after being diagnosed with a brain tumor in August 2017, four months short of serving the full 12-year prison sentence for "inciting subversion of state power"; he died three months later in November 2017.Muhammed Salih Hajim, an Islamic scholar and advocate of Uyghur cultural and religious rights, died in mid-January 2018, a month after being detained on unspecified charges.RecommendationsImmediately extend invitations to the relevant UN special rapporteurs, working groups, and experts to investigate and report on these deaths;Publicly commit to ending reprisals against human rights defenders, including those who engage in UN processes and other international accountability mechanisms; andAppropriately discipline or prosecute officials involved in the deaths of the five individuals noted above.Arbitrary Detention and Enforced DisappearanceChina also agreed in 2013 to prevent torture; immediately inform relatives about arrests and effective legal representation; improve the regulatory framework for lawyers conducive to the unhindered exercise of their profession; ensure those detained prompt access to defense lawyers of their choice; respect the right to freedom of expression; and advance the rule of law and to deepen the reform of the judicial system.Despite these commitments, China continues to arbitrarily detain countless people for their peaceful work or views. Those include:Artist Liu Xia, kept under house arrest after the death of her husband, Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo, in July 2017.Human rights lawyer Wang Quanzhang, forcibly disappeared since July 9, 2015.Bookseller Gui Minhai, Swedish citizen arbitrarily detained since his October 2015 forced disappearance from Thailand.Tibetan cultural rights and education advocate Tashi Wangchuk, awaiting a sentence on charges of inciting separatism.Uyghur intellectual Ilham Tohti, sentenced to life imprisonment in 2014 on the baseless charge of "separatism."RecommendationsImmediately confirm the fate and whereabouts of these individuals, and allow them full and unfettered access to family, lawyers and doctors of their choice, and consular representatives if a foreign national;Drop all charges and end all use of coercive measures; andAppropriately discipline or prosecute officials involved in abuses in these cases.Mass SurveillanceIn the 2013 UPR review, China accepted recommendations on respecting fundamental rights and abolishing arbitrary detention. However, the Chinese government's augmented mass surveillance efforts not only violate individual rights, including to privacy and to freedom of expression and association, but also enable officials to arbitrarily detain people.Human Rights Watch has documented the Chinese government's drive to employ the latest technologies, including biometric collection, artificial intelligence, and big data, in strengthening mass surveillance across the country without oversight, transparency, or privacy protections.Police have collected DNA samples from more than 40 million individuals for a nationally searchable database. Human Rights Watch has documented cases in which police officers are compelling ordinary individuals neither convicted nor even suspected of a crime to have their blood drawn and DNA taken. In Xinjiang, authorities are mandating the collection of DNA samples, fingerprints, iris scans, and blood types of all residents in the region between the age of 12 and 65, according to official documents. It is unclear if residents are informed of the authorities' intention to collect, store, or use sensitive DNA data as their blood is collected under a free annual physical exams program.The Chinese government is building big data policing platforms that aggregate and analyze massive amounts of citizens' personal information. The "Police Cloud" system, one of the Ministry of Public Security's most ambitious and privacy-violating big data projects, scoops up information from people's medical history, to their supermarket membership, to delivery records. The system is designed to track and predict the activities of activists, dissidents, and ethnic minorities, including those authorities say have "extreme thoughts," among other functions.In Xinjiang, authorities are building and deploying a big data predictive policing program called "Integrated Joint Operations Platform." Drawing from sources such as CCTV cameras, "wifi sniffers" and health, banking and legal records, the program aggregates data about people often without their knowledge and flags those it deems potentially threatening to the authorities. Some of those targeted are detained and sent to extralegal "political education centers."In 2012, Chinese authorities launched a nationwide "social credit system." By rating citizens on a range of behaviors from shopping habits to online speech, the government aims to "make trustworthy people benefit everywhere and untrustworthy people restricted everywhere" by the time it is fully implemented in 2020. Those with low scores may face obstacles in everything from getting government jobs to placing their children in desired schools.The Chinese government, collaborating with major Chinese voice recognition company iFlytek, is also collecting "voice pattern" samples of individuals to establish a national voice biometric database and to develop a system that can automatically identify targeted voices in phone conversations.RecommendationsImmediately release those detained in "political education centers" in Xinjiang based on results generated by big data platforms;Stop the mass collection of DNA and other personal data of Chinese citizens without full, informed consent and destroy all data gathered; andEstablish a privacy and data protection law to protect personally identifying information from misuse, especially by the government.Conversion TherapyIn its 2013 UPR review, China accepted recommendations on prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. While homosexuality is neither a crime nor officially regarded as an illness in China, Chinese authorities have not taken the necessary steps to stop public hospitals or private clinics from offering illegal "conversion therapy," which aims to change an individual's sexual orientation from homosexual or bisexual to heterosexual.In 2001, the Chinese Society of Psychiatry removed homosexuality from its list of mental disorders. China's 2013 Mental Health Law requires that the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders comply with diagnostic standards. Because same-sex attraction is not a disorder, the law renders conversion therapy illegal. The law further requires that the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders respect individuals' basic rights and human dignity. However, Chinese authorities have not taken proactive measures to stop healthcare facilities or practitioners from offering conversion therapy, such as issuing clear guidelines that conversion therapy contravenes existing law; monitoring facilities to determine whether conversion therapy is taking place; and, where it is, holding such facilities accountable.Based on interviews with people who were subjected to conversion therapy, Human Rights Watch has documented multiple abusive aspects of conversion therapy, including coercion and threats, physical abduction, arbitrary confinement, forced medication and injection, and use of electroshocks. Human Rights Watch found that conversion therapy often took place in government-run public hospitals. In a few cases, conversion therapy was conducted in privately owned psychiatric or psychological clinics, licensed and supervised by the National Health and Family Planning Commission.RecommendationsIssue regulations or guidelines that clearly prohibit public hospitals and private clinics from conducting conversion therapy;Strengthen the monitoring and regulation of state-run hospitals as well as private psychiatric clinics and practitioners, including by establishing an effective complaint system and conducting stop visits, to ensure that they are not conducting conversion therapy; andHold accountable facilities that continue to conduct conversion therapy, including by issuing warnings and ultimately revoking licenses of repeat offenders.Hong KongIn the 2013 UPR review, China accepted the recommendation to "preserve different rights" of citizens in Hong Kong "in accordance with [its] laws." However, the government has steadily encroached on those rights and the "one country, two systems" arrangement.Human Rights Watch has documented the surge in politically motivated prosecutions against Hong Kong's pro-democracy leaders since the Umbrella Movement protests culminated in December 2014. Most were charged for their participation in or leading peaceful protests.Human Rights Watch has also documented other forms of official harassment against opposition politicians, such as delays and rejections in registering political parties on political grounds. There were also increased reports of suspected mainland security police following, intimidating, and assaulting democracy advocates, particularly during President Xi's visit to Hong Kong in mid-2017.After ruling Hong Kong for two decades, Beijing has failed to fulfill its pledge of universal suffrage for Hong Kong's top post, the chief executive, but also has increasingly restricted people's electoral rights by targeting Hong Kong's semi-democratic Legislative Council (LegCo). Beginning in 2016, the Beijing and Hong Kong authorities have disqualified outspoken pro-democracy figures from running for seats on the LegCo or unseated them after they were elected.In 2016 and 2017, respectively, two individuals a British bookseller, Lee Po, and a Canadian billionaire, Xiao Jianhua disappeared from Hong Kong. Lee later returned to Hong Kong, but there has been no information about Xiao's whereabouts. In both cases, credible evidence suggests that the two were abducted by mainland security agents in Hong Kong.

University Student Group Received Funding from Chinese GovernmentThe Hoya: Georgetown UniversityFebruary 16, 2018 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 891 wordsByline: Hannah UrtzBodyThe Georgetown University graduate student group, GU Chinese Students and Scholars Association, has received substantial funding from the Chinese government in years past, though the group has not broken any university funding rules, a recent report from Foreign Policy alleges. GUCSSA FACEBOOKFounded in the early 2000s, Georgetown's chapter of the national organization boasts a membership of approximately 230 students, most of whom are Chinese nationals and graduate students, according to the organization's HoyaLink description.The documentation of the funding points to Chinese government involvement with student groups on American college campuses, a link that is often suspected though difficult to prove, Foreign Policy reports. While not illegal, these relationships have been under scrutiny from U.S. security organizations, who have attempted for years to ascertain what, if any, threat the Chinese government and students pose to the U.S.The outlet wrote that they had obtained documents and emails from "a source concerned about Chinese Communist Party influence on university campuses" that showed the group had received approximately $1600 in funding from the Chinese government, amounting to roughly half its annual budget in 2011.Rachel Pugh, Georgetown's senior director for strategic communications, said the university ensures all student groups adhere to university and government policies."As a global university, our international student body hails from more than 125 nations and contributes valuable experiences and perspectives that enhance the diversity and scholarship of our community," Pugh wrote in an email to The Hoya. "We ensure that all student organizations comply with applicable financial rules and regulations."Founded in the early 2000s, Georgetown's chapter of the national organization boasts a membership of approximately 230 students, most of whom are Chinese nationals and graduate students, according to the organization's HoyaLink description. In addition to providing an on-campus space for Chinese graduate students adjusting to life at Georgetown, the GUCSSA helps connect the Chinese community on campus with other on-campus student groups to promote Chinese culture, according to group's page.A graduate student group, GUCSSA operates independently from undergraduate student organizations and receives much of its funding from the university and the Graduate Student Government through the Office of Graduate Enrichment Organizations. The Foreign Policy report states that the documentation of the funds comes from a September 2011 budget request received by Georgetown's Graduate Student Government, which disclosed that the group received $800 each semester that school year from the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C. The group requested an additional $750 each semester from the university on top of the money it received from the embassy, the request said.While GUCSSA could not be reached for comment, members of the group said in their 2011 budget request that the Chinese funding was used to host events, such as the annual Chinese New Year party in 2011.Georgetown has no rule against student groups receiving money from foreign governments, according to Kylie Navarro (COL '20), chair of the Student Activities Commission, the funding and advisory board that allocates resources to university-recognized undergraduate groups."There is no university policy that prevents student groups from receiving money from any outside source, including foreign governments," Navarro wrote in an email to The Hoya. "Outside funding sources are not considered when SAC makes decision to allocate funding. Groups are not even required to report outside funding to SAC."Navarro said it is unlikely that SAC will be looking further into whether or not funding has come from foreign governments at the undergraduate level.The CSSA also serves as a support network for Chinese students at nearly 150 other universities across the United States, including the University of Maryland, the University of California, San Diego and the University of Connecticut. The groups began to pop up more regularly in the 1980s, when Chinese students began to study abroad in the United States more regularly, The Washington Post reported in May 2017.The groups often work with oversight from the Chinese government, advocating for pro-Chinese government agendas on campuses, according to The Washington Post.This newly reported information follows a growing trend of tension between Chinese student groups and universities across the country. Students in the CSSA at other institutions have clashed with administrators at their universities over different decisions affecting Chinese culture.The club protested a presentation on human rights violations in China at Columbia University a decade ago. At the University of Maryland, the CSSA responded to an address given by a Chinese student praising free speech in May 2017. The group responded by posting a video titled "Proud of China UMD," composed of video segments responding to the student's address."We are deeply concerned about some of the stereotypical comments in her speech, and we, Chinese students at UMD, decided to reply with the following videos," the opening slide of the video read.Have a reaction to this article?

China's Surveillance State Should Scare EveryoneAtlantic OnlineFebruary 2, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1593 wordsByline: Anna Mitchell and Larry DiamondBodyImagine a society in which you are rated by the government on your trustworthiness. Your "citizen score" follows you wherever you go. A high score allows you access to faster internet service or a fast-tracked visa to Europe. If you make political posts online without a permit, or question or contradict the government's official narrative on current events, however, your score decreases. To calculate the score, private companies working with your government constantly trawl through vast amounts of your social media and online shopping data.When you step outside your door, your actions in the physical world are also swept into the dragnet: The government gathers an enormous collection of information through the video cameras placed on your street and all over your city. If you commit a crime-or simply jaywalk-facial recognition algorithms will match video footage of your face to your photo in a national ID database. It won't be long before the police show up at your door.This society may seem dystopian, but it isn't farfetched: It may be China in a few years. The country is racing to become the first to implement a pervasive system of algorithmic surveillance. Harnessing advances in artificial intelligence and data mining and storage to construct detailed profiles on all citizens, China's communist party-state is developing a "citizen score" to incentivize "good" behavior. A vast accompanying network of surveillance cameras will constantly monitor citizens' movements, purportedly to reduce crime and terrorism. While the expanding Orwellian eye may improve "public safety," it poses a chilling new threat to civil liberties in a country that already has one of the most oppressive and controlling governments in the world.China's evolving algorithmic surveillance system will rely on the security organs of the communist party-state to filter, collect, and analyze staggering volumes of data flowing across the internet. Justifying controls in the name of national security and social stability, China originally planned to developwhat it called a "Golden Shield" surveillance system allowing easy access to local, national, and regional records on each citizen. This ambitious project has so far been mostly confined to a content-filtering Great Firewall, which            prohibits foreign internet sites including Google, Facebook, and The New York Times. According to Freedom House, China's level of internet freedom is already the            worst on the planet. Now, the Communist Party of China is finally building the extensive, multilevel data-gathering system it has dreamed of for decades.While the Chinese government has long            scrutinized individual citizens for evidence of disloyalty to the regime, only now is it beginning to develop comprehensive, constantly updated, and granular records on each citizen's political persuasions, comments, associations, and even consumer habits. The new social credit system under development will consolidate reams of records from private companies and government bureaucracies into a single "citizen score" for each Chinese citizen. In its comprehensive 2014            planning outline, the CCP explains a goal of "keep[ing] trust and constraints against breaking trust." While the system is voluntary for now, it will be mandatory by 2020. Already, 100,000 Chinese citizens            have posted on social media about high scores on a "Sesame Credit" app operated by Alibaba, in a private-sector precursor to the proposed government system. The massive e-commerce conglomerate            claims its app is only tracking users' financial and credit behavior, but promises to offer a "holistic rating of character." It is not hard to imagine many Chinese boasting soon about their official scores.While it isn't yet clear what data will be considered, commentators are already speculating that the scope of the system will be alarmingly wide. The planned "citizen credit" score will likely weigh far more data than the Western FICO score, which helps lenders make fast and reliable decisions on whether to extend financial credit. While the latter simply tracks whether you've paid back your debts and managed your money well, experts on China and internet privacy            have speculated-based on the vast amounts of online shopping data mined by the government without regard for consumer privacy-that your Chinese credit score could be higher if you buy items the regime likes-like diapers-and lower if you buy ones it doesn't, like video games or            alcohol. Well beyond the realm of online consumer purchasing, your political involvement could also heavily affect your score: Posting political opinions without prior permission or even posting true news that the Chinese government dislikes could decrease your rank.Even more worrying is that the government will be technically capable of considering the behavior of a Chinese citizen's friends and family in determining his or her score. For example, it is possible that your friend's anti-government political post could lower your own score. Thus, the scoring system would isolate dissidents from their friends and the rest of society, rendering them complete pariahs. Your score might even determine your access to certain privileges taken for granted in the U.S., such as a visa to travel abroad or or even the right to travel by train or plane within the country. One internet privacy expert            warns: "What China is doing here is selectively breeding its population to select against the trait of critical, independent thinking."While Westerners and especially civil liberties groups like the            ACLU are horrified by such a prospect-one commentator called the possibility "authoritarianism, gamified"-           others argue that because lack of trust is a serious problem in China, many Chinese welcome this potential system. However, a state-run, party-inspired, data-driven monitoring system poses profound questions for the West about the role of private companies in government surveillance. Is it ethical for private companies to assist in massive surveillance and turn over their data to the government? Alibaba (China's Amazon) and Tencent (owner of the popular messaging platform WeChat) possess sweeping data on each Chinese citizen that the government would have to mine to calculate scores. Although Chinese companies now            are required to assist in government spying while U.S. companies are not, it is possible to imagine Amazon in Alibaba's position, or Facebook in place of Tencent. While private companies like credit scoring bureaus have always used data to measure consumers' creditworthiness, in any decent society there must be a clear distinction between private-sector and public-sector scoring mechanisms that could determine access to citizen rights and privileges, without recourse.This planned data-focused social credit system is only one facet of China's rapidly expanding system of algorithmic surveillance. Another is a sprawling network of technologies, especially surveillance cameras, to monitor people's physical movements. In 2015, China's national police force-the Ministry of Public Safety-           called for the creation of an "omnipresent, completely connected, always on and fully controllable" national video surveillance network. MPS and other agencies stated that law enforcement should use facial recognition technology in combination with the video cameras to catch lawbreakers. One IHS Markit            estimate puts the number of cameras in China at 176 million today, with a plan to have 450 million installed by 2020.            One hundred percent of Beijing is now blanketed by surveillance cameras, according to the Beijing Public Safety Bureau.The stated goal of this system is to capture and deter criminals. However, it also poses obvious and massive risks to privacy and the modicum of freedom Chinese citizens have managed to gain since the Maoist era. The penalties for small crimes            seem unreasonable: Authorities in Fuzhou are publishing the names of jaywalkers in local media and even sending them to their employers. More ominous, though, are the likely punishments that will be inflicted on people who associate with dissidents or critics, who circulate a petition or hold up a protest sign, or who simply wind up in the wrong place at the wrong time. Thus, the installation of an all-seeing-eye for the government alarms civil liberties and privacy advocates worldwide. The government already constantly            monitors the cell phones and social media of human-rights activists in the name of "stability maintenance." A video surveillance system would enable further pervasive and repressive surveillance. Making streams publicly available, too, would threaten every citizen's privacy: A busybody neighbor could easily spy on the activities of the family next door as they run errands or go on vacation.China's experiments with digital surveillance pose a grave new threat to freedom of expression on the internet and other human rights in China. Increasingly, citizens will refrain from any kind of independent or critical expression for fear that their data will be read or their movements recorded-and penalized-by the government. And that is exactly the point of the program. Moreover, what emerges in China will not stay in China. Its repressive technologies have a pattern of diffusing to other authoritarian regimes around the world. For this reason-not to mention concern for the hundreds of millions of people in China whose meager freedom will be further diminished-democracies around the world must monitor and denounce this sinister creep toward an Orwellian world.Load-Date: February 3, 2018End of Document

AMBASSADOR ZHANG MING PUBLISHES AN ARTICLE AT EUROPEAN MEDIA ON THE RELATIONS BETWEEN CHINA AND EUROPE UNDER BRI FROM CHINESE MISSION TO THE EUROPEAN UNIONStates News ServiceMarch 19, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 908 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: BEIJING, China BodyThe following information was released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China:On March 15, EurActiv published an article by H.E. Ambassador Zhang Ming, Head of the Chinese Mission to the EU, on the relations between China and Europe under the Belt and Road Initiative.China and Europe can work together on the Belt and Road InitiativeBy H.E. Ambassador Zhang MingLast month, I had my first Chinese Spring Festival celebration in Brussels. It was unforgettable to see Chinese lanterns illuminating the Grand Place, the world's most beautiful square as described by French writer Victor Hugo. It was exciting to see the Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert decorated with Chinese red lanterns, bringing a moment of happiness to my European friends. Again, I was fascinated by the perfect fusion of Chinese and European cultures.More than 700 years ago, The Travels of Marco Polo invoked Europeans' curiosity of the East. Numerous trailblazers made strenuous efforts to connect Europe with Asia, and finally, opened up the ancient Silk Road. Today, China and Europe are bound together by faster transportation, closer commercial ties, and more diverse cultural exchanges. Despite its long history, the spirit of the ancient Silk Road, namely the respect for diversity and the pursuit of common prosperity, is still alive and relevant.Since it was launched over four years ago, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has received wide support from more than 100 countries and international organizations, more than 80 of which have signed BRI agreements with China. The first Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation held last year produced fruitful results, and contributed to a global consensus on Belt and Road cooperation.China and Europe, each located at one end of the Silk Road, are natural partners on the BRI. With the joint efforts of both sides, the BRI and Europe's development strategies are creating synergy. Governments of 11 EU member states have signed BRI cooperation documents with the Chinese government. The China-Europe express freight trains are busy traveling across the Eurasian continent. In 2017, a total of 3,673 trips were made, up by 116% from 2016 and exceeding the total number combined during the past six years. The train services reach 36 European cities in 13 countries and make the access of European goods to the Chinese market much easier.In addition, a great number of projects are well underway, such as infrastructure, logistics, ports, e-commerce and finance. For instance, in Serbia, a Chinese enterprise bought a troubled steel mill and turned it around in less than a year. In Greece, the Port of Piraeus regained its position as one of the largest ports in Europe. In the United Kingdom, China is partnering with France to build a nuclear power plant, a stellar example of tripartite cooperation under the BRI. The Brussels-based economic think tank Bruegel estimates that the EU's foreign trade will increase by 6% because of the BRI.The BRI, as a brand new initiative, enjoys huge potential. Yet, its potential will be brought to full only when all players come to realize its importance and take part in it. To help you better understand this initiative, I would like to characterize it with three words.First, openness. The BRI aims to promote economic cooperation through infrastructure connectivity and to bring about common development by leveraging the comparative strengths of all participants. As a global public good, the BRI follows the golden rule of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits. All parties get involved and gain benefits on an equal footing. The BRI is definitely not a unilateral strategy or China's Marshall Plan, as some have called it. On the contrary, it is designed to promote cooperation that is open to all.Second, transparency. The BRI is not a one-way street allowing only China to export its resources, market opportunities, technologies, projects, and manpower. Rather, it is based on wide consultation and communication. Our goal is not only to strengthen the physical connectivity of infrastructure but also to improve the institutional connectivity of rules and standards. All BRI projects have to go through well-informed feasibility studies conducted by interested parties and must follow market principles and international rules. All projects must be results-oriented, high-standard and sustainable.Third, inclusiveness. The BRI aims to establish a regional economic cooperation platform that is inclusive, balanced and beneficial to all. It is not meant to reinvent the wheel. Rather, it seeks to complement the existing bilateral and regional cooperation mechanisms. As people say in Europe, "Rome wasn't built in a day". The BRI is such a great undertaking that it has to involve many participants, including those from Europe. While each participant comes from different backgrounds and has different needs, we respect such diversity and value flexibility in our cooperation instead of insisting on uniformity.In our world today, protectionism and isolationism are still taking a toll. China, with its 40 years of reform and opening-up, has made its stance clear: openness brings progress, while self-seclusion leaves one behind. We remain committed to partnering with our European friends in an open spirit. Let's consult, contribute and share together to make a success of the Belt and Road Initiative.Load-Date: March 21, 2018End of Document

CHINA TO BLOCK OVERSEAS VPN SERVICES FROM END OF MARCHStates News ServiceJanuary 31, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 714 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:China will begin blocking overseas providers of virtual private networks (VPN) used to circumvent its Great Firewall of government censorship at the end of March, official media reported.Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) chief engineer Zhang Feng said VPN operators must be licensed by the government, and that unlicensed VPNs are the target of new rules which come into force on March 31."We want to regulate VPNs which unlawfully conduct cross-border operational activities," Zhang told reporters on Tuesday."Any foreign companies that want to set up a cross-border operation for private use will need to set up a dedicated line for that purpose," he said. "They will be able to lease such a line or network legally from the telecommunications import and export bureau.""This shouldn't affect their normal operations much at all," he said.Meanwhile, the American Chamber of Commerce said it had carried out a recent survey of U.S. companies that showed that the inability to access certain online tools, internet censorship, and cybersecurity were impeding their operations.Around one billion people in China had access to 4G mobile internet services last year, an increase of 76.4 percent compared with the previous year, the MIIT said.According to Zhang, overall mobile internet and data usage also surged by 26.7 percent in 2017.An internet user surnamed Zeng told RFA that the new regulations could also hit any Chinese businesses that need unimpeded communications with the outside world."I have a friend who is a businessman, and makes things mainly for export, and this has already affected his order book," Zeng said. "He usually uses WhatsApp to communicate [with customers] and now it's very hard to log on, and this has really affected business."He added: "In future, he won't be able to log on at all, so he told me he will likely have to shut down his factory."Internet user A Biao said the Great Firewall will continue to put huge limitations on what ordinary internet users in mainland China may do or see online."You can't read truthful, objective and balanced information in a timely manner," he said. "If you have an overseas phone, you can get online without going via the Great Firewall, but that's pretty difficult to get hold of, so there are limitations to that approach."No end in sightXie Jiaye, head of the New York-based Chinese Association of Science and Technology, said he doesn't see an end in sight to the crackdown on VPNs in China."The Chinese government already holds the power to solve this issue; if they wanted to be more open, they could do it immediately," Xie said. "If they don't want more openness, then it's very unlikely that this problem will ever be resolved."Wu Fan, editor in chief of the U.S.-based Chinese-language magazine Chinese Affairs, said the new controls on VPNs weren't in keeping with the ruling Chinese Communist Party's promises of an "open internet.""If they opened it all up, then everybody would be able to operate and communicate normally, including Chinese companies headquartered in China," Wu said. "There is a huge conflict here, as if the MITT is fighting against itself."China said last July that it planned to force both local and foreign companies and individuals to use only government-approved software to access the global internet, as overseas firms fear losing unrestricted online services by the end of February.State-run China Mobile, China Unicom, and China Telecom have all been told to ensure their 1.3 billion subscribers can't access blocked content with VPNs.Chinese internet users had become adept at circumventing the complex array of blocks, filters, and human censorship deployed by their government.After censors succeeded in blocking Tor, VPNs became the tool of choice for "climbing the wall," in Chinese online parlance, and are used as much by government institutions, state-owned companies, and educational establishments as by the general public.The licensing program indicates that the government plans to allow only users it trusts to scale the Great Firewall from now on.Reported by Wen Yuqing for RFA's Cantonese Service, and by Lin Ping for the Mandarin Service.

CHINA: RELEASE HUMAN RIGHTS LAWYERS RESTORE LICENSES REVOKED FOR CRITICIZING GOVERNMENTStates News ServiceFebruary 15, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1006 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:The Chinese government should immediately release human rights lawyers who have been detained or imprisoned on baseless subversion charges, Human Rights Watch said today. Authorities should also end the practice of revoking or suspending licenses of lawyers and law firms on political grounds.In February 2018, authorities stripped human rights lawyer Sui Muqing of his license for allegedly violating "courtroom etiquette," and canceled the registration of the Wutian Law Firm for its refusal to participate in a politicized review process."Not only is the Chinese government still holding some rights lawyers and activists rounded up in the July 2015 crackdown, it's disbarring others as a crude way to intimidate the group," said Sophie Richardson, China director. "This endless persecution of the legal profession exposes the absurdity of China's claim to uphold the 'rule of law.'"Since August 2017, authorities have revoked or suspended the licenses to practice of several human rights lawyers. They have also canceled the registration of one law firm. One lawyer has been detained on subversion charges:In August, the Hangzhou Bureau of Justice suspended Wu Youshui from practicing law for nine months. The bureau said it was a punishment for online articles Wu published that were critical of the Chinese government.In September, the Shandong Bureau of Justice revoked lawyer Zhu Shengwu's license, alleging that his messages criticizing the Chinese government and Chinese Communist Party leaders on his social media "endangered national security."In December, the Yunnan Bureau of Justice revoked the licenses of lawyers Wang Liqian and Wang Delong, accusing them of impersonation fraud. The lawyers believed that the disbarment was due to their withdrawing from the All China Lawyers Association, a government-run professional association. The lawyers had criticized the association for failing to advocate for lawyers' rights.In January 2018, the Beijing Bureau of Justice revoked Yu Wensheng's license, stating that he had published speeches that "oppose the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party." On January 19, authorities detained Yu in Beijing as he was walking his son to school. Police later took Yu to Xuzhou in Jiangsu province, held him in an undisclosed location, and accused him of "inciting subversion of state power." Two days before his detention, Yu had posted an appeal calling for the amendment of China's constitution and open presidential elections. In 2014, Beijing authorities had detained Yu for 99 days, during which he was allegedly tortured and denied access to lawyers.In February, the Guangdong Bureau of Justice revoked Sui Muqing's license. The bureau alleged that Sui refused to obey courtroom etiquette rules during the trial of human rights lawyer Ding Jiaxi in 2014. The bureau claimed Sui did not comply with court orders by repeatedly standing up, walking around the courtroom, and speaking without permission. Sui has represented prominent human rights activists including Guo Feixoing and Huang Qi.In February, the Beijing Bureau of Justice canceled the registration of the Wutian Law Firm, stating that the firm's lawyers failed to participate in China's annual lawyers' evaluation organized by the bureau. The founder of the law firm, Cheng Hai, said Chinese law does not stipulate that lawyers have to take part in justice bureaus' annual evaluations, and the real purpose of the evaluations is to scrutinize lawyers' political opinions.In 2016, the Chinese Ministry of Justice revised two directives on law firms and lawyers the Management Methods on Law Firms (aia¸ˆaia 'ac‰cR'c†a žac•) and the Management Methods on Lawyers (aia¸ˆac‰ a¸cR'c†a žac•) explicitly requiring lawyers and law firms to "support the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party," and to establish party branches in law firms. Lawyers are prohibited from expressing opinions that "reject the fundamental political system" of China or may "endanger national security."This endless persecution of the legal profession exposes the absurdity of China's claim to uphold the 'rule of law.'Sophie RichardsonChina DirectorThe arrest of Yu Wensheng and the revocations of legal licenses are a continuation of the crackdown on human rights lawyers in recent years. Several of the approximately 300 lawyers and activists who were rounded up in the "709" crackdown in 2015 remain in detention or prison. Lawyer Wang Quanzhang, detained in July 2015 and charged with "inciting subversion of state power," still awaits trial and has been denied legal counsel. In November 2017, lawyer Jiang Tianyong was sentenced to two years in prison on charges of inciting subversion. In August 2016, a court in Tianjin sentenced human rights lawyer Zhou Shifeng to seven years in prison after convicting him of subversion.The Chinese government has used various methods available to wrongfully punish activist lawyers. The Ministry of Justice and its lower-level offices issue lawyers' licenses annually, leaving lawyers vulnerable to politicized denials. Courts can also order a maximum of 15 days of judicial detention for those who disturb court order, and police can arrest lawyers for "falsifying evidence," a crime under article 306 of the Criminal Law, which has been brought against lawyers who encourage their clients to speak out about torture by criminal investigators. Lawyers are even at risk of being beaten, intimidated, and harassed in their work by police, court officials, and others operating at the behest of authorities."Chinese authorities treat the views and vital work of independent lawyers as anti-state activity," Richardson said. "Multilateral institutions and concerned governments, as well as international law firms present in China, need to find their voices and speak up against the authorities' systematic suppression of human rights lawyers."Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.Load-Date: February 15, 2018End of Document

The real reason for Trump&#39;s steel and aluminum tariffsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 19, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 792 wordsBody       In my view, US negotiators will use the threat of imposing tariffs on Chinese producers as a means of persuading the Chinese government to abandon the policy of "voluntary" technology transfers. Like almost all economists and most political analysts, I prefer low commercial rates or no tariff at all. How can one justify the decision of the President of the United States, Donald Trump, to impose substantial tariffs on steel and aluminum imports?  Undoubtedly, Trump sees potential political gains in steel and aluminum districts and increasing pressure on Canada and Mexico as his administration renegotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement. The European Union has announced plans to retaliate against US exports, but in the end the EU can negotiate - and agree to reduce current tariffs on US products that exceed US tariffs on European products.  But the real target of steel and aluminum tariffs is China. The Chinese government has promised for many years to reduce overcapacity in steel, thereby cutting surplus production that is sold to the United States at subsidized prices. However, Chinese politicians have been postponing this pledge as a result of domestic pressure to protect their own jobs in the steel and aluminum sector in China. US tariffs will balance domestic pressures and increase the likelihood that China will accelerate the reduction of subsidized excess capacity.  Since tariffs are being levied under a provision of the US trade law that applies to national security, it will be possible to exempt imports from NATO military allies, as well as Japan and South Korea, tariffs in China and avoiding the risk of a wider trade war. The United States government has not yet said it will focus tariffs in this way; but since its introduction provides for an initial period during which trading partners may request exemptions, such segmentation appears to be the most likely scenario.  For the US, the most important trade issue with China concerns technology transfers, not Chinese subsidized steel and aluminum exports. While these subsidies harm US steel and aluminum producers, the resulting low prices also help US companies using steel and aluminum as well as US consumers who buy these products. But China unequivocally harms US interests by stealing technology developed by US companies.  Until a few years ago, the Chinese government was using the sophisticated cyber-knowledge of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to infiltrate US companies and steal technology. Chinese officials have denied all irregularities until President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping met in California in June 2013. Obama showed Xi detailed evidence that the US obtained through its own cyber espionage. Xi then agreed that the Chinese government would no longer use the PLA or other government agencies to steal US technology. While it is difficult to know for sure, it seems that this type of cyber robbery has declined dramatically.  Theft of current technology takes a different form. American companies that want to do business in China are often forced to transfer their technology to Chinese companies as a condition of entry into the market. These companies "voluntarily" transfer their production know-how because they want access to a market of 1.3 billion people and an economy as large as theUSA.  These companies complain that the technology transfer requirement is a form of extortion. In addition, they fear that the Chinese government will often delay its market access so that domestic companies use their newly acquired technology to gain market share.  The US can not use traditional remedies for trade disputes or World Trade Organization procedures to prevent China's behavior. Nor can they threaten to take Chinese technology or require Chinese companies to transfer it to US companies because the Chinese do not have the kind of cutting-edge technology that US companies have.  So what can US policymakers do to ensure a level playing field?  This issue brings us back to the tariffs on steel and aluminum. In my view, US negotiators will use the threat of imposing tariffs on Chinese producers as a means of persuading the Chinese government to abandon the policy of "voluntary" technology transfers. If this happens, and US companies can do business in China without being forced to pay such a high competitive price, the threat of tariffs will be a successful trade policy tool. Martin Feldstein, a professor of economics at Harvard University and president emeritus of the National Department of Economic Research, presided over President Ronald Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers from 1982 to 1984 .   Copyright: Project Syndicate, 2018.  www.project-syndicate.org  Translation: Rita Faria Load-Date: March 19, 2018End of Document

House Energy & Commerce Subcommittee Issues Testimony From Fuels InstituteTargeted News ServiceMarch 7, 2018 Wednesday 6:54 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 4316 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on Environment issued the following testimony by Fuels Institute Executive Director John Eichberger at a hearing entitled "The Future of Transportation Fuels and Vehicles":"Chairman Shimkus, Ranking Member Pallone, members of the Subcommittee, thank you for inviting me to share my perspective with you today regarding "The Future of Transportation Fuels and Vehicles." My name is John Eichberger and I am the Executive Director of the Fuels Institute. It is my pleasure to share with you my thoughts on the fundamental factors that might shape the future of the market.About the Fuels Institute"The Fuels Institute, founded in 2013 by NACS (the trade association representing the international convenience and fuel retailing industry), is a 501(c)4 non-profit research organization focused on publishing peer-reviewed, unbiased research evaluating issues affecting the fuels and vehicles market today and in the future. Led by a diverse Board of Advisors, the organization does not advocate and has no vested interest in how the market develops. Research is commissioned to answer questions that decision-makers in the industry and government might have by providing data and perspectives that can lead to more informed decisions. In addition to publishing unbiased research, the Fuels Institute fosters cross-sector collaborative dialogue and provides common-sense analysis to the issues of the day. A list of our Board of Directors, Board of Advisors and contributing corporate partners and associations is available on our website and is reproduced in each published report.1 A comprehensive list of our research published to date is available2, and a monthly newsletter containing market analysis in blog-form3 is also available.Disclaimer"The comments presented in this testimony reflect those of myself (John Eichberger) only and do not constitute an official position of the Fuels Institute. The comments have not been reviewed or approved by any contributing partner of the Fuels Institute or any member of the Board. They reflect my perspective of the market as the Executive Director of the Fuels Institute and have been guided by Fuels Institute research, conversations with diverse stakeholders, third party research and data, market analysis and my nearly 20 years of experience in the transportation energy sector. This testimony should not be construed to represent the position of an individual or organization contributing to the Fuels Institute, or serving on a Fuels Institute committee or research task group. My testimony should not suggest or infer that the Fuels Institute supports or opposes any legislative or regulatory initiative.Overview"When evaluating the future of the transportation market, the headlines and forecasts that predict a rapid change in market structure and behavior can be overwhelming. It is important to take this type of information and view it within the context of the existing market to better understand the validity of the predictions. If I could leave you with one message today it would be this: The market will change, but absent significant influence from an external factor, such as government policy, it likely will take decades before major shifts in vehicle composition and the fuels that power them will be achieved."This is not to dismiss advancements in vehicle technology or powertrain diversification; it is simply a recognition of the size and scope of the current market, the amount of time vehicles remain in service and the nature of human behavior."Currently, there are nearly 250 million light-duty vehicles (LDV) registered in the United States. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects that an average of 16.6 million vehicles will be sold each year through 2030, and according to EIA's projections for the size of the fleet, approximately 6% of vehicles on the road will be scrapped each year.4 What this means it that it will take time before a new technology penetrates the market in a meaningful way. In fact, using these statistics as the foundation, Figure 1 plots the rate of market penetration if a new feature were to appear in 100% of the vehicles sold as of January 1, 2017. As you can see, it would take about seven years before the new feature is present in more than 50% of the vehicles on the road--and that is assuming 100% immediate and persistent market adoption.5 By way of comparison, total sales of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) combined represented just 1.1% of LDVs sold in 2017.Figure 1. Vehicle Market Penetration of New Technology(Figure 1 omitted)"Yet the rate of sales growth for these electrified powertrains has been impressive: 26% more BEVs and PHEVs were sold in 2017 than 2016, according to WardsAuto. I believe strongly that these powertrains (BEVs more so than PHEVs) will eventually represent most vehicles on the road, but where I disagree with many headlines and aggressive forecasts is the timing of that eventuality. I believe this future is several decades away because the rate of market conversion is much slower than the rate of vehicle sales growth."To demonstrate, Figure 2 uses the same EIA data as Figure 1 and plots the share of LDV sales and registered LDVs for BEVs and PHEVs. For this illustration, the 26% rate of growth in BEV/PHEV sales recorded in 2016-2017 is extended annually through 2025. After then, however, because the overall market will have increased to a significant number rendering year-over-year sales increases more difficult to achieve, the annual rate of growth is decreased to 20% through 2035. This remains a very aggressive forecast and results in BEVs and PHEVs combining for 42.9% of all LDVs sold in 2035. Yet, because of the overall size of the market, their combined share of registered LDVs by that time is only 10.4%. It should be noted also that in 2035, despite selling 7.5 million BEV and PHEV units, the United States will still incorporate into its existing fleet an additional 10 million units of traditional powertrain vehicles.Figure 2. BEV+PHEV Sales and Fleet Share(Figure 2 omitted)Factors That Might Affect the Rate of Market Transition"Figure 2 represents what I would consider to be a very aggressive rate of change in the composition of vehicle sales, yet it still affects only a modest change in the overall functioning of the market. Nearly 90% of vehicles on the road will continue to be powered by liquid fuels in 2035, despite the growth in electrification. But there are external factors that could influence this projection, which may include:* A sustained increase in crude oil prices* Global regulatory developments* Fleet vehicle purchases* Urbanization, generational shifts and mobility as a service* Advancements in the efficiency of internal combustion engines"In the following pages, I will explore how each of these factors could change the future of the vehicles and fuels market.Crude Oil Prices"According to EIA, since 2010 crude oil prices have contributed on average 60% to the retail price of gasoline.6 When oil prices rise, so do retail gasoline prices and that generates enhanced consumer sensitivity to prices. According to NACS, at the beginning of 2018, after multiple years of relatively low prices, two-thirds of consumers continue to select their fuel retail outlet based on the posted price of fuel, and 38% still say they might drive as much as 10 miles out of their way to save 5 cents per gallon.7 However, when gas prices are higher, consumer sensitivity is higher and translates into greater interest in alternative fuel vehicles."Since 2013, the Fuels Institute and NACS annually ask consumers whether they are in the market to purchase a vehicle in the next few of years and, if so, whether they would consider certain alternative fuel/powertrain vehicles. As Figure 3 demonstrates, when retail fuel prices were above $3.50 in 2014, 84% of consumers said they would consider a hybrid vehicle. However, when fuel prices dropped to below $2.00 at the time of the survey in 2016, the percent of consumers who would consider a hybrid dropped to 44%. This level of sensitivity to gas prices and overall interest in alternative vehicles was demonstrated in overall sales of hybrids. Figure 4 shows that when fuel prices dropped, not only did interest in hybrids decline but actual sales did too--from 3.2% of all LDVs sold in 2013 to 1.9% in 2016.8Figure 3: Consumers Might Consider a Hybrid(Figure 3 omitted)(Figure 4 omitted)Figure 4. Sales of Hybrids"While most forecasts are not projecting oil prices to eclipse $80 per barrel again anytime soon, if this situation were to develop the impact on retail fuel prices, and consequently interest in alternative vehicles, could be significant. Every time Brent oil has been priced above $80 since 2011, the national average retail price of gasoline has been above $3.00.9 A sustained market position of these levels could encourage consumers to consider an alternative fuel vehicle that would deliver more miles per dollar.Global Regulatory Developments"The automobile industry is global, with most automakers seeking to strengthen their economies of scale by introducing flexible vehicle architecture to satisfy multiple markets throughout the world. This means that activities in other countries could have residual impact on the United States. For example, recent announcements by several governments--including China, India, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Norway and even domestically in California-to ban internal combustion engines and mandate a transition to electric vehicles could have a profound impact on the manufacturing decisions of global automakers. Although most of these announcements exclude hybrid vehicles from proposed bans, the implications of such policies could be significant. For example, in 2016, Chinese consumers purchased 31.3% of the world's LDVs, which puts China in a position to exert significant influence on the automotive industry. Further, OPEC projects China and India combined will represent nearly 40% of global gross domestic product (GDP) by 2060. This is an economic power block that cannot be ignored when considering the future of the automotive industry."To consider whether these nations will remain committed to their stated policy objectives, let's look at China. The Chinese government is stable and likely to remain in power for several decades, suggesting we might expect consistent policy throughout this timeframe. Further, China has a parochial interest in promoting electric vehicles since it currently produces a substantial share of the world's BEV batteries, and controls significant shares of the world's cobalt and lithium reserves. Should China proceed with a ban on internal combustion engines and a mandated transition to electric vehicles, battery costs for BEVs could decline rapidly due to increased production volume, and that automakers considering Chinese market opportunities will increase BEV production. This combination of lower costs and increased production could inspire larger deliveries of BEVs to the United States. The greater availability of potentially more affordable BEVs could increase the rate of consumer adoption of these alternative powertrains."In addition to these announcements, 159 nations have signed on to the Paris climate accords and are working to reduce overall emissions to meet their agreed-upon targets. To date, 60 nations are implementing some sort of biofuels program, 40 have a greenhouse gas reduction or fuel efficiency program, 20 contain jurisdictions that have enacted some sort of ban or limitation on internal combustion engines, 13 have established zero-emission vehicle zones, and nearly all have enacted fuel sulfur controls.10 As nations continue to press forward with global commitments and local government focus their efforts to address air quality, policymakers will look at other markets for guidance and experience. This could result in additional initiatives considered within the U.S. that could disrupt the market trajectory.Fleet Purchases"Fleet operators represent the potential to inject momentum for change through volume and by example. The Rocky Mountain Institute believes that fleet operators could reduce annual operating expenses by approximately $1,000 per vehicle.11 For a fleet manager, who might be in the market to purchase 100 vehicles in a year, this could deliver $100,000 benefit to his bottom line--a powerful incentive to consider an electric vehicle. Given that modern BEVs can deliver more than 200 miles per charge, recharge in less than an hour and sell for a comparable price as an equivalent internal combustion engine, there is strong potential for fleets to purchase BEVs in larger quantities, contributing to an accelerated market penetration."Because of a stronger presence of BEVs in the market, fleet adoption could signal to individual consumers that BEVs are viable. Human behavioral sciences suggest that consumers are drawn to items they are familiar with and used by their peers. If consumers witness fleet operators, who drive more miles per year than most consumers, opting for a BEV, they may be more inclined to consider a BEV. Hence, more rapid fleet adoption of BEVs could have a domino effect that would accelerate market conversion and support consumer adoption.Urbanization, Generational Shifts and Mobility as a Service"Where people live, who lives there and how they get around can have a profound influence on the composition of the transportation market."First, younger consumers in the United States behave substantially different than their predecessors. For example, younger consumers are much more inclined to consider an alternative vehicle. In fact, a 2017 Fuels Institute survey found that 66% of consumers age 18-34 would be willing to consider a BEV as their next vehicle, compared with just 47% of consumers age 35-49.12 But perhaps more interesting is that since 1982, the percent of consumers age 20-29 who have a driver's license declined by 10% to just 81.5% of the cohort.13 These trends are indicating a significant shift in consumer behavior relative to car ownership and driving."Compounding this shift in behavior for the younger generation is the overall urbanization of society. The percent of Americans living in metropolitan areas has increased from 56% in 1950 to 84% in 2010. Since 1970, the percent of those age 20-34 who are living in these markets has increased from 33% to 40%, and the trend is continuing.14 Americans are living in more concentrated, urban environments, which introduces unique mobility issues such as cost of insurance, parking, congestion and overall convenience."Capitalizing on this trend have been ride hailing services. With mobility through an urban environment becoming more challenging, and with younger consumers less inclined to drive, mobility has gained significant traction. Most analysts agree that the typical American drives his or her vehicle approximately 5% of the time. The remaining time for that vehicle is spent absorbing resources for insurance, parking and depreciation. Using an on-demand mobility service can be attractive to many as an alternative to such burdens of vehicle ownership."Deloitte research suggests that 23% of Americans report using a ride hailing service at least once per week, and this number jumps to 44% for Generations Y and Z. Of those in Generations Y and Z who use a ride hailing service, 64% question their need to own a car in the future.15 Members of these generations know a market that included electric vehicles and do not have historic concerns about the technology. They are also looking for an alternative to driving and are accepting of new technologies and services."Rocky Mountain Institute suggests that autonomous, electric vehicles could reduce costs of on-demand mobility services to such an extent that such services could become less expensive than owning one's own car.16 RethinkX published a paper predicting that mobility services would be 10 times less expensive than owning a car.17 And Deloitte predicts that by 2040, total LDV sales could drop to about 11 million per year, of which only about 4 million will be personally owned and driven vehicles, with the remaining a mix of on-demand services and personally owned autonomous vehicles.18"In November 2017, Bob Lutz, former Vice Chairman of General Motors, wrote an op-ed in which he predicted that electric, autonomous on demand mobility services would soon dominate the transportation sector. In fact, he predicts that the compelling value (in terms of economics and safety) would result in legislation removing the right of Americans to drive their own vehicles within 20 years.19"I personally do not subscribe to forecasts in which on-demand mobility will supplant personally owned vehicles within 20 years, or even within 50 years, but the prospects for this type of mobility solution gaining roots in certain markets and then growing in the near term cannot be ruled out. Local governments and planning commissions are seeking ways to address traffic congestion, to reduce the need for more parking spaces and to enhance the overall value of mobility. It is possible that these concepts could find their way into near- and long-term city plans, and it is nearly a foregone conclusion that electric and autonomous vehicle technology will be available when such plans are enacted. There is an opportune intersection occurring within the next 10 years where these vehicles will be capable and affordable, consumers will be ready and willing and the needs of these local governments will be acute enough to warrant new mobility paradigms gaining traction."While the overall impact on the market cannot be projected because the number, scope and market reach of these programs is unknown, the, Rocky Mountain Institute suggests that there are 26 potential early market adopters of such services with a potential market capitalization value of $120 billion.20 Hence, there are dozens of companies investing in the development of capabilities and business opportunities for delivering a shared, autonomous and electric mobility solution, which only enhances the potential.Advancements in Internal Combustion Engines"Most external factors that could affect the market that have been addressed thus far would serve to accelerate the pace of market transition away from traditional modes of transport. But despite the public announcements of automobile manufacturing companies of their intent to transition to electrified fleets, engineers have remained diligently at work to improve the internal combustion engine. This is not a contradictory situation, however. Electrification does not necessarily mean BEV and PHEV, as most auto company announcements include hybrids, which operate primarily on an internal combustion engine. And, if my projections for the rate of market conversion are close to reality, the need for enhanced efficiency in a 100+ year-old technology is critical because it will continue to dominate the fleet for decades to come."In this space, automotive engineers are doing remarkable things to improve vehicle efficiency. They are using high strength steel to reduce weight, increasing the number of gears in transmissions, testing aerodynamics in advanced wind tunnels, and they are changing the engine. Many are using techniques that change intake valve timing to reduce the fuel-air mixture is ignited in the cylinder. Because this improves efficiency but reduces power and performance, automakers are pairing this approach with hybrid systems or turbo boosts, which ensures the driver receives the power necessary but reduces fuel consumption when possible."In addition, two companies (Nissan and Mazda) have taken internal combustion engine design to a new level. Nissan has introduced an engine (VC-Turbo) that will adjust the compression ratio (CR) of the piston stroke to accommodate performance needs. When more power and torque are necessary, the CR can drop to as low as 8:1. This is not the most efficient mode, but it delivers power when needed. When more efficient operation is desired, the CR can increase to 14:1. Pairing this technology with a turbo boost ensures adequate performance throughout the drive cycle and reports indicate potential efficiency improvements of more than 20%."Meanwhile Mazda will introduce an engine (SkyactiveX) next year that features a compression ignition gasoline system. Mimicking a diesel engine, this system compresses the fuel-air mixture almost to the point of auto-ignition and then uses a spark assist to ensure optimal timing of combustion. The spark assist protects against knock, but the compression system improves overall thermal efficiency. I have read reports suggesting efficiency gains of 20% to 40% with this engine."Other automotive engineers are focusing on the optimization of an engine design to maximize efficiency with a high-octane fuel. Auto engineers, biofuel producers, petroleum producers, the Department of Energy's Co-Optimization of Fuels and Engines (a joint effort of 11 national laboratories; I serve as External Advisory Board member)21 and others have spent years evaluating the relationship between octane and engine design to determine that significant improvements in overall efficiency, performance and emissions can be obtained if internal combustion engines are designed to operate specifically on a higher octane fuel and do not need to accommodate alternative, lower-octane products. The Fuels Institute will be releasing a study in late spring evaluating the production capabilities of fuel producers to produce sufficient volumes of specific high-octane fuels and the market's ability to deliver such fuels to consumers. Preliminary results indicate there might be a trade-off between the most cost-efficient production options and the most cost-efficient distribution and retailing options. Much of the discussion to date has centered around the potential role for ethanol in such a market."Each advancement in the efficiency of the internal combustion engine extends its life in the market and that of liquid fuels. Automakers are focused on achieving the emissions reductions and vehicle efficiency targets set forth by government and will use the technologies available to comply in the most cost-efficient manner possible. This may include electrification at some point, but it must include engine advancement as well.Conclusion"The vehicle and fuels market is dynamic, with many stakeholders engaged in multiple initiatives designed to deliver compelling value to the consumer. Media outlets continue to rally around corporate and government announcements, new research papers and thought-leader statements that pronounce disruption to the traditional model of transportation and energy. Yet, when we look beyond the headlines and the hype, the market that is supposedly subject to disruptive and radical change won't get there in the next few decades without considerable external prodding."The fundamentals of the market demonstrate that meaningful change will take time. Changing today's transportation system will not be like introducing a car engine to replace the horse and buggy, or the introduction of the smartphone to ultimately replace a wallet and personal computer. The major difference is this: Each example of a major, successful disruptive event delivered compelling, immediate and tangible value to consumers that improved their quality of life in some real way. What transportation paradigm shift could do that?"Currently, I do not see overwhelming evidence that the consumer is inclined to drive a significant pace of change, so it falls to external forces to influence the pace of change. In the absence of aggressive policies or market forces inspiring an acceleration in market transition, it is most likely that the internal combustion engine will remain the dominant powertrain in the U.S. vehicle fleet for the next several decades. And although BEVs will continue to gain market share, perhaps at a very fast pace, and alternative mobility solutions are likely to emerge in certain regions and markets, the fundamental structure of the market will evolve slowly."* * *Footnotes:1 http://www.fuelsinstitute.org/about.shtm2 http://www.fuelsinstitute.org/research.shtm3 http://www.fuelsinstitute.org/news/fuelsforthought/index.shtm4 https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/archive/aeo17/5 http://www.fuelsinstitute.org/news/fuelsforthought/2017/Jun2017-2.shtm6 https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/gaspump_hist.php7 Upcoming release in March 2018 issue of NACS Magazine8 www.fuelsinstitute.org/forms/reportdownload.aspx?rid=Consumers-and-Alternative-Fuels-20179 Brent oil price data sourced from U.S. EIA; retail fuel prices sourced from OPIS Retail Fuel Report10 www.fuelsinstitute.org/forms/reportdownload.aspx?rid=Global-Initiatives11 https://www.rmi.org/insights/reports/peak-car-ownership-report/12 http://www.fuelsinstitute.org/forms/reportdownload.aspx?rid=Consumers-and-Alternative-Fuels-201713 www.fuelsinstitute.org/forms/reportdownload.aspx?rid=Driver-Demographics14 www.fuelsinstitute.org/ResearchArticles/Urbanization%20Brief.pdf15 Ryan Robinson, Deloitte, presentation at Fuels Institute Annual Meeting, May 2017, Denver, CO16 https://www.rmi.org/insights/reports/peak-car-ownership-report/17 https://www.rethinkx.com/transportation18 Ryan Robinson, Deloitte, presentation at FUELS2017, Fuels Institute Annual Meeting, May 2017, Denver, CO19 www.autonews.com/article/20171105/INDUSTRY_REDESIGNED/171109944/industry-redesigned-bob-lutz20 https://www.rmi.org/insights/reports/peak-car-ownership-report/21 https://www.energy.gov/eere/bioenergy/co-optimization-fuels-enginesCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6194893 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: March 8, 2018End of Document

CHINA: BIG DATA FUELS CRACKDOWN IN MINORITY REGION PREDICTIVE POLICING PROGRAM FLAGS INDIVIDUALS FOR INVESTIGATIONS, DETENTIONSStates News ServiceFebruary 26, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 3188 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:Chinese authorities are building and deploying a predictive policing program based on big data analysis in Xinjiang, Human Rights Watch said today. The program aggregates data about people often without their knowledge and flags those it deems potentially threatening to officials.According to interviewees, some of those targeted are detained and sent to extralegal "political education centers" where they are held indefinitely without charge or trial, and can be subject to abuse."For the first time, we are able to demonstrate that the Chinese government's use of big data and predictive policing not only blatantly violates privacy rights, but also enables officials to arbitrarily detain people," said Maya Wang, senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch. "People in Xinjiang can't resist or challenge the increasingly intrusive scrutiny of their daily lives because most don't even know about this 'black box' program or how it works."Human Rights Watch said Xinjiang authorities in recent years have increased mass surveillance measures across the region, augmenting existing tactics with the latest technologies. Since around April 2016, Human Rights Watch estimates, Xinjiang authorities have sent tens of thousands of Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities to "political education centers."Arbitrary mass surveillance and detention are Orwellian political tools; China should abandon use of them and release all those held in political education centers immediately.Maya WangChina ResearcherThese actions are part of the regional authorities' ongoing "Strike-Hard" campaign, and of President Xi's "stability maintenance" and "enduring peace" drive in the region. Authorities say the campaign targets "terrorist elements," but it is in practice far broader, and encompasses anyone suspected of political disloyalty, which in Xinjiang could mean any Uyghur, particularly those who express, even peacefully, their religious or cultural identity.Since August 2016, the Xinjiang Bureau of Public Security has posted procurement notices confirming the establishment of the "Integrated Joint Operations Platform" (IJOP, a¸'aŒ-e"aˆ'aa [deg]), a system that receives data on individuals from many different sources. Kashgar Prefecture appears to be one of the first areas where the system is complete and in regular use.These notices reveal that the IJOP gathers information from multiple sources or "sensors." One source is CCTV cameras, some of which have facial recognition or infrared capabilities (giving them "night vision"). Some cameras are positioned in locations police consider sensitive: entertainment venues, supermarkets, schools, and homes of religious figures. Another source is "wifi sniffers," which collect the unique identifying addresses of computers, smartphones, and other networked devices. The IJOP also receives information such as license plate numbers and citizen ID card numbers from some of the region's countless security checkpoints and from "visitors' management systems" in access-controlled communities. The vehicle checkpoints transmit information to IJOP, and "receive, in real time, predictive warnings pushed by the IJOP" so they can "identify targets... for checks and control."The IJOP also draws on existing information, such as one's vehicle ownership, health, family planning, banking, and legal records, according to official reports. Police and local officials are also required to submit to IJOP information on any activity they deem "unusual" and anything "related to stability" they have spotted during home visits and policing. One interviewee said that possession of many books, for example, would be reported to IJOP, if there is no ready explanation, such as having teaching as one's profession.Police officers, local Party and government cadres, and fanghuiju (, e, an acronym which stands for Visit the People, Benefit the People, and Get Together the Hearts of the People [,ac[deg]'acan ac[deg]'c"Ÿaneac[deg]',]) teams are also deployed to visit people at home to gather data. Fanghuiju teams consist of officials from different agencies who have since 2013 been sent out to villages and local communities for the overarching purpose of "safeguarding social stability." According to official reports, the frequency of fanghuiju visits to a given family as often as every day to once every two months depends on whether the family is considered politically "untrustworthy." During the visits, people are required to provide a range of data about their family, their "ideological situation," and relationships with neighbors. Official reports say these teams use mobile apps to ensure that "the information for every household" is "completely filled in" and submitted to IJOP.Police officers and local officials tasked with data collection do not appear to explain the reasons for such data collection, nor give residents a choice to decline to provide the data, according to interviewees.An Urumqi-based businessman shared with Human Rights Watch a form he was made to fill out for submission to the IJOP program in 2017. That form asked questions on religious practices, such as how many times the person prays every day and name of the person's regular mosque; whether and where the person had traveled abroad, including to any of "26 [sensitive] countries"; and their "involvement with [political] instability," including via relatives. The form also asks whether the person is a Uyghur, has been flagged by the IJOP, and is "trustworthy" to the authorities.Another interviewee told Human Rights Watch he had observed the IJOP computer interface in the neighborhood committee office on multiple occasions in the past year:I saw with my own eyes, on designated computers...the names, gender, ID numbers, occupation, familial relations, whether that person is trusted, not trusted, detained, subjected to political education (and year, month, date) for every Uyghur in that district. Those detained or not trusted, their color [coding] is different. Also, the content of the form is different depending on what has [already] been filled in. For example, for Uyghurs who have passports: when they got it, where did they go, how long did they stay, when did they come back, did they give their passports [to the police], did they come back from abroad, the reasons for travelling abroad such as family visits, tourism, pursuing studies, business, or others.According to official and state media reports, the IJOP regularly "pushes" information of interest and lists of names of people of interest to police, Chinese Communist Party, and government officials for further investigation. Officials then are supposed to act on these clues that same day (a¸,au), including through face-to-face visits. The IJOP data is evaluated together with other sources of information, such as the person's "general performance" during "study meetings."Upon "inspection," individuals "who ought to be taken, should be taken" (a"ac"'ac") into custody, two work reports by local fanghuiju teams say. Two people told Human Rights Watch that they had observed the IJOP computer interface generate lists of individuals to be rounded-up by the police. One heard police saying that some of those on the list would be detained and/or sent to political education centers. The other said:Those pushed by IJOP are detained and investigated. As to how long that investigation takes place, nobody knows. During investigation, the person maybe held in the detention center or in the "political education" center. [Afterwards] that person can be sentenced to prison or subjected to [further] "political education."Most reports provide little detail about precisely how the IJOP conducts its analysis. An August 2017 post by a fanghuiju team noted that IJOP flagged those "villagers who, without reason, failed to pay for their mobile phone bills and got disconnected," as well as those "whose phone and video calls involve terrorism and violence." An earlier press article dated October 2016 about an unnamed "big data platform" in Jiashi County (or Peyziwat County), Kashgar Prefecture, says it analyzes geographic, migrant population, fertilizer, gas, vehicle, and other data about people's daily lives and alerts the police if it discovers any "unusual activity." A police researcher involved with the project explained:For example, if a person usually only buys 5 kilos of chemical fertilizers, but suddenly [the amount] increases to 15 kilos, then we would send the frontline officers to visit [the person] and check its use. If there is no problem, [they would] input into the system the situation, and lower the alert level.While official references to IJOP are rare, one official WeChat report acknowledged that the IJOP is contributing analytics that land people in political education centers in the campaign against "Two-Faced" Uyghur officials thought to be disloyal to the Party:Finally, after the political legal [authorities] and public security used the IJOP to...again analyze and study [the cadres], they are sent to the county's Occupational Skills and Education Training Center to be [politically] educated.Xinjiang police claim that the IJOP has assisted them in bona fide crime-fighting: two publicized cases involved finding a petty thief and an individual involved in unlawful financial transaction."If the Chinese government's goal is to prevent bona fide crimes, it could train police and procurators in professional, rights-respecting methods, and empower defense lawyers," Wang said. "Arbitrary mass surveillance and detention are Orwellian political tools; China should abandon use of them and release all those held in political education centers immediately."For more information about the use of IJOP in Xinjiang, please see the information below.BackgroundThe IJOPProcurement notices for IJOP show that it is supplied by the Xinjiang Lianhai Cangzhi Company (ac-[deg]c-†e"-aˆ›aca¬a ¸). That firm is a wholly owned subsidiary of China Electronics Technology Group Corporation (CETC a¸'c"µac 'ac e›†a›centsa¬a ¸), a major state-owned military contractor in China, which had announced in a March 2016 press conference that the company had been awarded a government contract to build a big data program that would collate citizens' everyday behavior and flag unusual activities to predict terrorism.Integrated joint operations are a new People's Liberation Army doctrine that depend on a hi-tech C4ISR (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance) "system of systems," according to an expert who has studied it. The application of this military doctrine, and the supporting technology, to civilian policing is a worrying development that indicates the extent to which policing in Xinjiang is being based on a military model.A number of academic articles by researchers affiliated with the People's Public Security University of China, the CETC, and the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau Special Investigation Unit discuss predictive policing algorithms. One addresses whether individuals' patterns of electricity use are unusual, and describes an official police list that outline 75 behavioral indicators of "religious extremism," including, for example, whether someone "store large amounts of food in their homes." In July 2017, these three institutions jointly built a national research institute in Urumqi, with the aim to better equip regional authorities with big data powers to discover "hidden social security incidents."IJOP and the Strike Hard Campaign in XinjiangXinjiang, in northwestern China, is home to 11 million Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities. The Chinese government has imposed pervasive restrictions on fundamental human rights, including freedom of religion, on these minorities, primarily Uyghurs. These controls are intrusive and personal, including, for example, restrictions on what kind of dress or beard Uyghurs may wear, or what name they may give their children.Authorities treat expressions of Uyghur identity, including language, culture, and religion, as well as aspirations for independence, as one of the "three [evil] forces" (a¸‰e,',a ›), that is, "separatism, terrorism, and extremism." The Chinese government has a long tradition of conflating violent and nonviolent forms of political advocacy in Xinjiang, and authorities justify many repressive measures and the heavy security presence in the region as necessary in their fight against terrorism.Since May 2014, the Chinese government has waged a "Strike Hard Campaign against violent activities and terrorism" (a¸¥aŽ‰ac‰"a‡»aca ›acac-ac»a a¸"e'e'Œa ), a campaign that seems to have been brought to new repressive heights by Party Secretary Chen Quanguo, appointed in August 2016.Official reports suggest that IJOP supports several objectives of the Strike-Hard Campaign. One is to uncover the hidden "violent terrorists" and "criminal groups" as well as those who "challenge...state security, ethnic unity and social stability," all labels that can include Uyghurs who disagree with the state, including on trivial matters or issues plainly protected by fundamental human rights. Another is to strengthen monitoring and control of people who "float" meaning, anyone who is not living in a location other than that of their official household registration (hukou), including migrant workers as well as anyone who has travelled abroad.In practice, what the campaign means for Xinjiang residents who are not ethnic Han (China's predominant ethnic group) is that authorities in the past year are redoubling efforts at forced assimilation and at severing any foreign ties such residents may have. These efforts include: restricting foreign travel by recalling passports, forcing those living abroad to return, imprisoning those with foreign connections, strengthening the use of Mandarin language in education while deprioritizing minority languages, targeting "Two-faced" minority officials, and detaining people in "political education" centers. Xinjiang authorities have also heightened surveillance efforts, including instituting mass collection of DNA and voice biometrics from individuals between ages 12 and 65, routinely inspecting smartphones for "subversive" content, creating numerous checkpoints on roads and train stations, hiring thousands of new security personnel, and building "convenient" police stations.IJOP and the Lack of Privacy ProtectionsThere are few checks on police surveillance powers, or effective privacy protections against government intrusions in China. The police do not have to obtain any sort of court order to conduct surveillance, or provide any evidence that the people whose data they are collecting are associated with or involved in criminal activity. Police bureaus are not required to report surveillance activities to any other government agency, or to publicly disclose this information. It is very difficult for people to know what personal information the government collects, and how the government uses, shares, or stores their data.China does not have a unified privacy or data protection law to protect personally identifying information from misuse, especially by the government. There is very little information available about how, and how securely, the data collected by IJOP is stored, who can receive or share the data, and under what circumstances, when, if ever, is the data deleted. There is no formal system for people to find out what information is held about them in the IJOP, and no way to obtain redress for abuses associated with it.Across China, Human Rights Watch has also documented the authorities' efforts in implementing new technological systems for mass surveillance, including the use of big data in the "Police Cloud" program. It is unclear how the IJOP and Police Cloud are related, but they share similar objectives: integrating massive data collections on citizens, sharing it across multiple agencies, and explicitly prioritizing "focus personnel" a term authorities use to describe people they find problematic, including Uyghurs, drug-users, and those with mental health problems.It is also unclear if, and how, IJOP connects to other databases on people the police manage or have access to, including biometrics (DNA, voice samples, fingerprints), hukou and residency information (which includes information such as religious and political affiliations), as well as registration information at internet cafes, hotels, flights and trains.The foundation of these systems is the digital national identification card system, which makes a citizen's card number the key to accessing many public and private services, as well as the identifier for vast databases of personal information the government accesses, collects, and collates on each individual. In Xinjiang, residents are required to present their IDs in an even wider array of situations than elsewhere in China, including when going through the region's countless security checkpoints, buying knives, and filling the tank at the gas station. Although some of the data fed into the IJOP may not be secret or undisclosed such as the location of a car when various points or types of data are aggregated, it can be highly revealing of private life.The government's use of big data and predictive policing exacerbates already widespread violations of the right to privacy in China. Predictive algorithms require large datasets to train on for accuracy. As more police departments build cloud-based policing systems, they collect more and more personal data, including through their own increased surveillance activities and through cooperation with the private sector. As conceived, these systems will lead to enormous national and regional databases containing sensitive information on broad swaths of the population, which can be kept indefinitely and used for unforeseen future purposes. Such practices will intrude on the privacy of hundreds of millions of people the vast majority of whom will not be suspected of crime. And of those who are suspected of "unlawful" behavior, many will be targeted for acts, including dissent or religious expression, that are protected under international human rights law but are crimes in China.Directly at risk are the rights to be presumed innocent until proven guilty, and the freedom of association. The IJOP flags people who may have acted in a manner authorities deem unusual but that in no way constitutes a crime. These people are then at the mercy of a judicial system rife with abuse, including torture, that presents defendants only limited scope to contest the state's accusations even for ordinary, non-political, crimes. A predictive policing system such as IJOP that focus on individual's relationship networks could also place them under suspicion and surveillance, merely because they have associated with individuals whom authorities deem politically threatening.Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.Load-Date: February 27, 2018End of Document

China: Big Data Fuels Crackdown in Minority RegionTargeted News ServiceFebruary 26, 2018 Monday 7:22 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 3116 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK BodyHuman Rights Watch issued the following news release:Chinese authorities are building and deploying a predictive policing program based on big data analysis in Xinjiang, Human Rights Watch said today. The program aggregates data about people - often without their knowledge - and flags those it deems potentially threatening to officials.According to interviewees, some of those targeted are detained and sent to extralegal "political education centers" where they are held indefinitely without charge or trial, and can be subject to abuse."For the first time, we are able to demonstrate that the Chinese government's use of big data and predictive policing not only blatantly violates privacy rights, but also enables officials to arbitrarily detain people," said Maya Wang, senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch. "People in Xinjiang can't resist or challenge the increasingly intrusive scrutiny of their daily lives because most don't even know about this 'black box' program or how it works."Human Rights Watch said Xinjiang authorities in recent years have increased mass surveillance measures across the region, augmenting existing tactics with the latest technologies. Since around April 2016, Human Rights Watch estimates, Xinjiang authorities have sent tens of thousands of Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities to "political education centers."These actions are part of the regional authorities' ongoing "Strike-Hard" campaign, and of President Xi's "stability maintenance" and "enduring peace" drive in the region. Authorities say the campaign targets "terrorist elements," but it is in practice far broader, and encompasses anyone suspected of political disloyalty, which in Xinjiang could mean any Uyghur, particularly those who express, even peacefully, their religious or cultural identity.Since August 2016, the Xinjiang Bureau of Public Security has posted procurement notices confirming the establishment of the "Integrated Joint Operations Platform" (IJOP, a system that receives data on individuals from many different sources. Kashgar Prefecture appears to be one of the first areas where the system is complete and in regular use.These notices reveal that the IJOP gathers information from multiple sources or "sensors." One source is CCTV cameras, some of which have facial recognition or infrared capabilities (giving them "night vision"). Some cameras are positioned in locations police consider sensitive: entertainment venues, supermarkets, schools, and homes of religious figures. Another source is "wifi sniffers," which collect the unique identifying addresses of computers, smartphones, and other networked devices. The IJOP also receives information such as license plate numbers and citizen ID card numbers from some of the region's countless security checkpoints and from "visitors' management systems" in access-controlled communities. The vehicle checkpoints transmit information to IJOP, and "receive, in real time, predictive warnings pushed by the IJOP" so they can "identify targets... for checks and control."The IJOP also draws on existing information, such as one's vehicle ownership, health, family planning, banking, and legal records, according to official reports. Police and local officials are also required to submit to IJOP information on any activity they deem "unusual" and anything "related to stability" they have spotted during home visits and policing. One interviewee said that possession of many books, for example, would be reported to IJOP, if there is no ready explanation, such as having teaching as one's profession.Police officers, local Party and government cadres, and fanghuiju an acronym which stands for Visit the People, Benefit the People, and Get Together the Hearts of the People teams are also deployed to visit people at home to gather data. Fanghuiju teams consist of officials from different agencies who have since 2013 been sent out to villages and local communities for the overarching purpose of "safeguarding social stability." According to official reports, the frequency of fanghuiju visits to a given family - as often as every day to once every two months - depends on whether the family is considered politically "untrustworthy." During the visits, people are required to provide a range of data about their family, their "ideological situation," and relationships with neighbors. Official reports say these teams use mobile apps to ensure that "the information for every household" is "completely filled in" and submitted to IJOP.Police officers and local officials tasked with data collection do not appear to explain the reasons for such data collection, nor give residents a choice to decline to provide the data, according to interviewees.An Urumqi-based businessman shared with Human Rights Watch a form he was made to fill out for submission to the IJOP program in 2017. That form asked questions on religious practices, such as how many times the person prays every day and name of the person's regular mosque; whether and where the person had traveled abroad, including to any of "26 [sensitive] countries"; and their "involvement with [political] instability," including via relatives. The form also asks whether the person is a Uyghur, has been flagged by the IJOP, and is "trustworthy" to the authorities.Another interviewee told Human Rights Watch he had observed the IJOP computer interface in the neighborhood committee office on multiple occasions in the past year:I saw with my own eyes, on designated computers...the names, gender, ID numbers, occupation, familial relations, whether that person is trusted, not trusted, detained, subjected to political education (and year, month, date) for every Uyghur in that district. Those detained or not trusted, their color [coding] is different. Also, the content of the form is different depending on what has [already] been filled in. For example, for Uyghurs who have passports: when they got it, where did they go, how long did they stay, when did they come back, did they give their passports [to the police], did they come back from abroad, the reasons for travelling abroad such as family visits, tourism, pursuing studies, business, or others.According to official and state media reports, the IJOP regularly "pushes" information of interest and lists of names of people of interest to police, Chinese Communist Party, and government officials for further investigation. Officials then are supposed to act on these clues that same day, including through face-to-face visits. The IJOP data is evaluated together with other sources of information, such as the person's "general performance" during "study meetings."Upon "inspection," individuals "who ought to be taken, should be taken" into custody, two work reports by local fanghuiju teams say. Two people told Human Rights Watch that they had observed the IJOP computer interface generate lists of individuals to be rounded-up by the police. One heard police saying that some of those on the list would be detained and/or sent to political education centers. The other said:Those pushed by IJOP are detained and investigated. As to how long that investigation takes place, nobody knows. During investigation, the person maybe held in the detention center or in the "political education" center. [Afterwards] that person can be sentenced to prison or subjected to [further] "political education."Most reports provide little detail about precisely how the IJOP conducts its analysis. An August 2017 post by a fanghuiju team noted that IJOP flagged those "villagers who, without reason, failed to pay for their mobile phone bills and got disconnected," as well as those "whose phone and video calls involve terrorism and violence." An earlier press article dated October 2016 about an unnamed "big data platform" in Jiashi County (or Peyziwat County), Kashgar Prefecture, says it analyzes geographic, migrant population, fertilizer, gas, vehicle, and other data about people's daily lives and alerts the police if it discovers any "unusual activity." A police researcher involved with the project explained:For example, if a person usually only buys 5 kilos of chemical fertilizers, but suddenly [the amount] increases to 15 kilos, then we would send the frontline officers to visit [the person] and check its use. If there is no problem, [they would] input into the system the situation, and lower the alert level.While official references to IJOP are rare, one official WeChat report acknowledged that the IJOP is contributing analytics that land people in political education centers in the campaign against "Two-Faced" Uyghur officials thought to be disloyal to the Party:Finally, after the political legal [authorities] and public security used the IJOP to...again analyze and study [the cadres], they are sent to the county's Occupational Skills and Education Training Center to be [politically] educated.Xinjiang police claim that the IJOP has assisted them in bona fide crime-fighting: two publicized cases involved finding a petty thief and an individual involved in unlawful financial transaction."If the Chinese government's goal is to prevent bona fide crimes, it could train police and procurators in professional, rights-respecting methods, and empower defense lawyers," Wang said. "Arbitrary mass surveillance and detention are Orwellian political tools; China should abandon use of them and release all those held in political education centers immediately."For more information about the use of IJOP in Xinjiang, please see the information below.BackgroundThe IJOPProcurement notices for IJOP show that it is supplied by the Xinjiang Lianhai Cangzhi Company.

House Armed Services Subcommittee Issues Testimony From Center for Strategic & International StudiesTargeted News ServiceJanuary 9, 2018 Tuesday 10:17 PM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 6390 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe House Armed Services subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities issued the following testimony by William Carter, deputy director and fellow at Center for Strategic and International Studies, at a hearing entitled "China's Pursuit of Emerging and Exponential Technologies":"Chairman Stefanik, Ranking Member Langevin, thank you for the opportunity to participate in today's hearing on this important topic. China's significant progress in key emerging technologies like [artificial intelligence, cyber, space-based capabilities and antisatellite weapons, electronic warfare and quantum computing] have transformed the global security environment in recent years, and require a rethink of the way that we approach securing our nation."Asia is a critical part of America's future, economically and strategically, and we are in a new era of strategic competition with China, one defined by our competing progress in advanced technologies. Our response to China's progress in technology is essential to our future. The goal of my testimony is to amplify some of these issues and to propose potential solutions for how we can implement an effective strategy to deal with this challenge."Since the Cold War, U.S. national security has been built upon the unparalleled strength of American technology. In the 1950s, the Department of Defense successfully "offset" the Soviet Union's conventional military superiority by strengthening our nuclear deterrent, and in the 1970s we again cemented our military dominance through innovation in precision munitions, stealth, and a new generation of space based ISR and communications technologies, the so-called "second offset." Today, this offset dynamic is being reversed. China is pursuing an "offset strategy" of its own to overcome our conventional superiority by winning the race to dominate the next generation of technology."In 2014, the Department of Defense (DoD) announced a "third offset," developing the next generation of technological dominance based on artificial intelligence and robotics, miniaturization and ubiquitous connectivity, and quantum computing, but this technological race is very different than the others. The success of previous offsets was based on investing in winning a race our adversaries didn't even know they were in while allowing them to focus their resources on an area of advantage that we could overcome through innovation. But today, even as we are pursuing our "third offset," China is pursuing a "first offset" of its own, and is investing in the same technologies to challenge us that we are investing in to maintain our strategic edge. They have developed a national strategic plan - in fact many of them - to overtake us in the race to dominate these new technologies, and are rapidly closing the gap in innovation, deployment, and militarization of these new systems with the U.S.China's Technology is Catching up with, and Perhaps Surpassing Our Own"China sees offensive cyber capabilities, anti-satellite weapons, electronic warfare tools, hypersonic weapons, artificial intelligence, and quantum technologies as key to enabling the PLA to win wars in future, high-tech conditions and offset the advantages of the U.S. military, and has made significant strides in all of these areas. These technologies can be divided into two broad buckets: technologies to disrupt and degrade our military capabilities by exploiting our vulnerabilities in the information domain, and technologies that will determine the future global balance of both economic and strategic power.Carter: Written Testimony, House Armed Services Committee 1/9/2018 3"The PLA correctly views the U.S. military as highly vulnerable to a first strike in the "information domain," and is developing capabilities in this domain that will overcome their conventional disadvantages. We may have more and better aircraft carriers, tanks, and missiles than the PLA, but without access to data and connectivity many of these systems are ineffective or even inoperable. Chinese military thinkers describe the U.S. military's Achilles heel simply: "No satellites, no fight.""China has demonstrated the ability to significantly disrupt, degrade, and even destroy the ICT infrastructure on which our military depends. The PLA has tested a range of anti-satellite weapons, including conventional ground-based kinetic kill vehicles,1 directed energy weapons,2 jamming and spoofing capabilities,3 and "kill-satellites" designed to disable or destroy other satellites on orbit.4 They have expanded their electronic warfare capabilities, testing their capabilities to jam radar and communications and spoof GPS systems.5 China has also developed some of the most sophisticated offensive cyber capabilities in the world."China is also investing heavily in building its technological base to dominate the technologies of the future. In particular, China sees artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum as foundational to both economic and military competitiveness in the long term, and has become not just a copycat or adopter of these technologies, but an innovator in its own right."Competition in AI between the U.S. and China has become neck-and-neck. Chinese researchers now publish more papers on AI than any other country in the world, although U.S. papers are still more widely cited, suggesting that they are more impactful and highly respected in the field.6 Chinese companies have also made significant breakthroughs in AI applications including natural language processing,7 real-time translation,8 imagery analysis,9 and autonomous driving.10"In quantum, China may already be well ahead. China has launched a quantum communications satellite called Micius,11 established a quantum fiber link between Beijing and Shanghai,12 has invested billions of dollars into research on quantum computing, and even claims to have tested functioning quantum radar that can detect stealth aircraft.13 Some of China's claimed advances in quantum technology are likely embellished, but we have seen enough of China's capabilities in this field that we must take them seriously. Where the U.S. stands in quantum research is murky, as much of the research is classified. However, a number of US researchers have recently noted that the US seems to be lagging, owing primarily to the comparative willingness of the Chinese government to aggressively fund new quantum initiatives.14Investing in Resiliency and Avoiding Conflict"Going forward, the U.S. must adopt a national strategy to counter China's offset in the short and long term. China's short-term strategy is to exploit the U.S. military's weaknesses and exert constant pressure to undermine us. In 2015, the PLA created the Strategic Support Force (SSF) to centralize information warfare units within the PLA. Notably, the SSF includes not only cyber, but also space and electronic warfare operations. The Chinese do not view information warfare as limited to computer networks, but rather as a domain spanning intelligence, communications, and the entire electromagnetic spectrum."China's offensive cyber capabilities should be of greatest concern to us in the short term because they are being used against us every day to strengthen China's strategic position in incremental ways. There is much debate about whether we are in a "cyber war" with China. My answer to that is simple: no. "War" implies an all or nothing conflict against an enemy, one where we must do what it takes to defeat them. China is a "frenemy" of the United States, not an enemy, and we are not prepared to do whatever it takes to defeat them in response to the low-level espionage and network reconnaissance activities that both sides engage in every day."We are in a new era of strategic competition with China in the information domain, a form of low-level, protracted back and forth in which both sides constantly prepare for possible conflict and seek to develop asymmetric capabilities that would allow them to dominate in a potential conflict. In China, this stance is referred to by PLA strategists as "active defense."15 By conducting peacetime network operations, PLA officers aim to identify vulnerabilities in US systems that could be exploited for active disruption if an attack were ever launched against China. The PLA see such network reconnaissance as unlikely to lead to escalation or retaliation, but taken together they allow China to slowly improve its strategic position."Though the active defense doctrine is ostensibly concerned with self-defense and post-emptive strike, the Chinese view cyber warfare as being highly effective for a first strike, and assume that very quickly afterwards vulnerabilities will be mitigated, defenses erected, and the advantage of surprise taken away. If the PLA were ever to attain a level of network penetration sufficient for them to feel confident in their ability to cripple US military forces long enough to attain a conventional or nuclear advantage, the US strategic position would be irreparably compromised."It is important to note that, while we often talk of "technological parity," when it comes to these technologies, in many ways it is less important whether their technology is "as good as ours" than whether it is good enough to render our capabilities ineffective. Our most important goal should be to invest in resiliency so that China is never confident enough to launch a preemptive strike. This means both hardening our networks and infrastructure, particularly in cyberspace and outer space, and developing and demonstrating our ability to operate in denied environments."We must re-train our military to operate in analog mode without access to data and technology. We must ensure that any new system or platform DoD buys has at least some basic level of functionality without access to space-based capabilities, instead of buying systems that are extremely effective when connected but cannot operate at all in denied environments. We must build a secure supply chain and develop new ways to test and ensure the security of the chips that we use in our weapons systems. We must develop new space architectures that do not rely on a small number of exquisitely capable, but also vulnerable, government satellites, leveraging commercial satellite capabilities, international partnerships, and constellations of smaller, cheaper satellites that are individually less capable, but are more survivable and replaceable. And we must develop ground-based backups and redundant capabilities so that we are not entirely reliant on space. These are not new answers to new questions. We know what needs to be done, but we need to get serious about implementing these solutions.Leveraging Our Unique Strengths to Maintain a Long-Term Technological Edge"Ultimately, however, simply countering China's immediate efforts to exploit our vulnerabilities will not be enough to confront the emerging threat of China's growing technological capabilities. In the long term, China's strategy is not just to exploit the weaknesses in our military technology but to develop their own innovative, dynamic high technology sector to dominate the next generation of civilian and military technologies, particularly AI. They seek to leverage both commercial and military innovation in ways that complement each other and build both military and economic power. Their national strategies anticipate a shift from today's "informatized warfare" to "intelligentized warfare,"16 and their strategy to dominate in intelligentized warfare is to dominate key commercial industries in AI, quantum technology, augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) and robotics.We Need a National Strategy to Maintain Our Technological Dominance"China has a strategic plan--in fact many of them--to develop a technological edge over the United States. National policies like the New Generation AI Development Plan, the 13th Five Year National Science and Technology and Innovation Plan, and the Made in China 2025 Plan represent a concerted effort to leverage the full resources available to China in order to cultivate indigenous technological innovation. China recognizes that military technology does not exist in a vacuum. It is a part of an ecosystem that spans the public and private sector, and has dependencies ranging from access to basic materials to massive quantities of data. In the digital age, virtually all technological breakthroughs are fundamentally dual-use."The Chinese system of industrial planning offers advantages in its ability to coordinate the activities of myriad groups and direct them all towards a single aim. An example of this is the case of high-end computer chips, a critical enabler for strategically-significant technologies like artificial intelligence. Realizing the significance of a robust integrated chip (IC) industry in China, the central government released its 2014 National Guidelines for the Development and Promotion of the IC Industry, established a national IC investment fund, which has provided over $20 billion so far to support the industry, and introduced new financing tools, insurance products, and tax policies introduced by the central government to encourage innovation.17"The result of these policies has been a dramatic expansion of China's IC industry, with revenues increasing by almost 20% for the sector in 2017 compared to just 3.4% for the rest of the world.18 Further, 2017 represented the first year that chip design brought in more revenues than chip packaging and testing, indicating that China's policies have been effective not only at expanding the industry, but at promoting the development of technologically sophisticated enterprises with high strategic value."That said, there are enormous bureaucratic inefficiencies involved in China's centrally-planned approach to industrial policy, which can waste resources and create severe market distortions. We should not try to replicate China's approach, but instead strive to formulate a cohesive, whole-of-government strategy based not on central planning, costly oversight procedures and elaborate coordination mechanisms, but on a common understanding of the strategic goals of the nation and how all of the levers of government can be used to support them.Invest in Long-Term Fundamental Research and Development"An important component of this strategy should be government investment in R&D and innovation. China has realized the essential role that both public and private R&D investments play in technologies like AI, but the U.S. increasingly depends on commercial R&D alone. Corporate research has a major role to play in advancing our nation's technological capacity, but the developers in these groups are often only focused on projects with immediate and guaranteed commercial applications. There is little incentive for most companies to fund sustained work on exploratory projects with long incubation periods and uncertain prospects for returns like fundamental research into quantum computing. The federal government is in a unique position to be able to support basic research which may not pay off for 20-30 years, but, like the internet, may prove revolutionary."Unfortunately, U.S. commitment to support public sector R&D is flagging. After the July 2017 announcement of China's new AI development plan, local and provincial governments announced billions of dollars of support to the industry, with the cities of Xiangtan and Tianjin alone pledging a collective $7 billion to MI projects.19 In comparison, total U.S. government R&D investment in AI was $1.1 billion in 2015,20 and the Trump administration's proposed budget would have cut the NSF's AI research funding by 10%. The U.S. government should be expanding, not curtailing, R&D funding for technologies like AI, leveraging research vehicles like DARPA, IARPA, and the national labs to advance our nation's technological capacity and ensure we are investing in the capabilities our defense and intelligence communities will need to manage emerging threats in the future.Leverage the World-Leading Innovation of the U.S. Private Sector"In addition, the U.S. must continue to support private sector innovation, which represents our greatest competitive advantage as a nation. In the past, major defense innovations took place in government labs, giving the military easy and monopolized access to strategically-significant innovations. Today, this is no longer the case. The private sector is now the source for most new strategic technologies, and our military's future effectiveness will depend on leveraging commercial advances more effectively than our opponents."There are two key things we can do to better leverage private sector innovation. First, we must support and enable the development of commercial markets for transformative new technologies. Technology has gotten decades ahead of our laws, policies, and regulations. Innovations like artificial intelligence, ubiquitous sensors, big data, and virtual reality raise significant questions about safety, security, privacy, and liability, and commercial markets for these technologies cannot thrive without a clear roadmap of how we will approach governing their development and use."Second, we must fundamentally rethink our approach to bringing private sector innovations into the national security world. The Chinese government has recently taken a number of steps to promote what they call "military-civil fusion" by creating opportunities for government and military researchers to partner with leading technology companies in the development of new products.21 China's approach is based off of similar efforts in the U.S., notably through programs like DoD's Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx) and In-Q-Tel, which offer the security establishment a way to bypass cumbersome contract processes and accelerate the deployment of cutting-edge technologies within our military."But these programs are tiny compared to the behemoth of traditional federal acquisitions, and we cannot expect a tiny part of the federal acquisitions process to produce the bulk of our next generation of military capabilities. As the share of transformative innovation continues to shift toward the commercial sector, these lean, agile acquisition programs cannot remain the exception, they must become the norm, and we must expect and tolerate stumbles and problems as we learn to leverage these approaches at scale."We also need to have a deeper conversation about how we can maintain a technological edge in national security in a world in which technology is fast-moving, ubiquitous, and develops outside of the government and outside our own borders. Our way of thinking about the relationship between technology and national security dates back to the Cold War, and is based on the concept of controlling access to technologies that have military applications. Most of today's most popular technologies have at least a theoretical military application, whether FitBits, quadcopters, Google Maps or Shazam, and the military is barely able to keep up its awareness of the latest developments in the commercial sector, much less try to control cutting edge technologies."It is no longer plausible or useful to base our national security strategy on the assumption that our military will have sole access to the best technology. As China becomes more innovative, they will develop their own cutting-edge military technologies that we will not be able to control. Trying to control our own commercial technologies as "dual use" only deters private companies from working with DoD to protect their freedom to market their products internationally, and paying defense contractors to re-invent the wheel by building bespoke versions of commercial technologies for a DoD client has proven ineffective and wasteful, draining our resources and causing the military to fall dramatically behind the private sector in even simple day-to-day technologies. Perhaps it is time for a new way of thinking about maintaining a technological edge for the military. We may not be the only ones who have access to the cutting-edge technologies of the future, but we can try to adapt faster and make better use of new technologies than our adversaries.Counter Chinese Efforts to Exploit the U.S. Education System and Innovation Economy in Ways that Work for Us"That does not mean we should be blind to our adversaries' efforts to acquire our technology and exploit U.S. innovation. In February 2017, DIUx released a report on China's technology transfer strategy which identified more than ten major strategies employed by China to acquire U.S. technologies, including early stage investments in U.S. tech startups, industrial espionage and cyber theft of intellectual property, and attracting talented engineers and students back to China along with all of their knowledge and experience of what U.S. companies and researchers are working on in their fields.22"The current debate in the U.S. around Chinese tech transfer is focused on preventing them from exploiting our education and investment environment by keeping China out, but this is misguided. If China wants to send their best and brightest students to be educated in our universities and graduate programs, and invest billions of dollars in startups and R&D in the United States, so much the better for us. We should instead focus on keeping them here, allowing the talented researchers and engineers that we educate to innovate and build businesses that employ Americans and add to the U.S. economy. We must ensure that the next generation of innovators, wherever they are born, build the technology of the future here in the United States."The DIUx report recommends that we look at ways to restrict Chinese investment in U.S. technology companies, particularly those with potential military applications. This is unlikely to work - it is easier to disguise the source of investment capital than to investigate it - and will not stop China from acquiring our technology through its other tech transfer strategies. Such an effort could also quickly become impossibly broad. Thousands of entrepreneurs seek capital in the U.S. each year to build businesses in AI, AR and VR, robotics, and IoT devices, and attempting to anticipate all those technologies which might one day have military applications is impractical, if not impossible. Furthermore, if anything, restricting China's access to U.S. technologies through investment could cause them to redouble their efforts to acquire our technology through more damaging means like industrial espionage and cyber theft, and to invest more of their money in domestic innovation."That said, Congressional efforts to reform the CFIUS process are essential. The proposed legislation modernizes the process and makes it more flexible, which is important not just in our technological competition with China, but to ensure our continuing security against a range of global threats. In particular, expanding the Committee's oversight of joint ventures and non-controlling investments is important. We should do more to identify and prevent deals that truly threaten our nation's strategic industries, but our goal should not be to cut off Chinese investment in U.S. companies. If China wants to pour their money into U.S. companies instead of their own domestic entrepreneurs, we should not turn the money away, but instead push back against anti-competitive practices and IP theft that exploit the companies that take their capital. Instead of restricting investment, policymakers should focus on ways to support companies that take Chinese investment, such as pressuring China to open up market access to U.S. companies.Invest in the Workforce of the Future"In the long term, we need to build in a workforce capable of leading the next generation of technological developments. Establishing new education and training resources for talent development was included as one of the main pillars of China's New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan, and the country has followed through by creating several new graduate programs in AI at Chinese universities to support need for trained researchers. China has also set its sights on attracting foreign talent, investing through its Thousand Talents Program to entice outside academics to relocate to China."The U.S. must also invest in cultivating domestic talent, expanding computer science education initiatives in schools and increasing funding for universities to support the next generation of researchers and slow the brain drain that is threatening the U.S.' ability to train successive generations of talent.23 Universities are under financial pressure as the government retrenches, making it even more difficult to compete with the huge salaries commanded by people with specialized skills in cutting edge fields like machine learning and artificial intelligence. This is imperiling our ability to train the next generation of talent in these crucial fields."As we think about where to focus our resources in education, we must move away from thinking in terms of the "STEM" disciplines, science, technology, engineering and math. STEM is both to broad and too narrow a category. On one hand, while the U.S. faces significant workforce shortages in some STEM fields like artificial intelligence, materials science and data science, there are significant surpluses in other STEM fields like chemistry and biotechnology.24 On the other hand, as automation plays an increasingly important role in the economy, the hard skills that STEM advocates so highly value will be the first to be automated, and the skills that we will need most from human beings will be soft skills like critical thinking, empathy and communication that are emphasized in the liberal arts. Our education strategy should focus on a two-pronged approach: develop a strong pool of technical talent that can build and operate the technology of the future, and build a broad workforce of quick thinking, adaptable people with basic digital literacy and the soft skills to complement and work with machines.Build an Open Data Ecosystem and Leverage International Partnerships to Combat China's Advantage of Scale"China's scale is one of its greatest advantages over the United States. China has 1.4 billion people; the U.S. has less than 330 million.25 The Chinese economy is the second largest in the world, and is projected to overtake the U.S. in 15 to 20 years. China will be home to 20% of the world's data by 2020 and 30% by 2030,26 a huge advantage in the development of AI, which depends on massive volumes of data on which to train learning algorithms. The size of the Chinese market also attracts innovators and entrepreneurs and allows China to lure talent and IP from overseas."But U.S. innovators also have advantages. China may have a huge consumer market but U.S. companies have larger global market share. Chinese companies dominate the domestic market, but have struggled to compete globally. China may have over 1 billion people, but Facebook has more than 2 billion users worldwide. Google has more Gmail users than any Chinese email service, and Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp have more users than any Chinese messaging service. As a result, while China may have 30% of the world's data, U.S. companies have a tremendous head start on cornering the other 70% of the global data market. These users are also more diverse and more global than users of Chinese services like WeChat and QQ. China's data is almost entirely on Chinese consumers, whereas U.S. companies like Facebook and Google have users around the world. This is an important advantage."But U.S. tech companies' position in foreign markets is under threat from policies that make it more difficult for foreign companies to compete. Privacy advocates in the U.S. are also pushing for greater protections for data. Even close allies like the EU are developing policies like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that target U.S. companies' ability to compete. The U.S. government must develop a strategy to combat protectionism, data localization and privacy policies that harm our global tech companies. Doing this effectively will require balancing legitimate concerns around privacy and consumer protection both in the U.S. and abroad with the need for an open, flexible data ecosystem that supports innovation and experimentation in AI. We can also use trade agreements and establish bilateral and multilateral partnerships to promote the free flow of data and support collaboration in R&D for emerging technologies.Avoid Dogmatic Views of New Technologies like Autonomous Weapons"As we plan for the future, particularly in the military context, we cannot afford to adopt dogmatic views of new technologies that prevent us from exploring their potential. China looks at our strategies and policies, identifies their gaps and flaws, and seeks to exploit them for their own advantage. If we disavow potentially transformative technologies, we open a door to China to leapfrog our capabilities."A prime example is autonomous weapons. In the US, lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS) often dominate conversations around AI, and discussions around AI policy too often revolve around the dangers of the military developing "killer robots" that could become available to malicious actors like criminals and terrorists. This conversation is both premature and behind the times. Fully autonomous weapon systems remain far from combat-ready, and human soldiers are not going anywhere anytime soon. At the same time, the technology for private individuals to build simple autonomous killing machines at little cost already exists, as a professor from UC Berkeley ironically demonstrated while advocating against the development of autonomous weapons.27"In 2016, the Secretary of Defense said, "whenever it comes to the application of force, there will never be true autonomy, because there'll be humans (in the loop)."28 This argument makes sense for today's AI technology. Human-machine partnerships are far more effective and reliable than fully autonomous systems in complex and dynamic combat environments, and are likely to remain so for a while. But if we rule out the possibility of fully autonomous combat systems, DoD risks missing out on a class of technologies that could fundamentally transform warfare."Other countries like Russia and China are unlikely to exercise the same restraint when it comes to fully autonomous weapons systems, which they view as an opportunity to leapfrog US military dominance.29 If these countries were to field fully autonomous weapons systems that could analyze and adapt to our tactics and strategies at machine speed, it could render our defenses ineffective if we do not do the same. DoD should invest in the next generation of combat systems that leverage the full potential of AI, including the potential future development of lethal AI systems that can operate without humans in the loop. Instead of LAWS "never," our policy should be "not until they can outperform human/MI collaboration," including making ethically acceptable choices about when to pull the trigger.Responding to Chinese Technological Progress and Maintaining our Technological Leadership in the Short and Long Term"China has taken a page out of the U.S. playbook, pursuing an offset strategy to overcome our conventional superiority by beating us in the race to the next generation of transformative technology. They are evaluating our military technology and our future strategy and doctrine, looking for the gaps and weaknesses of our approach so that they can exploit them for their own advantage. We must develop a new national security strategy of our own to win the race and overcome China's efforts to undermine our global position."In the short term, we must counter China's efforts to exploit our military's dependencies on ICT technologies by investing in resiliency and ensuring that China never develops enough confidence in their ability to compromise our systems to justify a first strike. In the long term, we must ensure that our world-leading education system and business environment work for us. We should rethink the relationship between private sector innovation and our military's technological edge to better leverage our greatest strength, our private technology industry, to secure our nation. We should push back against China's efforts to acquire our technology and the fruits of our innovation, but not push away China's brightest minds and innovation capital if they want to send them to the United States. We should invest in fundamental R&D that will form the basis of the next generation of technologies, not by replicating or subsidizing the private sector's efforts but by supporting the kind of long-term moonshot research that private companies are less willing to support. And we should build a strong base on which our private sector innovators can thrive by reinvesting in education, creating strong commercial markets for transformative technologies, and protecting our companies' ability to compete in global markets."Finally, we must remember that China is not the only threat we need to worry about. Russia, Iran and North Korea, among others, see the same weaknesses and vulnerabilities in our approach to national security that the Chinese do. To appropriately manage the range of threats the U.S. faces, we must focus not just on "beating China," but on increasing our strength and agility across the technological domain. We are no longer the disruptor offsetting an adversary with a conventional advantage by sprinting to disruptive technologies, we are the conventional hegemon and we must be prepared to face any challenger. Policymakers must wake up to the threat faced by all of these countries, and ensure that our country is investing in the technologies and systems that will define the next era of warfare."I thank the Committee for the opportunity to testify and will be happy to answer any questions."* * *Footnotes:1 Shirley Kan, "China's Anti-Satellite Weapon Test," CRS Report for Congress, RS22652, April 23, 20072 Richard D.

China: Release Human Rights LawyersTargeted News ServiceFebruary 15, 2018 Thursday 8:23 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 967 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK BodyHuman Rights Watch issued the following news release:The Chinese government should immediately release human rights lawyers who have been detained or imprisoned on baseless subversion charges, Human Rights Watch said today. Authorities should also end the practice of revoking or suspending licenses of lawyers and law firms on political grounds.In February 2018, authorities stripped human rights lawyer Sui Muqing of his license for allegedly violating "courtroom etiquette," and canceled the registration of the Wutian Law Firm for its refusal to participate in a politicized review process."Not only is the Chinese government still holding some rights lawyers and activists rounded up in the July 2015 crackdown, it's disbarring others as a crude way to intimidate the group," said Sophie Richardson, China director. "This endless persecution of the legal profession exposes the absurdity of China's claim to uphold the 'rule of law.'"Since August 2017, authorities have revoked or suspended the licenses to practice of several human rights lawyers. They have also canceled the registration of one law firm. One lawyer has been detained on subversion charges:* In August, the Hangzhou Bureau of Justice suspended Wu Youshui from practicing law for nine months. The bureau said it was a punishment for online articles Wu published that were critical of the Chinese government.* In September, the Shandong Bureau of Justice revoked lawyer Zhu Shengwu's license, alleging that his messages criticizing the Chinese government and Chinese Communist Party leaders on his social media "endangered national security."* In December, the Yunnan Bureau of Justice revoked the licenses of lawyers Wang Liqian and Wang Delong, accusing them of impersonation fraud. The lawyers believed that the disbarment was due to their withdrawing from the All China Lawyers Association, a government-run professional association. The lawyers had criticized the association for failing to advocate for lawyers' rights.* In January 2018, the Beijing Bureau of Justice revoked Yu Wensheng's license, stating that he had published speeches that "oppose the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party." On January 19, authorities detained Yu in Beijing as he was walking his son to school. Police later took Yu to Xuzhou in Jiangsu province, held him in an undisclosed location, and accused him of "inciting subversion of state power." Two days before his detention, Yu had posted an appeal calling for the amendment of China's constitution and open presidential elections. In 2014, Beijing authorities had detained Yu for 99 days, during which he was allegedly tortured and denied access to lawyers.* In February, the Guangdong Bureau of Justice revoked Sui Muqing's license. The bureau alleged that Sui refused to obey courtroom etiquette rules during the trial of human rights lawyer Ding Jiaxi in 2014. The bureau claimed Sui did not comply with court orders by repeatedly standing up, walking around the courtroom, and speaking without permission. Sui has represented prominent human rights activists including Guo Feixoing and Huang Qi.* In February, the Beijing Bureau of Justice canceled the registration of the Wutian Law Firm, stating that the firm's lawyers failed to participate in China's annual lawyers' evaluation organized by the bureau. The founder of the law firm, Cheng Hai, said Chinese law does not stipulate that lawyers have to take part in justice bureaus' annual evaluations, and the real purpose of the evaluations is to scrutinize lawyers' political opinions.In 2016, the Chinese Ministry of Justice revised two directives on law firms and lawyers - the Management Methods on Law Firms and the Management Methods on Lawyers - explicitly requiring lawyers and law firms to "support the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party," and to establish party branches in law firms. Lawyers are prohibited from expressing opinions that "reject the fundamental political system" of China or may "endanger national security."The arrest of Yu Wensheng and the revocations of legal licenses are a continuation of the crackdown on human rights lawyers in recent years. Several of the approximately 300 lawyers and activists who were rounded up in the "709" crackdown in 2015 remain in detention or prison. Lawyer Wang Quanzhang, detained in July 2015 and charged with "inciting subversion of state power," still awaits trial and has been denied legal counsel. In November 2017, lawyer Jiang Tianyong was sentenced to two years in prison on charges of inciting subversion. In August 2016, a court in Tianjin sentenced human rights lawyer Zhou Shifeng to seven years in prison after convicting him of subversion.The Chinese government has used various methods available to wrongfully punish activist lawyers. The Ministry of Justice and its lower-level offices issue lawyers' licenses annually, leaving lawyers vulnerable to politicized denials. Courts can also order a maximum of 15 days of judicial detention for those who disturb court order, and police can arrest lawyers for "falsifying evidence," a crime under article 306 of the Criminal Law, which has been brought against lawyers who encourage their clients to speak out about torture by criminal investigators. Lawyers are even at risk of being beaten, intimidated, and harassed in their work by police, court officials, and others operating at the behest of authorities."Chinese authorities treat the views and vital work of independent lawyers as anti-state activity," Richardson said. "Multilateral institutions and concerned governments, as well as international law firms present in China, need to find their voices and speak up against the authorities' systematic suppression of human rights lawyers."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6170077 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: February 16, 2018End of Document

PRESIDENTIAL MEMORANDUM ON THE ACTIONS BY THE UNITED STATES RELATED TO THE SECTION 301 INVESTIGATIONUS Fed NewsMarch 30, 2018 Friday 8:41 PM  ESTCopyright 2018 HT Media Ltd. All Rights ReservedLength: 964 wordsBodyBEIJING, China, March 30 -- The U.S. Embassy and Consulates in China issued the following news release:MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURYTHE UNITED STATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVETHE SENIOR ADVISOR FOR POLICYTHE ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT FOR ECONOMIC POLICYTHE ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT FOR NATIONAL SECURITY AFFAIRSTHE ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT FOR HOMELANDSECURITY AND COUNTERTERRORISMSUBJECT: Actions by the United States Related to the Section 301 Investigation of China's Laws, Policies, Practices, or Actions Related to Technology Transfer, Intellectual Property, and InnovationOn August 14, 2017, I directed the United States Trade Representative (Trade Representative) to determine whether to investigate China's laws, policies, practices, or actions that may be unreasonable or discriminatory and that may be harming American intellectual property rights, innovation, or technology development. On August 18, 2017, the Trade Representative initiated an investigation under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the "Act") (19 U.S.C. 2411).During its investigation, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) consulted with appropriate advisory committees and the interagency section 301 Committee. The Trade Representative also requested consultations with the Government of China, under section 303 of the Act (19 U.S.C. 2413). The USTR held a public hearing on October 10, 2017, and two rounds of public written comment periods. The USTR received approximately 70 written submissions from academics, think tanks, law firms, trade associations, and companies.The Trade Representative has advised me that the investigation supports the following findings:First, China uses foreign ownership restrictions, including joint venture requirements, equity limitations, and other investment restrictions, to require or pressure technology transfer from U.S. companies to Chinese entities. China also uses administrative review and licensing procedures to require or pressure technology transfer, which, inter alia, undermines the value of U.S. investments and technology and weakens the global competitiveness of U.S. firms.Second, China imposes substantial restrictions on, and intervenes in, U.S. firms' investments and activities, including through restrictions on technology licensing terms. These restrictions deprive U.S. technology owners of the ability to bargain and set market-based terms for technology transfer. As a result, U.S. companies seeking to license technologies must do so on terms that unfairly favor Chinese recipients.Third, China directs and facilitates the systematic investment in, and acquisition of, U.S. companies and assets by Chinese companies to obtain cutting-edge technologies and intellectual property and to generate large-scale technology transfer in industries deemed important by Chinese government industrial plans.Fourth, China conducts and supports unauthorized intrusions into, and theft from, the computer networks of U.S. companies. These actions provide the Chinese government with unauthorized access to intellectual property, trade secrets, or confidential business information, including technical data, negotiating positions, and sensitive and proprietary internal business communications, and they also support China's strategic development goals, including its science and technology advancement, military modernization, and economic development.It is hereby directed as follows:Section 1. Tariffs. (a) The Trade Representative should take all appropriate action under section 301 of the Act (19 U.S.C. 2411) to address the acts, policies, and practices of China that are unreasonable or discriminatory and that burden or restrict U.S. commerce. The Trade Representative shall consider whether such action should include increased tariffs on goods from China.(b) To advance the purposes of subsection (a) of this section, the Trade Representative shall publish a proposed list of products and any intended tariff increases within 15 days of the date of this memorandum. After a period of notice and comment in accordance with section 304(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 2414(b)), and after consultation with appropriate agencies and committees, the Trade Representative shall, as appropriate and consistent with law, publish a final list of products and tariff increases, if any, and implement any such tariffs.Sec. 2. WTO Dispute Settlement. (a) The Trade Representative shall, as appropriate and consistent with law, pursue dispute settlement in the World Trade Organization (WTO) to address China's discriminatory licensing practices. Where appropriate and consistent with law, the Trade Representative should pursue this action in cooperation with other WTO members to address China's unfair trade practices.(b) Within 60 days of the date of this memorandum, the Trade Representative shall report to me his progress under subsection (a) of this section.Sec. 3. Investment Restrictions. (a) The Secretary of the Treasury (Secretary), in consultation with other senior executive branch officials the Secretary deems appropriate, shall propose executive branch action, as appropriate and consistent with law, and using any available statutory authority, to address concerns about investment in the United States directed or facilitated by China in industries or technologies deemed important to the United States.(b) Within 60 days of the date of this memorandum, the Secretary shall report to me his progress under subsection (a) of this section.Sec. 4. Publication. The Trade Representative is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

House Armed Services Subcommittee Issues Testimony From Center for a New American SecurityTargeted News ServiceJanuary 9, 2018 Tuesday 9:30 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 3394 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe House Armed Services subcommittee issued the following testimony by Paul Scharre, senior fellow and director of the Technology and National Security Program at the Center for a New American Security, at a hearing entitled "China's Pursuit of Emerging and Exponential Technologies":"Chairwoman Stefanik, Ranking Member Langevin, and distinguished members, thank you for inviting me to testify today."We live in a time of dizzying technological change. The information revolution, which has now been underway for several decades, continues to unfold in surprising ways. The United States was a firstmover in information technology. By leveraging advances in the microprocessor revolution in the 1970s and 1980s, the United States led the world in the development of personal computers, the internet, the Global Positioning System (GPS), and other information-based technologies. Today, information technology has spread to nearly every corner of our lives. It has also spread around the world. While the United States is still the global leader in information technology, other nations are now also significant players. China, in particular, is a major and fast-growing player in information technology.1"As the world's third largest economy behind the United States and the European Union and as the most populous nation in the world, China has major structural advantages that make it a key competitor in information technology. China's population, in particular, is a key source of strength because it is a potential source of data on human behavior and genomics. Combined with a more lax cultural attitude towards data protection and personal privacy, this data can help fuel advances artificial intelligence and synthetic biology.2The Information Revolution"There are three broad trends underlying the information revolution: the datafication of our world, increasing networking and connectivity, and increasingly intelligent machines. These trends intersect and reinforce each other in powerful ways, and understanding these trends can help in understanding some of China's structural advantages."Datafication of our world: The modern information economy produces over 2.5 exabytes of data daily (an exabyte is one quintillion bytes, or 10^18 bytes).3 In the past few years the information revolution has generated more data than existed in the entire 5,000 years of recorded human history. This data comes in a variety of forms: mapping data showing patterns of human activity and the locations of people and things; human communications data showing people's networks and the content of their interactions; search, shopping, and entertainment data showing people's preferences and interests; and as gene sequencing becomes cheaper, the digitization of human genetic data. This trend in the datafication of our world is digitizing and quantifying the world around us: our lives, our bodies, and our likes and desires. Much of this data is unstructured and unlabeled, making it a sea of potential information, if one can sort and organize this data to yield useful insights."Networking and connectivity: The world is increasingly networked, making it possible to transmit and share this new ocean of digital data. In 2017, global internet users topped 3.8 billion people, more than half of the world's population. Nearly 5 billion people use cell phones - roughly twothirds of the world. Nearly 3 billion people are active social media users. And global connectivity continues to grow at a breakneck pace. Every day more than a million new people join social media.4 As more people come online, their data comes online as well. They, too, become digitized. People and companies are also sharing this data, sending it over networks that are growing in scale and bandwidth. The number of connected devices is growing even faster than internet users. An estimated 20 billion devices will be connected to this sprawling global network in 2018. Internet of Things (IoT) devices, which include smart meters, medical devices, home appliances, and industrial applications, are growing at the fastest rate and by 2021 are expected to account for over half of all connected devices.5 These devices create data and share it across a global network that will traffic over 150 exabytes of data per month in 2018. Global internet traffic is growing even faster than connectivity, at a rate of 24% per year. Broadband speeds are increasing to account for this data and are expected to roughly double over the next 5 years.6 It is not just the amount of connected people, devices, and data and that is increasing, but the volume and speed at which they are communicating."More intelligent machines: These trends have been made possible because of exponential growth in computer processing power, which enables ever-smaller and more powerful computers, tablets, smartphones, and devices. For the past fifty years, this trend has been encapsulated in a maxim known as Moore's Law, named for Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, which has observed that chip performance has doubled roughly every two years.7 The rate of advancement of CPU (central processing unit) performance has slowed in recent years. While still improving exponentially, it has been at a markedly slower pace as chips have approached the nanometer scale.8 At the same time, in the past few years there has been an explosion in deep learning, a powerful machine learning technique used to enable artificial intelligence (AI). This has yielded resulted in tremendous progress on long-standing AI problems such as object recognition and natural language processing. Deep learning draws on large amounts of parallel computer processing, made possible because of advances in graphics processing units (GPUs) driven by the gaming industry; as well as large amounts of data. In deep learning, deep neural networks train on millions of pieces of data to learn how to recognize objects, translate between languages, or perform many other cognitive tasks. Deep learning systems can even learn from unlabeled data, a process known as unsupervised learning.9 Thus, advances in increasingly powerful computer processors have enabled the production of myriad devices that collect vast quantities of data, which in turn have fueled learning machines that can process and make sense of this data."China's population is a major structural advantage in this information revolution, as it allows the pooling of large amounts of data. China already has 730 million internet users, a figure that will grow as the country becomes increasingly urbanized and connected. Chinese users also appear more comfortable sharing their data than Western counterparts, which companies can use to train more sophisticated algorithms to understand human behavior.10"China also combines a dynamic private sector with a government that plans and executes long-term strategies to increase China's competitiveness in key technology areas. China has used this in recent years to execute plans to leap forward on artificial intelligence, synthetic biology, and quantum computing, all key technologies tied to the information revolution.Artificial Intelligence"China is a global leader in artificial intelligence, second only to the United States. Baidu, Tencent, and Alibaba - all Chinese firms - are top-tier AI companies, and China also has a vibrant AI startup scene.11 Since 2014, China has surpassed the United States in the total number of publications and cited publications in deep learning, an important sub-field of AI.12 The United States still leads the world in AI patents, but China is growing at a faster rate.13 While the quantity of publications does not necessarily equate to quality, Chinese AI researchers perform well in international competitions.14 Chinese teams "dominated" the ImageNet visual image recognition competition for the past two years and a Chinese start-up won the Facial Recognition Prize Challenge hosted by the Intelligence Advanced Projects Agency (IARPA).15 Overall, Chinese AI researchers are not as experienced as U.S. counterparts, but they are improving.16 In the 2017 meeting of the Association of the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), there were roughly as many papers accepted from China as there were from the United States.17"In July 2017, China published a national strategy for artificial intelligence, the "New Generation AI Development Plan." 18 Under this plan, China's goal is to be the "premier global AI innovation center" by 2030.19 To achieve this goal, China's plan includes improving in areas where China is currently weak, such as human capital, by focusing on the education and recruitment of top AI talent. As one example, Chinese-born and American-educated AI researcher Qi Lu recently left an executive vice president role at Microsoft to become the Chief Operating Officer at Baidu.20 News reports indicate Chinese firms see the Trump Administration's anti-immigrant policies as an opportunity to draw away top U.S. technology talent, as immigrants are responsible for one-quarter of startups in the United States.21"China also has significant advantages in translating private sector advances in AI into national security applications because of its model of military-civil fusion.22 In the United States, the Department of Defense (DoD) has struggled to break down largely self-imposed barriers to working with non-traditional defense companies that lock the DoD out of crucial innovation in places like Silicon Valley. China has a closer relationship between the public and private sector and is able to more easily "spin in" private sector innovations into the military through their strategy of militarycivil fusion. This means that not only is China a significant global player in artificial intelligence - with a plan to be the global leader by 2030 - but that China has major advantages in translating these private-sector gains into national security applications.Synthetic Biology and Genomics"The information revolution has opened up new opportunities in biotechnology as computers have made genome sequencing increasingly affordable. The cost of sequencing the human genome has been falling exponentially at a rate faster than Moore's Law.23 In turn, the acquisition of large datasets of human genomes has significant research potential, as these datasets can be mined by data analytics and AI for correlations between genes and health outcomes. A Chinese company, Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI), is the world's largest genetic research center. BGI has a U.S.-based center headquartered in Cambridge and has sequenced the genomes of millions of Americans. BGI has robust support from the Chinese government and partnerships with Chinese military research institutes such as the Academy of Military Medical Sciences.24"At the national level, the Chinese government is proactively engaged in developing its biotech sector and has created multiple national-level biotechnology development plans. One of the strategies China uses to advance its biotechnology industry, as in other areas, is "going out" and "bringing in" foreign innovation by investing in foreign companies.25 For example, in 2013 BGI acquired nextgeneration genome sequencing technologies by purchasing the U.S. company Complete Genomics.26"The importance of genomics is likely to increase as the cost of gene sequencing continues to fall and larger datasets of human genomes are established, making possible large-scale analysis of human genes. Given that the ultimate aim is modifying life itself, it is nearly impossible to overstate the long-term potential of synthetic biology and genomics. As this field matures, China is wellpositioned to be a global leader.Quantum Computing"Quantum computing is another important area of information-related technologies and one in which China has shown striking recent advances. Quantum computing is an entirely different method of computing from current approaches and relies on the unusual properties of quantum physics. Quantum technology has many potential national security applications, including cryptography, remote sensing, and secure communications.27 Chinese researchers have made recent strides in quantum technology, demonstrating a 10-qubit quantum processor and a quantum communications satellite in 2017.28 China is following up on these advances with national-level investments in quantum technologies. China recently launched the Jinan Project, a plan to build a secure quantum computer network, and is building a $10 billion National Laboratory for Quantum Information Sciences.29Conclusion"As the world's third-largest economy and most populous nation, China has many inherent structural advantages in competing in high-technology areas. China has a dynamic private sector, with both large established firms and dynamic start-ups, and a large pool of potential talent to draw upon. In places where China has weaknesses, such as the quality of human capital in some fields, China is actively working to improve by recruiting top talent from abroad. China's population, increasingly networked and digitized, is a major source of potential data, which is a critical resource for 5 information-enabled innovation. One of China's biggest strengths relative to the United States, however, is the government's willingness to develop and follow through on large-scale long-tem investment plans in key technology areas. China has repeatedly demonstrated an ability, in multiple technology areas, to acquire foreign expertise by investing in foreign companies and then using that to improve Chinese indigenous capabilities. China's capacity for executing long-term strategies for technology development should not be underestimated, and Chinese plans to become the global leader in critical technology areas such as artificial intelligence should be taken seriously."* * *Footnotes:1 Chris Dong, "China ICT Market: Trends, Complexity, Potential," presentation, IDC Web Conference, July 6, 2017.2 "The Algorithm Kingdom: China May Match or Beat American in AI," The Economist, July 15, 2017, https://www.economist.com/news/business/21725018-its-deep-pool-data-may-let-it-lead-artificialintelligence- china-may-match-or-beat-america.

China's Tightening Grasp on Social Media Offers Potent Tool of Repression for President-for-Life Xi Jinping, PEN America Report WarnsTargeted News ServiceMarch 13, 2018 Tuesday 7:31 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 812 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK BodyPEN America issued the following news release:Offering a detailed analysis of digital rights today and a chilling preview of their future in China, PEN America announced the release of Forbidden Feeds: Government Controls on Social Media in China.From the leading US free expression organization, the 90+-page original research report demonstrates how the government's grip on social media constricts free expression in China, and how the scope and severity of censorship has expanded under President Xi Jinping. With an increasing array of technological, legal, and ideological tools at the government's disposal, Beijing is ever more able and willing to systematically erase expressions of dissent and calls for social change, silencing internet users who dare cross ever-shifting red lines, and shutting off channels of circumvention under the banner of "cyber sovereignty." The report takes a particular look into how these constraints burden writers and other creative professionals, as the government wields its power to ensure no one becomes so popular and nothing goes so viral on social media as to slip beyond the state's control."China has managed to offer its citizens a lively social media universe that is heavily policed and has successfully choked off social media's promise as a vehicle for free social, political, and creative expression," said PEN America Chief Executive Officer Suzanne Nossel. "Chinese authorities have managed to prove wrong the hopeful notion that the rise of a vibrant digital realm would inevitably herald greater ideological and political freedom. Despite the ceaseless and inventive efforts of Chinese netizens to evade government censors, the systematic erasure of sensitive subjects and dissenting views, and the targeting of those who express them ultimately leaves those who speak truth to power forced to self-censor and withdraw from conversation, if not leave the country entirely. Chinese social media companies have no choice but to play an active role in enabling this system of repression--something American social media companies weighing entry into the Chinese market should bear in mind, while the choice is still theirs."Based on extensive interviews with writers, poets, artists, activists, and others personally affected by the government's grip on online expression, as well as interviews with anonymous employees at Chinese social media companies, Forbidden Feeds lays bare the destructive impact of the Chinese government's vision of "cyber sovereignty" on netizens who dare to dissent. The report also includes an Appendix that documents 80 cases of Chinese citizens warned, threatened, detained, interrogated, fined, and even imprisoned for online posts over the past six years. The wide-ranging content of these posts, which touch on everything from Tiananmen Square to issues such as land rights and local corruption, demonstrates the ruthless enforcement of information control and the heightened risks facing those who dare test ever-evolving methods and powers of censorship.In Forbidden Feeds, PEN America argues that the Chinese government engages in political censorship under the guise of countering so-called "online rumors," promoting a definition of fake news driven more by political control than regard for the truth. Online censorship is also used to protect the reputations of powerful individuals, as well as to ensure no social media figures gain so great a following as to pose a threat. As Xi Jinping extends and consolidates his rule, China offers a chilling blueprint to other authoritarian governments aspiring to implement total information control. The report also notes, however, that China's foresight about the risks social media would pose to the party's hegemony has allowed them to construct a unique system of control that may prove alarmingly sustainable.As well as analyzing the impact of China's sophisticated surveillance and censorship mechanisms on Chinese social media companies and their users, Forbidden Feeds considers the trade-offs facing foreign social media and technology companies as they consider entry into the Chinese market.

Presidential Memorandum on the Actions by the United States Related to the Section 301 InvestigationTargeted News ServiceMarch 22, 2018 Thursday 6:05 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 896 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe White House issued the following memorandum:SUBJECT: Actions by the United States Related to the Section 301 Investigation of China's Laws, Policies, Practices, or Actions Related to Technology Transfer, Intellectual Property, and InnovationOn August 14, 2017, I directed the United States Trade Representative (Trade Representative) to determine whether to investigate China's laws, policies, practices, or actions that may be unreasonable or discriminatory and that may be harming American intellectual property rights, innovation, or technology development. On August 18, 2017, the Trade Representative initiated an investigation under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the "Act") (19 U.S.C. 2411).During its investigation, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) consulted with appropriate advisory committees and the interagency section 301 Committee. The Trade Representative also requested consultations with the Government of China, under section 303 of the Act (19 U.S.C. 2413). The USTR held a public hearing on October 10, 2017, and two rounds of public written comment periods. The USTR received approximately 70 written submissions from academics, think tanks, law firms, trade associations, and companies.The Trade Representative has advised me that the investigation supports the following findings:First, China uses foreign ownership restrictions, including joint venture requirements, equity limitations, and other investment restrictions, to require or pressure technology transfer from U.S. companies to Chinese entities. China also uses administrative review and licensing procedures to require or pressure technology transfer, which, inter alia, undermines the value of U.S. investments and technology and weakens the global competitiveness of U.S. firms.Second, China imposes substantial restrictions on, and intervenes in, U.S. firms' investments and activities, including through restrictions on technology licensing terms. These restrictions deprive U.S. technology owners of the ability to bargain and set market-based terms for technology transfer. As a result, U.S. companies seeking to license technologies must do so on terms that unfairly favor Chinese recipients.Third, China directs and facilitates the systematic investment in, and acquisition of, U.S. companies and assets by Chinese companies to obtain cutting-edge technologies and intellectual property and to generate large-scale technology transfer in industries deemed important by Chinese government industrial plans.Fourth, China conducts and supports unauthorized intrusions into, and theft from, the computer networks of U.S. companies. These actions provide the Chinese government with unauthorized access to intellectual property, trade secrets, or confidential business information, including technical data, negotiating positions, and sensitive and proprietary internal business communications, and they also support China's strategic development goals, including its science and technology advancement, military modernization, and economic development.It is hereby directed as follows:Section 1. Tariffs. (a) The Trade Representative should take all appropriate action under section 301 of the Act (19 U.S.C. 2411) to address the acts, policies, and practices of China that are unreasonable or discriminatory and that burden or restrict U.S. commerce. The Trade Representative shall consider whether such action should include increased tariffs on goods from China.(b) To advance the purposes of subsection (a) of this section, the Trade Representative shall publish a proposed list of products and any intended tariff increases within 15 days of the date of this memorandum. After a period of notice and comment in accordance with section 304(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 2414(b)), and after consultation with appropriate agencies and committees, the Trade Representative shall, as appropriate and consistent with law, publish a final list of products and tariff increases, if any, and implement any such tariffs.Sec. 2. WTO Dispute Settlement. (a) The Trade Representative shall, as appropriate and consistent with law, pursue dispute settlement in the World Trade Organization (WTO) to address China's discriminatory licensing practices. Where appropriate and consistent with law, the Trade Representative should pursue this action in cooperation with other WTO members to address China's unfair trade practices.(b) Within 60 days of the date of this memorandum, the Trade Representative shall report to me his progress under subsection (a) of this section.Sec. 3. Investment Restrictions. (a) The Secretary of the Treasury (Secretary), in consultation with other senior executive branch officials the Secretary deems appropriate, shall propose executive branch action, as appropriate and consistent with law, and using any available statutory authority, to address concerns about investment in the United States directed or facilitated by China in industries or technologies deemed important to the United States.(b) Within 60 days of the date of this memorandum, the Secretary shall report to me his progress under subsection (a) of this section.Sec. 4.

Mr. Wensheng warns that heavy-handed regulatory policies may squander the opportunity for China to maintain a significant presence in the burgeoning global cryptocurrency sector, in addition to arguing that many of the challenges faced by cryptocurrencies are indicative of the typical  development process  experienced by emerging monetary forms.Also Read: Cryptocurrency Exchange Poloniex Has Been Bought by CircleMeiti Founder Argues Mining Could Comprise Major Chinese Export IndustryCai Wensheng, the founder of Meitu, has expressed            criticisms of the Chinese government s prohibitive regulatory policies regarding cryptocurrency mining and initial coin offerings (ICOs).According to The Meitu founder, the majority of the world s bitcoin mines are located in China, with Mr. Wensheng estimating that  80%  of the world s bitcoins are produced by hardware housed in China. As such, Mr. Wensheng believes that a regulatory crackdown targeting bitcoin mining risks squandering the opportunity to maintain its dominance in the bitcoin markets, describing such a potential export industry.Mr. Wensheng argues that China should use bitcoin mining surplus power for productive purposes, stating that  China s surplus power [can be used] to produce surplus power to produce bitcoin, [which can be] sold to the South Koreans, Japanese, and Americans    making China  a bitcoin foreign exchange earner.  However, Mr. Wensheng also warns that if bitcoin miners are  forced overseas [to] Iceland, Chinese people will need to spend a lot on foreign exchanges to buy back bitcoin. Challenges Faced by New Monetary FormsThe Meitu Founder argues that many of the challenges and criticisms faced by bitcoin have been experienced by other emerging monetary forms throughout history, stating that  every coin is a kind of faith.  Mr. Wenshen asserts that many of the world s national currencies have gone through numerous periods of considerable volatility throughout history, claiming that political instability led to dramatic price fluctuations for many sovereign currencies prior to 1973. This is the case with the Golden Circle Certificates of the Republic of China, Mr. Wenshen stated, adding that instability is an inherent component of the requisite  development process  experienced by emerging monetary forms.Mr. Wensheng also predicted that cryptocurrencies will reshape the securities industry.Entrepreneur Warns Against Heavy-Handed ICO RegulationsMr. Wensheng has argued that initial coin offerings do away with many of the barriers preventing ordinary investors from being able to access exposure to emerging companies, adding that venture capital and investment firms typically access tokens at the same price as their retail counterparts in the ICO markets.Mr. Wensheng also compared the ICO markets to the dotcom bubble of the nineteen-nineties, stating that of the  hundreds of companies  that listed Initial Public Offerings (IPOs)  in 1999  very  few companies are left,  however,  One Amazon is enough    implying that heavy-handed restrictions on ICOs may result in China failing to facilitate the growth of potential major companies that could emerge through the disruptive ICO sector.Do you agree with Mr. Wensheng s opinions on the China s regulatory actions targeting cryptocurrencies?

China: Rights Crackdown Goes GlobalTargeted News ServiceJanuary 18, 2018 Thursday 7:35 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 775 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK BodyHuman Rights Watch issued the following news release:The Chinese government under the leadership of President Xi Jinping expanded its sustained offensive against human rights both at home and abroad in 2017, Human Rights Watch said today in its World Report 2018. The death of the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo in a hospital under heavy guard in July epitomized the authorities' deep contempt for people's rights. China used its increasing global influence to threaten the protection of rights internationally.Liu Xiaobo died from cancer in a Shenyang hospital, surrounded by state security, after serving nearly 9 years of his 11-year prison sentence for "inciting subversion." During his hospitalization, authorities isolated Liu and his wife, Liu Xia, from family and supporters, and denied Liu's request to seek treatment outside the country. Since Liu's death, authorities have forcibly disappeared Liu Xia."Chinese authorities are leaving no stone unturned in their cruel campaign against peaceful human rights activism," said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. "The near future for human rights in China appears grim as President Xi enters his second five-year term."In the 643-page World Report, its 28th edition, Human Rights Watch reviews human rights practices in more than 90 countries. In his introductory essay, Executive Director Kenneth Roth writes that political leaders willing to stand up for human rights principles showed that it is possible to limit authoritarian populist agendas. When combined with mobilized publics and effective multilateral actors, these leaders demonstrated that the rise of anti-rights governments is not inevitable.Beijing subjected more human rights defenders - including foreign nationals - to show trials in 2017. Police tortured detainees to obtain confessions, denied them access to lawyers of their choice, and held them incommunicado for months. Lawyer Wang Quanzhang and activist Wu Gan, who were rounded up in the nationwide crackdown that began in July 2015, remained in police custody. Taiwanese democracy activist Lee Ming-che was sentenced to five years in prison, and lawyer Jiang Tianyong received two years, both for "subverting state power."The Chinese government also intensified its assault on the freedom of expression, Human Rights Watch said. Authorities banned unauthorized circumvention tools that allow internet users to bypass government censorship. A Guangdong man was sentenced to nine months in prison for selling virtual private networks, or VPNs. The tech giant Apple said it had removed 674 VPNs from its App store in China during 2017, citing a need to comply with government regulations. Authorities also pressured foreign academic publishers - including Cambridge University Press and Springer Nature - to pull access to articles in China. After an international outcry, Cambridge restored the 300 articles it had withdrawn.Hong Kong marked the 20th anniversary of its return to Chinese sovereignty. The growing interference of the central Chinese government is increasingly undermining civil liberties in the city. Three student leaders were sentenced to six to eight months in prison for peaceful protest against China's government during the 2014 Umbrella Movement.Repression deepened in ethnic minority regions of Xinjiang and Tibet. In Xinjiang, the government increasingly restricted and punished ethnic Uyghurs' foreign ties by arbitrarily recalling passports and forcing those studying abroad to return. It has also arbitrarily detained thousands in political education facilities and ramped-up surveillance measures. In Tibet, authorities carried out the mass demolition of some parts of monasteries, expelling monks and nuns and forcing them into re-education programs.China increasingly used its growing global influence to undermine human rights protections abroad, Human Rights Watch said. At the United Nations, China worked consistently to silence criticism of its human rights record and took actions to weaken central UN human rights mechanisms. In June, the European Union failed for the first time to deliver a statement on China under a standing agenda item at the UN Human Rights Council, because Greece, a council member, was unwilling to criticize human rights violations in China, with which it has substantial trade ties."As China plays an increasingly assertive role in world affairs, governments need to push back on President Xi's abuses at home and abroad," Richardson said. "Defending embattled Chinese human rights defenders and activists is critical."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6133913 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: January 19, 2018End of Document

APPLE'S MOVE TO SHIFT ICLOUD DATA TO CHINESE FIRM SPARKS WARNINGSStates News ServiceFebruary 7, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 758 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:International press freedom groups have warned journalists living behind China's Great Firewall that their data, and that of their sources, may be compromised if they don't move it to a different jurisdiction by the end of this month.Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said journalists and bloggers who use Apple iCloud China should change their geographic region or close their accounts before Feb. 28, when control of their data will pass to a Chinese state-run company.Control of Apple's iCloud storage service in China will be transferred to Guizhou-Cloud Big Data (GCBD), a company linked to the government of the southern province of Guizhou, to comply with local regulations, RSF said in a statement on its website."RSF alerts journalists and bloggers using iCloud China to the danger that this migration poses to their security and the security of their sources, and urges them to migrate their account to another geographic region or to close it by Feb. 28," it said.It said most of the personal data of Apple app users, including contacts, photos, files, email, Internet connection history, geolocation data, and passwords, are stored on iCloud, and will all come under the control of a government-backed Chinese company."Apple promises that it will never give governments a backdoor to content, but there is no way of being sure about this," Cedric Alviani, who heads RSF's East Asia bureau, said."Knowing the Chinese government's determination and the extent of the means of pressure at its disposal, it will end up getting its way sooner or later, if it hasn't already," Alviani warned.It said Apple's lawyers have added a clause to the user agreement that says: "Apple and GCBD have the right to access (...) all user data (including content)."Politically sensitive contentBruce Lui, senior journalism lecturer at Hong Kong's Baptist University, said such data could easily be used, once transferred, to incriminate rights activists and dissidents who store politically sensitive content on iCloud."For example, content that mentions the Chinese leadership, or that is linked to [activists'] investigations at a local level, for example data on pollution or AIDS," Lui said. "All of these are highly sensitive topics.""Local governments will also be able to access this information to suppress [activists and dissidents]," he said, adding that he agrees with RSF's advice."If you have a choice, it would be safest to use a cloud storage service outside China," Lui said. "I have some friends who work in multinational companies, and any sensitive material belonging to the company is always stored in an overseas cloud service."RSF also hit out at Apple's readiness to accommodate the ruling Chinese Communist Party's requirements for operating in mainland China."As Google and Facebook keep trying to get Beijing to lift the ban on their operations in China, the precedent set by Apple is likely to encourage the government to seek more concessions from them, increasing the danger to those who defend reporting freedom and to their contacts and families," it said.Microsoft, IBM, and Amazon also store data in China, but in much smaller quantities, RSF said, adding that China currently ranks 176th out of 180 countries on its 2017 World Press Freedom Index.Duty to protectSerenade Woo of the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) said journalists also have a duty to protect their sources."If they allow this stuff to be stored inside China, they have actually no way of knowing who will be able to read all of their content," Woo said. "From a journalist's point of view, there is a clear conflict with their professional ethics and integrity.""And from the interviewee, or source's, point of view, it could cause all kinds of unforeseen problems," she said.The warnings come as Chinese state media reported on Tuesday that Apple will build a second data center in the northern region of Inner Mongolia, to add to one already planned for the southwestern city of Guizhou.The data center is slated to start operation in 2020 and offer iCloud services on the Chinese mainland, authorities in Inner Mongolia's Ulanqab city announced.The project will use 100 percent renewable energy sources, state news agency Xinhua reported. Ulanqab is already home to a data center belonging to Chinese technology giant Huawei, it said.Reported by Gao Feng for RFA's Mandarin Service, and by Ma Lap-hak and Fok Leung-kiu for the Cantonese Service.

VIDEO: KEY MOMENTS FROM CECC HEARING "THE LONG ARM OF CHINA: EXPORTING AUTHORITARIANISM WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS"States News ServiceJanuary 6, 2018 SaturdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1389 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, D.C. BodyThe following information was released by the Congressional-Executive Commission on China:U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) and U.S. Representative Chris Smith (R-NJ), the chair and cochair respectively of the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), held a hearing on December 13, 2017 to look at the scope of the Chinese government's foreign influence operations.Witnesses included Shanthi Kalathil, the Director of the International Forum for Democratic Studies at the National Endowment for Democracy; Glenn Tiffert, a Visiting Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University; and Sophie Richardson, the China Director for Human Rights Watch.Partial transcripts and links to videos of some of the hearing's key moments are below. Witness testimonies and the opening statements of Senator Rubio and Congressman Smith can be found on the CECC's website. The archived hearing webcast can be viewed at the CECC's YouTube page.VIDEO: Senator Rubio Says Chinese Government Wants to Roll Back Human FreedomsWhat see here, on behalf of the government and the Communist Party, is an effort to roll back the advances towards human freedom that have been made over the last hundred years, particularly since the end of the second world war. That's also important to communicate because sometimes when we talk about China it means, in the minds of some, that we are talking about the Chinese [people]and we are not. We are fully cognizant that in a nation that large, with that many people, there are hundreds of millions of people who aspire to a different way forward, but simply do not have the way to advocate for it, or are punished for advocating for itsometimes even with their livesand so that's always important to leave clear on the record.VIDEO: Glenn Tiffert Responds to Representative Smith's Question About China's World Internet Conference and Confucius InstitutesThe United States is accustomed to dealing with or engaging with the world from a position of the strength, not just comprehensive economic and military strength, but also a deep confidence of the enduring appeal of our values around the world. And that, particularly since the fall of the Berlin Wall, has produced a certain amount of complacencywe thought game overI don't think China ended the game and I believe that we are now playing different games and the United States needs to get its game back on. Our confidence about our strengths, our powerour soft power not just our hard powerhas produced the language of "responsible stake holding," "convergence"they will become more like us if we open our institutions to them and show them how fabulous we are. China is the first country this century to challenge that from a position of comprehensive strength. They are large, they are increasingly rich, and increasingly militarily powerful, so we need to dig deep. Our way of dealing with a lot of these issues is too harden our own institutions, some of which are developing cracksacademia, the media, other institutions. China is exploiting those cracks and it is doing it in ways that frankly are brilliant. Our best response to these exploitations is to strengthen ourselves, to raise consciousness, to get our game back on and to reinvest in ourselves... It is a question of valuesSenator King raised this earlier. To the extent that we regard our engagements with them as purely transactional and disengage values from itthen Tim Cook (Apple CEO) can talk optimistically about a day when China may suddenly open up without having to confront the problem of the China of today.VIDEO: Senator King Describes China Influence Operations as 'Geopolitical Jujitsu'What is going on here is what I call "geopolitical jujitsu" where you are using your opponent's strengths as their weaknesses. Our strength is our openness, our free society, our first amendment, and protected expression and that is being used by our adversaries to undermine our system. It is kind of an ironic turn using our own values against us and that is concerning to me because any country in the world could look at what the Russians did here in 2016 and say, "Wow that worked, it was pretty cheap, and here is another avenue for influence."VIDEO: Shanthi Kalathil on the Exporting of China's CensorshipThis combination of aspects results in a system that curtails freedom, suppresses dissent, and manages public opinion reliant not on any individual elements put on a principle of redundancy built into every layer. Why is this domestic approach relevant to our topic today? It is becoming evident that the CCP under Xi Jinping is intent on encompassing the rest of the world within its "walled garden." This isn't to say that China seeks to control every facet of communication or that it wants to impose its exact model of authoritarian government everywhere, but it is increasingly true that Beijing's technology ambitions, combined with its attempts to determine, on a global scale, the parameters of acceptable speech and opinion with respect to China, pose clear threats to freedom of expression and democratic discourse outside its borders. So how does the Chinese government apply to gardening techniques internationally? While it cannot control the infrastructure and technology of the global Internet, Chinese companies are actively building out key telecommunications and communications infrastructure in developing countries, raising questions about security and dissemination of censorship capabilities. And, if China succeeds in dominating the emerging global market for data-enabled objects, also known as "the Internet of Things" its approach to embedded surveillance may become the norm in places with weak individual privacy protections.VIDEO: Sophie Richardson on China's Efforts to Undermine UN Human Rights MechanismsEven as it engages with UN institutions, China has worked consistently, and often aggressively, to silence criticism of its human rights record before UN bodies and has taken actions aimed at weakening some of the central mechanisms available there which in turn poses a longer term challenge to the integrity of the UN human rights system as a whole. In a September 2017 report, we detailed how Chinese officials have harassed activists, primarily those from China, by photographing and filming them on UN premises, in violation of UN rules, and by restricting their travel to Geneva. Members of this Commission need no reminder about the case of Cao Shunli. China has also used its membership on the UN's Economic and Social Council's NGO committee to block NGOs critical of China from being granted UN accreditation and it has sought to blacklist accredited activists. Behind the scenes, Chinese diplomats, in violation of UN rules, contacted UN staff and experts on treaty bodies and special procedures including behavior that has amounted to harassment and intimidation. China has also repeatedly sought to block or weaken UN resolutions on civil society, human rights defenders, and peaceful protests including when they do not directly concern policy and practice in China. It has pushed back against efforts to strengthen some of the key mechanisms, notably country-specific resolutions on grave situations like North Korea and Syria and efforts to strengthen treaty body reviews. During UN peacekeeping budget consultations earlier this year, China sought to slash funding for the UN human rights officers who play a vital role in monitoring alleged human rights abuses in some of the world's most dangerous places...VIDEO: Glenn Tiffert Responds to Senator Rubio's Question About the Scope of Chinese Influence OperationsWhat distinguishes the Chinese efforts to wield influence in the United States is that they are spending a great deal more money to do thatthey have commercial advantages and so they are able, through, for example, Confucius institutes, to promote a particular view of China and to close out discussion of certain topics on campus. They are able to donate money to a particular causemuch of this is legal activity but they can simply wield influence because they can write checks. That is something that we did not face as a country during the Cold War with the Soviet Union as their pockets were not as deep. China is not necessarily appealing to hearts and minds, it is appealing to wallets.Load-Date: January 7, 2018End of Document

Beijing has a new propaganda weapon: Voice of ChinaCNN WireMarch 21, 2018 Wednesday 12:56 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 501 wordsByline: By Steven JiangDateline: BEIJING (CNNMoney) BodyBEIJING (CNNMoney) --  China is creating a new giant broadcaster to ensure its voice is heard loud and clear around the world.Voice of China, as the new outlet will be known internationally, will be formed by combining three mammoth state-run national networks: China Central Television (CCTV), China National Radio and China Radio International. It will employ more than 14,000 people.The merger was revealed in a Communist Party document on a sprawling government reorganization program, championed by President Xi Jinping to reinforce the party's absolute control in all aspects of state governance.State news agency Xinhua released the document Wednesday after it was approved by China's rubber-stamp parliament.With echos of the Voice of America radio service created by the US government during World War II, Voice of China is tasked with "propagating the party's theories, directions, principles and policies" as well as "telling good China stories," according to the document.It will be under the direct control of the party's central propaganda department.The new broadcast juggernaut is being formed at a time when Chinese authorities face growing challenges to control their message in the age of the internet and social media. They are making strenuous efforts to maintain strict censorship at home while pouring money into propaganda projects abroad.Now the most powerful Chinese leader in decades, Xi has cracked down hard on freedom of expression since taking office in late 2012. He has also taken a tough line on the role of news media in the party's "ideological work."In the past decade, Beijing has spent billions of dollars on a global campaign of "soft power" aimed at enhancing its international image and spreading its views.CCTV has launched large operations in Washington and Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, with non-Chinese journalists fronting news reports, while China Radio International broadcasts in 65 languages -- more than any other station in the world.The Chinese government has also set up cultural centers -- such as Confucius Institutes to promote the Chinese language -- across the world, and increasingly provides grants to foreign think tanks in an attempt to shape public opinion. Some of the Chinese efforts overseas have triggered backlashes in host countries, with politicians from countries including Australia and the United States accusing Beijing of political meddling through its foreign operations.Still, even before the creation of Voice of China, some Chinese state media outlets had spotted a growing opportunity for Beijing's propaganda on the global stage. "It takes more time to completely eliminate the asymmetry of information dissemination between China and the West, but this has obviously become a tendency," the Global Times tabloid wrote in an editorial last week. "The increasingly mediocre Western media also reflect the West's declining advantages over China."TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

House Financial Services Subcommittee Issues Testimony From Commission on Theft of American Intellectual PropertyTargeted News ServiceJanuary 9, 2018 Tuesday 7:41 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2051 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe House Financial Services subcommittee on Monetary Policy and Trade issued the following testimony by Dennis C. Blair, co-chair of the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property, at a hearing entitled "Evaluating CFIUS: Challenges Posed by a Changing Global Economy":"Chairman Barr, Ranking Member Moore, and members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify on this important matter."My recommendations in the testimony are based on my work as co-chair of the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property (IP Commission), and on my observations of the behavior of this country's economic and security competitors since the end of the Cold War. While this hearing is primarily concerned with how the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) process might usefully be reformed, I encourage members and committee staff to review the findings of both the original IP Commission report and the 2017 update for additional details on the scale and scope of the IP theft problem. We have brought copies of those reports today.II. CFIUS Reform"The bill to reform CFIUS currently under consideration by this committee is welcome. In the ten years since CFIUS was last updated, there have been many developments. We have learned a great deal about how other countries and their companies are able to take advantage of the American economy while working actively against American interests in other areas."The Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA) is a welcome and necessary update to the current CFIUS statute. It recognizes that majority ownership of a U.S. company is not the only way that foreign countries gain access to cutting edge U.S. technology with potential military applications. It widens the categories of "covered transactions" to include deals short of full ownership that would enable the loss of militarily relevant technology of a U.S. company. One of its most important features is the updating and expanding of the specific factors that CFIUS may consider when analyzing a transaction's national security implications. For example, it adds the following as a specific factor: "Whether the transaction involves a country of special concern that has a demonstrated or declared the strategic goal of acquiring a type of critical technology that a U.S. business that is a party to the transaction possesses.""Chinese investors are now involved in up to 10% of all American venture deals, and especially in startups in areas such as AI, autonomous vehicles, augmented/virtual reality, robotics, and blockchain technology, all important to American military effectiveness in the future. The CFIUS process needs to cover these transactions and these areas to ensure that we preserve the American edge."Beyond the important considerations of preserving our advantage in military technology, I recommend that the CFIUS process be expanded to punish foreign companies for actions that have already damaged our economic and national security. By punishing past damaging behavior, we can prevent future harm by those companies and deter damaging behavior by other companies. I would add to the CFIUS process the following principle: If a foreign company has stolen American intellectual property, or has taken actions against American security policies or interests, it should not be allowed to invest in this country - it should not be allowed to purchase ownership of American companies."This principle would widen the current military security focus of the CFIUS process. Over the decades CFIUS has addressed many different risks of foreign investment in this country, from petrodollar investment from countries in the Middle East to Japanese investment in American companies and real estate in the 1980s. These investments did not pose immediate military risks to the United States, but they had the potential to pose economic risks. In the long term, our national security depends on our economic vibrancy and growth. CFIUS should be the means by which the United States controls foreign investment that causes risks to the country, whether they are financial, commercial or military.III. Foreign Investment Risks"Foreign companies, predominately Chinese companies, with the encouragement of official Chinese policy and often the active participation of government personnel, have been pillaging the intellectual property of American companies. This is a significantly new environment from the one that existed when CFIUS was last reformed ten years ago. In an updated report last year by the IP Commission, which Ambassador Jon Huntsman and I originally co-chaired, and which I now co-chair with Craig Barrett, we found that all together, IP theft costs the United States up to $600 billion a year, which is more than the total U.S. trade deficit with Asia. China accounts for most of that loss."Deficiencies in China's IP rights regime have gone uncorrected, with cyber theft and forced data transfers being particularly harmful. China singles out high-tech sectors in its five-year plans, increasing pressure on Chinese firms to procure the technologies necessary to reach or surpass global competitors, in some cases using Chinese government-controlled entities to illegally acquire the intellectual property. Affected sectors include electronics, telecommunications, robotics, data services, pharmaceuticals, mobile phone services, satellite communications and imagery, and business application software."The United States urgently needs a comprehensive program to deal with this hemorrhage of its competitive advantage, and our Commission report lists the many elements of such a program. However, at a minimum, Chinese and other foreign companies that have stolen American intellectual property should not be allowed to invest in this country. We need to face these companies with a choice - either follow American intellectual property rights law or do no business in the United States. The CFIUS process should be a part of imposing this choice."Chinese companies like Sinovel, one of the world's largest producers of wind turbines, should be stopped from investing in U.S. companies, based on Sionovel's theft of intellectual property from American Superconductor (AMSC). Chinese companies that manufacture solar panels like Trina Solar and JA Solar, two of the top builders and installers of solar panels in the world, with subsidiaries in the United States, and both of which have used IP stolen from the American company SolarWorld, should not be allowed to invest in this country. Companies like the huge Jiangsu Shinri Machinery Company, which stole intellectual property from its joint venture partner Fellowes, should not be allowed to invest in the United States."There are many ways beyond IP theft that foreign companies, sometimes acting on their own, sometimes compelled or induced by their own governments, have harmed American security interests. They have undercut American sanctions against authoritarian regimes that oppress their own people, supported terrorist groups or contributed to the development of nuclear weapons. Most of these foreign companies do not invest in the United States where they would be subject to CFIUS review, and there are other ways under American law of dealing with them, especially denial of their access to the American banking system. However, it is not clear to me, for example, whether we have kept a list of the Dutch, German and French companies that supplied the AQ Kahn-led Pakistani nuclear development program, and whether we use that information in the CFIUS process. I would guess not. We should develop a list of companies like this, their current structures, related parent and partner companies, and ensure they are not able to invest here."Major international companies that have harmed American security interests have been able to purchase American companies. For example, the primary Chinese company that built up seven features in the South China Sea into potential military bases is a subsidiary of the China Communications Construction Company, known by its initials CCCC. In August 2010, another subsidiary of CCCC purchased an American company that is the world's leading designer of offshore drilling rigs, the Houston-based company Friede Goldman United, or F&G. We should face CCCC, one of the top international construction companies in the world, with a choice: either cooperate with the Chinese government against American interests or invest in the United States. You can't have it both ways."To give another Chinese example. It was China Oilfield Services Limited (COSL), a subsidiary of the Chinese energy giant China National Offshore Oil Corporation, or CNOOC, that deployed drilling rig HD 981 into disputed waters in the South China Sea in May 2014 and provoked a confrontation with Vietnam. CNOOC is no stranger to the CFIUS process, having been denied permission to purchase UNOCAL in 2005. CNOOC should not be allowed to purchase American companies or raise funds in the United States so long as it serves as a partner with the Chinese government in aggressive actions against American interests.IV. CFIUS Capacity"Those in the U.S. government who work every day on CFIUS reviews in my observation are knowledgeable, dedicated, and effective. However even under the current statute, they are straining to meet the tight deadlines of a CFIUS application review with in-depth research. If the Congress expands the CFIUS standard in the direction I recommend, it will take more government officials to do the work. It will take additional staff with different skills. Lawyers and part-time military analysts currently do most of the work within the government to staff CFIUS decisions. We need to add officials with business backgrounds, especially in finance and M&A. We need to take advantage of private, independent business analysts who follow specific industries in microscopic details. We need to exchange information with organizations in Europe and Japan that have unique insights into their foreign competitors. We need to build up fresh databases tracking the activities of foreign companies so that we can quickly identify those that have engaged in harmful activity in the past. Those databases need to include the very complicated ownership structures of foreign companies, in many cases specifically designed to hide subsidiaries that are harming American interests. If we are serious about this national security threat, we would establish an organization like the National Counterterrorism Center, or NCTC, with a combination of full-time staff and personnel detailed from other government departments and agencies - a true center of expertise on the activities and structure of foreign companies taking actions and posing risks hostile to American interests.V. Summary of Recommendations"Let me summarize the three major areas in which I believe the CFIUS legislation can be strengthened:1. Approve the provisions of FIRRMA to update the CFIUS statute to deal with the new threats to our military technology from foreign investments.2. Broaden the criteria for review to include whether acquiring companies have damaged or threatened U.S. national security or the national security of U.S. treaty allies through the illegal acquisition of American intellectual property, or other activities against American security polices and interests.3. Review acquisitions that have been previously approved when new evidence comes to light of damaging actions by the foreign companies.4. Increase staffing to support CFIUS decisions, and expand the exchange of information with the private sector and with our allies.VI. Conclusion"The scale and scope of the theft of American intellectual property and of other actions by foreign companies against our interests demand robust policy responses that fundamentally change the cost-benefit calculus of foreign companies. Reforming the CFIUS process to include an IP protections evaluation--both before and after acquisition of American firms--and then staffing the CFIUS interagency team with sufficient resources to conduct this more thorough review are important next steps. I look forward to your questions."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6125709 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: January 11, 2018End of Document

All those stories coming up right and joining me to talk all about it Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, The King's College Business and Economics professor Brian Brenberg, and the Cadena Group's President Gary B. Smith. Great to see everybody.GARY B. SMITH, CADENA GROUP PRESIDENT: Good morning.BRIAN BRENBERG, BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS PROFESSOR, THE KING'S COLLEGE: Good morning.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR: Good morning.BARTIROMO: Big reversal of fortunate in markets.SMITH: You know, let me point out something, yes. It may be it's just me, Maria. When we came on at 6:00 A.M., I said I was optimistic.(CROSSTALK)SMITH: Now, look what's happened. I -- maybe it's -- one of us has to be right, Dagen, I'm sorry.MCDOWELL: I said it's kind of a show yesterday. I said look out below. That's what I said.(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: That was my final thought. I think that there's a lot that you do have an administration that is fomenting uncertainty when it doesn't need to and I'm not talking about getting tough on China but it's the way that you're doing it. It's fomenting uncertainty through these steel and aluminum tariffs.(CROSSTALK)SMITH: Isn't Trump a -- I -- it does a lot of things right. It does a lot of things wrong, but he is affecting change though. Don't you think that's good?MCDOWELL: And he's affecting a down decline in the stock market --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: And we're still up 30 percent from the election --MCDOWELL: But one just really quickly though, President Trump used the stock market as a barometer for his success repeatedly on Twitter over and over and over and over again. I'm curious what he thinks.BARTIROMO: Well, obviously these markets are talking. They do not like this trade situation. You mentioned early they don't like the $1.3 trillion spending bill, either.BRENBERG: But they want to get over it quickly. I mean look at what happened this morning. They want to get over this news quickly and they've done it time and time again and it looks likes that might be the case today as well.BARTIROMO: This is a buying opportunity?SMITH: I think it is. I think -- I think with Trump it's always a fire first, ask questions later. He always puts the biggest move. He moves his queen first and then later on all his rooks and stuff and then you really see what happens. Not as bad as people think.MCDOWELL: And John Dowd, one of the president's personal attorneys leaving yesterday. I think that adds -- that that's something that hard to quantify during this.BRENBERG: I agree with you.(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: Uncertainty about his legal situation, the Special Counsel Robert Mueller investigation. I think that it's -- that it's on the margin that adds more uncertainty.BARTIROMO: The markets don't like uncertainty but again this market has come all the way back. We are expecting perhaps a higher opening for the broader averages this morning. We'll see. We'll begin right to the top story right now, the trade war fears hitting global markets. Stocks across Asia tumbling following the direction of Wall Street yesterday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down more than 700 points after President Trump proposed tariffs of up to $60 billion on imports from China along with tighter restrictions on the country's acquisitions and technology transfers. It's all in response to what the administration is calling China's unfair trading practices.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We're doing things for this country that should have been done for many, many years. We've had this abuse by many other countries and groups of countries that were put together in order to take advantage of the United States and we don't want that to happen. We're not going to let that happen. It's probably one of the reasons I was elected, maybe one of the main reasons. (END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, hours later the Chinese government fired back saying that it plans to roll out retaliatory tariffs of up to $3 billion on U.S. goods in response to the tariffs on steel and aluminum. Those tariffs go into effect today. The U.S. now says that some allies including Canada, Mexico, the E.U. among others will get a brief exemption from those tariffs. Joining us right now to talk more about that is the author of The Coming Collapse of China, Gordon Chang. Gordon, very good to have you on the program this morning. Thanks very much for time. China is already retaliating I guess. What's your take on all of this?GORDON CHANG, AMERICAN COLUMNIST: Well, it was a very small retaliation, you know, it's $3 billion, 128 products. And we got to remember, you know, the Chinese Ambassador to the U.S. says look, well, look, you know, if we're going to have this tit-for-tat action, let's see who lasts longer. Well, I know who lasts longer, that's the United States because we're the trade deficit country. China needs us much more than we need them, you know last year, 88.8 percent of their overall merchandise trade surplus related to sales to us, you know, we hold all the high cards in a trade war.BARTIROMO: So they need us more than we need them? We're talking about $375 billion deficit, are they going to threaten that surplus that they have by ramping this up or do you see this $3 billion in tariffs as a sort of soft move? Not -- you're talking about $60 billion in U.S., $3 billion in China, how should we read that?CHANG: Yes. And I actually think that what we're seeing right now is the Chinese are trying to say, look, we will hurt you but we're not going to hurt too much because we don't want you to really get angry, you know, I think that President Trump has a lot of political will and that's really what's important in a situation like this because, you know, fundamentally, we, you know, a lot of people criticize the president about what he's done on tariffs steel, aluminum, and now the 301. But the point is we've got a trade outlaw at the center of the system of global commerce.That's China. We have tried to entice the Chinese into accepting norms and rules in International Congress. They won't do that and as a matter of fact they're getting worst. They're becoming more predatory, more about as a matter of fact getting worse more predatory, more mercantilist. They're closing their economy. Somebody has got to do something because if they don't, this trading system that we've had since the end of World War II is just not going to survive.BARTIROMO: Yes. I just want to point out markets here because we had been down earlier in the program, Gordon, by 200 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. When we were first navigating through this news from China and these retaliatory moves, the market has completely reversed course. Now, we're looking at a gain at the start of trading of 57 points on the Dow Industrials and 7 points higher on the S&P 500, do you think this is a negotiating move by this president? I mean he's also putting restrictions on what China can acquire and how much. But by the way, that's what China does right? I mean American companies can't go to China and own more than 49 percent of anything and, by the way, they can't even own directly a company that have to do with through and J.V., joint venture.CHANG: Yes. And that J.V. point is crucial, Maria, because that is at the heart of that $60 billion in loss of U.S. intellectual property, you know, we look at the numbers annually. They're staggering. They're somewhere between $225 to $600 billion annual loss of U.S. intellectual property. Most of that is related to China and this is something that comes from the bipartisan Blair and Huntsman's commission in their 2017 update to their 2013 report.So, you know, this last -- losses here are staggering and people who don't like what the president is doing have got to come up with a better way, you know, it's fine to say, look, we should align our interests with China. We should have consultations, but we've been doing that in the trade area intensively since the end of the 1990s and it hasn't worked.BARTIROMO: The president -- I am told that the president wants to cut the deficit, the trade deficit down by $50 billion with China. I'm told -- right now it's 375 billion. I 'm told he wants to get it down to 325 or even 300 billion, will he be successful before we turn on another subject here Gordon?CHANG: Yes. I think that we will overtime largely because we hold those high cards, you know, I think people in the United States have gotten really tired of just talking to the Chinese and now want to impose cost and that's absolutely the right way of dealing with this situation.BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, there's more turnover at the White House, markets of course reacted yesterday when president announced he's replacing National Security Advisory H. R. McMaster with former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton. He will be the third person to fill that role, Gordon, that appointment both and potentially, what could that mean for American foreign policy as it relates to Asia in your view?CHANG: I think U.S. foreign policy will become much more resolute because Ambassador Bolton understands that the primary problem that the world has in Asia and, of course, the U.S. as well is China and Bolton has views about China which I think aligned very closely with President Trump's. That's going to be good because the problem that H. R. McMaster had was that on certain critical issues, he just didn't see the world in the same way that the president did and every president deserves a National Security Advisory who shares his views.BARTIROMO: Yes. What's your take in terms of coming up a potential meeting with the leader of North Korea, Gordon? Do you think this happens in May?CHANG: I don't know if it happens in May. But it certainly happens and the reason is that Kim Jong-understand, the leader of North Korea needs sanctions relief and I actually think President Trump made instinctively the right decision. In 45 minutes, he came up with the right decision to meet with Kim and the reason is that Kim Jong-un in addition to the sanctions relief wants to drive a wedge between Seoul and Washington because Moon Jae-in, the south Korean President wanted this Trump-Kim summit. It's going to happen and that was the right thing because if we stay strong with South Korea, we'll always get acceptable outcomes and maybe even good ones.BARTIROMO: So I guess China is watching as well of who the president puts into which role. You say John Bolton will be more resolute, what does that mean in terms of how the U.S. changes strategy in Asia?CHANG: Well, I think that what we're going to see is a much more confrontational posture with regard to the Chinese because China is trying to close off international -- the global comments trying to grab territory from its neighbors challenging the U.S. across the board even attacking out system of government. I don't think John Bolton will put up with that.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean and a lot of these things have been known for a long time, right? I mean everybody gets it when you say, yes, China steals all of our stuff or they're stealing our intellectual property. Businesses have been taking this for decades.CHANG: Yes. I mean individual businesses can't stand up to Beijing. I mean we shouldn't expect them to but we should expect the President of the United States to protect American workers, American businesses and unfortunately, you know, we've had this view of, oh, let's just talk to the Chinese. Let's try to get them to see their better interests.Well, yes, they should see their better interests but they don't and so, you now, you now have a president in President Trump who look and says, look, we've got to try something different. It might not work but if we do the old things, we know we're going to fail. So I think that we should all be applauding what President Trump is doing in this regard trying something new.BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. We'll be watching that. Gordon, it's great to hear from you. Thanks so much.CHANG: Thanks, Maria.BARTIROMO: Gordon Chang on China there. Coming up, Congress averts a shutdown funding the government through September. But what's in that $1.3 trillion spending bill. Anyway, we're going to take a look. Then the end of Toys "R" Us as we knew it. Details on the retailers liquidation sell right here. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We have more information right now that the hostage situation in Southern France, Lauren Simonetti with the headlines, Lauren.LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT: A developing story, Maria, a person reportedly pledging allegiance to ISIS is holding a lone police officer hostage at a supermarket in Southern France. That's according to the Trebes' mayor. "The Associated Press" is reporting that one person has been shot dead by the suspect, another person seriously wounded, all hostages except the police officer have been freed. Police have the supermarket surrounded.They're treating this as a terrorist situation and official with the police union says the suspect fired at police officers about 15 minutes away from the supermarket scene hitting one of them in the shoulder before they ended up at the supermarket. That officer's injury is not life-threatening but as you know, France has seen a number of terrorist attacks in recent years and counselor to the president President Trump, Kellyanne Conway told Fox News this morning that the White House is monitoring the situation.A tragic night in New York as a firefighter is killed battling a five alarm blaze in Harlem. Flames broke out last night on a movie set in the basement of a close club. Firefighter Michael Davidson's engine company was the first to arrive. They rush to the basement but officials say once they got down there, the fire became too much forcing them to retreat out of the building. Davidson somehow got separated from his group when the firefighters did find him. He was unconscious and could not be revived. He's 37-year-old and he leaves behind his wife and four young children. Well, on Capitol Hill, shutdown averted. The Senate approving a $1.3 trillion budget deal.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The yeas are 65. The nays are 32. The motion to concur is agreed to.(END VIDEO CLIP)SIMONETTI: Four Republicans voted against the legislation led by Senator Rand Paul as expected who said earlier, "There's just too little time to read the bill. It is more than 2,200 pages long." The legislation will lift military spending by $80 billion this year and domestic programs by 63 billion. It also includes a $ 1.6 billion funding for the border wall that the president wants. Now, this bill goes to President Trump's desk for his signature.It's a sad day in Toyland, liquidation sales at bankrupt Toys "R" Us. They begin today. Customers were expecting the discounts yesterday but the company says, it saw some unforeseen circumstances, so they push them back. If you want a good deal, you got to act fast because they don't have too much inventory especially on the new stuff. And on a sad note, the founder of Toys "R" Us Charles Lazarus, he died yesterday. He was 94 years old. Maria.BARTIROMO: Yes, an incredible legacy of his. We want to bring you this breaking news, Lauren, as you were speaking. We put it on the screen and that is Fast Company Magazine is reporting that Target and Kroger are in discussions for a merger. We don't have any more information than that but look at the stock prices right here, Gary, Target is up two and two-thirds percent, Kroger up six and almost seven percent here. Obviously, the retail sector is incredibly bifurcated in an Amazon world.BRENBERG: Absolutely. And, you know, you talked about amazon, I was going to bring up players a good time now. There was a headline in "The Washington Post" grocery super -- grocery wars because Amazon is coming in there a lot us like Winn-Dixie stores are closing, Amazon's impact across the retail sector is exciting right now.BARTIROMO: Target and Kroger merge --MCDOWELL: Yes. And this is also specific to Target struggling in grocery because Target has failed to really keep up with Wal-Mart as Wal-Mart has moved deeper and deeper into grocery, and it has become a criticality important part of Wal-Mart's business. This is a way for Target to really step up its game.SMITH: I was surprised because, you know, Kroger in my experienced in the supermarket industry, they were one smart cookie. I mean they fought off people like FoodLine and a number of others. I mean if they can -- if they can go, anyone can.BARTIROMO: A lot changed after Amazon acquired Whole Foods. Let's not forget that.BRENBERG: And Amazon is bringing Whole Foods prices down big time. It's causing some turmoil at Whole Foods but that's the problem for Kroger and Target. Whole Foods is becoming viable for your average middle class buyers.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Right. And look what it's doing? The issue now talking about a merger. According to Fast Company, they try to get that official coming up. We will take a break. Stay with is.BARTIROMO: Well, global markets are selling off this morning. Asian and European markets following the U.S. sharply lower over night as worries over China tariffs weigh on investors. We are about an hour away from the opening of trading this morning and we had seen a complete reversal of fortune in Futures this morning, Dow Industrials earlier had been down almost 200 points. We're at a gain now at the opening of trading, 13 points on the Dow, and a gain of three points on the S&P 500. Joining us right now is Morgan Creek Capital Management CEO and CIO Mark Yusko. And Mark, you've been hedged for about a year now.MARK YUSKO, CEO AND CIO, MORGAN CREEK CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: Yes. I mean we started getting hedged at the end of last summer.BARTIROMO: But you were expecting this market to trade down?YUSKO: Yes. I mean you never expect it to trade like yesterday. Yesterday was a pretty tough sell-off, but we looked at the beginning of the year pretty skeptically a big move last year, you know, up 20 plus percent and the end of January was a big turn in momentum really. We're kind of made a top that last day of January and there's been a top that we call -- we talked about as distribution. People buy early in the morning and then the big money comes in and sells in the afternoon. That's been happening most days over the last six weeks.BARTIROMO: But why? Why are you negative on this market?YUSKO: Well, a couple of things. So one, valuations are very high but they've been very high and they got higher last year and say, well, why can't they keep going up? High valuations have to have higher earnings and earnings growth I think have peaked. I think we had the big euphoria around the tax bill and I think what's happening now is companies are realizing, wait a minute, I still have to compete and there's a lot of deflationary forces like technology, the aging demographics. They're putting pressure on earns.BRENBERG: It's interesting. So you -- we've been talking about trade all morning and how that's affecting markets, you know, yesterday the big sell- off, now, today it's coming back. I think that's because markets look at what -- how China responded and said, this is not as big of a response as we were thinking we're going to have and the U.S. tariffs don't go into effect for 45 days. That's a lot of time to cut a deal. There's a lot of negotiating going on here but it's not going to be the trade war we thought, are you in agreement with that?YUSKO: Look, wars have no winners, so I'm hoping that you're exactly right. I'm hoping this is all just, you know, bluster and that there really isn't the desire to go through. Look, I've been tweeting a lot about, you know, two words, Smoot-Hawley, right? Trade wars are bad. Tariffs are horrible idea. They never work. So why do we think they're going to work this time? And I just think that China thinks differently than everybody else. They think in decades. They plan long term and what -- it's interesting to me about all of this is it used to be about made in China.Everything was made in China, export every place else. The next two decades saw about made for China. Their consumer market is going to be the biggest consumer market on the planet. Our companies need to sell stuff. In fact, my guess is that when the president went to Boeing I guess last week or something, they had a few choice words about the idea of, hey, we need China to buy our airplanes.BARTIROMO: Right. Sure.YUSKO: So --SMITH: I want to get back to -- I want to get back to your market outlook. You said, right, you've been hedged for a while now expecting the market to go down. That's fine and that's been accurate. When do you become unhedged? What are you looking for as a downside and some clear sailing?YUSKO: Yes. So there are a couple of things. It's really important point. So in terms of just short term stuff, I actually look at this thing called The World's Greatest Indicator and it's basically the number of stocks in the S&P 100 that are above their 200 day moving average. When that false below 65, it's 60 today, that's just the time to get kind of half hedged. If it falls below 50 where it was heading yesterday afternoon, then you get fully hedged. Now, when that comes back up and goes back up the other way through 65, then you can start reentering. That's one way in terms of a short term indicator. But for the long term, what we find is that markets tend to lead the economy.SMITH: OK.YUSKO: So the markets getting weak here are starting to make noise. They're not like tomorrow but there could be a recession. Recessions tend to have meaningful market corrections related to, so we're going to stay hedged for a while. If, you know, economic growth started to pick up, here, look, I think in January, the Atlanta fed was saying, we're going to have 5.4 percent GDP growth. Now, they're saying 1.8.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: But that was just wrong.MCDOWELL: But they were changing that estimate --(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: Any time a data point --(CROSSTALK)YUSKO: And to me, it's just -- look, we've been in sub two percent growth for seven years and I don't think we're going to get higher than that. But people forget it's not necessarily percentage --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: -- couple of times.YUSKO: Yes. But the average -(CROSSTALK)YUSKO: But the whole year is only 2.3 and the thing is it's not about the number, right? Because it's the law of those numbers. We're in a huge number. It's hard to grow huge economy at a huge percent, so we should be looking more at the economic growth it has created. So, look, as long as that that stops going down, that's when I would get more bullish.BARTIROMO: Well, earning is still going to be up eighteen and a half percent, right?YUSKO: That's what they say.BARTIROMO: Ok. So you're questioning --YUSKO: Every year in January, earnings estimates are really high. By the end of the year --MCDOWELL: They've been -- they've been at 18 plus percent.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: It's going to be 16 percent for the first quarter.YUSKO: I'll come back in December and if they hit 18, I'll buy you dinner.BARTIROMO: You got to come back before December.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: You still own Bitcoin?YUSKO: I do. I love Bitcoin. I love Blockchain. I think Blockchain technology is going to change the world as we know it and my plan over the next couple decades is tokenize the world.BARTIROMO: Tokenized the world? All right. Well, you sound like Jack Dorsey. Good to see you.YUSKO: All right. Thanks. Well, it's high praise.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. Mark Yusko there. We have this breaking news from the president. The president is tweeting this right now. "DACA was abandoned by the Democrats, very unfair to them. Would have been tied to desperately needed wall." DACA legislation is not happening, I guess, right now. All right. We will take a break. When we come back Deloitte CEO, Cathy Engelbert, is with us.

Plus, Sister Jean in Loyola Chicago living on its prayer and some great play on the court. We have the very latest from the sweet 16 where Michigan dominated once again.First though, our top story this half an hour. A shake-up at the White House also weighing on markets yesterday. President Trump announced he is replacing National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster with former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton. Adam Shapiro covering the story, live right now a the White House with the very latest. Adam, good morning to you.ADAM SHAPIRO, FBN REPORTER: Good morning, Maria, and Mr. Bolton will begin his duties on April 9th. Let me read you the tweet the President sent to the nation last night. He said, "I am pleased to announce that effective April 9th, Ambassador John Bolton will be my new national security adviser. I am very thankful for the service of General H.R. McMaster who has done outstanding job and will always remain my friend. There will be an official contact handover on April 9th."Now, Ambassador Bolton was on the Fox Business Network yesterday as well as the Fox News Channel, and he is very much in line with the president who during the campaign to become president promised that he would either hold Iran to the deal that have been struck during the Obama administration, or tear it up. And Mr. Bolton is in favor. He's written in the past about regime change in Iran, and here is what he said last night about the President's agenda with the Iran nuclear deal.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN BOLTON, INCOMING NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: I think that the rest of the bureaucracy needs to understand as well when the guy who got elected makes a decision, that's what the constitution provides.(END VIDEO CLIP)SHAPIRO: And it is no surprise to anybody that Ambassador Bolton is hawkish when it comes to Iran. Here is what Hogan Gidley, one of the press people here at the White House had to say.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HOGAN GIDLEY, WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY: Bolton is more hawkish than the President. The President relishes and people around him don't agree because he likes to bring the best minds together, have the conversation, but at the end of the day, it's the president who sets the policy and the president who makes the decision.(END VIDEO CLIP)SHAPIRO: But on Capitol Hill, there is reaction. Senator Chris Coons had this to say, "In the midst of international challenges from North Korea and Iran to China and Russia, I'm concerned that President Trump has chosen to abruptly dismiss the well-regarded H.R. McMaster and hire his third National Security Adviser in just 15 months." The senator from Delaware, Chris Coons. Then, of course, there were the other issues about shake-up here. Mr. Tillerson yesterday leaving the State Department, telling people that this is a Mean Spirited City, Washington, D.C., imagine. Then there of course was the President who meeting with millennials kind of joked when asked what advice would you give to your 25-year-old self. The president said, don't run for president. Back to you.BARTIROMO: Yes, he did. Adam, thank you. Adam Shapiro at the White House. The corporate tax code overhaul has been a big windfall for American business and a big win for the President, certainly. But the tariff plan has thrown CEOs and investors for a loop a bit, rocky markets. Although, things are in positive territory this morning. Futures indicating a gain of about 50 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, complete reversal to earlier where the low was down 262 down on the Dow earlier. Joining us right now to talk markets and trade is the CEO of Deloitte, Cathy Engelbert. Cathy, it's good to see you.CATHY ENGELBERT, CEO, DELOITTE: Great to see you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much for joining us. What do you see when you speak with corporate executives today in terms of these policies out of Washington?ENGELBERT: Well, number one, they're all looking for sustained economic growth, and tax reform, regulatory reform helps them, infrastructure will probably help a little bit. And you saw wage increases, one-time bonuses, investments in facilities. So, are they looking for a little more certainty and stability? Absolutely. But obviously, trade is complicating things for them. I think, you know, we have 36 million of our jobs here in America are very important export driven. Trade is 27 percent of our GDP, so a little stability around this topic would really help.BARTIROMO: Right. Sure. Well, Gary B., I haven't been able to find one person to say, yes, this trade tension is probably going to take a cut from economic growth expectations. I'm just -- people are not going there, even though there's all of this worry.SMITH: I mean, look, I think any kind of trade tariffs are going to be bad. I mean, it's a tax. I mean, as simple as that. It's going to cut into the economy, but I think what we've seen and maybe you've seen this, too, Cathy. We talked about this before, Trump puts his big chess piece forward initially and then kind of ramps down. Do you think this is all going to be watered-down, you know, in the long run?ENGELBERT: I think in any trade agreement, negotiation is key. I think one of the important things will be is as we look at American companies' fair access to 95 percent of the consumers White House are outside the U.S. So, this is a chess game but it also is a big balance on negotiating.SMITH: A question from your perspective as CEO of Deloitte. For your company, is all this change and uncertainty good for you, or would you rather have a more stable -- I know how it impacts business, because they can't plan. I'm curious for -- is it good or bad for your business?ENGELBERT: I think company confidence is very important for our business, that companies are confident, they're all transforming. There's so much technology emerging. That's why the intellectual property argument is so important to get right because every company is becoming a technology company, digital transformation. So, all of that is good, but that's all happening not standing policy.BRENBERG: Cathy, you've talked about the importance of sustained economic growth, but we're now seeing this $1.3-trillion spending bill, which is not good for sustained long economic -- I mean, it's -- this is long-term deficits, debt, red ink, very bad news for the long term. How does that affect how companies feel today? I mean, is that too far in the future, or do you see that having an impact on how companies are thinking about investment and where they're going to invest.ENGELBERT: I think companies worry macro about the debt and the deficits, but as they're looking at the execution of their strategy over the next three to five years, they have to invest heavily and that's why tax and regulatory reform is helping them with confidence to do that. That capital sitting on the sidelines deployed -- the repatriation of foreign earnings deployed. So, they're -- macro, they're worried about debt and deficits, but kind of as they look at execution of their strategy, they kind of like what they see around confidence and the ability to bring back those earnings, invest them in U.S. businesses, U.S. workers, U.S. facilities.MCDOWELL: In terms of policy, what do they want to see next? Excluding trade potential tariffs, what comes out of the White House, but something that Congress can do? Because Brian asked about spending, but what I'll --ENGELBERT: Well, number one is infrastructure, which as we know is a bipartisan issue but obviously very challenging on where do you find the money. Again, get -- back to Brian's point about --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: There were some infrastructure money in that spending plan, right, Dagen?MCDOWELL: -- a few billion in that -- in the omnibus spending bill.ENGELBERT: Right. And, obviously, comprehensive immigration reform as we look at the future of jobs and the future of work, very important to get immigration reform skills, funding into education, the business roundtable is doing some interesting things around workforce development and education. So, really, as we see shifts in the American worker, very important to look at that as well.BARTIROMO: And then there is the phase two of the tax reform plan that we're expecting. The President says that he wants to make the individual cuts permanent. Here's what he told a group of millennials yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: The millennials starting out tremendous. You have a tremendous advantage over what you had, you're going to pay less taxes, you have far more incentive, you're going to have a lot more money left in your paycheck to spend. We were at about 1.2 percent GDP. We've now hit 3, and another 3, and a 3.2, and we'll see what this next quarter is, that could be a good quarter."(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Phase two reportedly will include individual cuts being permanent. What companies are looking for in terms of the tax side of this story? Did they get what they needed in that last tax plan to actually hire more people?ENGELBERT: So, I think they got what they needed. There was -- not everybody is happy. So, there was some negotiation obviously here in New York City with the SALT, you know, deduction, et cetera. But I would say that the one question that CEOs are asking yesterday is how long term is this? Will there be a reversal of this kind of policy in 2020 or 2024, or however you look out the 10 years and make them permanent? So, they are looking at the future because they're doing long-term plans right now and that's where their uncertainty lies.BARTIROMO: Hey, what about this New York City councilman, Bill, that they want to make it illegal for companies to require employees to answer work e-mails or calls after hours. I don't know how I would do with that. I'm always e-mailing.(LAUGHTER)ENGELBERT: I'm fascinated with that because what are work hours, right?BARTIROMO: Yes, what are work hours?ENGELBERT: And we're promoting flexibility and predictability in our 62 percent millennial workforce. And so, work hours are not 9:00 to 5:00 or 8:00 to 6:00 or 8:00 to 7:00. We actually pride ourselves on our people work at different times that are flexible for them and how they're -- whether they have family issues and things like that, so I wouldn't even know how you implement that.MCDOWELL: The lefties always float this idea. It comes up every now and then.BARTIROMO: Hey, we're not 9:00 to 5:00, people.MCDOWELL: Thank God.BARTIROMO: Thank you. Cathy, good to see you.ENGELBERT: Great to see you. Thanks.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Cathy Engelbert. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Complete reversal in stocks. We're looking for a higher opening this morning. Meanwhile, there's Nike, the stock is up on one of the handful of Dow components gaining ground before the bell after topping analysts' expectations with third-quarter earnings. Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, watching markets. Nic, good morning to you.NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria. Friday morning, we've had a turnaround in Futures. Nike was the one name that we saw after the bell yesterday. We did after the bell, we saw it to the upside, continues that trend, it's looking up about 4.3 percent. In fact, North America was not a bright spot. They said that will be going forward. It was the international markets that helped Nike in China and Europe. Those were some of the areas that actually saw strength in sales on the rise. They have a lot of competition here in the States with Adidas, but the stock, a Dow component is likely to be to the upside today. This year, it's about three percent and it will be up this morning as well. They have direct selling. They're using Amazon and selling direct to consumer and that's been helping them.Let's take a look because I mentioned Amazon, this is a whole another concept. You know, Amazon has worked on so many businesses and patents, one of which is the drone-type patent. And this one delivers packages but it will have sensors and cameras to see you waving or shooing it off or calling to your drone that will be delivering your package. I'm not sure how they're going to handle this one, Maria. What if someone is freaking out, waving their arms wildly. The drone won't know what to do. We'll see whether or not it comes to fruition. Back to you.BARTIROMO: Wow! The world is changing. Nicole, thank you. Nicole Petallides.Meanwhile, a retail deal could be in the works, Kroger and Target reportedly discussing a merger. Joining me now, the host of VARNEY & COMPANY Stuart Varney to weigh in. Another sign of the Amazon economy. Stu, good morning to you.STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST: Good morning, Maria. Yes, I think it is a sign of the Amazon effect. But I think this is really all about the delivery battle, the battle to deliver groceries and other items same day. We also have the development today apart from Target maybe getting together with Kroger, there's another development here, where Whole Foods is looking for much bigger stores with a warehouse attached.What Amazon wants to do here is, yes, deliver groceries from Whole Foods, same day, and from the warehouse next door, other Amazon products, next day. I see all of these as a development where we're moving towards same- day delivery not of groceries but of all kinds of things. That's where we're going, and this Target-Kroger deal may be a deal. I think that's part of it.BARTIROMO: Yes. And you have to do that with same day because you're talking about fresh items, groceries.VARNEY: Yes. You know, I've recently discovered Amazon Prime.BARTIROMO: Good move?VARNEY: Yes, I mean, it's 2018. I just got hold of this thing. I don't have an account of my own. I have somebody do it for me, but nonetheless, it's fantastic.BARTIROMO: It's good.VARNEY: It is absolutely fantastic. You want a bar of soap, it's there next morning. Unbelievable stuff.BARTIROMO: Yes, it is unbelievable, Stuart, you're right. All right. Stu, I know --MCDOWELL: Now, I order --BARTIROMO: Dagen has a comment here.MCDOWELL: I ordered some succulents the other day, plants, Stuart, from Amazon Prime, and it -- they were all dead. It was awful. I'll never order --BARTIROMO: What?MCDOWELL: I'll never order plants from them again. But again, my bad that I'm ordering live living things rather than --BARTIROMO: But that's what -- we're talking about with groceries that same day, got to be fresh.VARNEY: Yes. Succulents don't do same-day deliver or next-day delivery. Is that the message here, Dagen? Watch out for your succulents.MCDOWELL: Yes.BARTIROMO: Exactly.VARNEY: I've been there. I've been there.MCDOWELL: You say it so beautifully.BARTIROMO: Stuart, I know you'll have a lot more. We'll see you in 10 minutes.VARNEY: Sure thing.BARTIROMO: "VARNEY & COMPANY" begins top of the hour right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Join Stuart in 10 minutes' time.First, though, a seal of approval for Mr. Rogers. A sneak peek of the new stamp honoring the Kids T.V host. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Police say two people are now dead in that hostage situation we are following in France. Lauren Simonetti with the details now. Lauren?SIMONETTI: OK, Maria. There are about two -- one dozen people wounded. A person who is reportedly pledging allegiance to ISIS is holding a police officer hostage at a supermarket in Southern France according to the mayor of that town, Trebes. Police have the area surrounded. They're talking to the hostage taker, all hostages except that police officer have reportedly been freed. Police say the suspect fired at police officers about 15 minutes away from the scene, hitting one in a shoulder before they ended up at the supermarket. That officer's injury is nonlife-threatening.French television reporting that the attacker asked for the release of a terrorist that took part in the November 2015 attack in Paris that left 130 people dead. That happened at many venues, the concert hall being one of them. He is the sole survivor in the organized attack. President Trump hasn't briefed on this matter and he will continue to be updated.Well, the House Judiciary Committee slapping the Justice Department with a subpoena for documents related to the Clinton e-mail investigation. Chairman Bob Goodlatte saying he had no choice since they have only received a fraction of the roughly 1.2 million documents they requested months ago. Goodlatte spoke about this with you, Maria, on "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES."(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA), HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: We need to have those documents, the department and the bureau have been slow. I would say, now, very slow in getting them to us. The last time I was on your program, I expressed confidence that we would have those documents forthcoming. Here, we are several weeks later, still don't have them. So this is coming to a head.(END VIDEO CLIP)SIMONETTI: So the Department of Justice has two weeks to comply with that subpoena.And the U.S. Postal Service's new forever stamp is honoring Mr. Rogers. It goes on sale today. It shows Rogers in his famous red cardigan along with one of the puppets in the shows "Neighborhood of Make-Believe." The stamp is part of the celebrations that mark the 50th anniversary of the start of Mr. Rogers' "Neighborhood."(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FRED ROGERS, AMERICAN TELEVISION SHOW HOST: Would you be mine? Could you be mine? Won't you be my neighbor?(END VIDEO CLIP)SIMONETTI: His show ran for 33 years from 1968 to 2001 and Fred Rogers died back in 2003 at the age of 74.BARTIROMO: Oh, that takes me back, Lauren.SIMONETTI: I know.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Yes, it does.All right. We got to get this breaking news. President Trump is tweeting about the spending bill. Look at this, "I am considering a veto of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the democrats not even mentioned in the bill and border wall, which is desperately needed for our National Defense. It is not fully funded." We are looking at this, we we're talking about this earlier, and that's what Congressman DeSantis said right in this interview. That he wanted the President to veto this.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Now, we named three other reasons why it ought to be vetoed as well beyond what the President is saying here. So this is a very interesting development. Could be an exciting weekend if he decides to do this.BARTIROMO: Yes, Congress is on their way out for two-week vacation. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Great show, everybody. Thanks for being here.(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can't wait to come back.BARTIROMO: Happy Friday, everybody. Here's VARNEY & COMPANY, and Stuart, take it away.Load-Date: March 23, 2018End of Document

THE DEAFENING SILENCE ON CHINA'S HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSESStates News ServiceFebruary 2, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 898 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:Sophie RichardsonChina Director SophieHRWWhere is China headed in 2018? President Xi Jinping promised "world peace" for the new year - but his 2017 track record suggests otherwise. Remember the singular stain of the July death of 2010 Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo, surrounded by state security? Many condemned China's conduct, but such interventions are fewer and further between these days. Increasingly, abusive Chinese authorities are garnering international support for their principles and policies.In a single December week, the Chinese Communist Party hosted an international political forum in Beijing attended by representatives of political parties from democracies including New Zealand and the United States, seemingly unbothered that their hosts run an authoritarian, one-party state.China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the State Council Information Office held an international symposium in Beijing on human rights - attended by United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, a UN body that, unlike two dozen other UN agencies, is systematically denied the ability to operate in China.And China held another global information technology summit on connectivity - attended by Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, who in the US argues hard for privacy rights but in China lauds Beijing's plans for a "common future in cyberspace" despite rampant censorship and electronic surveillance.The term "normalising" is in heavy use these days, typically to mean the implicit or explicit acceptance of problematic behaviour. In diplomacy, it means two countries establishing formal diplomatic relations.But it's now also a perverse hybrid in contemporary international politics: individuals and institutions from parts of the world where human rights are generally protected aren't just cosying up to, but also increasingly publicly praising, their Chinese counterparts - while failing to defend the principles and institutions that underpin their very existence. In doing so, they enable a whitewash of an abusive regime, one with global aspirations to change and set the rules of modern political life.While it's true that many people across different realms - academia, business, politics - have, over the years, pushed the Chinese government to adopt international human rights standards and end its persecution of peaceful critics, few now stand against Beijing's intransigence. Many now choose to engage on Beijing's terms, even when doing so is perverse and even harmful to their interests. Will Apple still thrive if China's vision of state control of all sources of information and the use of artificial intelligence to monitor all citizens' behaviour becomes a reality?Those who participate in these kinds of gatherings invariably insist that it's better they engage than not: after all, the logic goes, who else will set out different or higher standards on everything from democratic governance to corporate social responsibility?But, increasingly, they simply don't bother to set out or defend those standards. Did any of the political party conference attendees publicly dissociate themselves from their hosts' closing statements praising President Xi's leadership, or offer up publicly available remarks reflecting concern about the lack of elections or multiple political parties in China? No. Did anyone at the human rights conference make a public statement, while in China, about the death penalty, or torture by police? No.While Chinese authorities host these substantively through-the-looking-glass gatherings and proclaim international support for their vision, increasingly they exploit openness elsewhere to do the same, often through state organisations like the United Front Work Department. Australian politicians have been discovered receiving political donations from Chinese businesses.The Chinese authorities have been limiting access of human rights groups to the country. Police from Cambodia to France have capitulated to pressure from Chinese law enforcement or Party "discipline" officers and handed over allegedly corrupt fugitives without any semblance of due process. Universities struggle with ferocious complaints from Chinese diplomats about whether the institutions may describe Taiwan as an independent country, or have the Dalai Lama as a commencement speaker.The question for democracies or businesses isn't whether to engage: it is how to engage in a principled manner. This means treating China like many governments treat US President Donald Trump when he makes outrageous statements or adopts retrograde policies. Democratic leaders condemn Trump's remarks about "fake news" - but don't condemn China for its censorship or propaganda. They criticise Trump for his hostility towards the UN, but have nothing to say on China's efforts to weaken the institution.It is time for new standards to reverse these highly abnormal relationships with China. Forty years into China's "reform era", Beijing has made clear it's not moving on democracy, a free press, or an independent legal system, though courageous people continue to push for these at considerable personal risk. If powerful outside voices mindlessly engage, they not only stab these brave people in the back - they may also find themselves obliged to dance to the tune of a highly repressive government.Load-Date: February 3, 2018End of Document

Trump's Measured Response to China's Economic Aggression Is NeededTargeted News ServiceMarch 26, 2018 Monday 7:06 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 888 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: SOUTHWICK, Massachusetts BodyThe Coalition for a Prosperous America issued the following news release:On March 9, 2000, President Bill Clinton urged China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) with the following words.Op-ed originally appears on LifeZette March 24, 2018 (https://www.lifezette.com/polizette/trumps-measured-response-to-chinas-economic-aggression-is-needed/)."For the first time, our companies will be able to sell and distribute products in China made by workers here in America without being forced to relocate manufacturing to China, sell through the Chinese government, or transfer valuable technology ... We'll be able to export products without exporting jobs."Eighteen years later, we know he was wrong.Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama engaged in years of economic dialogue with China to resolve issues of trade cheating, government subsidies, and currency manipulation. Multilateral negotiations were undertaken to reduce overcapacity in steel. None of it worked.Chinese firms have repeatedly hacked America's leading companies and stolen proprietary technology to build their economy. U.S. firms are not allowed to sell in China unless they manufacture there. American companies are also required to transfer key technology at coercively low prices -- all in exchange for short-term market access. Then, local competitors drive American companies out of the market.According to indictments and other court documents, Chinese companies have stolen proprietary U.S. technology for products including nuclear power generators, solar cells, internet software, and internet hardware. It's estimated that 20 percent of the wind turbines in China today rely on technology stolen from a U.S. company.Rather than trade fairly with U.S. suppliers, China has favored its own companies, racking up a $375 billion trade surplus with the United States and setting a new world record bilateral trade imbalance. This is economic aggression.Trump rightly named China a "strategic competitor" in his National Security Strategy. The U.S. Trade Representative stated that China's entry into the WTO was a mistake. The administration's National Defense Strategy called out Beijing's use of predatory economics to coerce neighboring nations.Trump attempted bilateral economic talks with China through the Mar-a-Lago process. But President Xi and his representatives merely recycled offers they had already pledged to the Obama administration but did not fulfill.Beijing has committed the largest theft in world history through its systematic technology transfer strategy. In fact, over $350 billion is lost each year due to forced technology transfer. Beijing's "China 2025" plan mandates that government-owned companies upgrade in 10 priority sectors deemed industries of the future. A substantial portion of the technology underpinning this plan was forcibly taken from U.S. firms. No foreign competitors are allowed.China has also shamelessly hacked key American technologies. U.S. Steel, for example, was forced to engage in costly litigation after Chinese firms stole high-tech steelmaking processes. American Superconductor Corp. was the victim of theft by Sinovel, which used tactics worthy of a spy novel.In one case involving Westinghouse, Alcoa, and SolarWorld, Chinese agents infiltrated the companies using such code names as "UglyGorilla" and "KandyGoo."Significantly, the United States still maintains the world's wealthiest consumer market. And this gives the president leverage needed to take action in three key areas.First, Trump must levy tariffs on products that benefit from China's industrial policy. Those who claim "protectionism" forget that tariffs are a longstanding method to enforce global trade rules against subsidies and dumping.Second, Beijing has perfected the art of "weaponized investment." Awash in surplus trade dollars, China's government-supported companies have systematically acquired U.S. firms and technology, including high-tech producers of semiconductors and other advanced systems. The U.S. must limit China's purchase of critical American technologies that currently provide a strategic advantage.Third, the U.S. is right to use the WTO to stop Beijing's imposition of coercive licensing requirements on US companies. Many firms are required to sign licensing agreements with Chinese companies at low prices as a condition of selling there. But this is a devil's bargain since it merely yields short-term market access while surrendering long-term technological viability.Trump's action on tariffs, investment, and WTO cases is the first step. China is likely to respond. But we have the advantage because America's consumer market is the fuel for China's growth.The president must evolve his response to limit undue retaliatory harm. Resolve, not hand-wringing, is in order over a period of years.A comprehensive tariff strategy must be combined with both a new-Hamiltonian industrial strategy and a policy to manage the dollar's exchange rate, making American goods more competitive both at home and overseas. Farmers and ranchers must be protected when they face commodity prices that do not pay their bills.The president is right to act now against predatory economic strategies if we are to preserve an economy for our children.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6221988 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: March 27, 2018End of Document

Digitizing dairy in ChinaMcKinsey & CompanyMarch 22, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 McKinsey & Company, Inc All Rights ReservedLength: 1606 wordsByline: McKinsey QuarterlyHighlight: The CEO of China's second-largest dairy company describes how data and artificial intelligence are shaking up how he does business.Body Link to Image Twenty kilometers outside of central Beijing sits the sprawling headquarters of China Mengniu Dairy, China's second-largest dairy company. It might not boast the same glossy exterior as China's colossal technology companies' campuses, and CEO Jeffrey, Minfang Lu admits that the dairy industry suffers from a less-than-innovative image, but behind modest doors lies a rapidly modernizing business. Armed with more data than its people can currently compute, Mengniu Dairy is embarking on an effort to bring the centuries-old industry up to date through the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in China and beyond. As it does, the company hopes to innovate across everything from manufacturing and supply chains to product development and marketing. As with everything in China, the scale of the ambition is huge. Each year, the company sells 12 billion packets of product, chiefly milk and yogurt products, which are produced across 58 manufacturing sites and more than 1,000 manufacturing lines in China. In addition to the impressive scale of production, the company has access to 20 million "active" consumers who share information about their product preferences and lifestyle habits through e-commerce and social channels. Mengniu Dairy's product-development, forecasting, manufacturing, and marketing teams interpret these data, albeit not fast enough. By tapping into consumer trends that extend beyond the immediate product, Mengniu Dairy hopes to make milk and yogurt more appealing among a younger, savvier Chinese consumer. A recent, and notable, example saw milk products featured in a kung fu film alongside Alibaba CEO Jack Ma and kung fu star Jet Li. China is in the midst of a transition from a country of people who do not drink much milk and have perceptions of lactose intolerance to one where consumption catches up with the research showing that 80 percent of Chinese people can drink 200 milliliters of milk at a meal without adverse reaction. Plans are afoot to expand Mengniu Dairy's physical footprint, too, beyond China's borders and into Southeast Asia to capitalize on the government's Belt and Road Initiative.SidebarJeffrey, Minfang Lu biography In December 2017, Mr. Lu sat down with McKinsey Quarterly to share more about the company's digital-transformation plan and how he hopes technology can help its leaders better understand ever-changing Chinese consumption habits.The Quarterly: How are some of the well-documented changing consumer habits shaping your business?Mr. Lu: One of the big changes is that consumers are more mobile than before. People are on the move, they are traveling, and they have a mobile phone wherever they go. We need to really take this seriously and see how it will impact our model, and our route to market, and the way we communicate with customers. In the past, you will see consumers go to a supermarket, buy enough stock for one month, and go back each month, and your job is done. This is no longer going to happen. Consumers have more choice. They can go to a small convenience store; they can use their mobile apps and have a product delivered to their home.The Quarterly: How are you using digital technology to tap into the changing consumer behavior?Mr. Lu: The new environment is all about data. If you look at our industry, you will see a very long supply chain all the way from grass to glass. You can collect data from farms and even from individual cows. When you go into the supply-chain side and into manufacturing, you have much more data. When you look at our logistics, we have a huge amount of milk, which is transported across the nation. And then, on the consumer side, you see consumers buying our products online, communicating with us online-and so there is a lot of consumer transactional and interaction data. Across our entire chain of our business, data is available for us to translate into knowledge about our business. But it's all about how to use this data to empower our decision making across our business activities. More and more, this is about using AI to help us to improve our ability to do further analysis. Our capability to calculate and to analyze this data relies on us using the newest knowledge. Just for example, at Mengniu, we collect four million tons of milk each year. We sell 12 billion packs of product to our consumer, and we have 58 manufacturing sites, more than 1,000 manufacturing lines, more than 2,000 SKUs. If you put everything together, honestly, humans cannot do this analysis anymore. So today, we have kicked off some big projects-with Alibaba, for example-to use AI to analyze our supply chain, to tell us where we should manufacture products, to tell us where we should collect the milk, and to tell us how we can transport these products to our customers so that we get the maximum efficiency out of all this data.The Quarterly: That is a great example of how data are helping you tackle productivity challenges internally. Can you talk about any other initiatives that will help you better understand your customers?Mr. Lu: On the consumer side, we built an internal capability to get the consumer data out of a huge database. We have 20 million consumers who are actively talking to us in our data bank monthly. We know exactly who they are, how they behave, and how they interact with us, and we use this to adjust our product and adjust our formulation in order to meet their needs. At the same time, consumers are also able to get access to more of the services and products that we are offering, either through an online channel or through membership interaction or through a microcommunity. So again, this gives a lot more transparency over how we run our business. We can forecast for the next day instead of a month later. And we can read consumer trends-whether they like more sugar, less sugar. They may also tell us where they go in terms of what entertainment programs, dramas, and movies they are watching. This provides a lot of possibility for us to get the access to our consumer but also to give our consumer the ability to access us.The Quarterly: How do you see the changes you have been describing playing out over the next few years?Mr. Lu: We need to see how we can use these changes in the market to actively engage with our consumers, to provide personalized, individualized products for the young and old, because they all have different needs. For example, we are working on how to get our product to be more interesting and to have a different taste profile that appeals to a younger audience. How can we give consumers much more than nutrition? We need to give them enjoyment. We need to give them excitement. We also want to work on the image of Mengniu, to become younger looking and more fashionable. We cannot blame consumers for not liking milk or our packaging. If we do these two things right, then I think we will be part of a consumer's healthy enjoyment of life rather than just a pack of milk sitting in the fridge.The Quarterly: If China's bold Belt and Road Initiative does indeed open the borders to increased outbound and inbound trade, what is the opportunity for Mengniu Dairy to become a global brand?Mr. Lu: Now, honestly, Mengniu is still very much a Chinese company. But whereas in the past, the Chinese government or Chinese companies were very good in terms of exporting machine equipment and infrastructure capabilities, today we find, given the One Belt, One Road strategy, there is opportunity for a consumer-goods company like us. We are expanding into markets like Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, Malaysia, Myanmar, and Bangladesh; we find huge opportunity in these markets. For example, I was in Indonesia recently. It's amazing because in Jakarta, an area of 15 million people, we know the consumers and they like our product. If we take our product there, we will find out that there are a lot of similar products and that they have the same preference [as Chinese consumers]. We have tested two products in this market and got very, very good feedback. It also gives us opportunities to expand our products. In Southeast Asia, ice cream is a very important category because, unlike China, you have no seasonality. You can eat ice cream every day. And the same thing for the fresh dairy products. Some of these markets are like China 20 years ago, like in Myanmar and Bangladesh. We understand the consumer and the category trends as well as the country trends. With One Belt, One Road, there is support from the local countries that are more open to a Chinese company running business there. Alibaba is there. We can see Jingdong is there. We can see also Xiaomi and Vivo-they are all there. This is a different ecosystem today than in the past.The Quarterly: Can you explain the motivation behind your recent film collaboration with Alibaba and Jack Ma?Mr. Lu: It was interesting because the motivation for the film came from Alibaba-and from Jack Ma, who wanted to change the impression of kung fu to make it fun, interesting, and part of modern Chinese culture and bring it to the front of the consumer mind. This was the purpose of the film, and that also resonates with what we at Mengniu want to do as well. We are not just a milk manufacturer telling you what we can do; we want to be part of your life.About the authorsJeffrey, Minfang Lu is the CEO and executive director of China Mengniu Dairy.

China blocks Marriott for listing Tibet and Taiwan as countriesCNNMoney.comJanuary 11, 2018 Thursday 12:56 PM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: COMPANY NEWSLength: 402 wordsByline: Alanna PetroffBodyMarriott is suffering the consequences after making a major political misstep in China.Chinese authorities say they have blocked the Marriott website and app for a week after the hotel group listed Tibet, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan as separate "countries" in its emails and app.The online ban began on Thursday.The Chinese government considers these cities and territories to be part of a unified China and clamps down on any talk of sovereignty in these areas.Chinese authorities say Marriott's wording violated cybersecurity and advertising laws.

House Foreign Affairs Committee Issues Testimony From Information Technology Industry CouncilTargeted News ServiceFebruary 6, 2018 Tuesday 7:52 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 9649 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe House Foreign Affairs Committee issued the following testimony by John Miller, vice president for global policy and law, cybersecurity, and privacy at the Information Technology Industry Council, at a hearing entitled "U.S. Cyber Diplomacy in an Era of Growing Threats":"Chairman Royce, Ranking Member Engel, and Distinguished Members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I am John Miller, Vice President for Global Policy and Law, Cybersecurity and Privacy at the Information Technology Industry Council (ITI), and I am pleased to testify before your committee today on the important topic of assessing U.S. cyber diplomacy, including the State Department's cyber functions, in an era of growing threats. As we survey the global cyber policy landscape, we agree we are living in a time of remarkable global cyber policy activity, signifying both opportunity and risk. While it's instructive to understand where the policy landmines representing those risks are currently located and how they can undermine the United States government's (USG's) cyber policy objectives, global cybersecurity efforts, and the competitiveness of U.S. companies, it's also important for us to seize the opportunity presented by this global uncertainty to advance cyber policies that promote the cross-border data flows underpinning competitiveness, economic growth, and security. We welcome your interest and engagement on this subject."ITI1 represents over 602 of the world's leading information and communications technology (ICT) companies. Cybersecurity and cyber policy more broadly are rightly a priority for governments and our industry, and we share common goals of improving cybersecurity, protecting the privacy of individuals' data, and maintaining strong intellectual property protections. Further, our members are global companies, doing business in countries around the world. Most service the global market via complex supply chains in which products are developed, made, and assembled in multiple countries, and service customers across the full range of global industry sectors, such as financial services, healthcare and energy. We thus acutely understand the impact of governments' policies on innovation and the need for U.S. policies to be compatible with - and drive - global norms, as well as the potential impacts on our customers. Our members have extensive experience working with governments around the world on cyber or digital policies. In the technology industry, as well as other global sectors, when discussing any cyber policy, it is important to consider our connectedness, which is truly global and borderless."Taking a global approach is at once our top priority and challenge, because policymakers don't necessarily look at these issues through the same lens as global companies - many understandably refract cybersecurity, for instance, through their sovereign rights and obligations to protect their territories and their citizens. Unfortunately, doing the equivalent of building policy walls at your borders in the name of better security doesn't work in the digital world - from either a business or technical perspective - and may have the unintended consequence of doing more harm than good."I will focus my testimony on four areas: (1) demonstrating the critical importance and interrelatedness of cross-border data flows to the top cyber policy issues our companies grapple with every day; (2) illustrating how some of the top global cyber policy trends put global data flows, security, and our companies' competitiveness at risk; (3) positioning recent U.S. cyber policy activity within this global context; and (4) offering recommendations on the path forward, including discussing how the policies expressed in the Cyber Diplomacy Act (H.R. 3776) can help advance our collective cyber policy interests.Cross-Border Data Flows and the Top Cyber Policy Issues Facing the ICT Sector"A central element of ITI's global advocacy efforts involves helping governments understand the critical importance of cross-border data flows to the ICT sector and the global economy, and the centrality of data to many cutting-edge technologies and innovations, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and big data analytics. Virtually every business that operates internationally relies instinctively on the free and near instantaneous movement of data across borders to enable their day-to-day business operations, from conducting research and development, to designing and manufacturing goods, to marketing and distributing products and services to their customers, to securing global networks and the personal data of customers across the globe. With data increasingly at the center of not only the global economy but our lives, securing that data, and protecting privacy of individuals' data, is of paramount importance to ITI's companies, and the data-driven innovations mentioned above are increasingly critical to our shared cybersecurity mission as well."In addition to facilitating secure business transactions amongst companies in disparate locales, global data flows are key to greater coordination and productivity for global companies, helping to secure the systems and networks that manage production schedules and Human Resources data, as well as to communicate internally with subsidiaries and employees in different geographies. The free flow of data across borders is also necessary to enable a seamless and secure internet experience for hundreds of millions of citizens around the globe."I suspect the top "buckets" of cyber policy issues facing ITI's companies - international trade and data flows; standards and regulations; privacy and data protection; and cybersecurity - are the same issues facing most companies doing business in the global, digital economy. And so it's not surprising that all these issues implicate data flows in one way or another."Data Flows and International Trade. We think of these issues together, because for our companies these issues are inextricably linked. There is no trade in the modern, global digital economy without the ability to move data across borders - transferring data, communicating data, storing data, and of course protecting data are all fundamental to digital trade. Cross border data flows are fundamental to businesses of all sizes, and in all geographies, as well as to the key innovations that will drive the future, such as IoT and AI. The value of cross border data flows to e-commerce and digital trade cannot be overstated, and indeed there are plenty of statistics we can cite placing the aggregate dollar values of cross-border data flows between the U.S. and any number of trading partners in the hundreds of billions of dollars with the overall value of such data flows involving the U.S. topping $6 trillion in 2014.3 It is important to note these numbers are so large because the impacts involve much more than just the U.S. ICT sector - here in the U.S., or in countries proposing or adopting protectionist measures. The ICT sector is a horizontal enabler of services trade across all sectors of the economy. A recent study by UNCTAD - the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development - found up to 75% of the benefits of e-commerce impact other sectors of local economies. Misunderstanding of this fact amongst developing countries is palpable, as policies designed to "grow a domestic ICT sector" will have much broader negative impacts, as businesses in developing economies such as Brazil and India will not be able to grow and operate on a global scale without the ability to move data across borders."Standards and Regulations. Trade associations representing global businesses are often characterized as "anti-regulation" - and of course, it's true that not a lot of businesses go out of their way to ask to have regulations imposed on them. However, when we survey emerging standards and regulations globally, the bigger problems often aren't necessarily the standards and regulations themselves, but the fact that many countries are contemplating local standards, and local, siloed regulatory approaches. The proliferation of siloed technical standards, regulations and localized data and security requirements could impede the seamless functioning of the internet and global digital economy as we experience it today. Multiple country specific standards, or requiring that non-domestically sourced equipment undergo differing security requirements, can lead to the balkanization of the global digital infrastructure, threatening the continued interoperability of the innovative technologies that have fueled the internet's growth. The potential negative impacts of forced localization and other protectionist measures become even more pronounced when we factor in potential impacts on the cloud, Big Data, IoT, and emerging technologies such as AI."Privacy and Data Protection. We all acknowledge that exponentially more data is being generated than ever before. Unlike natural resources, data is an infinite resource because we create it, and then data itself is leveraged through a host of innovative technologies that help unlock its value. Whether we are talking about Big Data Analytics, IoT, AI - data is at the center of all these innovations. Given data is at the center of trade and innovation, securing that data, and protecting the privacy of that data, is of paramount importance to governments, companies and citizens alike, to protect consumer privacy and to enable secure transactions. Governments around the world are aware of this as well, and many are examining, re-examining, or considering privacy and data protection laws for the first time. But data protection policies that seek to protect data by, for instance, restricting its cross-border transfer by requiring a determination of whether the receiving country's laws are "adequate," or preventing data from leaving a country's borders entirely by requiring that it be stored on domestic servers, can not only prevent future innovative uses of data, but may prevent us from realizing a host of socioeconomic uses that data helps us realize , in areas such as health, agriculture, finance, and cybersecurity."Cybersecurity. Cybersecurity is often the rationale lurking behind many of the problematic policies that threaten data flows, such as data localization policies, proposed requirements for in-country security testing, audits or assessments, or requirements for domestic manufacturing or server locations. The net result of such policies will likely be a slowing or diminishing of cross border data flows, which will in turn negatively impact global e-commerce development and growth. However, what is sometimes overlooked is that data flows are of central importance to cybersecurity itself. U.S. and global ICT companies have a long history of exchanging security-related information across borders with geographically-dispersed employees, users, customers, governments, and other stakeholders, which helps them better protect their own systems and maintain high levels of security for customer data, IP and the technology ecosystem as a whole. Indeed, one of the preeminent cyber policy achievements in the U.S. in recent years - the 2016 passage of a bipartisan cybersecurity threat information sharing legislation4 - was intended to spur the voluntary sharing of cyber threat information among and between businesses and government entities to improve cybersecurity. So, it's critical to understand that the trend of impeding data flows generally is also contrary to the thrust of current U.S. cybersecurity policy and threatens to undermine progress to better secure the global digital ecosystem and economy.Top Global Cyber Policy Trends"The policy issues described above manifest themselves in various global cyber policy trends, sometimes alone but oftentimes in combination. After briefly discussing these trends, I will highlight the current state of play in a few major economies to help illustrate the pervasiveness of today's "global policy threats.""Forced Localization. Forced localization refers to a broad set of policies that are designed to compel companies to relocate all or part of their global business operations within a country's borders. Data localization is a prime example: foreign firms could be required to process data at a national datacenter, purchase or manufacture locally, or transfer intellectual property to a domestic competitor as a precondition for market access. We've seen localization proposals popping up almost everywhere over the last few years - and while such measures today have become increasingly complex, often they are designed to achieve a straightforward goal: impeding the ability of foreign companies to compete with local firms in providing goods, services, and technologies in global business transactions. While many governments view these policies as helping them to meet the challenges of a complex global economy, the truth is the drawbacks for a country and its citizens far outweigh the benefits. Instead, localization efforts work to reduce the competitiveness of countries who employ them across all economic sectors and undermine the health of the global economy by raising the cost of doing business internationally."While much of the discussion of forced localization policies has appropriately focused on data localization, in fact forced localization policies can take many forms, including:* Data Localization: Requirements that companies store, process, or otherwise handle data within a country's borders. This includes restrictions on the free flow of information across borders that underpins an open internet.* Local Content Requirements: Mandates that a certain amount of the final value of a good or service be sourced domestically, either by purchasing it from local companies or by manufacturing or otherwise producing or providing it locally.* Technology Transfer Requirements: Measures requiring businesses to transfer proprietary intellectual property directly to local competitors or through government agencies.* Local Presence Requirements: Requiring a company to establish a local office in-country or provide goods or services using local facilities, infrastructure, or agents, etc.* Standards and Conformity Assessment: Requirements to comply with unique, non-global technical standards, or to conduct duplicative or overly restrictive conformity assessment procedures without recognition of international norms that make current technology and new innovations possible.* Indigenous Innovation Requirements: Requirements to use or impose a preference to domestically developed technology.* Domestic Employment Requirements: Requirements to achieve a certain level of domestic employment."The proliferation of forced localization measures is a trend that the world's leading economies - including the U.S. - - must work hard to combat if policymakers want to continue to leverage the internet to spur innovation, job creation, and economic growth. Given that localization policies are out of step with the international norms and policy frameworks that have guided innovation in technologies and the rapid rise of technology-enabled industries, the rise of such policies in recent years should be cause for concern."ITI has conducted an in-depth survey of forced localization policies worldwide. While half of localization measures are acknowledged by governments as having a naked economic objective, such as local ICT sector development, in nearly half of the cases ITI has studied there are noneconomic rationales or objectives, often security-related, lurking behind these policies.5"There is a certain irony in security being cited as a driving rationale in roughly one-third of the forced localization cases ITI studied - such policies may negatively impact security itself. As noted above, there is a security rationale underlying many of the proposed localization regulations, and few would question the sovereign right of nations to pursue cybersecurity or other regulations that will legitimately protect their national security. However, in our view many of these proposed security requirements, while well intentioned, are grounded in a fundamental misconception - that location of manufacture or the country of origin of an IT product is somehow dispositive of the security of that product, or that the location of data or restricting its flow guarantees stronger protections."In fact, geographic-based restrictions are simply not a reliable way to create better security. Fundamentally, product security is a function of how a product is made, used, and maintained, not by whom or where such products are made. Geographic-based restrictions not only ignore the reality that most supply chains for IT products are global, but run the risk of creating a false sense of security for any countries who advocate for such provisions to advance their national cybersecurity interests. At a time when greater global cooperation and collaboration is essential to improve cybersecurity, restrictions based solely on geography risk undermining the advancement of global best practices and consensus-based standards for cybersecurity, such as secure development lifecycles."Siloed or Country-specific Standards and Regulations. Countries are increasingly proposing regulations or standards that are country specific, rather than grounded in international standards or approaches - whether we are talking about privacy-based transfer restrictions or security-based testing requirements. Different requirements across countries pose significant regulatory fragmentation risks. The negative impacts of regulatory fragmentation include the inefficiencies associated with companies potentially being required to adopt a separate privacy and security compliance program for every country they do business in, and pose significant challenges to global interoperability due to varying technical or legal requirements. Layer on top of that sector specific laws within these countries, competing overlapping regulations (e.g., competing security incident notification and data breach notification), or multiple levels of government regulators potentially getting into the mix (e.g., Brazil's financial regulator promulgating security regulations for banks), and it's easy to see the potential problems in this area."Cybersecurity Audits, Assessments and Testing Requirements. Efforts by policymakers to "measure," "certify," "test" or "label" for cybersecurity - e.g., the EU's proposed ENISA Regulation urging the development of a security certification Framework, or India's Department of Telecommunications proposed implementation of local security certification and testing requirements for telecommunications equipment - show no signs of abating. While these and other policy proposals are wide ranging, at their core is a common set of underlying concerns regarding the trustworthiness and security of ICT products, supply chains and systems. While determining how best to use cybersecurity measurements to drive increased accountability for cybersecurity across organizations is unquestionably a worthwhile goal, global proposals seeking to impose certification, audit or assessment requirements on private entities are often invasive in that they contemplate such tests being conducted by government auditors or assessors, thus requiring access to companies' source code or other proprietary information. Further, the testing contemplated often involves local standards, rather than global standards. A better approach to driving accountability via measurement is espoused by Draft 2 of Cybersecurity Framework Version 1.1, which emphasizes the role of measurement as a tool for self-assessment and internal use by organizations, rather than as intended for external use by policymakers or regulators to evaluate or judge the sufficiency of organizations' cybersecurity risk management programs."Application of Legacy Regulations to Technology and Services Innovations. Of emerging concern are the attempts to "retrofit" legacy regulations to technology and services innovations in a manner that that would impact broad swaths of the internet economy, or have unintended consequences on innovation, security, or other dimensions of cyber policy. Two recent examples of this trend involve the rise of "OTT" regulations, and the expanding use of export controls."The Rise of "OTT" Regulations. Numerous foreign governments are seeking to subject U.S. online services and applications to burdensome legacy regulations designed to address the particular technical and market characteristics of traditional telecommunications or broadcast providers. These measures - often vaguely called "Over-the-Top" or "OTT" regulations in foreign markets - take different forms globally. What they increasingly require is that online services register as telecommunications or broadcasting providers, contribute to universal service funds, comply with local content quotas and make subsidy payments, guarantee a particular quality of service, establish local presence and/or local data storage, and implement technical mandates, including certain emergency calling requirements that are not technically feasible or economically reasonable. These regulations are creating market access barriers for U.S. services, including in China, Colombia, the European Union and several EU member states, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, Vietnam, and other countries."Extension of Export Controls to Cybersecurity Products. Another troubling regulatory trend that appears on the rise is the extension of export controls to cybersecurity technologies. During the 2013 Wassenaar Arrangement plenary session, the member nations agreed to implement export controls related to intrusion detection software and IP network communications surveillance items. While the human rights concerns underlying the controls were laudable (i.e., protecting activists from monitoring by authoritarian governments and keeping software and technology out of the hands of hackers who could use it maliciously), the controls as originally agreed to were overbroad, sweeping in virtually any type of software, hardware, and technology designed to counter "intrusion" software. The 2013 controls were also ineffective in achieving their intended objective of barring companies from exporting specific tools to specific end-users for specific purposes, were divergently applied across Wassenaar signatories, and from the perspective of most would have undermined U.S. and global cybersecurity efforts."The good news is that many of the flawed aspects of the 2013 controls were improved pursuant to the outcomes of last year's Wassenaar plenary session, but the risks of further expansion of export controls to other cybersecurity technologies, or other technologies that could negatively impact either cybersecurity efforts or global data flows more broadly, remain. For instance, the European Union is currently in the process of redrafting its Dual-Use Export Regime, implicating many of these same issues."These issues are not hypothetical - they are both very real and pervasive, insofar as they are not really limited to particular countries, regions or economies. I provide a "deep dive" on how these issues arise in several major markets below."China. ITI members continue to be concerned with market access issues in China, especially barriers to entry portrayed as security justifications. China's discriminatory Cybersecurity Law (CSL) creates a legal framework that institutes multiple and overlapping security review regimes for foreign technology with limited transparency and significant ambiguity that can easily preference domestic industry. The security review regimes under the CSL and related measures compel companies to disclose sensitive information. The Law also contains "secure and controllable" requirements, which were raised in USTR's 2017 and 2016 National Trade Estimate (NTE) reports as a known issue with serious implications for domestic preferences. Moreover, the scope of the CSL is broad and several of its provisions remain ambiguous, conditions that will lead to problems with compliance."Data localization measures have dramatically increased in China, jeopardizing not only the technology industry, but all other industries that depend on ICT platforms for global operations. Barriers that pre-dated the CSL already cost U.S. services billions of dollars as companies were pushed out of the market, with a vast majority of U.S. companies describing Chinese internet restrictions as either "somewhat negatively" or "negatively" impacting their capacity to do business there.6 For instance, even though U.S. cloud service providers (CSPs) have stimulated innovation and application of cloud computing technologies around the world, China has imposed several onerous regulations on U.S. CSPs - effectively barring them from operating or competing fairly in China. Chinese laws and regulations on non-Chinese CSPs can force U.S. CSPs to transfer valuable intellectual property, surrender use of their brand names, and hand over operation and control of their businesses to Chinese companies in order to operate in China."Embedded within the Cybersecurity Law and among numerous regulations and standards are requirements to store, process, or manage data locally within China and restrictions on flows of data in and out of China. The most prominent restrictions are found in the Measures on Cross-Border Data Transfer and the Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Regulation. The CSL creates additional barriers by mandating data localization for CII network owners and operators in China and restricting flows of data out of China."These measures directly affect the ability of many industries beyond the tech sector to conduct normal business operations. This trend toward increased control over where and how data is transferred represents a destructive and misguided attempt to protect Chinese tech companies from foreign competition. Taken together, these measures pose great costs to U.S. firms in all sectors."China also continues to flout international standards and norms, as demonstrated by an increase in laws and standards that include China-specific requirements. In April 2017, the State Encryption Management Bureau released the draft Encryption Law, which currently requires unique encryption of products and services within China that does not align with the Common Criteria.7 The draft would also impose an intrusive licensing scheme covering the sale, use, and import or export of commercial cryptography that poses significant risks of disclosure for companies. Meanwhile, the draft Standardization Law causes concern among companies for its potential to create a burdensome standards regime. In establishing a framework for standards-making, the draft Standardization Law contains unclear definitions of standards types and their status as mandatory or voluntary. Numerous Chinese standards that are categorized as voluntary continue to be regarded by Chinese government agencies as mandatory or de facto mandatory, a problem that the law has not adequately addressed."Beyond the negative impacts on U.S. companies in terms of access to the Chinese market itself, perhaps most worrisome is the potential of the CSL to emerge as the dominant approach to cyber policy in the region, or even globally."India. India presents a unique case, insofar as the U.S. and India in 2016 successfully negotiated a bilateral agreement, the Framework for the U.S.-India Cyber Relationship, that seems to run counter to many of the problematic policies India continues to pursue."In May 2017, India's Telecommunications Engineering Centre (TEC) proposed changes mandating certification and local testing for all telecom products regulated under India's Telegraph Rules. These changes are set to begin in October 2018 and include a wide range of technical requirements from electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and safety to security testing and IPv6 interoperability, as well as environmental requirements, among others. TEC and the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) have not provided a rationale or details on the implementation this broad certification framework, nor have they notified it to the WTO Technical Barriers to Trade Committee for global stakeholder feedback."Many of these requirements will likely be redundant with existing international testing and certification of telecom products. Moreover, India has little capacity to or infrastructure to implement these changes. ITI and local industry are asking TEC/DoT to pare back the initial scope of the requirements and ITI is seeking clarification on many outstanding issues before TEC/DoT move ahead. ITI is also urging the authorities to follow global best practices and accept international test reports and certificates when applicable, and to allow for additional consultation with industry and an adequate transition time."DoT also continues to pursue a mandate that telecom companies, operating networks within India and overseas, put in place necessary systems to ensure the networks within India's geographical borders comply with telecom security rules. In April 2013, DoT identified certain telecom products to be screened at an authorized test lab, of which some were singled out as "high risk items" to be checked from October 1, 2013. DoT notified industry that all imported telecom and ICT products (if internet connected) will have to be locally tested by DoT-accredited labs even if such devices have been screened by private labs within the Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement (CCRA) alliance. However, since notifying this requirement, DoT has delayed implementation every year since due to a lack of capacity for testing and unclear requirements for implementers. This measure, if ever implemented, would impose significant costs to U.S. companies exporting to India, and yearly last-minute delays in implementation have created significant uncertainty for companies exporting to India."India maintains and is expanding local preferences for government procurement. Historically, the most prominent measure--Preferential Market Access for Government Procurement (PMA-G)--has steadily expanded from low level computing systems to high end servers and other technology products. This measure, implemented by MEITY and DoT, requires products to have certain levels of local content in order to qualify for procurement price preferences, effectively blocking many American companies from competing. However, in June 2017, the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion released a new "Make in India" Order which gives a 20% price preference to all products with 50% Indian local content in government procurement. As a result, both MEITY and DoT are updating their PMA-G policies to reflect this order, expanding both the scope and effect of their policies. In addition, MEITY recently released a notification that will expand this program to cybersecurity products - a sector in which the U.S. has a significant competitive advantage. These requirements are extremely problematic for American tech companies that wish to do business in India, and the expansion on PMA to cybersecurity products is particularly problematic to the extent it necessarily impacts companies' intellectual property rights. When implemented, ITI member companies would be unable to compete fairly for government ICT contracts, which make up a large portion of the Indian ICT market."In addition, the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has published several consultation papers on a range of issues (cloud computing, machine to machine communications, data protection, and more). Though few concrete steps have yet been taken as a result of these consultations, many of them have explored potentially damaging policy options - most notably data localization and extending telecommunications regulations to OTT service providers. The outcomes of these consultations warrant attention from the USG as they could result in restricting the ability of U.S. companies to export their services to India in the future."Russia. Russia has adopted several forced localization policies and laws. Federal Law 242-FZ, which requires data collected on Russian citizens to be stored in Russia, came into effect on September 1, 2015. This law affects the normal business operations of all industries in Russia by imposing inefficient operational rules, particularly the requirement in Article 18 to store personal data concerning Russian citizens in data centers located in Russia. It appears that Roskomnadzor, the federal regulator responsible for implementation, has accepted mirroring of data--keeping copies of data within Russia rather than the more extensive requirements of processing it in-country--to be compliant with the law. However, the vague language in the law could allow for blocking cross-border data flows in the future, lending to an uncertain business environment in Russia. Furthermore, even mirroring of data can be very costly to businesses, particularly Small and Medium Size Enterprises (SME), increasing barriers to entry for the Russian market. In addition, the federal media regulator has been empowered to block local access to the websites of non-compliant companies. Given the law's expansive scope, foreign companies without a legal presence in Russia, which might pay only a cursory attention to the Russian market, can be labelled data protection violators and blocked. In late 2016, Russia began conducting audits and fining companies for violations. In one high profile case, this audit resulted in a U.S. internet company being blocked outright from doing business in Russia."In January 2016, the Kremlin issued a 16-point plan for improving the competitiveness and security of the Russian ICT sector through import-substitution, increased surveillance capabilities, and increased education on issues related to cyber. The plan is focused on import substitution and has generally been talked about in the context of "internet sovereignty." Two new executive decrees associated with this plan call for ministries to create plans that prioritize Russian-produced software and equipment for government purchases, create additional obligations for how the personal information of Russian citizens is processed, regulate the encryption of data, reorganize federal cyber-threat monitoring, and establish a Center of Import Substitution for Information and Communication Technologies. In October 2016, a bill was introduced in the Duma that would further require government entities to provide preferences even to Russian developed software that is based on foreign-developed middleware. Further implementation and follow-up decrees have been opaque and seemingly poorly coordinated, so there is little information on how the plan has progressed."Federal Law No. 149-FZ "On Information, Information Technologies and the Protection of Information," as amended in 2014, has two particularly troubling elements. First, Article 10.1 "The Duties of an Organizer of Dissemination of Information on the Internet," requires "organizers of the distribution of information on the internet" to retain all metadata within Russia for six months and provide access to that data to security agencies. This applies to an incredibly wide range of companies that facilitate the receipt, transmission, delivery, and/or processing of electronic messages--including any email and internet-based messaging services. Second, Article 10.2, the "Blogger's Law," requires bloggers with more than 3,000 daily users to register with Roskomnadzor and places restrictions on what they can and cannot post to their websites. This law not only has significant free speech and human right implications, but it also creates costly barriers for U.S. companies who wish to do business in Russia."Lastly, on July 7th, 2016 President Putin signed a package laws (374-FZ and 375-FZ) that amended Russian Federal Laws 126-FZ and 149-FZ--known as the "Yarovaya Amendments." These amendments require "organizers of information distribution on the internet" to store the content of communications that they enable within Russia for six months. In addition, telecommunications companies must store metadata of all communications within Russia for three years, whereas "organizers," referring to internet providers, must store metadata for one year. If any of this data in encrypted, then companies must also provide encryption keys to the implementing agency, the Federal Security Service (FSB). These requirements will be incredibly costly for companies operating in Russia, so much so that domestic telecommunications companies have been in vocal opposition to the law, a rare event in the country."European Union. There are also a range of policy and regulatory proposals related to security and privacy in the EU that potentially jeopardize data flows."E-Privacy Regulation. The European Commission unveiled its draft proposal for an ePrivacy Regulation (ePR) last year. The ePR is a priority issue for ITI and our members for several reasons, including the broad material, definitional and territorial scope of the proposed regulation's reach, prescriptiveness of its provisions, size of contemplated penalties/fines, and inefficiencies and confusion caused by overlap and conflict with the GDPR. While it is hard to single out just a few concerning provisions, perhaps most troubling of all is simply the vast scope of electronic communication services (ECS) data the draft proposes to regulate - the "Regulation applies to any exchange of information using electronic communication services and public communications networks, including content and metadata," and expressly applies not only to OTTs but communications among IoT devices, including machine-to-machine communications, and thus directly impacting three of the leading edge data-driven innovations. As for the penalties, fines for violations of the ePR can range as high as the greater of Euros20M, or 4% of worldwide revenue. ITI has also pointed out potentially problematic unintended consequences of the ePR on cybersecurity, particularly on the ability of companies to retain third party cybersecurity providers to defend their networks due to rigid consent and other requirements. ITI will continue to advocate for changes to ePR to minimize the impacts on important emerging technology priority areas such as artificial intelligence, OTTs and IoT."Safe Harbor Invalidation and Privacy Shield. Most are aware the transatlantic trade relationship was legitimately placed in serious jeopardy back in 2015, when the invalidation of the Safe Harbor agreement by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruling in Maximillian Schrems v. Data Protection Commissioner (Case C-362/14) ("Schrems") cast uncertainty on the ability of companies to transfer data from the EU to the U.S. While the U.S.-EU Privacy Shield arrangement, which took effect on August 1, 2016, and was recently reaffirmed by the European Commission following the first joint annual review of the agreement, represents a strong commitment by both the U.S. and EU to enable transfers of data across the Atlantic and safeguard consumer privacy, threats to transatlantic data flows remain due primarily to two factors: 1) the pending judicial review at the European Court of Justice of standard contractual clauses, which give U.S. companies an alternative option to ensure that they can transfer data from the EU to the U.S., and 2) challenges in other EU courts to the Privacy Shield itself."EU Cybersecurity Measures. The Network and Information Security Directive (NIS Directive), the first EU-wide cybersecurity legislation, must be transposed into member state law by May 2018, and the threat of siloed approaches (across the member states) to implementation on key issues, such as the scope of NIS application to technology companies and the potential of asymmetric security incident notification requirements (including rationalizing them vis-a-vis the GDPR's data breach notification requirements), remains. While Germany's legislation implementing NIS is already largely in place, and the UK (who is implementing NIS despite its impending departure from the EU due to Brexit) released their draft legislation to transpose the Directive late last year, several other member states have yet to release legislation to transpose or implement NIS at all, making it hard to fully gauge the risks of regulatory fragmentation. In the latter part of last year, the European Commission also released a comprehensive "cybersecurity package" including a revision and update of the 2011 Cybersecurity Strategy and Proposal for a Regulation on ENISA (the EU Agency for Network and Information Security), the "EU Cybersecurity Agency," and on information and communication technology cybersecurity certification (the "Cybersecurity Act").8 Key issues of concern with the proposals include the overbroad and potentially far-reaching scope of the cybersecurity certification scheme, the potential for it to be linked to EU rather than international standards, and the current lack of ENISA resources to support its vastly expanded mandate.Recent U.S. Cyber Policy Activity in the Global Context"On balance, recent cyber policy activity in the U.S. acknowledges both the importance of global data flows and avoids many of the policy pitfalls identified above. The Cyber Diplomacy Act of 2017 (CDA) helpfully recounts many of the noteworthy cyber policy initiatives advanced or supported by the U.S. over the past several years that are not only supportive of data flows, but necessarily depend on prioritizing and resourcing international approaches to address our shared cyber challenges, including:* 2011 U.S. International Strategy for Cyberspace* 2016 International Cyberspace Policy Strategy* 2016 Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity* Multilateral declarations at the G-7 and G-20* May 2017 Executive Order on Cybersecurity (EO 13800)"To that list, I would add the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (the "Cybersecurity Framework"), a voluntary, risk management framework grounded in international standards and best practices that was co-developed by NIST and other USG stakeholders in partnership with industry, and the Cybersecurity Act of 2015,9 bipartisan information sharing legislation expressly designed to increase the flow of information for cybersecurity purposes. Additionally, some of the initial outputs spurred by the EO 13800, including the botnet report,10 similarly acknowledge the importance of the international dimension of cyber policy."All these policies, spanning both the Obama and Trump Administrations, implicate ecosystem-wide, global cyber challenges calling for global solutions advanced via international and public-private partnerships and collaboration."The Cyber Diplomacy Act of 2017. The CDA is a welcome and complementary contribution to this recent body of U.S. cyber policymaking that appears to strike the right chord on multiple fronts. Of particular note are the following elements of the bill:"Taking a Global Approach That Promotes Data Flows, Innovation, Openness and Economic Prosperity."The CDA's expression of the overarching policy objectives it is trying to achieve fairly encapsulates the types of cyber policy approaches that help promote data flows, innovation and economic prosperity, and that ITI routinely promotes: "Congress declares that it is the policy of the United States to work internationally with allies and other partners to promote an open, interoperable, reliable, unfettered and secure internet governed by the multistakeholder model which promotes human rights, democracy, and rule of law, including freedom of expression, innovation, communication, and economic prosperity, while protecting privacy and guarding against deception, fraud and theft." (Sec. 3(a))"Securing and implementing commitments based on cyber policy norms. The CDA prioritizes several commitments to pursue to advance cyber policy norms that would help mitigate the problematic global policies detailed earlier in my testimony, including:* Furthering cross border data flows by prohibiting localization* Incentivizing security by design* Shielding critical infrastructure entities and CERTS from state-sponsored attacks* Avoiding state-sponsored IP theft to provide commercial advantages to the private sector"Actionable and accountable agreements. The CDA also smartly seeks to establish guardrails designed to make those agreements both actionable and accountable. The CDA compiles a list of existing bilateral cyber agreements with nine countries. Over the past several years The Department of State and other key USG stakeholders such as the Departments of Homeland Security (DHS) and Commerce have done an admirable job of forging a series of cyber bilateral agreements consistent with the governing principles articulated above. As the CDA points out, however, there is a need to follow through by making "evidence-based assessments" regarding the functioning of those agreements, to make sure our counterparties are fulfilling their commitments and other obligations. Multilateral agreements are also a clear part of the solution to furthering international progress on cybersecurity and other cyber policy issues, and the bill acknowledges important foundational work that has already been done at the G7 and G20. This is one area, perhaps, where the CDA could more specifically call out the need for actionable and accountable follow through, as it does explicitly in the context of bilateral agreements."Prioritizing and Allocating Department of State Resources. Realizing the international cyber policy objectives expressed in the bill will require adequately prioritizing and allocating sufficient resources, including regarding the Cyber Coordinator role at the State Department."The CDA proposes the Department of State cyber coordinator should be a Senate-confirmed position at the rank of ambassador. This makes good sense for several reasons. First, the rank and title of the position sends an important message to other countries regarding the importance the USG places on the cyber issues falling within the coordinator's purview. Second, the practical reality is whoever resides in this position will often have to negotiate with counterparts at other countries holding a similar rank - these counterparts need to know they are dealing with a peer with proportionate decision-making authority. Finally, staffing the position at a senior level can aid in interagency discussions with peer decisionmakers at DHS, Commerce and other USG stakeholders, and can help provide greater continuity through subsequent administrations and personnel changes."The scope and scale of cyber issues facing the U.S. and the Department of State is growing - we urge that the cyber coordinator's office be adequately resourced to handle this mandate. As the next wave of emerging technologies and digital innovations continue to take hold, cyber issues will only continue to grow in breadth and prominence as policy, economic and security issues for the United States, and the Department of State's lead cyber official and office should be adequately resourced to handle them.Recommendations"My testimony thus far should make clear there are landmines all over the global cyber policy landscape. While it's instructive to understand where they are, and the stated and unstated motivations underlying them, what's more important for the USG is defining and resourcing a collaborative, proactive strategy, in partnership with the private sector, to drive forward the admirable policy objectives expressed in the CDL. Ultimately, helping that global, open, innovation-friendly approach gain traction will be the best way to influence those countries at earlier stages of cyber policy development in a direction that supports the policy objectives shared by the USG and industry - not simply because we support them, but because those are the policies that will ultimately help developing countries fulfill their internet-fueled economic and digital aspirations."Below are concrete recommendations for USG actions internationally that can help improve global data flows, security, and the other international cyber objectives expressed in the CDA."Continue to Prioritize and Resource International Cybersecurity Standardization. To counter the trend of various countries increasingly advocating for their own local security standards, testing protocols, certifications, etc., it seems obvious the U.S. needs a proactive and adequately resourced national strategy involving both industry and government working together to develop and further international cybersecurity standards, consistent with the policy expressed in the CDA. The U.S. has already made some progress in this area, including the Interagency Report on Strategic U.S. Government Engagement in International Standardization to Achieve U.S. Objectives for Cybersecurity (the "International Standardization Strategy") published by NIST in 2016. We recommend that the current administration prioritize furthering this strategy to improve the U.S. government's participation in the development and use of international standards for cybersecurity, as well as IoT, AI and other emerging standards areas. Doing so will require a unity of effort with industry, as well as adequate resources and political support."Further the Cybersecurity Framework Approach Globally. The Cybersecurity Framework approach represents the most prominent counterweight to many of the data-restrictive policy approaches recounted above and that are growing in prominence globally. The Framework leverages public-private partnerships, is grounded in sound risk management principles, and helps foster innovation due to its flexibility and basis in global standards. The Framework has also consistently been lauded for providing a common language to better help organizations comprehend, communicate and manage cybersecurity risks - it can serve as a common language for global policymakers as well. International Cybersecurity Framework alignment is essential to its longevity, and foundational to driving such alignment involves the global Framework promotion efforts of both industry and government. Promoting the Framework in its current form will help the U.S. to sustain its leadership on cybersecurity around the world, and this will in turn help to further enhance the Framework's use within the United States. To facilitate further global adoption, USG stakeholders should promote the Framework approach with their global counterparts. For example, the Department of State should reference the Framework in its global cybersecurity capacity-building efforts. Likewise, the White House should highlight the Framework in its strategic cybersecurity partnerships. ITI has also urged NIST to explore, with industry stakeholders, the opportunity for submitting relevant parts of the Framework as an international standard. The latest draft of the Roadmap to Framework Version 1.1 indicates NIST has actively engaged with the ISO and IEC to map existing international standards to the Framework, work that has led to the anticipated publication of an ISO/IEC Technical Report."Leverage Multilateral Fora to Drive Cyber Policy Solutions. Multilateral agreements are also a clear part of the solution to furthering global progress on cybersecurity and other cyber policy issues, and the CDA references important foundational work that has already been done at the G7 and G20. While not all multilateral fora hold equal promise, ultimately pursuing multilateral solutions in parallel with bilateral ones can be an important force multiplier to drive policy solutions across the global digital economy. For example, good progress has been made at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum to further the Cross-Border Privacy Rules (CBPRs) framework. The APEC CBPRs are flexible enough to be adopted on a broad scale and are gaining traction across a diverse set of economies in the APEC region, providing a mechanism to move data safely between organizations while providing a bridge to address variations in laws or regulatory fragmentation amongst the participating economies. The United States, Mexico, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, the Philippines and Australia are already participating or have committed to participate in the CBPRs, and other APEC economies have signaled their interest in joining. The CBPRs offer a scalable system that holds the potential to be less burdensome to economies and companies than navigating other more restrictive, burdensome, resource-intensive, data transfer mechanisms.Conclusion"Members of the committee, ITI and our member companies are pleased you are examining the role and importance of cyber diplomacy in a world of evolving and increasingly sophisticated threats. Unfortunately, government policymakers globally are increasingly responding to the expanding sophistication and capabilities of cyber adversaries and more frequent and severe cyber incidents by proposing cyber laws and policies that can create trade barriers for U.S. companies and threaten to impede cross-border data flows. If left unchecked, this activity threatens to undermine both the trust and interoperability undergirding the global digital ecosystem."Historically, the U.S. has maintained a leadership position in cyberspace - from the companies who have led the way in building the global digital economy and internet-based services that have fueled its growth, to visionary cyber policy developments such as the Cybersecurity Framework, to pioneering bilateral cyber agreements negotiated with allied and competitor nations alike. If the USG aspires to maintain its leadership position going forward, it must not only work collectively - both domestically and on the global stage, bilaterally and multilaterally, via public-private collaboration and across sectors - but it must lead."ITI stands ready to provide you any additional input and assistance in our collaborative efforts to develop balanced policy approaches that help all of us to collectively advance cyber policies that promote global data flows, innovation, security, economic prosperity, and the other laudable objectives expressed in the Cyber Diplomacy Act."I thank the Chairman, Ranking Member, and Members of the Committee for inviting me to testify today and for their interest in and examination of this important issue. I look forward to your questions."Thank you."* * *Footnotes:1 About ITI. ITI is the global voice of the tech sector.

Version 2.0.1 of the suite includes GUI enhancements, the latest version of the PTDaemon for power analyzers and temperature sensors, and a single score metric.Major part of critical effort                                                                    SERT is emerging as a major part of server efficiency improvements worldwide.                                                                            Since its introduction five years ago, SERT testing has been a mandatory part of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) ENERGY STAR for Computer Servers specification. SPEC is actively engaged in several international initiatives, working closely with the European Commission to add SERT to the Ecodesign Directive for enterprise servers, collaborating with the Chinese National Institute of Standardization (CNIS), and working with the International Standards Organization (ISO) to include SERT in the ISO/CD 21836 standard for server efficiency.                                                                       Importance in China                                                      The Solution Department of Inspur, a SPEC Open Systems Group (OSG) Steering Committee member, described the importance of server efficiency and SERT in China:                                                                           "The Chinese government is paying more and more attention to servers' computing and power efficiency within large datacenters. Government research shows that power accounts for more than 40 percent of the operational costs for most Chinese datacenters. Many cities have strict PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) requirements for newly built computing and datacenters. A new policy for the city government of Beijing, for example, will overrule any construction application for computing centers whose PUE is higher than 1.5.                      "Power efficiency means not only environmental protection for China, but also energy security. The Chinese government has made sound energy conservation standards part of its '13thFive-YearPlan' (2016-2020). This directly raises power efficiency requirements for Chinese server and storage manufacturers.                                                                          "As a neutral third-party computing system evaluation organization, SPEC is the computing industry's mosttrustworthy benchmark provider. Within this context, SERT receives a lot of attention as a vital tool for measuring server efficiency."                                                          Key role in European Ecodesign Directive                                 Davide Polverini, policy officer in charge of implementing the Ecodesign Directive aimed at improving the environmental performance of energy-related products, acknowledges the importance of SERT in Europe:                           "Potential Ecodesign requirements for servers, both addressing energy efficiency and material efficiency aspects, are currently being analyzed in the European Union. SERT has emerged as the most suitable test measurement for servers, and a SERT-based metric for the energy efficiency of these products has been developed in conjunction with industry stakeholders."                   Bringing the parties together                                            "SPEC's international membership collaborates to bring together the global server community focused on conserving energy," says Klaus-Dieter Lange, chair of the SPECpower committee that develops the SERT suite and the SPECpower_ssj2008 benchmark. "SERT is designed to be used worldwide, enabling all server vendors to perform standardized testing. This helps vendors to concentrate on improving the energy efficiency of their servers, provides consistent metrics for national regulatory programs, and simplifies comparisons."   Available immediately                                                    The SERT 2.0.1 suite is available for immediate download from SPEC for $2,800.

Government Clamps Down as National Political Meetings Draw CloserTargeted News ServiceFebruary 28, 2018 Wednesday 7:54 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 514 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: BRUSSELS, Belgium BodyThe International Federation of Journalists issued the following news release:The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) has called on the Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China respect Article 35 of the Constitution of China and cease attempts to suppress people from expressing their opinions in the lead up to and during the upcoming National People's Congress and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Beijing.On February 26, Bao Tong, the former director of the office of Political Reform of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, and political secretary of Zhao Ziyang, former Premier of China, was informed by national security agents that he was banned from accepting media interviews, posting articles on social media, and attending any group dinners until March 20, 2018, the date that the National People's Congress and Consultative Conference ends. There are reports that there is a list of 'sensitive' people who have received similar orders to Bao.Other people were also warned against accepting media interviews, while several bloggers have their social media accounts blocked. One citizen journalist told the IFJ that her Weibo account was shut down forever on February 27 after it was alleged that she was disseminating vicious rumours, violating Weibo's regulations. She said that Weibo did not specify which rumours had violated their terms, or which terms she had breached. However her account was shut just 24 hours after she posted a joint letter from veteran journalists against the proposed changes to the Constitution announced days earlier.Bao Tong and the citizen journalist had expressed concerns about the proposed amendments. Bao was against the removal of the 'office term' clause and in a number of Mainland interviews he repeated these sentiments, noting the negative impact long-term Presidents and Vice-Presidents can have, referencing the Cultural Revolution.The National People's Congress and the Chinese People Political Consultative Conference, annual meetings, will be held between March 3 and 20 in Beijing. The National Security Bureau, as is fast becoming the practice, has started censoring all negative messages on social media. On February 2, the Cyberspace Administration of China along with five departments kicked off a new campaign to supress 'so-called gossip' on microblogs and online games. Three microblogs were shut down due to focusing on entertainment gossip.The IFJ Asia Pacific Office said: "Blocking and the flow of information and placing restrictions on people and their right to express their opinion is fast becoming the norm in China. Last year, we tracked an unprecedented number of violations by the Chinese Government in the lead up to the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party, and it appears the Government is starting 2018 much the same. As an accountable and good government, the Chinese Government should be open to feedback and criticism, encouraging the Chinese people to discuss political developments."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6184249 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: February 28, 2018End of Document

Senate Finance Subcommittee Issues Testimony From Alliance for American ManufacturingTargeted News ServiceFebruary 16, 2018 Friday 1:17 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 4572 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Senate Finance subcommittee on International Trade, Customs and Global Competitiveness issued the following testimony by Scott N. Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, at a hearing entitled "Trade Enforcement and Infrastructure: Safeguarding our Industrial Base from Present and Future Challenges":"Senator Casey and members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify on behalf of the Alliance for American Manufacturing (AAM) at today's hearing on Trade Enforcement and Infrastructure: Safeguarding our Industrial Base from Present and Future Challenges."The Alliance for American Manufacturing is a non-profit, non-partisan partnership formed in 2007 by some of America's leading manufacturers and the United Steelworkers. Our mission is to strengthen American manufacturing and create new private-sector jobs through smart public policies. We believe that an innovative and growing manufacturing base is vital to America's economic and national security, as well as to providing good jobs for future generations. AAM achieves its mission through research, public education, advocacy, strategic communications, and coalition building around the issues that matter most to America's manufacturers and workers."Formed in 2007, AAM is proud to have helped call attention to some of the most pressing trade issues impacting American manufacturing companies and their workers - including global industrial overcapacity, dumping and subsidies, state-owned enterprises, currency manipulation, theft of trade secrets, and the need to better negotiate trade agreements. And, with respect to infrastructure, we have been at the forefront of efforts to establish stronger Buy America rules to ensure that our hard-earned tax dollars create jobs here at home.U.S-China Trade Deficit is Unparalleled in its Magnitude and Adverse Impact"Since Beijing's 2001 entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), the U.S. bilateral trade deficit with China has more than quadrupled, from $83 billion in 2001 to a record $375 billion in 2017. In just 15 years, the impact of the surging U.S-China trade deficit on U.S. companies and American workers has been severe and too often overlooked. Our communities have shed more than 54,000 manufacturing facilities and we've seen our global market share in manufactured exports shrink from 14 percent in 2000 to 9 percent in 2013. Altogether, a staggering 3.4 million jobs, largely in manufacturing, have been lost because of this massive trade imbalance. Each state and every congressional district in the United States has experienced lost jobs. In Pennsylvania alone, 136,700 jobs were displaced, accounting for 2.34 percent of the Commonwealth's workforce. And the losses extend into nearly every sector of the economy, ranging from computer and electronic parts to textiles and apparel, furniture, steel, aluminum, and other capital-intensive sectors.i"While the China trade deficit is unparalleled both in its magnitude and its adverse impact on our economy, we should not overlook that unfair trade from many other countries - even including our allies - has taken its toll:- South Korea. It was promised that the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS) would support 70,000 U.S. jobs and increase exports of American goods by $10 to $11 billion. Yet, the U.S. trade deficit with South Korea jumped $15.1 billion between 2011 and 2015 (from $13.2 billion to $28.3 billion), resulting in the estimated elimination of more than 95,000 jobs.ii The trade agreement hailed as a job creator has not opened new markets for U.S. automobiles and other products, as was promised, and demands improvement.- Japan. Meanwhile, it has been estimated that the trade deficit with Japan - fueled by currency practices - is estimated to have eliminated nearly 900,000 U.S. jobs as the goods deficit reached $78.3 billion in 2013.iii It has remained at unacceptable levels ever since.Trade Deficit Reduction Matters"Trade deficits matter and there is compelling research showing that reducing trade deficits would yield positive outcomes for our economy. For instance, a reduction of the U.S. global trade deficit by between $200 billion and $500 billion each year "could increase overall U.S. GDP by between $288 billion and $720 billion and create between 2.3 million and 5.8 million U.S. jobs."iv"To those who have made unfounded claims that the loss of five million U.S. manufacturing jobs, or roughly a third of the total amount, since 2000 was the result of increased productivity, and not trade deficits, the data does not support such a narrative.v According to the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), between 2000 and 2007, 3.6 million manufacturing jobs were lost. Yet, productivity growth declined, falling from 4.1 percent per year in the 1990s to 3.7 percent per year. The drop in the rate of growth of manufacturing output to 0.5 percent per year is largely the result of the rapid growth of the manufacturing trade deficit. Meanwhile, the Great Recession and financial crisis was largely responsible for the decline in manufacturing output and job loss from 2007 to 2014. Manufacturing trade deficits continued to surge over this period following the Great Recession.viProactive Trade Enforcement Approach is Necessary to Eliminate Trade Deficits"For too long, our trade policies haven't been focused on supporting our manufacturing sector but, in many ways, have undermined it. The United States is long overdue for a new approach to trade, especially with China. It is both possible and desirable to create a trade policy framework to support a resurgent, made in America manufacturing base."The United States has considerable economic leverage to shrink our $375 billion 2017 trade deficit with China. U.S. exports to China account for less than a percent of our GDP, our banks hold less than a percent of their assets in China, and multinational companies derive less than two percent of their revenue from there."Using aggressive trade enforcement to strengthen key U.S. sectors is hardly a radical proposition and there is clear precedent in our not too distant past of bold leadership and outside the box thinking. President Ronald Reagan adopted a flurry of measures to address an uneven playing field with European nations and Japan. His administration's aggressive actions helped revitalize our semiconductor industry and the iconic Harley Davidson. The Plaza Accords, which raised the value of currencies in Japan and Europe relative to the dollar, had a positive effect in lowering our trade deficits.It's Time for the White House to Complete Key Trade and Manufacturing Actions"After a year in office, President Trump has repeatedly promised to crack down on unfair trade and negotiate reciprocal trade agreements. Yet, on many key issues, the administration's words have resulted in either inaction or confusion as to the path forward. A status quo approach means continued persistent trade deficits, lost jobs, theft of our innovation base, and the steady erosion of our manufacturing capacity and workforce.* Currency Manipulation. The President repeatedly promised to label China a currency manipulator. However, China was not listed as a currency manipulator on either the Treasury Department's first two Semiannual Reports on International Economic and Exchange Rate Policies.* Section 232. The President initiated Section 232 investigations on steel and aluminum imports' impact on U.S. national security. However, long and unnecessary delays have made matters even worse as imports continue to surge. I will discuss this issue later in my testimony.* Section 301. The President initiated a Section 301 probe into China's intellectual property abuses, though since the August 2017 announcement there has been little movement towards an action that protects American interests.* Pipelines. In January 2017, the President called for a plan to require American pipelines to be constructed with American steel. More than a year later, there has been no action taken as imports of Oil Country Tubular Goods (OCTG) - a key energy product used in oil and gas extraction - were up nearly 200 percent in 2017.Recommended Actions for the Administration and Congress"Outlined below are some of the issues AAM believes need to be addressed for the United States both to expand trade relationships in the Asia-Pacific region in a manner that increases domestic production and to ensure that our markets do not become flooded with unfairly traded products.* Trade Enforcement. America's trade enforcement laws are the backbone of U.S. trade law and represent that last line of defense for workers facing unfair trade. Strict enforcement is vital to the preservation of a rules-based trading system - one in which American workers are not forced to compete against the endless resources of a foreign government that props up its state-run companies. Timely enforcement of U.S. trade remedy laws is vital to leveling the playing field for U.S. companies and American workers impacted by unfair trade practices - like dumping and subsidies. While our trade remedy laws help mitigate the damage, rarely do they restore all the lost jobs or make an impacted community whole again. Significant time and cost - and injury - is required to proceed with a trade enforcement case. In some cases, entire plants must be shut down before relief can be delivered. This makes no sense. We must ensure that timely and effective relief from such market distortions is available before plants are forced to close and workers lose their jobs."We greatly appreciate the leadership and work of this committee in the passage of the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015, which provided new tools to speed trade enforcement and to crack down on evasion of existing trade orders. It is simply unfair to U.S. companies and their workers for trade remedies to be circumvented - resulting in further harm and larger trade deficits.* Global Industrial Overcapacity. Many U.S. industrial sectors are suffering from unprecedented challenges due to global overcapacity - largely fueled by China - which dampens prices and has forced plant closures and massive layoffs. Despite slowing demand in the Chinese market, Beijing continues to maintain high levels of production with subsidies and other state support, undermining U.S. companies that compete based on market considerations. In fact, a recent report shows that, despite China's claims of capacity closures in 2016, its net steelmaking capacity actually increased.vii China will only respond, and America will only benefit, if there are enforceable mechanisms to ensure that Beijing is living up to its commitments. For the past ten years, China has delayed concrete action with lofty promises to cut capacity that never materialize. Despite repeated public pronouncements dating back to 2009 of plans to aggressively cut capacity, China's steelmaking capacity has increased over 400 million metric tons, roughly equivalent to five times the total production of the U.S. steel industry in 2016. The G20 Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity cannot be another tool to be used by the Chinese government to delay meaningful change.* Maintain China's Non-Market Economy Status. No one can seriously claim that Beijing runs a market economy, but the Chinese government desperately wants to be treated that way. Under U.S. law, China is and should continue to be treated as a non-market economy (NME). Any change to this status would severely undermine America's trade remedy laws and expose U.S. companies and American workers to more dumped imports. Such changes can only be made if China meets six specific criteria demonstrating that market forces, and not the government's party leadership, are directing the economy. Presently, China fails to meet the six criteria and it should focus on reforms rather than its attempts to shortcut this issue by way of the World Trade Organization (WTO).* Cyber Theft. It is critical that the government provide support when foreign interests steal trade secrets to manufacture products abroad and send them to the United States. Theft of intellectual property and trade secrets has been a serious problem with China. U.S. companies report that Chinese interests have not only stolen sensitive trade secrets, but that Chinese firms are now commercializing that valuable intellectual property into Chinese products. It is outrageous that U.S. companies are being forced to compete against the very products that they spent years and significant financial resources to develop. If the available trade enforcement tools - including Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 - do not work as intended, Congress should improve them so that our companies are not subjected to dishonest and criminal activity without the opportunity to seek effective and timely relief. And, the President should swiftly complete his Section 301 investigation and take meaningful action to defend domestic companies against foreign theft of intellectual property and technology transfer.* State-Owned Companies. China has many state-owned and state-directed enterprises (SOEs) that send dumped and subsidized goods into the U.S. market. In a disturbing trend, China's SOEs are also now aggressively seeking to invest here in America, putting further strain on U.S. firms that make decisions based on market forces. It is vital that we strengthen our CFIUS system of reviewing foreign acquisitions of strategic U.S. companies and operations so that they do not fall under the control of the Chinese government.* Currency Manipulation. China, Japan, South Korea, and other major trading partners have a long history of currency manipulation, which contributed to the loss of five million U.S. jobs.viii Despite claims that the yuan is no longer undervalued, there is ample evidence that Beijing continues to play an active, daily role in setting exchange rates. We urge the passage of legislation to treat foreign currency manipulation as a subsidy under trade remedy laws. And, we support the inclusion of strong, enforceable rules in trade agreements to deter and penalize currency manipulation. We will also be closely watching as the administration prepares to release yet another Semiannual Report on International Economic and Exchange Rate Policies, due by April 15th.* Automobiles and Rules of Origin in Trade Agreements. A trade agreement's rules of origin determine the national source of a product. This is important because only those countries bearing the risks and responsibilities of signing an agreement should obtain its benefits. We believe the rule of origin on automobiles in NAFTA and other trade agreements should be strengthened, so that workers in signatory countries can enjoy more of the benefits, while minimizing the advantages of non-participating countries. In the context of the NAFTA negotiations, automobiles and auto parts from countries such as Japan, South Korea, and China, all of which heavily protect their own industries, should not be permitted to displace North American production through rules of origin that are set too low. As it relates to KORUS, more work must be done to open the Korean market - one of the most difficult for our automakers to export into despite the signing of a trade agreement intended to open the market.It's Time to Act on the Section 232 Investigation"Last, but certainly not least, I want to focus your attention to the pending Section 232 investigations on the impact of steel and aluminum imports on U.S. national security. In April 2017, President Trump directed the Department of Commerce to complete these self-initiated investigations under an expedited timeline, saying, "Maintaining the production of American steel is extremely important to our national security and our defense industrial base. Steel is critical to both our economy and our military. This is not an area where we can afford to become dependent on foreign countries." In late-May 2017, the administration said the reports would be released in June and, just days later, the President himself publicly said the 232 reports would be coming "very soon" and that "we're going to stop the dumping." In early June, President Trump added, "Wait until you see what I'm going to do for steel and for your steel companies...We're going to stop the dumping, and stop all of these wonderful other countries from coming in and killing our companies and our workers. You'll be seeing that very soon. The steel folks are going to be very happy.""Despite those assurances, months passed without a clear understanding of when the investigations would be completed. American workers were told that the administration needed to complete tax reform and other legislative priorities before it could again focus on the Section 232 investigations. All the while, the import problem has been worsening for American workers and U.S. companies. Steel imports soared 21 percent in the 3 months after President Trump announced the Section 232 investigation compared to the 3 months before. Overall, total steel imports were up 15.4% in 2017.ix"We recently received the painful news that several steel mills in Pennsylvania would be reducing operations, including one that produces armor plate for the U.S. military and played an important role in supporting the production of armored vehicles to protect our service men and women from IED attacks in Iraq and Afghanistan.x Meanwhile, the United States is now down to a single manufacturer of the steel needed for America's essential electric grid - grain-oriented electrical steel (GOES). Unfortunately, there are no shortage of threats - both natural and manmade - that could damage or destroy this critical infrastructure. Already reduced to just one domestic producer of GOES, electrical steel imports increased by 101 percent in 2017. But, it's not just a China problem. Electrical steel imports from Japan, China, and South Korea are up a staggering 156 to 269 percent. Without broad action to prevent the loss of this domestic production capability, the United States would be entirely dependent upon foreign suppliers."Our national security rests on a healthy industrial base. Domestic production of steel and aluminum are vital in the manufacture of America's military and critical infrastructure, including everything from ships and tanks to bridges and energy infrastructure. If domestic manufacturing capabilities deteriorate further, we may be forced to rely on countries like China and Russia to supply steel for our military and critical infrastructure needs. We cannot let that happen."The President now has up to 90 days to determine what precise action to take. But, there's absolutely no reason to take that long. He should take bold action today to protect our national security and American jobs.American-Made Infrastructure Investment"Federal investment in infrastructure is critical to a well-functioning economy and our national competitiveness. U.S. manufacturers benefit from infrastructure investments not just because they generate new demand for steel, but also because an efficient infrastructure network improves their ability to bring goods to market. We desperately need to identify solutions to the funding challenges that stand in the way of addressing the backlog of repairs to our nation's highways, water systems, and other critical infrastructure. According to a Duke University report entitled Infrastructure Investment Creates American Jobs, America has 156,000 deficient bridges, an investment backlog of $85.9 billion for our nation's roads, and $200 billion in lost economic activity annually from inefficient rail transportation."Too often the focus of infrastructure has been on "shovel ready" projects, which unfortunately has meant that larger projects that are essential to our steel sector have not moved forward. A prime example is the Soo Locks system that allows ships to move between Lake Superior and the rest of the Great Lakes. The larger of the two locks, the Poe Lock, is nearly 50 years old and the only lock that can accommodate larger vessels that make up almost 70 percent of the potential capacity of the Great Lakes fleet. A recent report by the Department of Homeland Security found that if the Poe lock were to shut down for 6 months, the nation would experience economic hardship as mines and steel mills experience supply chain disruptions, causing a ripple effect throughout the manufacturing sector that could impact as many as 11 million workers. Depending on when such a failure occurred, as much as 75 percent of U.S. steel output could go offline in a matter of weeks. Building a second Poe-sized lock would cost $580 million, but would spur $1.7 billion in economic activity.Strong Buy America Policies Create Jobs Here at Home"Buy America policies are procurement preferences for iron, steel, and manufactured goods that are "produced in the United States." These preferences apply to federal infrastructure programs, ensuring that U.S. companies and American workers have the first opportunity to supply the materials used to build our highways, rail, airports, water systems, and other critical infrastructure. Strong Buy America laws maximize the return on the nation's investment in our infrastructure and are consistent with our international obligations."I want to offer several recommendations as Congress moves closer to a debate on infrastructure:* Include Buy America in the infrastructure package. As Congress looks to funding solutions, it is necessary to ensure that new funding mechanisms - including public-private partnerships or other new innovative financing tools - are covered with strong Buy America rules. Despite his frequent campaign rhetoric on the issue, we were disappointed to see that President Trump's recently released infrastructure plan made no mention of Buy America. In fact, it goes in the completely opposite direction, proposing to weaken existing application resulting in tax dollars going overseas to purchase foreign steel for our infrastructure needs.* Apply Buy America where it doesn't exist. There are many infrastructure spending programs that are not covered by a Buy America preference. We support a top-to-bottom review of all infrastructure spending programs and enacting Buy America laws where they are absent. An example of this is the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF), which is covered by a temporary Buy America provision. Without action to make this provision permanent, our nation's drinking water infrastructure investments will be open to steel and iron from China and other countries. We cannot let this happen.* Close loopholes and improve existing laws. We should also work to close loopholes, strengthen weak agency enforcement, and reduce the number of unnecessary waivers granted. Bipartisan support in recent transportation bills resulted in language to prevent project segmentation and increase transparency of the waiver process.* Reject efforts to weaken Buy America by supporting the 'Melted and Poured' standard. For 35 years, the foundation of our Buy America laws has been the requirement that all steel manufacturing processes occur in the United States for a product to be Buy America compliant - from the actual steel production to the finishing processes. Regrettably, a few companies whose business model focuses on importing foreign steel are aggressively lobbying to create a massive Buy America loophole that would allow steel from Russia, China, or other foreign sources to qualify as "produced in the United States." This massive outsourcing loophole should be rejected outright. Steel is made here only if it is melted here.No More Outsourced Infrastructure Projects"I want to highlight several high-profile infrastructure projects that have found ways to evade federal Buy America laws. In each case, public resources bypassed U.S. companies and American workers and, instead, supported jobs in China and other foreign countries.* San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. Completed in 2013, California state officials used clever accounting gimmicks to bypass federal Buy America laws for the construction of the Bay Bridge. They thought that using Chinese steel would net them $400 million in savings to the overall project. Rather, the project was plagued with quality issues and cost overruns, all while thousands of jobs were created in China instead of here in the United States. The project was a decade behind schedule and nearly $4 billion over budget.* Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. In 2013, New York state officials decided to source 15,000 tons of steel, including the fabrication work, from China for the bridge deck replacement at the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. In shocking fashion, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) awarded the contract to a Chinese state-owned company that had never done such work. MTA used a very specific fabrication design, called orthotropic decking, and used it as an excuse to bypass U.S. companies and workers ready to rebuild the bridge.* LaGuardia Airport. Early last year, it was reported that Chinese and other foreign-origin steel is being used in the $4 billion LaGuardia Airport renovation. While the project does not appear to be covered by a federal Buy America law, it is notable that the Port Authority of NY and NJ has received $76 million in federal FAA grants for improvements at LaGuardia in just the last 10 years. These funds require U.S.-melted steel to be used. And, the Port Authority will finance the LaGuardia project with $1 billion in Passenger Facility Charges (PFCs).Conclusion"Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. We look forward to working with you to advance policies that will revitalize America's manufacturing sector - a major economic driver, foundation of U.S. national security, and source for millions of family-sustaining jobs. Together, we can Keep It Made in America.* * *Footnotes:i Scott, Robert E. "Growth in U.S.-China trade deficit between 2001 and 2015 cost 3.4 million jobs."

Venture Videgaray-Chinese agreementCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 8, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 553 wordsBody       MEXICO.- Luis Videgaray, Secretary of Foreign Affairs, led a high-level group that worked with representatives of the Government of China on the Mexico-Queretaro High-Speed ??Train project, and published the Aristegui Noticias portal. The main objective of the group led by the former head of the Ministry of Finance was to carry out that work, according to the "Notice of intention to initiate an investment arbitration against the Government of Mexico", presented by the Chinese consortium before the Ministry of Economy. on October 9, 2015. The portal states that 10 days before the launch of the contest, Videgaray received Chinese officials at a National Palace for a meeting that aimed, among others, to analyze strategic alliances between companies from both countries. On November 3, 2014, the Chinese government won the tender to carry out the project in conjunction with the Mexican Constructora and Edificaciónra GIA, Prodemex, GHP Infraestructura Mexicana and Constructora Teya. On November 9 of that same year, Aristegui Noticias revealed that Enrique Peña Nieto lived in a house owned by Juan Armando Hinojosa Cantú, owner of Constructora Teya. Two days later, The Wall Street Journal published that Luis Videgaray bought a house to Hinojosa in Malinalco, State of Mexico, with a value of 7.5 million pesos. These newspaper reports gave rise to a corruption scandal that was allegedly investigated by Virgilio Andrade, who was named head of the Public Function Secretariat (SFP) on February 3, 2015. Videgaray was exonerated from a conflict of interest because he did not intervene in no stage of the hiring process, so it could not be imputed a lack of impartiality or partial attitude in favor of someone, according to the file of the Ministry of Public Administration. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said yesterday that it is false that Videgaray directed the proposal of the Mexico-Querétaro train to China. "We declare conclusively that this is totally false and unfounded information, since the note is based on the participation of Dr. Luis Videgaray, as Secretary of Finance and Public Credit, in a single widely publicized work meeting," he said. the dependence. Through a letter, he mentioned that three Secretaries of State, general directors of parastatal entities and development banks also participated in the session, and that a presentation was made to the Chinese counterpart of the major infrastructure projects, as well as of various financial vehicles to attract investment to Mexico. The Secretariat reported that in September 2013 a memorandum of understanding was signed to create a high-level investment group between the Governments of China and Mexico, which aimed to strengthen cooperation for investment in various sectors such as finance. , infrastructure, energy, mining, manufacturing, high technology and tourism, among others. Braking project The construction of the Mexico-Querétaro High Speed ??Train had to start in December 2014, but the tender was canceled on November 6 of that same year. $ 58.88 billion was the amount of the canceled contract. 300 kilometers was the maximum speed planned. 22,000 passengers a day would have transported the rail system. 85% of the construction of the project would be financed by the Chinese government.

Welcome back -- everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Monday, March 5th.Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.Tackling trade as the world reacts to President Trump's tough talk on trade. Administration officials are fighting back.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross addressed the criticism with me on Sunday on "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES".(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WILBUR ROSS, U.S. SECRETARY OF COMMERCE: Europe has announced some retaliations and it's on some $3 billion worth of product -- that's a tiny fraction of 1 percent. So while it may be painful for those particular companies, in the overall scheme of things, it doesn't mean very much of anything.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The trade debate rattling U.S. investors last week, driving stocks lower for the week. The Dow closed in the red for the fourth day in a row on Friday. That is its longest losing streak in about five months. Dow Industrials down 71, a quarter of a percent.This morning futures indicate we will see the selling continue. Take a look, Dow Industrials right now down about 60 points. That's one quarter of 1 percent. S&P 500 also negative down, 7 points, a quarter of a percent there. But the Nasdaq is up although here too we're off of the highest levels of the morning. Nasdaq up just about 4 points right now.Checking European indices, markets are higher. AS you can see, you've got elections there. Investors are watching the elections in Italy, in Germany. Initial results in Italy have yet to show a clear winner. But the populist party looks to have gained significant ground.In Germany, Angela Merkel secured her fourth term as German chancellor. The German DAX index is up one-half of 1 percent, 65 points higher.In Asia overnight stocks are mostly lower; tough session in Hong Kong. The Chinese government laid out plans for economic growth setting their economic growth target at, get this, 6.5 percent for 2018. The Shanghai composite was up a fraction but the Hong Kong Hang Seng down 2.25 percent.We have breaking news right now -- another hurdle in the Qualcomm-Broadcom deal. The U.S. government is ordering Qualcomm to delay its shareholder meeting this week. The meeting was slated for this week but the government is saying we want time to review this deal. We're going to delay that and demanding that they delay the shareholder meeting. Qualcomm shares right now as a result, down two and two-thirds percent.The immigration outrage -- the illegal immigrant pleads guilty to stealing the identity of a U.S. citizen for 37 years. The details as he received over $360,000 in benefits from the U.S. government as he may believe he was a citizen after stealing someone's identity.United Airlines grounds quarterly bonuses. Get this, the details as the airlines plan to introduce now a lottery. Get the turbulent reaction from employees.Plus, YouTube makes a scene. The new feature that lets users change their background without a green screen.All those stories coming up this morning and joining me to talk all about it: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; "The Wall Street Journal's" global economics editor Jon Hilsenrath; and pollster and president of Maslansky and Partners Lee Carter.Great to see you.LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS: Great to be here.BARTIROMO: Happy Monday.CARTER: Happy Monday.JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL": Great Monday, we're still here.BARTIROMO: We get this breaking news right now that's just breaking. And that is that there's another hurdle in the Qualcomm-Broadcom deal -- the U.S. government ordering Qualcomm to delay its shareholder meeting this week. The government banks the decision in order to have more time to review the proposed offer. Qualcomm shares are trading down on the news, down two and two-thirds percent.Now Jon -- we know that the move represents an unusual intervention by Washington. It's going to delay Broadcom's proxy fight for control of Qualcomm's board. Qualcomm's board was set to vote on whether to replace six of its directors with nominees put forward by Broadcom shown (ph) in the "Journal" today about just that.HILSENRATH: Right. So the shareholder vote was supposed to happen tomorrow. And now the government is stepping in and saying hold off. This is a huge deal. The future of 5G technology is on the line -- $117 billion.What was going to happen is Broadcom wants to seat six directors on Qualcomm's board. If they get those six directors, the likelihood of that deal going through increases significantly. But, you know, there are antitrust issues that the government wants to take a look at.Yes. And Broadcom says that it learned of Qualcomm's request last night, that Qualcomm had not disclosed its request in its interactions with Qualcomm at all. We'll see what happens here.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST: Are you surprised by the government intervention in this?HILSENRATH: I'm not very surprised because you know, again with this administration, it doesn't -- you know, usually you would think Republicans are kind of open to deal-making, free markets, mergers and acquisitions. But this is a president who cuts across the grain as we've seen on trade on many issues. And he has spoken out against other big deals and concentration of power in certain markets. And this is what they're looking at here.BARTIROMO: You've got to look at CFIUS, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States because they are reviewing the merger. Qualcomm is based in San Diego. It has, so far, spurned Broadcom which is Singapore based.This is $117 billion take over offer. It's forced Broadcom to go hostile in its pursuit. Now CFIUS, that is the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., reviewing the merger. The secretive committee headed by the Treasury Department includes officials from the Justice, Defense, Homeland Security and Energy Departments reviewing foreign acquisitions of U.S. assets on national security grounds.That is why they are asking for the shareholder meeting to be delayed. So CFIUS has reviewed this.HILSENRATH: And again cutting edge American technology is on the line. And this group CFIUS is very concerned about China and Chinese authorities getting their hands on cutting edge U.S. technology. So you have to think that that's part of the problem.BARTIROMO: Makes sense.And then there is a trade, the tariff turmoil. British Prime Minister Theresa May spoke with President Trump this weekend to express her concern with the new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports into the United States; the plan coming under sharp criticism and threats of retaliation.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross joined me this weekend. He fought back against all of that threat.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ROSS: I'm sure that there will be some kind of retaliations from somebody. You've already seen the announcement from Europe.I don't think the retaliation is likely to be on steel as such. I think if it is on anything, it will be some little product in a key state to try to get Mitch McConnell or Paul Ryan feeling some pressure. I think it will be very targeted.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: A lot of pushback on this issue.Joining us now to talk about it, the director of the Heritage Foundation's Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom and former foreign policy advisor under Margaret Thatcher, Nile Gardiner. Nile -- good to see you, thanks so much for joining the conversation.NILE GARDINER, HERITAGE FOUNDATION: Great to see you -- Maria. Thanks very much for having me on the show.BARTIROMO: Your take on these tariffs. I mean this is so much pushback from Republicans within his own party to global CEOs. Even, you know, as Dagen mentioned earlier, some of the very people who have helped him on other economic policies like a Steve Moore and Larry Kudlow. Your take.GARDINER: Yes, I think these tariffs are an absolute disaster for the United States. It will start a trade war with Europe and other parts of the world. And I think that this is completely the wrong track for the White House to be taking. I think ultimately these tariffs will cost a lot of American jobs.It's also going to be a deep-felt (INAUDIBLE), of course, for the stock markets. I think there's going to be a political impact as well. It's going to result in a major confrontation between the United States and key allies including Great Britain, also Canada as well.And it's also going to be used as an excuse by European Union protectionists implement more tariff barriers in Europe. And I think that -- this is going to be ultimately very, very bad news actually for the United States.I do hope the White House is going to back track here and reverse gear and move away from what would be I think an extremely dangerous move for this administration to take.MCDOWELL: Nile -- I just -- I will ask you a question that has been posed on Twitter to all of us in the last several days. How does this administration take care of the trade deficit? How do we make sure that we as a nation are operating on a fair playing field with all of our trading partners?GARDINER: Well, that's a very good question. Certainly I think that there is room for improvement with regard to the NAFTA agreement towards a modernization but also removing some of the labor regulations, environmental regulations. I think ultimately the American -- the United States' strength actually on the world stage is really as a great free trading nation.So the greater the level of economic freedom, the greater the level of economic liberty on the part of the United States, I think the better the deal is actually for U.S. workers and for U.S. consumers. But if the United States is to retreat into some kind of protectionism I think that is going to have an extremely negative impact upon the U.S. economy overall.And as my old boss Margaret Thatcher used to say, you know, free trade is really the vital engine of economic prosperity and she greatly believes in economic freedom. And America is most prosperous if it advances and protects the principles of economic liberty.BARTIROMO: Yes, I understand that but he is saying he is for free trade. He is just for fair trade first. I mean the question which Dagen poses is what the administration will come back at you and the proponents of this plan who say, look, the U.S. has been on the losing end of so many of these deals. What is the U.S. to do?Is it ok for India to pay -- to charge 100 percent tariff on Harley Davidson motorcycles? Is it ok, in the auto sector that Europeans have 10 percent tariff while the U.S. has 2.5 percent? I mean these tariff troubles are weighing even on the NAFTA talks right now. They're set to wrap up today.Secretary Ross weighed waiting on that trade relationship as well. Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ROSS: The President has made quite clear that if it comes to a dumb deal or no deal, he is very likely to opt for no deal. He doesn't need to take a terrible deal. That terrible deal is how we got here.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: And then the President tweeted this on NAFTA just a few minutes ago, Nile. He says, "We have large trade deficits with Mexico and Canada. NAFTA which is under renegotiation right now has been a bad deal for U.S.A. Massive relocation of companies and jobs, tariffs on steel and aluminum it will only come off if new and fair NAFTA agreements are signed.Also Canada must treat our farmers much better, highly restrictive. Mexico must do much more on stopping drugs from pouring into the U.S. They have not done what needs to be done. Millions of people addicted and dying."So Nile -- you know, this is the first time I've heard the President even open the door to an exemption on Canada and Mexico. He said these tariffs will not go away unless in that tweet. It seems like he's starting to open a door if they make changes, then maybe they are exempted from these tariffs. Your take.GARDINER: Well, certainly I think we've seen some shift in the President's position just this morning and that's a positive sign. But I think the overall approach, the idea, the very idea that you are going to an protect American workers or advance U.S. economy by implementing protectionist big government policies I think is very, very reckless.And what the President has done over the past 12 months is put forward free market solutions which have greatly advance I think the U.S. economy basically repealing large numbers of regulations, cutting taxes. This is the way forward.Certainly there is a lot of protectionism across the world. But the answer is not for the United States to go down the same route of protectionism. I do believe that if the President adapts, for example, European Union style protectionist policies, this is going to have very, very negative impact for the United States.And so the answer is not more protectionism on the world stage. It's more free trade. It's great for national --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: So what's the answer?GARDINER: -- competitiveness.BARTIROMO: But you're not answering the question. Do you have a solution to the U.S. being disadvantaged? All these deals?GARDINER: Well, I think, you know, the long-term solution of course, is greater competitiveness on the part of the U.S. economy. I believe the President is making a lot of the economic reforms that are necessary that will advance economic freedom in the United States that will improve America's position on the world stage in terms of trade.And eventually I think other countries across the world who implement protectionist policies will, you know, begin I think to reduce those protectionist barriers. But the United States must lead and be the shining city on the hill in terms of --BARTIROMO: Right.GARDINER: -- standing up for free trade. And that's the best way forwardBARTIROMO: Here's Lee Carter.CARTER: Yes. One of my questions as I watched the President with all of this is often he lobs these things out there, se starts the conversation and things change. Do you think this is one of his strategies where he's just putting something out there, letting everybody debate it and hoping that people are going to ask and bring different solutions to the table?GARDINER: I think that's -- you know, that's quite possible here. And you are seeing the President starting to soften his position a little bit today but I think that certainly there are some in the White House who believe that, you know, protectionist policies are the way forward. There are others who believe that these policies are very reckless.I do hope the huge backlash that we've seen, not only here in the United States but also across the world --BARTIROMO: Yes.GARDINER: -- is going to really, you know, support the position of those within the administration who are absolute supporters of free trade. So I think that's everything to play for.BARTIROMO: Nile -- before you go -- before you go, real quick. Your thoughts on the election in Italy and Germany.GARDINER: Yes. Yes. This is a huge development. You've seen the anti- establishment parties pulling in over 50 percent of the vote.BARTIROMO: Wow.GARDINER: This is a massive game changer in Italy, has big implications for the future of the Euro and the European single currency.BARTIROMO: All right. Nile Gardiner -- good to see you. Thank you. We will be right back.BARTIROMO: Ok. Now there is this -- an illegal immigrant stealing a U.S. citizen's identity and more than $300,000 in taxpayer money. It's an incredible story.Lauren Simonetti has the details. And what is incredible is how long it has gone on.LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Thirty-seven years and $361,000 in benefits stolen. So Andres Anduaga admitted in federal court last week he assumed the fake identity of a Texas resident back in 1980 after obtaining a fraudulent birth certificate. That enabled him to successfully apply for a California driver's license, Social Security number and passport.If you look at the years 1989 to 2016, he received around $361,000 in benefits including food stamps and supplemental security income benefits. So he did agree to pay back that money but also faces up to 12 years behind bars. Plus, that's a lot of money to pay back.Meanwhile, the sweep in northern California by federal immigration officials last week caught a number of illegal immigrants convicted of serious crimes. So Immigrations and Customs Enforcement say the four-day raid, it led to the arrest of 232 illegal immigrants in the San Francisco Bay area and many of them with criminal records. This despite the mayor of Oakland warning of the impending raid.Well, Amazon is reportedly in talks with the big banks about building a checking account product. So "The Wall Street Journal" is reporting that the effort is still in the early stages. They talked to a financial firm to focus on creating a product that would appeal to younger consumers and also those without bank accounts who might be familiar with Amazon. Taking a look at shares of Amazon at $1,500 a pop.All right. Check this out. Google is using artificial intelligence to give selfie videos different backgrounds, making the background changes seem just as easy as adding like an Instagram filter to something. The system can swap out backgrounds fast enough to keep up with the video. Right now this is only available to a few of the high-profile YouTube users. But that just makes their job even easier, right, to get content out there that looks good. Shares of Google parent Alphabet are up 25 percent from a year ago.BARTIROMO: All right. Fun stuff. Thank you -- Lauren.SIMONETTI: Sure.BARTIROMO: Coming up, trading blows -- corporate America's response to President Trump's tariff plan. We're going to tell you what the response is from corporate America.And then thinking outside the box -- why Porsche says flying cars are the wave of the future, next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Businesses are reacting to President Trump's pledge on tariffs. Some companies are concerned the plan to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports could result in price increases, shortages or even retaliatory trade barriers on American exports, according to "The Wall Street Journal".Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross addressed those fears during our interview on "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES" yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ROSS: The impact on a can of beer will be a fraction of 1 percent. Beer sells for over a dollar a can. Impact on Bumblebee tuna packages, again trivial.So it isn't the important fact that there are more people working in steel consuming industries than in steel-producing. The important fact is how trivial these amounts are relative to their business.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: And of course, Wilbur Ross was a former CEO of a steel company.Joining us right now is Fat Brands International chairman, former CEO of McDonald's U.S.A. and former CEO of Famous Dave's Barbecue, Ed Rensi joining the conversation. Ed -- good to see you.ED RENSI, CHAIRMAN, FAT BRANDS INTERNATIONAL: Good morning -- glad to be here.BARTIROMO: Your take on this. Well, you know, I look at what President Trump's doing and he's been talking about this ever since he started running for office. He believes our trade deals are unfair.And I think this is much a political statement as it is an economic statement. He is firing a shot across the bow of China telling them to get their dumping under control and to behave themselves and understand that we want fair trade deals. This is going to trickle down. It's going to impact every business in the United States a one way or the other over time.Hopefully it will rationalize, it will settle down, you know, the implications for small businesses like the restaurant industry is all about steel for equipment, steel for construction, aluminum packaging and things of that nature.It will probably be a year to 18 months before we really see a significant effect. Hopefully we can get some of these agreements straightened out.But Trump is not to be messed with. He's not a politician. He is looking out for America and America's workers. And when he says I want to make America great again, he means it.BARTIROMO: It sounds like you're not worried about the impact and you agree with what the notion that you said earlier, Lee Carter, that it's a little of playing poker here. And this is more about telling China "Get in line and change your practices because we mean business than anything else."RENSI: I think that's absolutely correct. I've traveled around the world quite a bit and I've been all over Europe and Asia and believe me their economies are in a lot worse shape than we're in.We are a big consumer of goods in this country and it needs to be done in a way that is fair to our workers and our consumers. And China has got a dumping attitude, you know. They are producing steel and aluminum like crazy and they're just dumping in the United States. That's my words, not the government's.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: If and when China makes a change -- it China does make a change on this stuff, Dagen -- then it would have been worth it.MCDOWELL: Maybe. It's not just China it's every nation that we trade with. And the way that we manufacture in the world is so exceedingly complicated. It's not a zero-sum game, if you will.But Ed, I want to raise an issue. As a former CEO of McDonald's if this is done say 25 percent steel tariff, 10 percent aluminum tariff. And it doesn't happen, would you have ever as the CEO of McDonald's told your customers 25 percent price increase on everything that we sell. Oh, I don't really mean that, I'm just testing the waters.Like if you're a CEO and he's -- President Trump is the CEO of the United States. That is what doesn't make sense to people if he's not going to step up and do it and do it the way it was explained in the last three or four days.RENSI: Well, you know, he is not a politician. He is what he is. And he is bold and he's inarticulate in a lot of ways when he does these things.But free markets have to prevail ultimately. And that's what we should be shooting for.MCDOWELL: No, but Ed -- my point is a CEO would never do this.RENSI: Everybody needs to win -- everybody needs to win --MCDOWELL: My point is a CEO would never actually do that. You say he's not a politician. If he's the CEO, a CEO would never test the waters with such a dramatic proclamation that they are trying to use as negotiating tactics.RENSI: Well, you know, I would have to agree with you about that. But he is what he is. And it's what we've got to live with and I'm not --CARTER: I would argue though --(CROSSTALK)RENSI: -- with what he does sometimes.HILSENRATH: Wilbur Ross says this is a trivial. That this isn't going to have a big effect on the cost of the soup can or eating out --BARTIROMO: Tuna fish.HILSENRATH: Do you think it's trivial.RENSI: Well, I -- I don't think it's trivial at all. It may be trivial when you get down to a beer can but we are talking about fate of nations, we're talking about free trade. We're talking about strategic direction.And strategically I wonder why he's doing what he's doing. Tactically it may make some sense in the short term. But, you know, it rocked the world. Everybody's talking about it. Everybody's looking to find out what the answers are going to be. And it's not going to be easy.CARTER: You know, Ed -- I don't know if you saw the President's tweet that he just put out where he said, "It looked like he was a shifting a little bit his position, saying that he's going to put this on NASA. I don't know if you saw that but that's for me, is also another indication that he is in fact using this as a negotiating strategy.RENSI: I think that's exactly right. It may not be the best strategy, but it's what he's using. And he's fired a shot across everybody's bow. And the world's reacting right now. You hear every leader of the every country, talking about how unfair this is. Ok -- then get together and start talking about what is fair.BARTIROMO: So give us the practicality of this -- Ed. You were running McDonald's USA. You see steel tariffs on aluminum of 10 percent, on steel of 25 percent. Let's say hypothetically you're still running McDonald's. What are you going to do? How much are you going to raise prices -- 10 percent and 25 percent?RENSI: Well, for every penny of increase in cost we are 1 percent increase in cost, you have to raise your menu board prices about 3 percent or three times. So it does have an impact.But we are talking about -- we're talking about small matters when you're talking about a small business. When you're talking about the fate of the nation, the direction of the nation, that's a far more strategic matter and one that has to be managed very, very, carefully.And Trump can be grossly inarticulate at times. I really wonder what's really going on, why they're really doing what they're doing because this isn't about six-tenths of a cent on a can of soup -BARTIROMO: Yes.RENSI: - this is a much larger issue.BARTIROMO: So, for every one percent increase in the cost of the manufactured good you've got to raise prices by three percent?That's what you just said?Ed Rensi?OK!RENSI: Yes. Yes, I'm here.BARTIROMO: Yes. So, you just said for every increase of -RENSI: I -BARTIROMO: - one percent on the manufactured good you raise prices likely by three percent at cash register?RENSI: - Well when we look -BARTIROMO: Yes.RENSI: - when you look at the P&L of a typical restaurant you know, it's only about a - eight to 10 percent margin and anytime a price goes up a penny you're going to have to raise the menu board three cents to offset it, it's just -BARTIROMO: OK.RENSI: - that's simple.BARTIROMO: All right. Well, we will leave it there.Ed, we'll be watching. This is an important story, we hope you'll come back and talk more about it.Ed Rensi, good to see you sir?We'll take a break.When we come back the feud over the FISA court, why South Carolina congressman, Trey Gowdy said, `it is time for a second special counsel.'Then Walmart cooking up something new, the retail giant's new plan to fend off competition from meal delivery services, like Blue Apron.Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Monday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us this morning.I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Monday, March 5th; your top stories right now, 7:30 a.m. on the East Coast.Markets are under pressure again, Futures indicating the selloff continues this morning, at the opening of trading Dow Industrials down 75 points right now, one third of one percent; NASDAQ; S&P 500, also weaker.This after Friday's decline, the Dow was down 70 points on Friday, that was well off of the lows by the way, at one point the market had been down 400 points. NASDAQ and S&P are now firmly in positive territory this morning, we are seeing a bit of a change and some buying going on right now; a little bit of a - uptake (ph) on the upside.In Europe markets are higher across-the-board reacting to votes in Germany and Italy. No clear winner emerging in Italy just yet and Angela Merkel has secured her fourth term as German Chancellor.In Asia overnight mixed performances, take a look, as you can see Hong Kong worst performer, Hang Seng Index down 2 1/4 percent.Fury over FISA, Congressman Trey Gowdy raising the possibility on SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES this weekend of needing a second special counsel to investigate the abuse of power at the top of the FBI and the Justice Department, watch?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. TREY GOWDY (R-SC), CHAIRPERSON, HOUSE OVERSIGHT AND GOVERNMENT REFORM COMMITTEE; MEMBER, INTELLIGENCE & JUDICIARY COMMITTEES: Congress has proven itself incapable of investigating this FISA abuse. DOJ should not be looking into it. We need an independent arbiter that's either the inspector general or special counsel.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: A closer look at that coming up this morning.And a first for Walmart, the retailer and the country's biggest grocer will reportedly now offer prepared meals, what that means for the rest of the industry.Porsche, `eying the sky,' the automaker wants to make a flying car.And then there's this, the supercalifragilisticexpialidocious return of "Mary Poppins," the first trailer -UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yeah (INAUDIBLE).BARTIROMO: - from the upcoming sequel is out.Yeah!I said it!All right!All that coming up this morning.But first our TOP STORIES this half an hour, the growing fight over the FISA court, the controversy over Obama era abuses in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has Congressman Trey Gowdy now pointing to a need for a second special counsel to investigate it.The South Carolina lawmaker told me on SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES yesterday that the lowercase inspector general may not cut it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. TREY GOWDY (R-SC), CHAIRPERSON, HOUSE OVERSIGHT AND GOVERNMENT REFORM COMMITTEE; MEMBER, INTELLIGENCE & JUDICIARY COMMITTEES: I don't think the Inspector General himself can answer all of our questions.Some of these witnesses have already left the Department which means the Inspector General does not have jurisdiction and there are other agencies like the State Department where Michael Horowitz, the DOJ has no jurisdiction whatsoever.Maria, over the weekend I've counted up almost two dozen witnesses that the inspector general would not have access to, were he alone conducting this investigation.So, I think we're trending perhaps towards another special counsel.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is FOX NEWS Senior Judicial Analyst, George Andrew NAPOLITANO:Judge, good to see you?JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Hello. Good morning.BARTIROMO: Do you agree with this?NAPOLITANO: Well, I personally agree and I personally disagree so I'll - I'll explain to you.Special counsels are dangerous. They are just free-standing agents who indict people to justify their existence.We're going to talk in a few minutes about somebody we never heard of before and whether the United Arab Emirates was involved in the Trump -BARTIROMO: Yes.NAPOLITANO: - (INAUDIBLE) -BARTIROMO: They can go anywhere -NAPOLITANO: - They -BARTIROMO: - a special counsel?NAPOLITANO: - they can go anywhere and they do go anywhere from Lawrence Walsh to Bob Mueller.I happen to believe Bob Mueller is an honest guy but I also believe there is a great temptation, you know, Joe Stalin once said, "Show Me the Man and I'll Show You the Crime," to keep digging, digging, digging, digging -BARTIROMO: Yes.NAPOLITANO: - digging, digging, until they can find one of the 4,400 federal criminal acts (ph) that's been violated.Having said that, some of what Congressman Gowdy said is very telling (ph).BARTIROMO: How do they investigate -NAPOLITANO: Think -BARTIROMO: - themselves?NAPOLITANO: - think of the inspector general as internal affairs in a police department; a police department within a police department to look at the other cops.So, the inspector general is a mini DOJ, in the DOJ to examine the rest of the DOJ to make sure they are abiding by the law.How many employees are there in the DOJ?"Ninety thousand."There's a couple of dozen that work for the inspector general.When they leave the DOJ, he no longer has authority over them. He can't subpoena them and he can question them.And the principal person that he has to question will be on retirement as of the end of this week or early next week and that's Andrew McCabe.BARTIROMO: Right, right.NAPOLITANO: Having said that, who chooses the special counsel?Well if Jeff Sessions has recused on all things Russian and FISA was related ostensibly on its face the - to the Russians because Carter Page said, "I'm working for the Kremlin while I'm working for Donald Trump."The decision was made by Rod Rosenstein.There are four FISA applications, three in the Obama administration approved by Jim Comey -BARTIROMO: Hmm!NAPOLITANO: - one during the Trump administration, approved by Rod Rosenstein.So, is he going to appoint a special counsel to investigate himself?BARTIROMO: Right.NAPOLITANO: This is a very, very, complex, conflict-laden situation.I want to - want to bring in Michael Mukasey -HILSENRATH: (INAUDIBLE) -Bartiromo - I want to bring in Michael Mukasey's comments on this. He's obviously - former attorney general himself, he says that the Department of Justice should be handling this FISA investigation. Here's what he told me on SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MICHAEL MUKASEY, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL & FEDERAL JUDGE: First of all, I'm not a fan of `special counsel,' generally.We have a Justice Department, the Justice Department can do criminal investigations -BARTIROMO: Right.Mukasey: - if they want to.BARTIROMO: Ten thousand lawyers in the system!Mukasey. Hey, if they want.What is the conflict, in this Justice Department, in investigating that episode?I don't see any.You have a special counsel, only when there is a criminal investigation to be conducted and there is some good reason why the Justice Department can't do it.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: He's making a good point?NAPOLITANO: Yes. He is - he is making a good point.I mean the Justice Department likes to commence investigations of DOJ people with the inspector general.BARTIROMO: Yes.NAPOLITANO: It was a rather discipline its employees for violating an internal regulation than prosecute one in - prosecute one of its employees for committing a crime.But I happen to agree with attorney general Mukasey, the Justice Department is competent to investigate itself.Now Trey Gowdy used some great one-liners with you yesterday.BARTIROMO: Yes.NAPOLITANO: I wish I could have graded my own exams in college -BARTIROMO: OK.NAPOLITANO: - and law school. I wish I could -BARTIROMO: It wouldn't work (ph).NAPOLITANO: - be a judge of my own case. I wish I could put my friends on the jury.It's different when you have 90,000 employees and you have different teams that have no connection with other teams that can do the investigation.HILSENRATH: Why not ask Bob Mueller to make this part of his investigation; you say he's an honest guy?BARTIROMO: That would be the obvious thing!HILSENRATH: He's -BARTIROMO: Yes.HILSENRATH: - why do they -NAPOLITANO: That -HILSENRATH: - need a whole second special investigator?NAPOLITANO: - that you know, this is spoken like such a "Wall Street Journal" editor!Because that would save the government a lot of money! That is a great idea!The team is already in place -BARTIROMO: Would he do it?Napolitano - there's no - No. There is no -BARTIROMO: Would he do it?NAPOLITANO: - learning curve.HILSENRATH: I don't think he would either.NAPOLITANO: I don't think he'd have any choice but to do it if Rosenstein expanded the jurisdiction.I say that of course with great respect, would expand the jurisdiction of Bob Mueller.But should Bob Mueller investigate -HILSENRATH: Which (ph) he's already done.NAPOLITANO: - Yes. Should Bob Mueller investigate Jim Comey's dropping the ball on prosecuting Hillary?Well, Jim Comey is a witness for Bob Mueller against Donald Trump and - on the issue of why he was fired.I'm telling you there is so many conflicts -BARTIROMO: And that's what Michael Mukasey brought up yesterday too.He said, "Look, now, Jim Comey has hired the very individual that helped him leak that letter to "The New York Times" which actually ended up getting the special counsel."He said, "I wonder if this is a way to get cover and get a client -NAPOLITANO: Well -BARTIROMO: - a client-attorney -NAPOLITANO: - yes -BARTIROMO: - privilege."NAPOLITANO: - and no. They weren't - they weren't attorney-and-client at the time -BARTIROMO: Right.NAPOLITANO: - he leaked it.On the other hand -BARTIROMO: But now they are!NAPOLITANO: - no court is going to force the lawyer to cough up what the attorney told him during the time-period of the investigation -HILSENRATH: No.NAPOLITANO: - even if what the attorney told him preceded the investigation -HILSENRATH: Yes.NAPOLITANO: - if you follow me.MCDOWELL: Jim Comey has a book coming out, he's planning to -HILSENRATH: There you go.MCDOWELL: - sit down with George Stephanopoulos on "ABC" -NAPOLITANO: I wish he could -MCDOWELL: - in his first -NAPOLITANO: - sit down with Maria.MCDOWELL: - television interview - no kidding! Right.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: But does that complicate matters or at all based on what he says publicly, what he is already -NAPOLITANO: Only he can tell us that when we read the book.I can't - I'd be surprised if there's anything in the book that contradicts what he's said publicly.But the problem with writing a book, before you testify under oath, is you may have to say something under oath that's inconsistent with the book; he's willing to take that chance.BARTIROMO: Yes.And meanwhile they are expanding Mueller's investigations. Special counsel -NAPOLITANO: Yes.BARTIROMO: - Robert Mueller could be expanding the investigation of the Trump administration, this is from "The New York Times" today, reporting that Lebanese-American businessman, an advisor to the United Arab Emirates, George Nader is being questioned or has been questioned.What do you think this is about?NAPOLITANO: Well, you remember when we never heard of George Papadopoulos -BARTIROMO: Yes.NAPOLITANO: - and now we know.

Thank you so much for joining us.BARTIROMO: Yes.MIHEER WALAVALKER, CO-FOUNDER & CHIEF BUSINESS OFFICER, FORMER CEO, YOUFOOT:. Good to see you. Thanks a -WALAVALKAR: - lot for inviting me.BARTIROMO: Explain how LiveLike works first, let's start there?WALAVALKAR: So -BARTIROMO: And I know you have deals with companies like FOX SPORTS, which is owned by our parent company 21ST CENTURY FOX.WALAVALKAR: - that's right.So, LiveLike is actually a technology company that's trying to reimagine how Live Sports viewing works.Basically, we are building mixed reality experiences which allow fans to feel like they're watching the game from the stadium, in a VIP lounge, with their friends.We partner with folks such as FOX SPORTS, "BP Sports," rights-holders around the world, and `white label' their applications for them.BARTIROMO: So, what is it like, give me the experience?I mean we're looking at it right now.(BEGIN AUDIOTAPE)BARTIROMO: I'm there at home but I could see on my screen what's going on, on-the-field, if I'm behind-the-scenes, on-the-scene.WALAVALKAR: Yes. So, actually the way it works is, once you put on your headset - it actually works without the headset as well but once you put on a headset you feel - you're transported to the stadium.You have an option to move to different parts of the stadium depending on where the action is so let's assume the action moves downfield you can move to the 20-yard line, you can move to the end zone.At the same time when you look around you there is a 3-D Lounge which hosts different types of content so you have real-time statistics, 2-D highlights, and more importantly you have avatars of your friends.So, actually up to four people can come together and watch games as though they are watching it from the same couch.BARTIROMO: That is very cool.I know this has been very important to FOX and to the Murdochs in terms of getting you right there -WALAVALKAR: Yes.BARTIROMO: - and this Virtual Reality use in sports.Can you apply this to other things away from sports?WALAVALKAR: Absolutely. I mean any experience that's a social experience, it works the same way.I mean we haven't really done anything outside of sports specifically yet except for a couple of tests here and there but -BARTIROMO: But I imagine you can do a, whole hosts of things?WALAVALKAR: - you can do this for concerts, you can do this with fashion shows, yes, it is; Oscars could have been done in a social manner with friends. You can be at the `Red Carpet.' You can be backstage, in the `Green Room,' you could be front-row, watching the game - watching the Oscars.BARTIROMO: And you think you can charge a premium for these kinds of program.WALAVALKAR: So, actually, the way we work is, we partner with rights- holders so it's really up to their business - up to them, from their business model perspective so if FOX SPORTS wanted to charge a premium to subscribers or a `per view' basis or you know, even potentially if you want to sit courtside you pay something; if you want to sit five rows behind, you can pay something.So, it's really creating a virtual stadium of the future.And our goal is to enable partners in their business models.BARTIROMO: And where do you take this, now how do you monetize this?WALAVALKAR: So, from our perspective, we have a licensing model, we're white-labeling -BARTIROMO: OK.WALAVALKAR: - our platform for broadcasters.But then of course brands play a big role in all of this because you know, it's really any brand that's looking for an innovative, interactive, play with millennials, this is the goal - this is - this is the platform where - so for example, we did something similar with Buffalo Wild Wings for the Gold Cup, which we did with FOX SPORTS and we had - when you look around you, there is a popping bucket of chicken wings that you can -BARTIROMO: OK.WALAVALKAR: - tab (ph) onto and order online while you're sitting right there.BARTIROMO: That's a great application.WALAVALKAR: Absolutely.BARTIROMO: That's really cool stuff.Miheer, thank you.WALAVALKAR: Thank you so -BARTIROMO: Good luck -WALAVALKAR: - much for having me.BARTIROMO: - with it, we'll be watching.Miheer Walavalkar, joining us here -WALAVALKAR: Appreciate it.BARTIROMO: - LiveLike.We'll take a break.When we come back, Hollywood's biggest night gets political.What a surprise, from jabs at the president to the `#MeToo movement,' we'll have the major moments from the Oscars, next hour, right here, MORNINGS WITH MARIA.Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Monday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.I am Maria Bartiromo and it is Monday, March 5th; your top stories right now, 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.Getting tough on trade, it has sparked global reaction, the world is reacting to president Trump's tough trade talk and administration officials have been fighting back the criticism.Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross addressed the potential impact of tariff increases with me this weekend on SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES.Load-Date: March 5, 2018End of Document

Sino accelerator will bring Chinese entrepreneurs to ALCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 26, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 610 wordsBody Importing Chinese start-ups and exporting Latin American products is the goal of Sino-Latin America Accelerator. The acceleration program - the result of the partnership between the Chilean-American investment fund Magma Partners and the Kr Space coworking chain in China - seeks to boost the growth of new Asian businesses so that they can venture into Latin America and, at the same time, support to ventures in the region whose target market is the United States.  The program, which will start operations on April 10, is backed by the Chinese government and will give selected entrepreneurs the possibility to raise financing for 5 million dollars from Asian investors.  Nathan Lustig, co-founder of Magma Partners explains that the program will be free and will have two calls per year, the first will close in the first quarter of 2018 and the second plan to launch it in October of the same year. The chosen generation of entrepreneurs will have the opportunity to attend the acceleration program in two modalities: face-to-face, in the spaces that Kr Space has in Beijing and Shanghai, and at a distance (by videoconference) from the place of residence of the participants.  Entrepreneurs in Latin America who wish to take the program face-to-face must pay for their travel expenses and stay, details Lustig. Once there, they will have a work space and can link with more than 100 Asian investment funds. "China is more advanced in issues such as electronic payments and big data, experience that local entrepreneurs can take advantage of", highlights Lustig.  Lee: Didi Chuxing, Uber's Chinese rival, recruits personnel for its headquarters in Mexico  The founders will also be able to present their project to the Magma fund, which will reserve a part of its Magma II fund - created last January with a stock market of 15 million dollars - to invest in those projects they consider attractive. The final objective is to finance, in the following three years, 60 start-ups in Latin America that operate in the fintech, e-commerce and health sectors, among others. The investment tickets will go from $ 25,000 to two million dollars.  With the alliance with Kr Space, Lustig expects the arrival of five to 10 Chinese companies to Latin American territory in the next two years. Cyprien Grau, co-founder of the real-time advertising campaign analysis startup Decidata, analyzes the business opportunities for his company with the arrival of Asian companies such as Didi Chuxing, Uber's Chinese rival, and the bicycle start-up Mobike shares, as well as the investors that can arrive.  "This is very good for the ecosystem. In Mexico it is difficult to find large funds that invest 5 million dollars of seed capital. The ones that exist, they do it in more mature companies, they want super strong sales, attraction ", explains Grau.  You may be interested: Ofo and Mobike, Chinese companies that will rent bicycles in Mexico  Santiago Zavala, partner of the business accelerator 500 Startups, with presence in several countries, including China, qualifies the arrival of Magma Partners and Kr Space as excellent news for the entrepreneurial ecosystem of the region. He believes that the arrival of Asian start-ups and investors will increase the competitiveness of the enterprises and will connect industries in Latin America and China.  "When the Chinese enter other countries they do it seriously. They have a very disciplined way of doing business and it is accompanied by a lot of capital. When we see players like them coming, we are very excited, because there will be opportunities for those who know how to take advantage of them, "says the manager. Load-Date: February 26, 2018End of Document

Rubio calls for end of Confucius Institute agreementThe Oracle: University of South FloridaFebruary 6, 2018 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 604 wordsByline: Miki ShineBodyUSF was the first university in Florida to create a Confucius Institute .SPECIAL TO THE ORACLEUSF started a partnership with the Confucius Institute in 2008, but a letter sent from Sen. Marco Rubio (R) is calling for the university to consider terminating the agreement.The USF Confucius Institute offers Chinese focused culture and language classes along with Chinese events on campus. However, over the years accusations against the different Confucius Institutes across the country have raised concerns."There are presently more than 100 Confucius Institutes, in addition to Confucius Classrooms at the K-12 level in the United States, including several in the state of Florida," Rubio wrote. "These institutes are overseen by a branch of the Chinese Ministry of Education, and are instructed to only teach versions of Chinese history, culture or current events that are explicitly approved by the Chinese Government and Communist Party."Rubio also sent the letter to the University of North Florida, the University of West Florida, Miami Dade College and Cypress Bay High School. "I can confirm that USF received the letter and we will respond to Senator Rubio in the near future," university spokesman Adam Freeman said in an email to The Oracle.USF was the first university in Florida to found a Confucius Institute when creating a partnership with Qingdao University. According to the USF World website, the institute is supported by Qingdao and the Chinese Ministry of Education.It is this connection that led to the National Association of Scholars to write a report titled "Outsourced to China: Confucius Institutes and Soft Power in American Higher Education," which outlines concerns about the Chinese government influencing American education and by extension Americans' opinions on China."There is mounting concern about the Chinese government's increasingly aggressive attempts to use "Confucius Institutes" and other means to influence foreign academic institutions and critical analysis of China's past history and present policies," Rubio wrote. "Additionally, the (People's Republic of China) continues its efforts to interfere in multilateral institutions, threaten and intimidate rights defenders and their families, and impose censorship mechanisms on foreign publishers and social media companies."The institute provides "academic support" to not only the USF Chinese program, but also language programs at local K-12 schools. Additionally, it puts on cultural performances and lectures, non-credit classes for people over the age of 50 and basic Chinese language courses for employees. According to the site, the institute usually lends two teachers to the USF Chinese language program who "strictly follow USF's curriculum" while teaching about 46 students per semester. These classes have included "Ethnic Minority Cultures in China" and "Business Chinese."Other universities in the past have allowed Confucius Institute agreements to expire. The University of Chicago discontinued the agreement in 2014 after faculty outcry and Penn State followed suit shortly after. Rubio heads the Congressional-Executive Commission on China. "I remain deeply concerned by the proliferation of Confucius Institutes and Confucius Classrooms in the United States," Rubio wrote.

ITIF Issues Statement on Trump Administration Actions on ChinaTargeted News ServiceMarch 25, 2018 Sunday 10:17 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 512 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Information Technology and Innovation Foundation issued the following statement:* * *The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF), the leading think tank for science and technology policy, today applauded the Trump administration's efforts to curb China's pattern of abusing economic and trade policy to gain unfair advantage in key industries. But ITIF cautioned the administration against imposing tariffs on producer goods that support U.S. productivity growth. ITIF released the following statement from its president, Robert D. Atkinson:"For far too long, the United States has held the rosy view that it was only a matter of time before China would open its markets and follow international trade rules. The reality is that China has systemically broken its promises and subverted the letter and spirit of WTO rules--and this behavior is getting worse, not better. We therefore applaud the Trump administration for taking long overdue steps to address this challenge. In particular, restricting Chinese foreign direct investment until China allows U.S. companies to invest there on fair market terms and countering discriminatory licensing restrictions through the WTO are important steps to begin to roll back Chinese innovation mercantilism."But it is important for the pushback to be carefully targeted and focused on the steps that will have the most leverage over China so that it doesn't raise prices and dampen investment in the kinds of machinery, equipment, and other technology that drive innovation and productivity across the economy. While it's well past time to tell China "enough is enough," we caution USTR from imposing tariffs, particularly on producer goods like computers. These won't bring production back to America, but they will raise prices, which will reduce capital investment, lower productivity, and weaken U.S. competitiveness. As ITIF has calculated, imposing 25 percent tariffs on information technology and communications goods alone would reduce U.S. GDP by $332 billion over 10 years."Furthermore, the U.S. risks winning only a Pyrrhic victory in a one-on-one trade war with China, because the Chinese government is in a much better political position to absorb economic pain--and it can dish out punishment with impunity to hurt the U.S. industries we should care about most. We stand a significantly better chance of countering unfair Chinese trade practices if we form a strong international alliance with allies such as the EU, Commonwealth nations, Japan, and South Korea. We urge the administration to build a strong and committed anti-mercantilist alliance with America's allies."For additional background on the unintended consequences of ICT tariffs, see ITIF's recent report "Why Tariffs on Chinese ICT Imports Would Harm the U.S. Economy," which found that a broad 25 percent tariff on Chinese ICT products would slow U.S. growth by $332 billion over the next 10 years, and a 10 percent tariff would cost the U.S. economy $163 billion over 10 years.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6217052 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: March 25, 2018End of Document

Asian stocks fall for 3rd day on US-China trade tensionsAssociated Press Financial WireMarch 26, 2018 Monday 3:19 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; Financial MarketsLength: 523 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - Asian stocks fell for a third day Monday amid mounting fears about U.S.-Chinese trade tensions.KEEPING SCORE: The Shanghai Composite Index fell 1.2 percent to 3,115.18 points and Tokyo's Nikkei 225 lost 0.8 percent to 20,445.03. Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 0.2 percent to 30,245.27 and Australia's S&P-ASX 200 retreated 0.6 percent to 5,787.60. South Korea's Kospi gained 0.2 percent to 2,422.63 while benchmarks in New Zealand, Taiwan and Southeast Asia fell.WALL STREET: Stocks had their worst week in two years as investors fled technology and bank stocks due to fears they might be hurt if Beijing responds to a U.S. tariff hike on Chinese imports by raising its own duties on American goods. Facebook fell 13.9 percent, wiping out $68 billion of market value, as outrage mounted over its handling of user data. The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 2.1 percent to 2,588.26. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 1.8 percent to 23,533.20 points. The Nasdaq composite shed 2.4 percent to 6,992.67.TRADE FEARS: China's new economy czar, Vice Premier Liu He, told U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a phone call that Beijing was ready to defend itself in an escalating tariff dispute, according to the Chinese government. President Donald Trump on Thursday approved possible higher duties on $60 billion worth of Chinese goods in a dispute over technology policy.

China's move to abolish presidential term limits is more unpopular than the government thought - so it's turning to censorshipBusiness Insider USFebruary 26, 2018 Monday 01:23 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 606 wordsByline: feedback@businessinsider.com,  (Tara Francis Chan)Highlight: The phrases "heil," "immortality," "constitution," and "Emporer Xi" have all been censored.BodyJohannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images• China's ruling Communist Party announced its plan to abolish presidential term limits on Sunday, which would allow President Xi Jinping to rule indefinitely.• A number of related phrases as well as pictures of Winnie the Pooh, which is said to look like Xi, were subsequently censored on Chinese social media.• The censorship, that started several hours after the announcement, indicates the Chinese government may not have expected much criticism from citizens.Criticism of the Chinese government's desire to abolish presidential term limits has seen censorship soar since Sunday.China's constitution restricts the president and vice-president to serving a maximum of two terms - 10 years - with President Xi Jinping's leadership due to end in 2023.While censoring social media is a regular occurrence in China, the latest incident may mean the Communist Party's proposal to            scrap presidential term limits, and essentially allow President Xi Jinping to rule indefinitely, was more unpopular than anticipated.After the proposed change was announcedon Sunday, critical posts began flooding both Weibo and WeChat.According to What's On Weibo, a website that tracks trending conversations on the Twitter-like service, many called the announcement "scary.""I've posted this before but it was censored within 13 minutes so I will post it again. I oppose to the amendment of the 'no more than two consecutive terms of office' as addressed in the third section of Article 79 of the Constitution," wrote a Weibo user."Argh, we're going to become North Korea," wrote another, according to Reuters."We're following the example of our neighbor," said another.But, Reuters reported, these posts were removed late Sunday evening.A number of phrases have also been censored on Weibo. Searching for "two term limit," "third consecutive term," "constitution," "Emperor Xi," and "continued rule" will return zero search results. Other censored phrases also reportedly include "heil," "ascended to throne," and "immortality."WeChat has also been affected. One New York Times reporter based in Beijing said he was unable to send a news report about the proposal to a family member on WeChat, but other messages were still able to be sent and received.China regularly censors phrases it disagrees that become popular on social media. But the government's censoring of this language hours after the term limit proposal - which would have been planned for some time - indicates the government hadn't expected the level of criticism it ended up receiving.Pictures of Winnie the Pooh also flooded social mediaXiao Lu Chu/Getty ImagesThere are also multiple reports that pictures of Winnie the Pooh are also being censored.Chinese netizens have used pictures of the character to poke fun at Xi in the past, who is thought to look similar in appearance to the bear.This weekend photos of Winnie wearing a crown, sitting in a throne, and hugging a honey pot spread on Weibo.Not only have some of these pictures been censored but, according to a tweet from cyber analyst Fergus Ryan, the phrases "Disney China" and "Winnie the Pooh" have also been banned.The proposal to remove China's presidential term limit will be voted on in March and is expected to pass easily.NOW WATCH: Henry Blodget: Will arming teachers with guns help stop school shootings?See Also:• The 40 highest-paying jobs you can get without a bachelor's degree• Disaster diplomacy governs who gets help after catastrophic events around the world• Mueller is reportedly investigating Jared Kushner's efforts to seek foreign financing for his family's businessLoad-Date: February 11, 2019End of Document

This participation was never mentioned by the authorities, published the portal Aristegui Noticias. The former head of the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit led a "High Level Working Group" with the Government of China, whose main job was to carry out that work, according to the "Notice of intention to initiate an investment arbitration against the Government of Mexico. " This was presented by the Chinese consortium before the Ministry of Economy on October 9, 2015, of which Aristegui Noticias assures it has a copy. The portal stressed that 10 days before the launch of the contest, Videgaray received at the National Palace to Chinese officials for a meeting that sought, among other objectives, to analyze alliances. On November 3, 2014, the Chinese government won the tender to carry out the work in conjunction with the Mexican Constructora and Edificaciónra GIA, Prodemex, GHP Infrastructure Mexicana and Constructora Teya, detailed. He recalled that in November of that same year, Aristegui Noticias revealed that Enrique Peña Nieto lived in a house owned by Juan Armando Hinojosa Cantú, owner of Constructora Teya. The Wall Street Journal also published that Videgaray bought a house from Hinojosa in the State of Mexico. This gave rise to a corruption scandal, investigated by the Secretariat of Public Function, of which Videgaray was exonerated. The spokeswoman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Claudia Algorri, said it was false that Videgaray directed the train proposal to China. "We declare conclusively that this is totally false and unfounded information, since the note is based on the participation of Dr. Luis Videgaray, as Secretary of Finance and Public Credit, in a single widely publicized work meeting," he said. . Braking project The construction of the Mexico-Querétaro High Speed ??Train had to start in December 2014, but the tender was canceled on November 6 of that same year. 58.820 million pesos was the amount of the canceled contract. 22,000 passengers a day would have transported the rail system. 300 kilometers was the maximum speed planned. 85% of the construction of the project would be financed by the Chinese Government.

Chinese  Lee: China will intensify its diplomacy, but assure that it does not rival the US.  In the official note, China called on the United States to "cease and abandon" these measures, "make cautious decisions and avoid placing the EU-China trade relationship in jeopardy."  According to the Chinese government, the measures announced in the day by Trump "are defeating themselves, they are going to directly hurt the interests of consumers, US companies, and financial markets."  In addition, the measures launched by Trump on Thursday "threaten the international trade order and the stability of the world economy."  The decree signed by Trump directs the Trade Representative, Robert Lighthizer, to draw up within 15 days a list of Chinese products whose importation into the United States will be charged.  We recommend: will China, the largest creditor in the US, stop buying?  The Trump resolution also directs Lighthizer to take action against China within the World Trade Organization (WTO) to prevent US companies from being forced to share technology.  Trump announced a consultation period for the collection of tariffs on imported Chinese goods valued at around 60,000 million dollars and ordered the Treasury Department to consider restrictions on US investments in China, Reuters reported.  Shortly before Trump signed the decree, one of his advisors, Everett Eissenstat, had mentioned that the tariffs would cover imports for some 50,000 million dollars, although he later raised that forecast.  Lee: Trump prevented the Broadcom-Qualcomm merger due to technological fear for China.  "There are a lot of things that are happening, but in particular with China, we are taking commercial action ... It could reach up to 60 billion dollars, but it's really just a fraction of what we're talking about," he said. Load-Date: March 22, 2018End of Document

The            regulatory crackdown is being led by the Ministry of Public Security and other Chinese government agencies. According to an insider familiar with the matter, Yicai explains that the investigators are looking for possible Ponzi schemes,            fraudulent trading activities, tax evasion, and money laundering crimes.Even though many trading platforms moved offshore, the publication s source explains they still monitored the exchanges  synchronously.   As for the next step there will be further regulatory measures, but also to wait for the notification of higher officials,  explains the insider speaking with the regional publication.ICO Projects and Domestic Exchanges Evade Regulations by Setting Up Businesses and Servers InternationallyThe translated report further states that China s regulatory authorities have witnessed            initial coin offering (ICO) projects and domestic exchanges evade the country s laws by setting up operations outside of China, registering the businesses offshore, and moving their servers as well. To this end, Chinese regulators will conduct a review of domestic bank accounts and online payment accounts for businesses and individuals suspected of helping domestic investors to make digital currency transactions at overseas exchanges,  the report details.If the trading account is frozen, the exchange can no longer continue its operations, otherwise it is easy to involve illegal fund-raising, money-laundering and other criminal activities. Additionally, regulators are aware of the large amounts of over-the-counter (OTC) trading taking place outside of the country but with the operations still servicing customers dealing in RMB.  These platforms, while moving servers overseas, still  open doors  to domestic users,  explains the news outlet.What do you think about China s police force and other authorities monitoring offshore exchanges?

House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee Issues Testimony National Endowment for DemocracyTargeted News ServiceMarch 21, 2018 Wednesday 7:56 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2174 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific issued the following testimony by Shanthi Kalathil, director of the International Forum for Democratic Studies at the National Endowment for Democracy, at a hearing entitled "U.S. Responses to China's Foreign Influence Operations":"Chairman Yoho, Ranking Member Sherman, thank you for the opportunity to testify before the subcommittee on this important issue."My remarks today will focus on how a rising China has increasingly been able to wield influence that chills free expression within democracies around the world. Successfully controlling political speech and expression at home has morphed into a broader approach that seeks to manipulate, suppress and surveil expression and the free exchange of ideas outside China's borders. This is not simply about "telling China's story," as Chinese authorities like to claim - it is also about shutting down a more contextualized version of China's story, as well as suppressing at a global level the discussion of a growing number of issues that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) finds sensitive."This has an impact on academic freedom at universities and schools around the world, on the international publishing sector, on communications infrastructure and independent media in developing countries, and on a free and open Internet. Beijing uniquely wields this influence due to China's market appeal and growing stature, employing a combination of carrots and sticks. As Xi Jinping's power consolidation and other events have demonstrated, China is moving in both a more authoritarian and a more global direction - which means these trends are likely to intensify.Taking domestic tactics overseas"With the advent of the Internet, many originally thought the Chinese government would find it impossible to control the political impact of communication within its borders. But the Internet has not only spread but flourished within China, all while the Chinese government has fine-tuned its management of politically sensitive expression. Since I first began studying this issue many years ago, the shape of the Internet within China has certainly changed, but the overall tactics used by the Chinese government have generally remained stable. First, technological innovation has enabled fine-grained censorship and increasing surveillance, now made possible by tremendous amounts of data collection in a weak rule-of-law environment. Second, while the actual censorship and surveillance apparatus is important, equally important is the inducement of self-censorship at all levels, which relies on fear and an implicit understanding of taboo issues. And finally, control and/or co-optation of the infrastructure of ideas and communication (including the actual pipes, the regulatory environment, and the private sector) is key, such that the interests of those innovating within and powering the information sector within China run parallel to - or, at the very least, not counter to - the interests of the Party."Just as in the past with respect to the flow of information within China, many now also find it difficult to believe that the CCP can exert influence over expression and communication outside its borders. Yet what we learn from its existing domestic approach is that a) it works; and b) it is possible to use similar tactics on an international scale to dampen or distort the free exchange of ideas. As noted in the National Endowment for Democracy's recent report on "sharp power," authoritarian regimes inevitably project overseas the values they live by within their bordersi. This projection of influence has already had a chilling effect within democracies.Impact on democratic principles"Recent examples have been numerous. With respect to encouraging self-censorship, academic publishing in particular has been in the spotlight. Cambridge University Press agreed to Chinese officials' request to censor within China articles pertaining to sensitive issues such as Tibet and the Tiananmen Square massacre; this decision was reversed after protests and petitions from the academic community. Yet publisher Springer Nature went forward with a similar arrangement, arguing that by censoring a small percentage of their content in China, the remainder can be made available. Variations of this argument - the "greater good" argument - have been advanced by numerous institutions and companies to justify acquiescing to CCP censorship."Confucius Institutes, which have been lauded internally by Chinese officials as successful influence vehicles, have also come under scrutiny as a growing number of scholars voice concerns that the presence of such Chinese government-funded centers on campus within democracies, including in the United States, are constraining academic freedom. This is particularly relevant when the agreements struck between universities and Confucius Institutes are opaque, as they frequently are, and when the educational institutions in question lack the resources to fund independent Asian or Chinese studies centers. As some have noted, decisions taken within liberal democracies to censor prestigious journals at the source - or conversely to acquiesce implicitly to a highly sanitized, university-sanctioned version of China's story - gives the unfortunate impression to all that the CCP's version of history is the only one, endorsed by the international scholarly community.ii"This is particularly of concern in younger democracies, which frequently lack deep expertise on China. In regions of the world ranging from Latin America to Central Europe to sub-Saharan Africa, the Chinese government has actively shaped the "infrastructure of ideas" through backing think tanks, investing in media outlets and infrastructure, and co-opting elites through exchanges and privileged access to officials and experts in China. In this way, the CCP has restricted the diversity of knowledge and opinion on China in areas where it has strategic interests, with the most prominent and politically connected voices frequently being those associated with the CCP. Notably, this is not limited to positive advocacy for CCP objectives, but includes the marginalization or exclusion of issues that the CCP deems sensitive. This list of issues is constantly expanding, a dynamic that itself encourages even more self-censorship."In the young and struggling democracies of sub-Saharan Africa, the Chinese government and government-linked companies have invested millions in communications infrastructure and media. Official Chinese cooperation arrangements with the continent - like the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation - have included arrangements for cooperation in film and TV production, Chinese support for radio and TV digitalization, and thousands of exchanges for African journalists. These "training" exchanges involve not so much training in the fundamentals of independent journalism but "training in the Chinese agenda," as some African independent journalists put it. The full ramifications of these developments have gone under-explored for a variety of reasons, including lack of capacity in the independent media sector to contextualize what is happening and clear incentives on the part of governments in Africa to cooperate with Chinese state objectives."Finally, the Chinese government's multi-pronged effort to shape the future of the Internet has implications for free expression, privacy and surveillance globally. Chinese tech companies, now among the largest in the world, have pioneered domestic censorship and surveillance at home (in the absence of strong rule of law protections and civil society that can freely advocate for citizens' rights) while simultaneously pushing into overseas markets, a trend likely to accelerate under the Belt and Road Initiative. As I have noted elsewhere, it is reasonable to explore whether Chinese firms with global ambitions plan to follow the same CCP dictates with respect to data-gathering, surveillance and policing of communication abroad as they do at home. Meanwhile, the Chinese government continues to push its concept of "cyber sovereignty" at the international level, a model of authoritarian control over information that would end the Internet's potential to serve as a platform for global free expression. It is useful to note in this context that, rather than upholding values of free expression, Silicon Valley often invokes the "greater good" argument to justify censorship within the Chinese market."The scale of these activities would have been impossible were it not for the tremendous market power China now wields. The CCP uses its unique carrots (including investments and market or other forms of access) in combination with its sticks (including denial of market and other forms of access, investment, or visas; and using pressure points on individuals and/or institutions) to create a foundation for its influence. As the Belt and Road Initiative rolls out throughout great swathes of the world, dwarfing the Marshall plan and engendering worries of "debt trap diplomacy," these carrots and sticks are likely to be deployed in greater measure.Addressing the challenge: prioritizing and reaffirming core democratic institutions and values"Why is it important to address the "greater good" argument, advanced by those who say some degree of CCP-imposed censorship or interference is worth the trade-offs? Because in the eyes of the CCP, any decision by democracies to compromise their values is binary: either you are willing to do so or you aren't. Degree is unimportant. For some time, as the CCP's ambitions have grown, democracies have essentially conveyed the message that they are not willing to defend their own core values. As a result, the Chinese authorities increasingly set the rules with institutions within the democracies on standards of free expression, a development with enormously troubling implications if we remain on this trajectory."Democracies are slowly coming to grips with this fact. Yet while the issue must be confronted head-on, it would be a mistake to think that the best way to address such heavy-handed tactics by authoritarian regimes is through similarly heavy-handed tactics by democracies that would have the effect of subverting the very values that undergird democratic systems. Democracies should be proactive in asserting why norms such as transparency, accountability, pluralism and the free exchange of ideas are critical to their interests. They must also be precise and thoughtful in formulating nuanced responses to authoritarian influence. Actions that fan xenophobia, restrict pluralism, or contravene core principles will not only weaken democratic institutions, but will conveniently make the CCP's own case that democracies are inherently flawed and hypocritical.With this in mind, democracies might consider:- Continuing to uncover the ways in which the CCP's influence activities are impinging on democratic institutions outside China's borders, and to share information on "best practices" for dealing with these activities while respecting democratic values;- Facilitating democratic learning and supporting the capacity of local independent media to report in a dispassionate way on issues relating to China, particularly in countries or regions without deep capacity to do so;- Seeking transparency in institutional agreements with Chinese government-affiliated institutions, such as Confucius Institutes and others. Particularly when public funds in democracies are involved, civil society should insist on understanding whether fundamental issues such as freedom of expression are placed at risk;- Collectively supporting existing norms relating to academic freedom and freedom of expression (within publishing, the scholarly community, think tanks, etc.) so that individual actors are not as susceptible as they are now to being picked off and pressured by the Chinese government or its surrogates;- Within relevant private sector industries, standing up initiatives that establish voluntary, mutual adherence to accepted norms of free expression and fundamental human rights;- Encouraging democratic solidarity among countries that are grappling with their engagement with China. Such solidarity will invariably lead to more effective and democratically sustainable outcomes, given the scope of the challenge."Thank you very much, and I look forward to answering your questions."* * *Footnotes:i Sharp Power: Rising Authoritarian Influence.

Campaign Targets Apple Over Privacy Betrayal for Chinese ICloud UsersTargeted News ServiceMarch 21, 2018 Wednesday 8:10 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 651 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: LONDON, England BodyAmnesty International issued the following news release:Amnesty International is launching a new social media campaign targeting Apple over its betrayal of millions of Chinese iCloud users by recklessly making their personal data vulnerable to the arbitrary scrutiny of the Chinese government.In a nod to Apple's iconic '1984' advert, the campaign takes an Orwellian theme with the line "All Apple users are equal but some are less equal than others". It launches as the tech company's chief executive, Tim Cook, touches down in Beijing to co-chair a prestigious business forum."Tim Cook is not being upfront with Apple's Chinese users when insisting that their private data will always be secure. Apple's pursuit of profits has left Chinese iCloud users facing huge new privacy risks," said Nicholas Bequelin, East Asia Director at Amnesty International."Apple's influential '1984' ad challenged a dystopian future but in 2018 the company is now helping to create one. Tim Cook preaches the importance of privacy but for Apple's Chinese customers' these commitments are meaningless. It is pure doublethink.""By handing over its China iCloud service to a local company without sufficient safeguards, the Chinese authorities now have potentially unfettered access to all Apple's Chinese customers' iCloud data. Apple knows it, yet has not warned its customers in China of the risks."On 28 February, Apple transferred the operation of its iCloud service for Chinese users to Guizhou-Cloud Big Data. The move affects any photos, documents, contacts, messages and other user data and content that Chinese users store on Apple's cloud-based servers.On 1 February, Amnesty International wrote to Apple raising our concerns about the changes and asked the company to provide further information. Apple has yet to respond to the request.Privacy threatNew Chinese legislation enacted in 2017 requires cloud services to be operated by Chinese companies, meaning companies like Apple must either lease server space inside China or establish joint ventures with Chinese partners.Chinese domestic law gives the government virtually unrestricted access to user data stored inside China without adequate protection for users' rights to privacy, freedom of expression or other basic human rights.As a result, Chinese internet users can face arrest and imprisonment for merely expressing, communicating or accessing information and ideas the authorities do not approve of.Amnesty's online campaign urges consumers to tell Tim Cook to reject double standards when it comes to privacy for Apple's Chinese customers, whose personal data is now at risk of ending up in the hands of the government.Think DifferentApple's chief executive will be in Beijing on 24-26 March to co-chair the China Development Forum, which aims to foster relationships between the Chinese government and global business leaders. Apple reported record revenues of US$17.9 billion for Greater China in the last quarter."While Apple may claim it treats its customers equally, some are less equal than others. Profits should never threaten privacy. It's time for Apple to Think Different when it comes to the privacy of its millions of Chinese customers," said Nicholas Bequelin."Apple needs to be much more transparent about the risks to privacy posed by recent changes to the iCloud service in China."1984Directed by Ridley Scott, Apple's 1984 advert of the same year is considered to be one of the greatest TV commercials of all time. Scores of grey clad clones are fixated on a giant screen as Big Brother celebrates "Information Purification Directives". An athletic woman in bright clothes storms past troops to take a sledge-hammer to the screen unleashing an explosion. A voice over says "On January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. And you'll see why 1984 won't be like '1984.'"Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6214219 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: March 22, 2018End of Document

Trump Blocks Broadcom's Bid For Qualcomm On Security Grounds; Trump Visits California To See Wall Prototypes Near Mexico Border; CIA Director Mike Pompeo To Replace Tillerson As Secretary of StateMORNINGS WITH MARIA MORNINGS WITH MARIA 8:00 AM ESTMarch 13, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; FinancialLength: 8855 wordsByline: Maria Bartiromo, Jon Hilsenrath, Dagen McDowell, Jonathan Hunt, Cheryl Casone, Sean Hannity, Stuart VarneyGuests: Ankur Jain, Anthony Scaramucci, Charles SchwabBodyMARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Tuesday, March 13th. Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast. Deal blocked, President Trump orders Broadcom to end seize its $117-billion hostile bid for rival Qualcomm. The President citing national security concerns. We are breaking down the shocking move coming up. The news comes after trade concerns weighed on stocks yet again yesterday. The Dow Industrials down better than 150 points, dragged down by big industrials like Boeing, Caterpillar, who will face the impact of tariffs.The NASDAQ closed at a record-high for the 15th time this year. NASDAQ was up 27 points. Futures this morning indicating some momentum on the upside. Dow Industrials expected to be up about 50 points. NASDAQ and S&P also higher this morning. Investors are waiting on the February consumer price index that is out in 30 minutes' time. That is expected to show an increase of two-tenths of one percent. And of course we are all mindful of inflation post the recent wage numbers in the month of January. In Europe, this morning markets are edging hire, take a look, the FT-100 actually down 22 points and that is the low of the morning right here. Down one -- down one-third of one percent. The CAC quarante in Paris is up a third of a percent but the DAX Index just flipped into negative territory as well. So much more of a mixed story this morning in Europe. In Asia overnight, markets were also mixed as you can see there.Battleground Pennsylvania, the polls are open in a key Congressional district and yet another primary test for President Trump. Republican Candidate Rick Saccone told me in the last hour, President Trump needs him in Washington.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. RICK SACCONE (R), PENNSYLVANIA: He's getting beat up in Washington as you see from the media and from the bureaucracy and from Hollywood and he needs a good wing man and as an old air force guy I want to get down there and protect his six and help him implement that very agenda.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Where things stand as voters head to the polls right now, we're going to take you there as the news develops. Meanwhile, earnings in focus this morning. Dick's Sporting Goods profit reported of a $1.22 a share, that was above expectations. Sales though were below expectations and the stock is now down 5-3/4 percent on Dick's Sporting Goods.Vice President Mike Pence calling on The View star, Joy Behar to publicly apologize for slander against Christians. I'll speak with Sean Hannity about his exclusive interview with the Vice President coming up. All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the Wall Street Journal's global economics editor Jon Hilsenrath, and Kairos founder Ankur Jain is with us this morning. Great to see you.ANKUR JAIN, FOUNDER, KAIROS SOCIETY: Good morning.BARTIROMO: Good morning. Good show so far, guys.JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: Good to be here.BARTIROMO: Busy morning.JAIN: Quite a morning.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: So much to cover including the Broadcom-Qualcomm (INAUDIBLE)BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: And then Hillary Clinton in India. Essentially bashing the entire country quite frankly or anybody who didn't -- isn't still carrying HRC pom-poms.BARTIROMO: And we know from her comments in India that when she said people who voted for Trump were deplorable. Well, she meant it.MCDOWELL: Oh, yes. She meant it. And again, it goes back to the Joy Behar if they need to just own the garbage that they spew. Just on it. Just be anti-Christian. Just look down upon a giant part of this county because you -- because they don't like you and they don't agree with you, so you're irrelevant to them, that's what they think.BARTIROMO: We're going to talk about that when Sean Hannity comes up in a few minutes. Coming up. I will speak exclusively meanwhile to the founder and chairman of the Charles Schwab Corporation. Charles Schwab is in the studio this morning and we're going to talk with him about everything from markets to regulation. Also joining the conversation this morning is Kentucky Congressman Andy Barr and the host of "HANNITY", Sean Hannity weighing in as well. Don't miss a moment of it. We got a big hour coming up. We kick it off right here with this. President Trump has blocked Singapore-based Broadcom's proposed takeover of Qualcomm. Citing national security concerns. Blake Burman is live at the White House with all details. And Blake, it was just what, six or eight months ago when we were all celebrating the fact that Broadcom said that it was going to take all their employees and their headquarters from Singapore to the United States.BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: That's really where this story begins, Maria. I'll take you back here to November 2nd here at the White House. I remember that day because there was a jobs announcement as it was being held in the afternoon here and we were all trying to figure out what exactly is this jobs announcement and then the president was standing there in the Oval Office along sided the CEO of Broadcom in which Kevin McCarthy, the number two in the House was there as well in which the -- all of them were celebrating Broadcom bringing their headquarters from Singapore back to the U.S. or into the U.S. I should say. At the time, the context of all of this was this was during the heart of the tax reform push and at that point, this was being hailed as a jobs announcement that was beneficial to the U.S.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Broadcom limited is moving its headquarters from Singapore back to the United States. So I want to I thank you.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you.TRUMP: They moved back to the United States and to the United States is something very, very special, and very important.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURMAN: However in the immediate days after that, Broadcom began to attempt a hostile takeover, and now the Trump administration is raising national security concerns as a reason not to allow an acquisition of Qualcomm to take place. At issue here concerns that Broadcom could weaken Qualcomm in the midst of the race to develop 5G technology and the potential for that to benefit China. In a statement, the Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin saying yesterday "this decision is based on the facts and national security sensitivities related to this particular transaction only and is not intended to make any other statement about Broadcom or its employees including thousands of hardworking and highly skilled U.S. employees. Broadcom released this terse statement "Broadcom is reviewing the order. Broadcom strongly disagrees that it proposed acquisition of Qualcomm raises any national security concerns. Maria, this would have been the largest tech merger ever and it also prohibits Broadcom's attempt to install a new board of directors at Qualcomm. Maria?BARTIROMO: All right, Blake. Thank you so much, Blake Burman. Joining us now to talk more about that is Kentucky Congressman Andy Barr who oversee - - who serves on the House Financial Services Committee. Congressman, it's good to see you. Thanks very much --(CROSSTALK)REP. ANDY BARR (R), KENTUCKY: Good to see you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Was this the right move?BARR: We're going to be reviewing whether it was the right move. Our subcommittee has jurisdiction over the CFIUS, the Committee in Foreign Investment in the United States and in fact our committee, the Financial Service Committee is evaluating legislation to modernize the CFIUS process. Clearly, China and other counties are making moves to acquire critical technologies in the United States that could indeed compromise American national security but we should always start with the basic proposition that foreign direct investment is good for America. It's good for American competiveness. It's responsible for 6.8 million American jobs and these are higher-paying jobs than typically American jobs. And it's responsible for about $900 billion in GDP output every year. So, we should always start with the -- with the presumption that foreign investment is benign.BARTIROMO: Yes.BARR: And so the extent that CFIUS is exercising its authorities to block deals, we need to scrutinize that.BARTIROMO: So, was this more about China? I made the point earlier that China is participating in up to 10 percent of venture deals in the U.S. for that reason to get technology and, you know, intelligence.BARR: Right. And dual use technologies, technologies that could be used for artificial intelligence and other issues, semiconductors but dual use and the fact that some of these technologies could be used for military applications. So we need to look at these, we do need to probably expand the CFIUS jurisdiction to joint ventures and to other non-controlling investments. However, again, we have to make sure that this is not used for economic protectionism, the CFIUS process and focus exclusively on national security issues.HILSENRATH: I want to drill down on that a little bit philosophically. So you're Republican, Republicans traditionally stood for free and unfettered markets free movement of capital and goods across borders. You know, we now have Republican in the White House who is putting tariffs on steel and aluminum in the last week. And now this deal in which the government is intervening with two private companies doing a transaction. How do you digest this philosophically? Does it fit into your philosophical mindset of free and unfettered markets?BARR: Well, it's that balance that we need to strike between national security and free and unfettered markets as you -- as you say. The Broadcom deal is an interesting one because it's a Singapore-based company, it's not a Chinese company.BARTIROMO: It was going to move its headquarters here though.BARR: It was. And so the issue really that we need to look at as we exercise oversight over the committee on I foreign in the United States is do we -- do we -- do we give that committee the ability and do we give the president the ability to block deals where an adversary is not acquiring entity but the inquisition itself would perhaps compromise American competiveness relative to an adversary like China.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: You reviewing this CFIUS ruling. You going in and trying to change, it was the Exon--Florio Amendment think in '88. They gave the President the authority to veto a deal based on national security concerns. Even if you tweet that, that doesn't necessarily revive the Broadcom- Qualcomm deal, does it?BARR: No. In fact, the legislation before the Congress right now would actually expand the jurisdiction of CFIUS. it wouldn't remove it, it wouldn't limit it, it would expand it to joint ventures and non-controlling investments. So I think we do need to have a balanced approach here, but we also do need to recognize that China and other entities are engaged in efforts to circumvent the existing jurisdiction --BARTIROMO: And that's the issue here. And that's (INAUDIBLE) on tariffs too.MCDOWELL: To your point, 20 percent of the deals reviewed by CFIUS between 2013 and 2015, that's the last information available by the way. There is no transparency with CFIUS. 20 percent of those dealings involve Chinese investors. Incredible number.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Yes. Impressive number.JAIN: Congressman, I'm curious. I mean, the statement the White House put out here was that the effect of this is downsizing Qualcomm's research budget was a security threat So, what would you guys have done if it was a U.S. private equity firm buying Qualcomm with the same threat?BARR: Well, I don't -- I think in that case, CFIUS would not have jurisdictions. Certainly, the President would not the jurisdiction and certainly the President would not have jurisdiction to block that deal. Again, we don't want to prevent economizing transactions. And we also don't want a bias against foreign direct investment which as I said before could be very productive in growth oriented and my district is a perfect example of that with a lot of foreign direct investments that has created a lot of good high-paying jobs, so --JAIN: Do you think the White House would have blocked the deal if another U.S. private equity firm post the same posed the same existential threat to Qualcomm falling behind the tech race?BARR: No. Unless there's a beneficial ownership interest that can be trace back to an adversary like China. So, that's what you're seeing right now as China circumventing CFIUS by controlling say a German company or an Irish company. And certainly --(CROSSTALK)HILSENRATH: They're not controlling Broadcom. Broadcom is a Singaporean company.BARR: Very good point. And that's why we need to ask tough questions to CFIUS in the upcoming hearings about whether or not a non-Chinese company like a Singapore-based company, whether that acquisition and even a move to the United States would compromise American competiveness.(CROSSTALK)HILSENRATH: CFIUS is a pretty -- I'm sorry, Maria.BARTIROMO: Yes. Go ahead.HILSENRATH: It's a pretty obscure Washington institution. I doubt many people have heard of it a year ago. Are you going to get the transparency you need to do a kind of review like this? From CFIUS and who is going to be a representing it to you.BARR: Well, so, the administration is presenting its views and the administration does support reform and modernization of CFIUS. The legislation is a -- the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, it's a piece of legislation sponsored by Senator Cornyn and my colleague Robert Pittenger applaud their leadership on addressing this real national security issue with the -- with Chinese investment and other investment that could compromise our competitive edge in critical technologies and national security sensor technologies but the key is it has to be essentially to national security. If it's not essential to national security, we need to allow the benign direct investment to continue in the United States because that actually enhances American competitiveness.BARTIROMO: Right. Congressman, before you go, we go to turn to taxes. Are you going to do phase two of tax plan? Are you going to do another tax cut?BARR: I hope so. I think we need to do a technical corrections bill. I think expand on the progress that we made. You've seen the jobs report from the last week. 313,000 jobs created in February. You see business optimism at the highest level in history, consumer confidence --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Where will the tax cut be?BARR: Well, I think we need to expand on the Main Street small business pass-through deduction. I think we need to expand to more professional services companies and increase those thresholds. I think that would be a simplification of that provision as well.BARTIROMO: So you're moving toward that then?BARR: Well, I certainly hope so. I'm pushing for that and I'd also like to hold the Democrats accountable when they say that they criticize the tax plan because individual and small business tax plans aren't permanent, let's put them to the test. Let's vote to make those tax cuts permanent.BARTIROMO: And real quick on the tariffs. Europeans are coming right at you in Kentucky.BARR: Oh, they sure are.BARTIROMO: Is that a fact that Europeans are going to try to institute a 25 percent tariff?BARR: Yes. And I signed a letter to the President, you know, expressing our concern about the potential retaliation against Kentucky Bourbon and Harley-Davidson and other sensitive American products. Again, free trade should be our default in every instance and we don't want retaliation from the European Union or anyone else.BARTIROMO: Are you going to come up with new legislation to block the President's tariffs?BARR: Well, we are encouraged that the President has said that he will tailor it so that we are not discriminated against our allies.(CROSSTALK)BARR: That's a good first step.BARTIROMO: Thank you --BARTIROMO: Welcome back. President Trump making his first visit to California as President today where he will visit border wall prototypes. Fox News' Jonathan Hunt is live at the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar outside of San Diego with the very latest. Jonathan, good morning to you.JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria. This is a trip that many in the White House would consider a visit to enemy territory. Given the ongoing battle between the Trump administration and the state of California over immigration and sanctuary cities in particular. But President Trump will largely meet only friendly faces today here at the Marine Corps Air Station. He will be making a speech to members of the five branches of the military. Prior to that after he lands here at about 2:30 Eastern Time. He will be touring some of those prototypes for the border wall that he has long promised to build. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee-Sanders says the President feels it's important to get an up-close look. Listen here.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I think that this is an important thing that the President has talked about, the safety and security of the country. And strongly feels that the wall is a big part of that and he is going to look at those prototypes.(END VIDEO CLIP)HUNT: Now protesters many different groups have promised to be out in force making their presence felt to the President and letting him know that they disagree wholeheartedly with many of his policies. Listen again.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRISTOPHER WILSON, ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR, ALLIANCE SAN DIEGO: Building more walls is irresponsible. When our bridges crumbling and our schools falling apart, when we need infrastructure, we don't need walls, we need money for people who are homeless and starving. Building more walls is irresponsible.(END VIDEO CLIP)HUNT: Once the President wraps up here in San Diego, he will head north to Los Angeles where he will attend a fundraiser. Location for that, still being kept a closely guarded secret you can be sure that the protesters who are gathering there will not be able to get anywhere near President Trump today. Maria?BARTIROMO: All right, Jonathan. Thank you, Jonathan Hunt with the latest there. Meanwhile, a crucial election in Western Pennsylvania today. Voters are headed to the polls to choose their new representative. Cheryl Casone with the details. Cheryl? CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, Maria. You just had of course one of those candidates on but let's take a look at this new video. We just got a Democratic Candidate Conor Lamb, he just casts his ballot in what is expected to be a very tight race between him and Republican Rick Saccone that you spoke with. The Democrats want to steal the House seat away from Republicans in today's special election. This is the district that President Trump carry by nearly 20 points. Maria, Rick Saccone to you just moments ago, he emphasized his work as state representative to you.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SACCONE: I was elected on the same agenda that President Trump was elected on. Cutting taxes, cutting spending, rolling back regulations that are strangling our businesses repealing -- replacing Obamacare, rebuilding our military, taking care of veterans, protecting our second amendment rights , protecting our unborn children, securing the border, supporting our law enforcement.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Rick Saccone speaking with you of course just moments ago, that was a great interview. We should say polls are going to be open until 8:00 p.m. Tonight, of course Fox Business going to be covering that special election all day. Back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl. Coming up. Vice President Mike Pence calls on Joy Behar to apologize following her anti-Christian comments. "HANNITY" host, Sean Hannity weighs in next. As we take a break, take a look at futures. The major indices looking higher this morning. We're expecting a gain of about 50 points on the Dow at the opening this morning after the Dow close down better than 150 yesterday. Back in a moment.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: When I heard ABC had a program where my Christian faith had been described as a mental illness, I felt it was important for me to speak out, that I defend the faith of tens of millions of Americans against that kind of slander. She picked up the phone, she called me, she was very sincere and she apologized. And one of the things my faith teaches me is grace. I said the joy of course, I forgive you but I did encouraged her and I'm still encouraging her to use the form of that program or some other public forum to apologize to tens of millions of Americans who were -- who were equally offended.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: That was Vice President Mike Pence commenting on The View host Joy Behar's apology to him after she revered to his faith as a "mental illness". Pence made the comment in an exclusive interview with Fox News Host Sean Hannity. And joining me right now on the phone is the host of "HANNITY" on Fox News, Sean Hannity. Sean, thanks so much for calling in. We saw --(CROSSTALK)SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST (via telephone): Hey, good morning, Maria. How are you this morning?BARTIROMO: Great. Congratulations. Fantastic interview with the V.P. last night. Were you surprised to hear that Behar offered the Vice President an apology? What struck you from you the interview?HANNITY: Well, what struck me is that -- it was Bob Iger who actually announced the (INAUDIBLE) and Joy Behar made the comment publicly, she made the apology privately and she kind of got away with it which tells me it's really probably not that sincere. If she really believe it, she should go to the same format or her own show and say, by the way, I said this about Christianity, I compared to mental illness it was wrong, I apologize to the vice president privately and I apologize to all of you. And, you know, I think the Vice President in his typical gracious manner was encouraging her to do that but, you know, it's amazing the double standard that exist was, I think, you know, and I know that if you're a conservative and you say something similar, you're not going to get away -- you're not going to get the pass that people on the left seem to get regularly although I'm not -- you know Maria, I make my living with the first amendment. I have never called for anybody to be fired for stupid things they say, people like Bill Maher or Stephen Colbert or Joy Behar or Rosie O'Donnell.BARTIROMO: Right.HANNITY: You know, I figure people are smart enough, they'll sort it out on their own.BARTIROMO: Yes, you're right. And by the way, we would never have known it without that shareholders meeting where Bob Iger was asked about it because of exactly the reason you just said, she refuses to say it publicly. We'll see if there's pressure for to do that. I want to move on to the House Intel Committee shutting down this probe of Russia collusion between Trump and the -- and the Russians. We knew this from the get-go that there was no collusion but Adam Schiff is still not admitting it, Sean.HANNITY: Well, let me finish. I wouldn't even say it's shutdown, it's been going on for 14 long months. And to date, there is no evidence of -- look, I will go to the report last night it was very, very clear we have found no evidence of collusion coordination or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russians. You know, Adam Schiff is now publicly himself said there is no evidence most recently on that same show that we're just talking about, The View. And it's put up or shut up time.BARTIROMO: Right.HANNITY: Because Adam Schiff has been on T.V. some 275 times shooting off his mouth making all these proclamations, all the insinuations of the world when push comes to shove, you have the Senate investigation, you have the House investigation, you got the Mueller investigation, and there's not one single person that has ever come up with any evidence that said, boom, here, this is it.BARTIROMO: Right. But we -- but we knew that from the get-go, Sean. We knew that this was all a narrative. I mean --HANNITY: It's a witch hunt.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, it's certainly seems that way. But can Robert Mueller completely ignore the collusion that we did see on the side of the Democrats? I mean, let's face it. Hillary Clinton and the DNC paid for the dossier that they used, to wiretap the Trump campaign, that sounds like collusion to me.HANNITY: Well, what she did with the Clinton campaign, it was bought and paid for dossier full of Russian lies, Russian government lies and propaganda. And think about what that was being used for. The whole purpose of it was to manipulate propagandize and misinform the American people before the election. And then as you know, it can be even worse because Fusion GPS, they have verify and corroborated any of the material nor did the FBI, nor did the Department of Justice and then they allowed this document unverified as it was, a political document paid for by one party, one candidate to be presented in an application before FIS court and they never -- they never inform the judge who paid for it, where it came from, and they presented it as if it was a gospel truth that may never did their due diligence.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: So the question is can Robert Mueller ignore that, Sean? I mean, he is supposed to be looking for collusion with Russia, there it is.HANNITY: If everything was fair, if Robert Mueller, I have zero faith in Robert Mueller. Robert Mueller has appointed an abusively bias one-sided team of Clinton-Obama-DNC donors, there's no Trump supporters that he put on his team, you know, he also brought in some of the most unethical people to work on the special counsel. Andrew Weissmann is the guy, he supposed to be reporting to The New York Times. Robert Mueller's pit bull, well, this is the guy that put literally, literally 10s of thousands of people out of work in the Anderson accounting special investigation.BARTIROMO: Right.HANNITY: Tens of thousands of Americans lost their jobs, eventually we had lost nine-zero Supreme Court decision. We put four Merrill executives behind bars for a year, that was overturned by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. And you know, you have a whole pattern of behavior where in two separate cases, if you look at Sidney Powell, Gregg Jarrett, and some other people where he was held exculpatory evidence. What's really fascinating that's gone on since General Flynn -- since, you know, he pled guilty to quote, lying to FBI, is that the judge in that case is the same judge that was involved in Ted Stevens' corruption case that was eventually overturned and thrown out. He wants to see all exculpatory evidence as it relates to General Flynn, and the judge is saying I will decide what is exculpatory. So, that tells me that General Flynn's case is far from over.BARTIROMO: Yes.HANNITY: And that -- and, you know, and listen, we better ask ourselves the question here: if Adam Schiff is going to go on T.V. 275 times and he can't answer the question after 14 months of an investigation, where is the evidence? And the country has a right to demand we move on.BARTIROMO: Yes.HANNITY: You know, Robert Mueller investigating Jared Kushner's, you know, investment in a property in Chicago is meaningless to the American people. And it literally hamstrings this President from doing his job, and the double standard is outrageous as you rightly point out.BARTIROMO: And, you know, Hillary Clinton is still trying to figure out what happened. She's in India trashing Trump supporters again. Sean, we have a lot to talk about with you. I hope you come back soon. Thanks very much for weighing in and we'll be --HANNITY: Anytime, Maria. I love this show.BARTIROMO: -- we'll be watching tonight, great exclusive with Vice President Mike Pence last night. Thank you, Sean Hannity.HANNITY: Thank you.BARTIROMO: We'll see you tonight on Fox News on "HANNITY." We'll be right back. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Topping our news this half an hour, inflation in focus. We did get the February reading on the consumer price index and it was inline, it showed the prices were up two-tenths of one percent in line with expectations, this coming ahead of next week's Federal Reserve meeting where the Central Bank is expected to raise interest rates for the first time this year on March 21st. Joining me now in an exclusive interview is Charles Schwab Corporation Founder and Chairman, Charles Schwab himself. It is so great to see you, Chuck.CHARLES SCHWAB, FOUNDER AND CHAIRMAN, CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION: Thank you, Maria. It's lovely to be here.BARTIROMO: Thank you for joining us. It's --SCHWAB: Our careers have been together side-by-side for 30 years. It's always fun for me to come back.BARTIROMO: It's true but you are a statesman in the industry, and you've done so much, you are a pioneer and I salute you. So, thank you for joining us. I want to start by talking a bit about the policies coming out of Washington. I think you have been supportive -- the President is talking about his success in terms of tax reform, in terms of rollback in regulations, and then we'll get to the tariffs but what has been the impact of these policies so far?SCHWAB: Well, I've always considered myself an entrepreneur but a Republican entrepreneur. And what we have is probably the most dynamic change in legislation I have seen in my career as a public servant, serving our Schwab customers, and involved in sort of policy too. I think what we've done with this tax bill is unleashing unbelievable amount of power in the economy, power in our individual entrepreneurs, powering what is going to -- we're just 65, 70 days into the change of the tax bill, what it's offering to American public. And I think we just have to put on our hat and be ready to fly away here. This is going to be an incredible period next two or three years, I think, of economic growths. Which means, in many ways, people are going to be coming back to workforce. Participation rates will definitely be picking up again. It sort of went into the doldrums, for sure, in the last seven or eight years. I think that's going to be, really, a beneficial thing for most American families.BARTIROMO: So, you think, that the impact of the tax plan is actually going to have a real runway.SCHWAB: I think so.BARTIROMO: It's not short term thing.SCHWAB: It's amazing. When you look at the various factors, I mean, I just looked at, for instance, our employees, and this is so true for so many of the companies, the thousand-dollar bonus was something that was significant. It's like for the average person who makes about 75,000 a year, that's about a four percent after tax income boost.BARTIROMO: That's a big deal.SCHWAB: Then you add on the thousand-dollar bonus that many of our companies gave including ours, that's another four percent, so there's a whole eight percent boost this year alone for the average American employee. So, that's -- then you add on what's going to be happening to the corporate thing which takes some time, decisions have to be made in terms of investment capital, that will be extended for sure. Development in our case, we're putting in another million square feet of space in different places in the country for our addition in growth of the Schwab company. So, there's lots of things that are going on, just many, many thousand different companies, ours is just one, of course, and we're really anxious and very optimistic.BARTIROMO: There are people who feel like the rollback in regulations was even more impactful than the tax cutting plan. Talk to us about that. You're a leader in the financial services industry. And now, they're talking about tweets to Dodd-Frank. How important was the rollback in regs?SCHWAB: Well, it is crucial. What was happening before without any rollback, was just crushing regulation that decisions all had to be sort of go through the central government agencies. We're over agency -- you're sort of under -- or under the Federal Reserve or the OCC, one of the SEC, go on and on. And they all had conflicting different regulations, so you're trying to weave your way through all these things. So, finally, they're a little bit of -- said stop, no more. Let's see if we can do some efficiencies here and make it easier for businesses to operate, to really do the things that customers really want is great service. Don't put all your time and energy into regulation, put your time in serving me, the customer, that's what we need to do and that's what we're moving about.BARTIROMO: Because for so many years, companies, banks, in particular, were hiring compliance agents and lawyers to keep up with the string of rules.SCHWAB: We're no different.BARTIROMO: Right.SCHWAB: And I can quote you numbers, I'm probably not going to do it because it probably be a little embarrassing to do that, but we've had to put an incredible sums of money in terms of hiring people, and we're all trying to hire the same people which makes it really difficult, because the supply is very limited.BARTIROMO: Yes.SCHWAB: So, anyway, we're really happy that deregulation is a movement afoot, it won't happen overnight but I think if you see the trend in, we really are happy about it.BARTIROMO: What do you think is most important that they tweak in terms of Dodd-Frank right now? That's in the works right now.SCHWAB: Yes, I think right now, what they're looking at particularly the smaller banks, getting them outside of the big net that the Fed has put together in terms of regulatory thing. Let the smaller banks, they're the ones down the street here lending money to the average person, trying to reduce their overhead, and let them be more efficient about delivering loans and lending money to individuals. That would really be a great benefit. Then there's other things that deal with the custodial banks that will be probably beneficial. They don't need to have all these great overwriting regulatory things that living wills to some extent, is sort of a crazy thing. Let bankruptcy happen. If a person does a bad thing in business, they should probably go out of business. That's what should happen.BARTIROMO: Right. That's called free markets, right?SCHWAB: Yes, free market. Exactly.BARTIROMO: Yes. Let's take a break, Chuck. I want to get your take on this latest proposal on tariffs. This is going to take effect in less than two weeks, and there's been a lot of pushback, on the tariffs. So, we'll talk with Chuck Schwab more when we come right back after this short break. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: I am back with Charles Schwab, he is the founder and chairman of Charles Schwab. We want to bring you this breaking news from the Washington Post. The Washington Post is reporting right now, that Rex Tillerson, the Secretary of State, is going to be leaving the White House, that he is out. We will follow this. Again, this is all -- he is going to be replaced apparently by CIA Director Mike Pompeo. And this is from, again, the Washington post, that Tillerson is out. He will be replaced by Mike Pompeo, the head of the CIA. And I'm with Chuck Schwab. Chuck, this is obviously a surprise. This is just coming from the Washington Post.SCHWAB: It's a disappointment to have Tillerson leave. I think he was a exquisite Secretary of --BARTIROMO: -- of state.SCHWAB: -- State. And so -- but there are changes. In any administration, there's always rotation going on, all the time, and so, that's just -- you have to expect that. It's a very difficult job to have, and moving around, travel around as much as they all do, I can understand that.BARTIROMO: And the speculation had been for a long time, should Tillerson leave, Pompeo gets the job?SCHWAB: Yes, well, he's a good man.BARTIROMO: Yes. And that's what we're seeing. Does it bother you that we're seeing such resolving doors in the White House, or is that typical to a President --SCHWAB: Not reallyt. It's fairly typical, and I think we have an atypical President. He's really a business guy. And he's acting -- asking for certain performance, and yes, he is more flexible than some old staid politician, and he has to be -- you have to be flexible and work with him. I mean, I know in my case had times we changing the business format. It's not a personal thing, but you do change your mind based upon incoming facts and so forth. And sometimes that change is too quick for some people.BARTIROMO: Right.SCHWAB: And maybe you don't have perfect communication, so you just have to go along. That's why teams are so important. They go to work together, and you sort of know what's happening but you don't know -- you don't have -- or have perfect information this time as a part of a team.BARTIROMO: And people like the idea that he has all these different people around him with different viewpoints which is why they're wondering if Larry Kudlow gets the job as Gary Cohn's replacement.SCHWAB: I would -- I would love to see that.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, by the way, let me show you this tweet. Do we have the tweet from the President? The President is confirming this, Rex Tillerson is out as Secretary of State and Mike Pompeo is in. And the President just tweeted this, "Mike Pompeo, Director of the CIA, will become our new Secretary of State. He will do a fantastic job. Thank you to Rex Tillerson for his service." And he goes on to say, "Gina Haspel will become the new director of the CIA and the first woman so chosen. Congratulations to all." The President confirming these moves. Chuck?SCHWAB: That sounds just fine with me.BARTIROMO: Yes. So, you're happy with the team in place?SCHWAB: I absolutely am.BARTIROMO: Let me ask you this because you were right there in the middle of things, in California, San Francisco, and this idea that California pushes back on federal law, blows off the federal law, and is a sanctuary - - wants to be sanctuary. What's your take on this? How tough is it being in California and seeing it then pushback against the President's policies?SCHWAB: Well, the result will be many penalties, many of the moneys that come from the federal government for different services, they will come to an end. I don't know what they're thinking about. It's like shooting yourself in the foot all the time. Why would you do that? There are certain moneys that come back for the homeless, for instance, or for other activities, fire prevention, and all the big fires that we've had there, they're putting themselves in jeopardy in term of federal assistance and so many things. I don't know -- I don't know what's happening. Finally, where is the populous here in America, in California? It's pretty sad right now and -- but we'll just have to see.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, the Oakland Mayor basically telling the illegals they're coming for you. That was -- that was troubling.SCHWAB: Tells me there are many -- the U-Hauls cost -- 10 times as much to get a U-Haul to leave as to come in to California. It's very, very -- the U-Hauls are going out of California right now.BARTIROMO: I bet, yes. And that's probably going to pick up.SCHWAB: I think --BARTIROMO: So, what's your take on the tariffs? The President has said that he's willing to make exemptions on these tariffs on steel and aluminum. But he's faced a real pushback in terms of getting too nationalistic, too protectionist. Your take on the impact of all of these tariff plans going to have on what you say is great economic policies and growth.SCHWAB: Well, my view is that there is really no free trade and such. Every country and particularly people like China, like Russia, like Japan, all have protective different kinds of tariffs. I have been involved as a personal investor in a number of things, solar cells, one for instance. (INAUDIBLE) the Chinese government want their own big percentage of that thing that has crushed the pricing. And they can do it, they have control over different things that allow them to do that in their country. I think in terms of steel, you know, we make about -- China makes 10 times more steel than we do. We have to have steel for strategic reasons for sure and it had to be 100 percent dependent eventually on China for our steel. I think it's crazy, I think we have to get some balance there. I think it's absolutely correct, the way he is moving on that.BARTIROMO: And even though it's not a direct seller of steel, they put overcapacity in the market.SCHWAB: They sell to Mexico, it comes up through cars, they could sell to Canada, they've different ways that we get the Chinese steel back here. But I think what Trump is doing and I think it's the right thing to do, we've got to have some negotiating positions on these things, otherwise we're sort of naked.BARTIROMO: Right.SCHWAB: So, what he's doing is setting something up like the tariff on steel, OK, we'll negotiate a little bit, may be here on NAFTA, maybe we'll negotiate there, but if you have nothing to sort of give, and we gave it all as we did over the last 50 years, we gave favored nations stuff to so many countries because we want to help them after World War II, and after Korean War, et cetera. And so, today, I think Trump is correct. We are -- we want to make America great again, we want to be competitive, we want to stop the giveaways and start working for ourselves. As you can see why in our economy, so many people were unemployed and not making as much as they should be doing so. And so, he wants to make that change happen.BARTIROMO: And a lot of people are wondering if this is all about China. Your experience with China, talk to us about that, because I know that if you want to open business in China and you want to sell to the 1.3 billion person population, you better give up some secrets and you can't do it by owning -- you have to own 49 percent of a joint venture.SCHWAB: We've been in Hong Kong for over 20 years. Schwab Office. I have gone to the federal government of China several times. We've tried to get into China ourselves, into mainland China, so we're in Hong Kong which is really not China yet. And we have been unsuccessful in getting a office, a little office in China. They're just the regulatory thing, they won't permit us to do it at this point in time.BARTIROMO: So, there you go.SCHWAB: But yes, they can come here and they could -- they can buy our company, they could buy Citicorp, whatever they want to do, they can do. So, there's not a fair balance between the two countries.BARTIROMO: Right. So, that's why this is more about China, about NAFTA, than anything else. It's an overall strategy. Chuck, let me ask you about Schwab and how things are going, you've been investing in new services, in new products, you've been a big investor in technology.SCHWAB: Totally.BARTIROMO: What's the goal?SCHWAB: Well, the goal is obviously, it's always the same thing, it's to make a great experience for our customers, that's what we want to do. And thank goodness we've been seeing the results of that. We've never seen such a huge influx of new customers, and I have to say particularly over half of our people that are under 35, it's really, really happy for me to see the younger people now participating in the market. They're beginning to think about investing for the long term whether they have need for a house later on or children schooling, et cetera, kids are now beginning to think, boy, what shall I do for myself, personally? That's really gratifying.BARTIROMO: Yes. So, what do you think the growth story is at Schwab? Where does growth come from, look out the next five years?SCHWAB: Well, the tax bill is one massive incentive that this country will grow at probably 2-1/2 -- from 2-1/2 going to three, 3-1/2 probably. I think we're really in for a four number.BARTIROMO: This year?SCHWAB: Maybe not this year but I think certainly next year.BARTIROMO: Next couple of years.SCHWAB: And the momentum going on the influx of money coming back, repatriation of all of that money is just beginning. And that possible -- and that movement, as well as the investment like firms like us, we have now -- because of the tax bill, we have -- our profits are substantially higher than they were last year, because of paying fewer taxes. So, what has happened fundamentally is that all this money has been moving to the private sector. And you know what the private sector does, it sort of has a very much -- it's the engine of growth.BARTIROMO: Of course.SCHWAB: Government is not the engine of growth, it's private sector. So, we have all these new influx of money to the private sector and you're just hang on to your hat.BARTIROMO: Chuck, let me ask you about hanging onto my hat in this volatility, what have you seen from your clients during these days, where we're seeing 1,000-point selloffs, and what are you expecting in terms volatility?SCHWAB: I think volatility is a natural part of the market. It's always been there. I can -- I've lived through so many different ups and downs but just like Warren Buffett says, hang on to your stock because it always -- 10 years later, it's always going to be a whole lot more than it was 10 years ago, it's just the natural thing. And growth is always never a perfect smooth thing but it's up a little bit this year, maybe a little bit down next year -- up next year. But you have to be willing to live these volatility, vicissitudes, and that's the natural thing of the market.BARTIROMO: So, you don't think the backdrop has changed getting --SCHWAB: No, not whatsoever. And as the number gets bigger as the Dow gets 25,000, 20 --you know, the numbers get sort of much bigger. And so, when you have an absolute number, it's not as bad as -- but it's only a one percent move. That's OK.BARTIROMO: Yes.SCHWAB: You know, 50 -- 25 years ago, it used to be the Dow was 600, you know, a six-point move would be one percent; today it's, you know, a lot more.BARTIROMO: Right. So, let's not get afraid of the volatility. And real quick, the options for investors today, I mean, you've got everything from mutual funds, to ETFs, to index funds, and beyond.SCHWAB: We got everything, but the most important thing we think is trying to help people understand what they're doing because we don't have the proper education or schools today, letting kids know what they needed to do for financial freedoms, for themselves, for how they can put money aside for their future opportunities that they have. We don't learn that in schooling (INAUDIBLE) and so that's really a difficult thing. So, our role as a company, to help young people or anyone to understand what is investing, what it's about, what's the best path to get there?BARTIROMO: Chuck, it's great to have you on the program this morning.SCHWAB: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Chuck Schwab is the chairman and founder of Charles Schwab Corporation. He will be my special guest this weekend on "WALL STREET" so we will see you then --SCHWAB: Right.BARTIROMO: -- for the weekend program. We want to recap the breaking news, President Trump is replacing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson with CIA Director Mike Pompeo. Joining me right now on the telephone is former White House Communications Director Antonio Scaramucci. Anthony, your thoughts on this big move?ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, FORMER WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR (via telephone): Maria, good morning. Well, I think it was expected, it was by the insiders, you know, Secretary Tillerson obviously is a -- is a wonderful guy and his great work over the last 13, 14 months, but I think that there was signals in there that he was ready to move on. And you know, the President sort of singles the people that Mike Pompeo, Director Pompeo would be his replacement. And so, the fact that this is happening this morning shouldn't be a surprise to markets, shouldn't be a surprise to the beltway, and when you think about Mike, or Secretary now-designate Pompeo, this guy is an awesome guy.I mean, he went to West Point, Harvard Law School, dedicated service inside the Congress, and, obviously, now as CIA Director, you know, he's got the - - he's got the information necessary but, more importantly, Maria, and you know the President a long time, has a very good personal chemistry with President Trump. These are two guys they get each other, and so my guess is there's going to be a very high comfort level between the President and his new Secretary of State.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, Mike Pompeo had been rumored to get the job. I guess Nikki Haley was in there being talked about a bit as well. But let me ask you, what was the straw that broke the camel's back here? Because I know they had a real difference of agreement on the Qatari situation. The President basically said that Qatar was supporting terrorism and then Rex Tillerson was in Qatar, talking to the leadership there. What else happened that they were against each other?SCARAMUCCI: Well, you know, listen, I mean, they're never going to -- they're never going to air it in that way, Maria, but I do -- I do think that one of -- one of the problems if you go historically for other past Presidents, there usually an incredibly tight relationship between the Secretary of State and the President. You can take James Baker as an example with George Herbert Walker Bush or even going back to Ronald Reagan and George Schultz. And so, I think one of the issues here was, you know, Rex -- Mr. Tillerson met President Trump during the transition and literally I would say five or seven days thereafter they decided to make him the Secretary of State that -- they didn't really have a personal chemistry with each other. So, I think the good news here on the flipside is you've got that personal chemistry now. So, I do think that that lack of personal chemistry probably caused some tension in the communication, and probably caused some tension.You know, the President as you and I know him from here on New York, he's more of a quarterback that will audibles on the line of scrimmage. He's not a guy that goes into the locker room (INAUDIBLE) he call offensive and defensive gameplan, sort of gets to the field, looks at what he sees on the field, and he starts calling plays, that could have been an issue with Secretary Tillerson, but I don't know that directly. But I definitely know that that's the President's personality.BARTIROMO: Anthony, stay with us. I want to get the panel in here as well as Blake Burman. He's live at the White House. Blake, what can you tell us?-- BURMAN: I could tell you that words started circulating within the White House here, Maria, of this -- of this departure last night. That folks within the walls here were made aware of this. The President obviously tweeted about this just moments ago, so this really shouldn't catch those within the White House apparatus surprised. I was just speaking with one member within the apparatus here just a little while ago who told me nothing surprises me at this White House anymore. President Trump is set to leave the White House within minutes here. We can hear the helicopter circulating around as he's set to go to California. Reports are gathered on the South lawn, so we will await to see if the President speaks about this on camera within the upcoming minutes potentially, Maria.BARTIROMO: All right. Blake, thank you so much. I'm back with the panel. Dagen McDowell, your thoughts?MCDOWELL: This has been talked about in private circles and in the media for months. The New York Times is reporting that Mike Pompeo was going to step into this job in late November, I think, and then it was dismissed by President Trump and the White House communication staff. President Trump then calling it fake news, and now it happened. So again, to Anthony's point, it's not a shock because people have been talking about this. And John Kelly, apparently, Anthony, you know, you've had to deal with him, was also kind of wanting Rex Tillerson out the door.BARTIROMO: Is that right, Anthony?SCARAMUCCI: I don't -- I don't -- I don't know that for a hundred percent but I do think that the chemistry, the -- what I do know for a hundred percent is that the chemistry was off, and because of so many departures, they were sort of laying additional departures, but I think -- I think it's better, you know, to get to even my opinion -- of course, my opinion always gets me in trouble, right? I think it's better to restructure, and get -- and get the -- get the President's team together that's the same personality as him.BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Anthony Scaramucci, great to see you again. The news of the day, Mike Pompeo becomes the new CIA Director, Rex Tillerson is out. Thanks to my panel this morning. Let's get to Stuart Varney right now continuing our coverage of the breaking news. Over to you, Stu.Load-Date: March 13, 2018End of Document

USTR led an extensive investigation based on a thorough analysis of evidence and comments received from academics, think tanks, law firms, trade associations, and American companies and workers.The investigation concluded that China uses foreign ownership restrictions, such as joint venture requirements and administrative review and licensing processes to force or pressure U.S. companies to transfer technology to Chinese entities.China requires foreign companies that access their New Energy Vehicles market to transfer core technologies to a joint venture and disclose development and manufacturing technology for the entire vehicle.The investigation concluded that China forces U.S. companies seeking to license technologies to Chinese entities to do so on non-market based terms.China imposes contractual restrictions on the licensing of intellectual property and foreign technology into their country, but does not put the same restrictions on contracts between two Chinese enterprises.The investigation concluded that China directs and unfairly facilitates investments and acquisitions to generate large-scale technology transfer from U.S. companies to Chinese entities.A Chinese government-backed fund helped Apex Technology Co., a Chinese investment consortium, acquire a U.S. computer-printer maker which had previously sued Apex over patent infringement.The investigation concluded that China conducts and supports cyber intrusions into U.S. companies to access their sensitive commercial information, such as trade secrets.In 2014, the U.S. charged five Chinese military hackers for cyber espionage committed against U.S. corporations and a labor organization for commercial advantage.An interagency analysis estimates that China's unfair acts, policies, and practices cause tens of billions in damages to the United States each year.CONFRONTING UNFAIR TRADE: President Trump has made clear that his Administration will confront unfair trade practices that harm American commerce.Since taking office, President Trump has sought to confront unfair trade practices that have harmed American commerce for far too long.The President's Administration conducted 82 antidumping and countervailing duty investigations in 2017.This was a 58 percent increase in investigations over 2016.In January, the President announced new safeguard tariffs on imported large residential washing machines and solar cells.The President's decision to implement the tariffs was based on recommendations by the bi-partisan, independent International Trade Commission.President Trump's Administration has successfully litigated WTO disputes targeting unfair trade practices and upholding our right to enact fair trade laws.In February 2018, USTR won a WTO compliance challenge against China's unfair antidumping and countervailing duties on U.S. poultry exports, and China announced the termination of those duties.In November 2017, the United States won a WTO dispute regarding Indonesia's unfair import licensing regime restricting U.S. agricultural exports.In October 2017, a WTO compliance panel found that U.S. tuna labeling rules designed to inform consumers about safe fishing practices were consistent with WTO standards.In September 2017, the WTO rejected allegations by the European Union that Boeing was receiving prohibited subsidies.In June 2017, a WTO compliance panel rejected almost all claims by the European Union that alleged U.S. subsidies to Boeing were causing serious prejudice to Airbus, instead finding that 28 of 29 challenged programs were consistent with WTO rules.Load-Date: March 22, 2018End of Document

We're going to defend our industry and create a level playing field for the American worker - finally. President Donald J. TrumpPROTECTING AMERICAN COMPETITIVENESS: President Donald J. Trump is taking action to address Chinese policies and practices that are harming American innovation.The President has directed his Administration to consider a range of actions to respond to China's acts, policies, and practices involving the unfair and harmful acquisition of U.S. technology. President Trump's Administration will propose for public comment adding 25 percent additional tariffs on certain products that are supported by China's unfair industrial policy. Sectors subject to the proposed tariffs will include aerospace, information communication technology, and machinery. USTR will confront China's discriminatory technology licensing practices through a World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute proceeding. The Department of Treasury, in consultation with other agencies, will propose restrictions on investment by China in sensitive U.S. technology. A THREAT TO AMERICAN INNOVATION: President Donald J. Trump based his actions in large part on the findings of the Section 301 investigation conducted by his Administration.In August, President Trump's Administration launched an investigation into Chinese acts, policies, and practices related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation. The U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) led the investigation under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which gives the USTR broad authority subject to Presidential direction to eliminate unfair trade practices or policies that burden U.S. commerce. This was the first Section 301 investigation since 2013. USTR led an extensive investigation based on a thorough analysis of evidence and comments received from academics, think tanks, law firms, trade associations, and American companies and workers. The investigation concluded that China uses foreign ownership restrictions, such as joint venture requirements and administrative review and licensing processes to force or pressure U.S. companies to transfer technology to Chinese entities. China requires foreign companies that access their New Energy Vehicles market to transfer core technologies to a joint venture and disclose development and manufacturing technology for the entire vehicle. The investigation concluded that China forces U.S. companies seeking to license technologies to Chinese entities to do so on non-market based terms. China imposes contractual restrictions on the licensing of intellectual property and foreign technology into their country, but does not put the same restrictions on contracts between two Chinese enterprises. The investigation concluded that China directs and unfairly facilitates investments and acquisitions to generate large-scale technology transfer from U.S. companies to Chinese entities. A Chinese government-backed fund helped Apex Technology Co., a Chinese investment consortium, acquire a U.S. computer-printer maker which had previously sued Apex over patent infringement. The investigation concluded that China conducts and supports cyber intrusions into U.S. companies to access their sensitive commercial information, such as trade secrets. In 2014, the U.S. charged five Chinese military hackers for cyber espionage committed against U.S. corporations and a labor organization for commercial advantage. An interagency analysis estimates that China's unfair acts, policies, and practices cause tens of billions in damages to the United States each year. CONFRONTING UNFAIR TRADE: President Trump has made clear that his Administration will confront unfair trade practices that harm American commerce.Since taking office, President Trump has sought to confront unfair trade practices that have harmed American commerce for far too long. The President's Administration conducted 82 antidumping and countervailing duty investigations in 2017. This was a 58 percent increase in investigations over 2016. In January, the President announced new safeguard tariffs on imported large residential washing machines and solar cells. The President's decision to implement the tariffs was based on recommendations by the bi-partisan, independent International Trade Commission. President Trump's Administration has successfully litigated WTO disputes targeting unfair trade practices and upholding our right to enact fair trade laws. In February 2018, USTR won a WTO compliance challenge against China's unfair antidumping and countervailing duties on U.S. poultry exports, and China announced the termination of those duties. In November 2017, the United States won a WTO dispute regarding Indonesia's unfair import licensing regime restricting U.S. agricultural exports. In October 2017, a WTO compliance panel found that U.S. tuna labeling rules designed to inform consumers about safe fishing practices were consistent with WTO standards. In September 2017, the WTO rejected allegations by the European Union that Boeing was receiving prohibited subsidies. In June 2017, a WTO compliance panel rejected almost all claims by the European Union that alleged U.S. subsidies to Boeing were causing serious prejudice to Airbus, instead finding that 28 of 29 challenged programs were consistent with WTO rules.

China's unwanted bitcoin miners may move to CanadaCNN WireFebruary 9, 2018 Friday 7:31 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 991 wordsByline: By Daniel ShaneDateline: HONG KONG (CNNMoney) BodyHONG KONG (CNNMoney) --  Once the global hub for all things bitcoin, China is now doing its best to drive the cryptocurrency out of its territory.After cracking down last year on exchanges where digital currencies are traded, the Chinese government has recently been moving quietly to evict the country's vast community of bitcoin miners. That's forcing them to look into moving to other countries, with Canada attracting a lot of interest.Unlike traditional currencies like the dollar, the creation of bitcoin isn't controlled by central banks. Instead, it's "mined" by computer algorithms that solve increasingly complex math problems. People can earn money unearthing cryptocurrencies from the digital deep by running the mining software on computer systems of varying sizes, a process that requires a lot of electricity.About 60% of all cryptocurrency mining takes place in China, according to a study last year by the University of Cambridge. The country is a good fit for the activity because of the cheap electricity and land available in provincial areas. But the industry is feeling unwelcome these days."It's a hard time for the mining business in China," said Jack Liao, who owns several bitcoin mines in the country.He said in a recent interview with CNNMoney that he's thinking about moving some of his operations overseas, with Canada, the U.S. and Iceland among the top candidates. Liao is the CEO of cryptocurrency mining firm Lightningasic, which is based in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen.Five other owners of bitcoin mines in China also told CNNMoney in the past month that they were considering moving operations out of the country because of pressure from the government. Most declined to be identified by name for this article due to the sensitivity of the situation.The Chinese government wants cryptocurrency miners to make an "orderly exit" from the industry because their operations are bad for the environment, don't pay tax and can be a fire hazard, Liao said, citing reports in Chinese state-run media.China has shown its willingness to crack down on other aspects of the cryptocurrency industry. It forced exchanges inside the country to shutter trading operations in September. And it's now reported to be moving to block the websites of overseas trading platforms.The Chinese government didn't respond to requests from CNNMoney for comment on its stance on bitcoin mining and trading.Experts say the Chinese government, which imposed controls in recent years aimed at stopping too much money from flowing out of the country, is wary of how cryptocurrencies can enable people to move funds outside of the traditional financial system and potentially put them to nefarious uses.Efforts by governments around the world to take an increasingly hard line on cryptocurrencies have contributed to the recent sharp decline in their prices. After getting close to $20,000 in late 2017, bitcoin tumbled below $6,000 this week.For the people running bitcoin mines in China, the big question at the moment is figuring out where to go.Running a bitcoin mine has a very specific list of requirements. The energy needs are huge for one thing. Digital currency website Digiconomist last year reported that one bitcoin mine it visited in Inner Mongolia used the same amount of power that's needed to continuously fly a Boeing 747."You need a country that can provide such a big capacity at a reasonable price," Liao said. Miners also want a government that's going to take a hands-off approach to regulating cryptocurrencies. Canada ticks a lot of boxes. The country has cheap, reliable energy sources, as well as a chilly climate. The latter helps servers keep cool to prevent them overheating. Interest from Chinese bitcoin miners is already being noticed in the country.Hydro Quebec, a big electricity supplier in eastern Canada, is receiving "new requests every day" for its services from bitcoin mining firms, said spokesman Marc-Antoine Pouliot. He added that the majority of these requests were coming from China and that demand had "risen significantly" since the end of last summer, when Chinese authorities stepped up their crackdown on bitcoin exchanges. Hydro Quebec has about 30 projects from bitcoin miners in its pipeline, Pouliot said. Hydro Manitoba, a power provider in central Canada, said it had also been approached by a number of North American brokers representing Chinese bitcoin miners in recent months. Among their requirements was the reassurance that their mammoth energy demands could be met and that they could get operations up and running quickly, said Bruce Owen, a Hydro Manitoba spokesman. Unlike more everyday business ventures, bitcoin mining gobbles up energy all day and all night."There is little time variation in their electric requirements -- it is nearly constant 24/7," Owen said. Other Canadian companies also see potential business opportunities from bitcoin miners' interest in the country.Resolute Forest Products is one of Canada's biggest manufacturers of tissues and paper products. The company, based in Montreal, has "received multiple calls" from bitcoin miners who want to use spare space in its factories, said spokesman Seth Kursman. The company is still in the process of figuring out what kind of services it can provide, he said.Uprooting an entire bitcoin mine is no easy feat, however.Liao said it can take months to find a new location, buy computer equipment and hire new staff to help you run the facility. The costs can be eye-watering, too. He claimed they can run into hundreds of millions of dollars, depending on the size of the operations. Liao and other mine owners will have to make their big decisions on where to go while watching bitcoin's volatile price rising and falling by thousands of dollars on an almost daily basis.-- Serenitie Wang contributed to this report. TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

No injuries were reported.Authorities appear to be censoring mentions of the fire online and suppressing any details of the cause or aftermath.Some social media posts on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform like Twitter, appear to have been erased by government censors. The ability to re-post and comment on other posts was disabled by Monday afternoon after working earlier in the day. The status of Tibet is one of China's most sensitive politics topics. Travel to the region is heavily restricted and news about the region is often censored. Jokhang Temple is widely considered to be one of the most sacred and important sites in Tibet. Buddhist pilgrims prostrate themselves in front of the temple every day, as they have since it was first built in the 7th century.CNN could not independently confirm the authenticity of videos being shared online showing the fire, and could not reach authorities for comment due to the Lunar New Year holiday.Chinese state media Xinhua said the bustling Barkhor market which surrounds the temple was reopened Sunday. The temple was also open Sunday but will be closed for the next few days as monks celebrate the New Year holiday, Xinhua reported.China's state-controlled Tibet Daily News confirmed there had been a fire but it has since been put out. No one was hurt and the surrounding area is now "back to normal," according to the paper. A hallowed site under a watchful eyeJokhang is one of China's most heavily-secured sites. The square outside the temple has seen a number of anti-China demonstrations by Buddhist monks over the years, protesting what they say are consistent attempts by the Chinese government to suppress Tibetan culture and religious freedom.The temple itself is constructed mainly of wood. It's age, primary building materials, constant burning of incense inside and the fact that the interiors are small and cramped, would make firefighting difficult. A CNN team that visited the temple in 2016 saw little firefighting equipment. Simmering tensionTibet was nominally independent following the collapse of the Qing dynasty, but was incorporated into the People's Republic of China in 1951, after the communist party won the country's civil war, to the chagrin of many in the Tibetan Buddhist community. After a failed revolt against Chinese rule in 1959, the 14th Dalai Lama -- Tibet's spiritual leader -- fled to India. The Dalai Lama's former home, the Potala Palace, is located just a few kilometers away from Jokhang Temple.Simmering defiance from Tibetans sometimes boils over into large-scale riots. Activists say more than 140 people have lit themselves on fire in protest of Beijing's rule since 2009.China requires all foreign tourists to have permits and sometimes shuts down access for weeks at a time. It only rarely allows reporters to visit the region. CNN has been permitted to visit twice since 2006.However, China has been grooming the region for a boom in tourism. New villages have been built and a second rail line, connecting Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, to Lhasa has been. China already has a 1,956 kilometer railway line between Qinghai and Tibet.Many Tibetans feel that the increase in visitors and the influx of Han Chinese, China's dominant ethnic group, has put their native culture and religion under siege from a government that sees religion as an existential threat to their leadership.CNN's Qiaoqiao Yu contributed to this reportTM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Why tech secrets, not steel, could cause the real clash between the U.S. and ChinaCNN WireFebruary 21, 2018 Wednesday 4:47 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1087 wordsByline: By Julia HorowitzDateline: NEW YORK (CNNMoney) BodyNEW YORK (CNNMoney) --  Steel and aluminum tariffs aren't the only explosive trade issue between the United States and China. Stolen trade secrets are also poised to become a flash point as the United States weighs how to transform President Donald Trump's tough talk on China into policy.The Trump administration opened an investigation into intellectual property theft by China in August. Officials have more recently signaled that an announcement on next steps is imminent.U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross called high tech the "next area of challenge" with China. Trump teased a "very big intellectual property fine" against China in a recent interview with Reuters. IP theft was even name-checked in Trump's State of the Union address.But defending intellectual property is a notoriously thorny issue - and any push from Washington runs the risk of retaliation from Beijing."As with every administration, there seems to be a range of options on the table from the extreme to the modest," said William Reinsch, a trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who also served in the Bill Clinton administration. "What is different is I think this president is more inclined to the extreme."Why we're talking about tech secretsChinese intellectual property theft from U.S. businesses has been an area of concern for years, both because of its security ramifications and its cost to companies.IP theft includes the sale of counterfeit goods and pirated software, as well as stolen corporate secrets. It costs the American economy between $225 billion and $600 billion per year, according to the 2017 report from the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property, a group co-chaired by former U.S. ambassador to China Jon Huntsman.The issue has become a particular point of contention as China works to remake its economy, shifting from low-end industry into high-tech incubation."China has gotten increasingly concerned that it's not going to be able to survive as the low cost manufacturer to the world," said Phil Levy, a fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs who previously served as a trade adviser to President George W. Bush.In 2015, China formally announced its intention to be a technology leader in a state industrial plan called "Made in China 2025." Priorities include ramping up domestic production of electric cars and developing a premier 5G mobile network. China also plans to dominate in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030 and is rapidly expanding its capacity to make computer chips.To achieve these goals, China needs a lot of industrial and technological know-how - which is where the country's interest in foreign intellectual property comes in.How intellectual property theft happensCybertheft has been less of a problem since President Barack Obama received assurances from Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2015 that China would stop hacking corporate trade secrets.The prevailing concern now is the fact that companies are forced to transfer technology in order to do business in China, according to experts.China typically requires companies that want to enter the country to pair up with domestic firms in joint ventures. Such partnerships can give Chinese companies access to information that foreign companies would otherwise keep private."In order to play in that market, you have to disgorge information [and] you have to make it available to local operators," said Brian O'Shaughnessy, an attorney who specializes in IP law at the law firm Dinsmore & Shohl.In June 2017, China enacted a law that tightened restrictions on cross-border data transfers and mandated that critical data be stored locally. The Chinese government framed the law as an effort to shore up cybersecurity, but critics see it as further means for China to monitor and control online information."Companies could be asked to submit source code to the Chinese government under the auspices of a security review," said Samm Sacks, a senior fellow in the Technology Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "But in doing so, they risk revealing their IP."Such policies and arrangements have built up skepticism among American companies that are otherwise eager to tap into China's massive market. More than 80 percent of members of the US-China Business Council, a leading trade organization for American companies that do business in China, said they're concerned "about China's policies on data flows and technology security," according to a 2017 member survey. To comply with the new data law, Apple said in July that it will store the iCloud data of mainland customers with a state-owned company in Guizhou. In November, Amazon Web Services sold the hardware it uses for cloud storage to its local Chinese partner to satisfy the new rules.The next stepsExperts say it's not clear how the Trump administration's intellectual property investigation into China will play out. There's one scenario in which President Trump takes a more restrained route, opting to file a complaint with the World Trade Organization once the investigation is complete. Concerns over trade violations are typically taken up with the WTO from the start, so that course would help normalize the situation at hand.But Trump could also decide to act unilaterally, citing the scope of the IP theft problem and the need for harsh penalties. That could mean dramatic restrictions on Chinese investment in the United States, or tariffs on a wide range of consumer products, without the WTO's blessing.Such moves would shake the global trading system - and would be impossible for China to ignore.At a press conference in January, China Commerce Ministry spokesperson Gao Feng criticized the United States' decision to launch the investigation via domestic laws, thus circumventing the WTO."If the U.S. insists on adopting unilateral protectionist measures no matter what, and hurt China's interests, [the Chinese government] will take necessary measures to firmly uphold China's legitimate rights and interests," he said.If Trump goes big on tariffs, the U.S. economy would be affected, too."A [U.S.] retaliation sufficient to change China's conduct would be so large as to significantly injure both the United States' and China's economies," said Matt Gold, an international trade law expert at Fordham University.

Online courses benefit children in poor areasPR NewswireMarch 29, 2018 Thursday 9:00 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 777 wordsDateline: BEIJING, March 29, 2018 BodyA news report by China.org.cn on China's live streaming industry transforming the classes in poor areas: There are only three students at Lumacha Primary School in a remote, mountainous area of northwest China's Gansu province. As the children from better-off families in the community have been sent to more well-equipped schools, the three remaining have come to represent the most underprivileged members of Chinese society.Fortunately, live streaming, the trendiest social activity among Chinese youth, is transforming the classes in Lumacha. With only an internet cable, an overhead projector and a webcam, the three students are now able to take part in online courses. A music teacher appears on the screen, instructing the children on how to read musical notation while correcting their singing. There is also a teaching assistant present in the classroom to manage the students.In Gansu, there are nearly 1,000 schools like Lumacha with less than five students. In order to provide a better education to these children, provincial authorities launched a pilot online education project in 2017. Now, all of the schools in Lumacha's district have adopted the same class schedule and recruited excellent teachers to give online courses. By switching video feeds, online teachers can monitor and interact with students in different schools. Live streaming has connected children in rural areas together. Some outgoing and versatile students have even become "online celebrities."The rapid development of China's internet has brought changes to education in poor areas with underdeveloped infrastructure and few teachers. Broadband construction in rural areas has been accelerating, and new online education companies keep springing up, bringing better public services and technologies to rural schools. The government and its national strategies have both played major roles in pushing it all forward.Promoting educational equity is one of the issues that the Communist Party of China and the government pay the most attention to, because it is an important basis for social equity. Nine-year compulsory education was implemented across the entire country by 2014, and now, through live broadcasts online, poor students in Lumacha Primary School can get access to arts curricula that were inaccessible in the past, reflecting an even deeper pursuit of educational equity.China's significant progress in internet technology and artificial intelligence in recent years has attracted global attention. At the same time, a spotlight has been shone into the poorest corners of China. It is evident that the Chinese government is working to develop its economy, while still paying attention to social equality, so that economic growth can be shared by everyone. Some changes may take time, but they are on the way.China Mosaichttp://www.china.org.cn/video/node_7230027.htmOnline courses benefit children in poor areashttp://www.china.org.cn/video/2018-03/29/content_50767910.htmAbout China.org.cnFounded in 2000, China Internet Information Center (China.org.cn/China.com.cn) is a key state news website under the auspices of the State Council Information Office, and is managed by China International Publishing Group.

U.S., China Quietly Seek Trade Solutions After Days of Loud Threats; Easing Trade Tensions; Support For Economic Vision; Hillary's DisrespectMORNINGS WITH MARIA MORNINGS WITH MARIA 8:00 AM ESTMarch 26, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; FinancialLength: 8019 wordsByline: Maria Bartiromo, Mitch Roschelle, Dagen McDowell, Adam Shapiro, Cheryl Casone, Jared Max; Stuart Varney, Nicole PetallidesGuests: Lee Carter, Gary Locke, Rob Manfred, Harvey Mason, Jr.BodyMARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Welcome back. Good Monday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Monday, March 26th. Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast. Averting a trade war. The Wall Street Journal is reporting that the White House and China have held behind-the-scenes negotiations in an effort to ease rising tensions following the administration's move to impose strict tariffs. Futures are jumping on the story. Take a look. Dow Industrials up almost 300 points. White House Trade Advisor Peter Navarro weighed in on the President's trade strategy yesterday with me on "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES".(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL TRADE COUNCIL: President's vision here, it's stunningly brilliant. What he's trying to bring about is a fundamental reordering of the global trading system in a way which focuses on free markets, fair trade and reciprocal trade. It's really important to understand that everything the President does every morning that he goes to work is all centered around driving economic growth and creating jobs. Not just here in America but around the world.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The news coming after a rough week for stocks. The Dow closed down yet again on Friday, capping a week which saw all three major indices down about six percent. In Europe this morning we're seeing gains across the board even if just fractional. FT-100, CAC quarante up a half of a percent. DAX Index up two-thirds of a percent. And in Asia overnight, stocks were mostly higher with the exception of China. All the majors up almost one percent. Supporting history, new Fox polls say that the majority of Americans are in favor of President Trump's plans to meet with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. Netflix banned, the big blow to the streaming service as it is told it cannot compete at the Cannes Film Festival. And another celebrity disappears from Snapchat. The details as model Chrissy Teigen becomes the latest to ditch the app. Then Sister Jean meets the Wolverines and number ones square off. More on their road to the final four coming up.Plus, shifting gears, one student driver hits the gas straight into the driving school. Oh, we are breaking down that accident coming up this morning. Nobody was hurt. Wow. All those stories coming up this Monday morning and joining me to talk all about it, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, PwC Partner, Mitch Roschelle, and pollster and the President of Maslansky and Partners, Lee Carter is here. Great to see you.LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS: That was a bad driving test.(CROSSTALK)MITCH ROSCHELLE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: Full disclosure, not a member of my family.(CROSSTALK)CARTER: Can you imagine that poor kid?(CROSSTALK)DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: It's usually some old person darting for the handicapped space in front of the golden corral. (INAUDIBLE) it happens all the time. My father saw a woman jump the railroad tracks in her truck in a car once, an elderly woman, Mrs. (Niece), may she rest in piece, jumped the railroad tracks right in the middle of Brookneal, hitting the gas, rather than the brakes. It was something from a Steve McQueen movie.BARTIROMO: Oh, that's crazy. We got a lot on top this morning. Joining the conversation, former U .S. Ambassador to China and former Commerce Secretary Gary Locke is joining us momentarily. The host of "VARNEY & VARNEY", Stuart Varney weighs in as well. And then award-winning record producer, Harvey Mason Jr. is here. Wait until you see some of the shows and music he has produced. Big interview coming up. And we kick it off right here with this hour. And a look at Futures, markets on a scare right now, the Wall Street Journal is reporting that Washington and Beijing have begun negotiations on improving U.S. access to Chinese market. Adam Shapiro has live at the White House right now with the details. Adam, good morning to you.ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: And a good morning to you, Maria. And we know that whether the things the Trump administration wants the Chinese to do is buy more semiconductors. As well as the President last week he said he wants reciprocal trades in which the tariffs against U.S. autos exports which is 25 percent in China get dropped down to -- he says the two percent it's about 2-1/2 percent when we import automobiles from China into the United States. But the President this morning also has a bit of a victory because it's been announced that the United States in its negotiations with South Korea have concluded and there are changes to the trade agreement with South Korea. So the President this morning has tweeted "The economy is looking really good, it has been many years that we have -- that we have seen these kind of numbers. The underlying strength of companies has perhaps never been better." And Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary was on Fox News Sunday yesterday in which he talked about the discussions with China and what the administration is trying to you achieve. Here is what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STEVEN MNUCHIN, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY: We're working on a pathway to see if we can reach an agreement as to what fair trade is for them to open up their markets, reduce their tariffs, stop forced technology transfer. These are all the things we want to do. But in a negotiation, have you to be prepared to take action and that's President Trump is doing.(END VIDEO CLIP)SHAPIRO: The administration not afraid of a trade war, nor are the Chinese for that matter but as you pointed out, Maria, the markets are seeming to be calmer and liking the fact that both sides are talking. Real quick on the South Korea deal, it will allow U.S. auto manufacturers to double the number of cars they export to South Korea. It will also make permanent, the exemption for South Korea from the current steel tariff. Back to you.BARTIROMO: All right. We'll be watching that. Adam, thank you. Adam Shapiro. Joining me right now to talk more about it is former U.S. ambassador to China, former Commerce Secretary, former governor of Washington State, now senior advisor and consultant at Davis Wright trimming, Gary Locke is with us right now. Good to see you, sir. Thanks so much for joining us.GARY LOCKE, ADVISOR AND CONSULTANT, DAVIS WRIGHT TREMAINE: Good to see you, Maria.BARTIROMO: What do you think this is about? How do you think the U.S. can make a dent in that $375 billion deficit with the Chinese? What would you like to see?LOCKE: We certainly have legitimate concerns about China's trade practices. China requires technology transfer. In many cases, so many parts of the Chinese economy are off limits to foreign and U.S. investment whereas there are virtually no impediments to Chinese investment here in America. So that's an unlevel playing field. And when American companies do invest in China oftentimes they have to have a local partner which means transferring your knowledge, sharing your knowledge or intellectual property or trade secrets with those partners which then ultimately overtime will take it and run with it and hurt U.S. companies. So there's been for long an unlevel playing field against U.S. and foreign companies. That's what we need to target. I'm concerned that these tariffs, these surcharges on Chinese goods coming into the United States will not help us achieve that purpose of leveling the playing field. Instead, it's just going to raise the prices that American consumers pay, whether it's at Target, Macy's, Costco, Home Depot, you name it. And in many cases, mane of these products that are coming from China, that's the only place where you can get them. I mean, no one in America makes microwave ovens anymore. They're all coming from China. Electronic goods, clothing, toys. So, ultimately it's just going to raise the price of -- that Americans face which means less money in their pockets for buying a car, vacation, college tuition.BARTIROMO: Yes, I know. I understand. So then what is the answer, Gary? I mean, you know, we know that China is trying to transfer technology from the United States to China and they're doing it in the very industries that are supposed to be the industries of tomorrow, like robotics, like A.I., biotech, all these very important leadership industries. So, if it's not tariffs, what other restrictions should be in place against China? Because I know like if you're a Ford motor, for example and you want to sell in China to the 1.3 billion person population, the first thing you have to do according to the Chinese government is give them all your technology. You have to basically say, OK, here's how we do the cars, here's how we have inserted technology all over the cars and then maybe you can get a foothold in China but you certainly won't get more than 49 percent of any joint venture, even then.LOCKE: Well, that's why I think that United States has to work with all of our allies around the world and the E.U. and elsewhere that have been subjected to these same unfair treatment and rules and regulations and together we impose basically the same restrictions on China. China very much wants to invest and buy companies and partner with U.S. companies and other foreign companies around the world. We need to put restrictions on their ability to invest and go abroad as well.BARTIROMO: Yes. How much of this is also about a national security concern, Gary? Because I think most people and certainly businesses in the United States, big businesses who have tried to get a foothold in China, they understand this. They know that they haven't been given a fair shake. They will only be allowed to own 49 percent of a joint venture. They have to give up all their technology secrets. But in terms of national security, the chairman of the House Intel Committee, Devin Nunes was with me yesterday and he right now told me he's investigating Chinese practices over intellectual property theft but he also says China's manipulation goes beyond that to military and infrastructure. Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NUNES: The Chinese just opened up a base, a military base in Jaboti, Jaboti is at the entrance of the Red Sea in the heart of the Middle East at the -- at --in the Indian Ocean, a long way away from China. We believe that they are looking at investing in ports and infrastructure around the globe, not just for military capabilities but also to control those governments to have -- to have the ability to lobby and manipulate governments.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: That's a big deal, Ambassador.LOCKE: It is. And that's why you had so many members of the U.S. military saying that the state department needs to invest more in terms of its soft power, it's diplomatic outreach and programs all around the world so that we build up the brand of America that we create allies and partners. I mean, China is really stepping into the vacuum created by the United States. And long ago we used to have programs to help people farm, to bring water, clean water and hospitals and build bridges and roads. We're not doing that anymore. Who is? China. And China's creating that favorable political strategic climate all around the world to our detriment. Getting back to the issue of intellectual property and technology, America really needs to put more money into supporting basic R&D in things like robotics and Artificial Intelligence. China is throwing billions of dollars at the world's premier foremost scientists and researchers in this area, creating laboratories for them, paying for all their staff. They're enticing people from around the world to set up their laboratories in China. Where is America? That's how we need to really confront some of these technological challenges facing them.BARTIROMO: Yes. These are -- these are big issues. And by the way, the President yesterday said that he wants to cut the trade imbalance by $100 billion. Do you think he'll be able to do that? Get it down to 275 versus the current 375 billion?LOCKE: I don't know if he will or not. I don't think that tariffs, surcharges on taxes, imposed on Chinese goods coming into the United States will do that because so much of what we're facing is as we said an unlevel playing field for U.S. and foreign companies in China where they're limited in what they can invest in, where they have to have a partner. Raising the prices of Chinese goods coming into the United States will slow down the Chinese economy to a bit, not much, because so much of what we buy is only made in China. So, Americans are going to continue buying things from China. They're just going to pay more which means less money in their pockets for other things. So, we've got to stop this trade war.BARTIROMO: You want something done but you don't think the current tariff story is the way to do it. Let me get your take on North Korea because then there's that as well. The President made a surprise decision earlier this month to accept an invitation to meet with North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un in May. Now a new Fox News poll finds a majority of voters approve of that decision by a margin of 63 to 30 percent. What are your thoughts on this bilateral meeting and will China be involved?LOCKE: Well, I think it's always good that we have talks as opposed to confrontation and bluster and so we need to lower the temperature and get the size sides talking. And if the President is meeting with the North Korean leader can help set the stage, start that process that's all well and good. But we need to be careful and we need to make sure that China is involved because ultimately North Korea will not give up their nuclear arsenal unless they have guarantees for their safety. North Korea is definitely afraid that the United States is somehow and North -- South Korea and Japan will invade North Korea. Topple the North Korean regime which is why they have their nuclear arsenal, it's kind of their ace in the hole, make sure that nobody crosses that border. But if they do give up their nukes, they're going to want to make sure that they have guarantees for their security, that China and Russia will come to their rescue, will defend them, will protect them. That's why we need to be very, very careful in our diplomacy and all of our negotiations with China and so many other issues.BARTIROMO: Yes. So do you believe this is actually happening though, that we are having these diplomatic talks? I mean, the markets are rallying today, Ambassador on the idea that China and the U.S. have been in talks and they're going to make a change in terms of trade and some of these issues. Are you buying it?LOCKE: Well, I -- I'm not privy to those discussions or to the intelligence. Let's just hope that the talks are for real, that we're starting and we're serious about it. That both sides are serious.BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Ambassador Gary Locke, it's always a pleasure. Thanks so much. We appreciate it.LOCKE: Thank you.BARTIROMO: We'll see you soon, sir. And we just showed the futures. Let's show that again because we're at the highs of the morning right now up better than 300 points on the Dow Jones Industrial average. The NASDAQ up better than 100 points. We're talking about a gain of 1-1/3 percent on the Dow and almost two percent on the NASDAQ at the start of trading in about an hour. Coming up. Supermodel Chrissy Teigen ditching Snapchat. The latest celebrity backlash for this social media company. That's next. And then a driver's exam coming to a crash and halt. How a teenager managed to slam into the local DMV during her test. She didn't pass the test. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Spotify issuing a revenue forecast ahead of next week's initial public offering. Cheryl Casone with the details now. Cheryl?CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes. More details for Spotify. They says that their -- they see a revenue growing by as much as 30 percent this year. That works out to nearly $7 billion. Although that would be less than last year's 39 percent revenue increase for them. Shares of Spotify set to start trading on the New York Stock Exchange on April 3rd.OK. Take a look at this historic touchdown. This is the first direct flight between Australia and the U.K. . It safely arrived at London's Heathrow Airport overnight. This is the Qantas flight that flew more than 9,000 miles in just over 17 hours. There's a flight for you. The plane itself a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, had 200 passengers and 16 crew on-board. By the way, the Dreamliner is twice as fuel efficient as the Boeing 747 Jumbo Jet which they've actually discontinued.Chrissy Teigen the latest celebrity to dump Snapchat following the redesign of the messaging app and a controversial ad about Rihanna and Chris Brown that appeared to mock domestic violence. Here's what she quoted, that's what she said on Twitter. I stopped using Snap, the update, the constant complaints, the people not being able to find me plus the Rihanna poll, no bueno. Snapchat subsequently issued an apology but the stock tumbled earlier this month after Rihanna criticized the ad Instagram. Stocks to watch today is certainly let's see if that has an effect, Snapchat shares are higher in the premarket, up more --almost two percent as you can see you on your screen.And then here's a story for you that I'm sure parents are going to love. A Minnesota teenager crashed into the DMV office while she was taking her driver's test. Police say that she accidentally shifted into drive instead of reverse and the adult tested that was with her had to be taken to the hospital, just minor injuries. The 17-year-old driver was not hurt either, nor was anybody inside of the DMV. No word , Maria, on when she's going to take her test over. If ever. We'll see. Yes.BARTIROMO: That's scary.CASONE: A parent's nightmare.BARTIROMO: Yes.ROSCHELLE: I would not take her to that location, that's for sure.BARTIROMO: Right in there. Move.MCDOWELL: Drive starts with a D, R stands for reverse. It happens a lot. Is it a Southern thing? I don't know but I've actually seen this happened where somebody drives right through the front of the convenient store by accident.BARTIROMO: Wow. Oh, god.CARTER: You've seen it happen.MCDOWELL: Yes, I've seen it happen. Because people are --- it's a lot of times it's elderly people like I said fighting for the handicap spot right in front and they're like racing and they, you know, and rather than hitting the brake, they push the accelerator down.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: You're going to love this next story coming up. We're going to take a break. When we come back, Senator Claire McCaskill is calling out Hillary Clinton for her comments attacking Trump voters. What she said coming up next. And the final four, no one saw coming, we break down the highlights from March madness. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. What a weekend in college basketball. The final four is set. Jared Max has the details. Jared?JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTSCASTER: Good morning, Maria. Yesterday's game between top-seed Kansas and number two Duke, the best of the tournament so far. 11 ties, 18 lead changes, back and forth until overtime. The Midwest region final in Omaha tied at 72. Final seconds regulation, Grayson Allen a chance to win it for Duke, say good night, Graysee, no. It doesn't get the lucky bounce, so we go to overtime where it was time to say hello, Newman. Malik Newman of the Kansas Jayhawks delivered. Newman, 32 points of the game. Newman scored all of Kansas' points in overtime. Drained five threes and all, Kansas in the final four for the first time in six years. 85-81. Second time in three years, Villanova going to the final four, 2016 champions, scored their fourth straight win by double digits. Wildcats beat Red Raiders of Texas Tech, 71-59 and a sense of a great matchup in San Antonio next weekend. Saturday night at the Alamodome. First up, 6:09 Eastern, it will be the Cinderella Ramblers of Loyola- Chicago underdogs of five against Michigan. And then 40 minutes after the first game, top seeds Kansas and Villanova square off. Nova, a five-point favorite. Loyola-Chicago has Sister Jean but Villanova has Father Rob. Yes. The priest is on the team bench who guard Dante DiVincenzo calls the rock of the team. Father Rob said he very much looks forward to meeting Sister Jean. Loyola Chicago's 98-year-old Chaplain and star of this tournament, now she's been given her blessing for the school to market her. Loyola Chicago's has reportedly approved in excess of 25 different Sister Jean t-shirts for various companies like this one.For the first time in 25 years, a NASCAR race was postponed by snow. The STP500 in Martinsville, Virginia had to get pushed back until today because snowplows and emergency vehicles in the area were needed elsewhere, not at the track. So they will race today instead. Two of the more colorful figures in recent sports history have become a viral video tandem. New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski and Hall of Fame basketball star Shaquille O'Neal, what happens when the two of these get involved? Well, Rob takes off his shirt and eventually Shaq would put off on his shoulders. The video has gone viral receiving well over 1.5 million views. How do you get on somebody's shoulders if you're Gronk? If you watch the final couple minutes of an NBA game, you've seen it all, right? Well, the league is now offering fans the chance to spend 99 cents to stream just the fourth quarter. It's like buying the greatest hits album. Oh, and speaking of streaming live sports, did you hear baseball commissioner Rob Manfred told Maria Bartiromo just 30 minutes ago?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: It's when you're at home.ROB MANFRED, COMMISSIONER, MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL: Home. And every one of those breaks is an opportunity to tune away. We pay a lot of attention to what's going on in other sports. We've been fortunate, however. Our last two World Series have been really successful in terms of our ratings. And, you know, during the summer in 25 of our markets on game days we're the number one programming on television. So we've been very fortunate.(END VIDEO CLIP)MAX: Major League Baseball season scheduled to get under way this Thursday, all 30 teams scheduled to play. Maria, I had an opportunity to talk with the Commissioner Manfred before you did. And I expressed to him as a baseball fan, this pace of play deal as a baseball fan does not bother me. I like the slowness of it. In fact, today's -- everything has to move so quickly.BARTIROMO: Yes.MAX: I'm even more enjoying the slowness of the game than ever before.BARTIROMO: But it's a reaction to the streaming, right? It's a reaction to people watching at home on their phones, trying to make it quicker, trying to get to a younger audience.MCDOWELL: You're an army of one. You're an army of one. I've got -- you know, I've got some paint you can watch dry.MAX: Listen, McDowell.CARTER: I'm with Jared on this one. It's an army of two.(CROSSTALK)ROSCHELLE: We're together. It's two versus --(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: Nobody's watching it, it's like NASCAR's problem.MAX: But it's a multitasking world, right? We're doing a million things at once. So, I can have the game on and be doing whatever I want, even if I want to watch paint dry and then I hear base hit up the middle and I go and I look at the screen and then --MCDOWELL: And by -- and by the way, I'm a life-long ACC fan but man, it feels so good to watch Duke lose.MAX: Mich.ROSCHELLE: Michigan, since I went to that game against --MAX: Thirteen straight?ROSCHELLE: Yes. That one 13 games and their good luck charm.(CROSSTALK)ROSCHELLE: My son keeps wearing the same thing over and over and over again. So, that man -- and we're going to go to the finals -- hopefully he's not watching, we're going to get to the finals with Michigan.MAX: You could score some good tickets for that, cheap, right? Yes?ROSCHELLE: Yes. Cheap tickets for the finals.BARTIROMO: Cool. Jared, thank you.MAX: Thanks, Maria.BARTIROMO: Jared Max. Catch Jared's sports reports on Fox News Headlines 24/7 or on radio, Sirius XM115. Coming up. Americans grade President Trump on his handling on the economy. We've got the latest Fox News polls coming up. And then Netflix reportedly getting the boost at a famous French film festival. Why the streaming company is no longer allowed to compete there. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Monday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Monday, March 26th. Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast. Easing fears of a trade war this morning. Futures are pointing to a big rally at the start of trading, up better than 300 points after a new report from the Wall Street Journal revealed that the U.S. and China have been holding behind the scenes negotiations to solve trade concerns. I spoke with Senator Lindsey Graham about the concerns on "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES" yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: The aluminum steel tariffs, I think, were too broad. The dumper is Canada, it's not Canada, it's not Mexico, it's not Europe. The idea that President Trump is going to hold China accountable for dumping, for currency manipulation, intellectual property theft, is long overdue.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The U.S. and China talks follow a brutal week for stocks on Wall Street last week. All three major indices were down about six percent. Global markets this morning look like this: European indices have a firmer tone. We are at the highs of the morning right here in Europe right now. FT-100 up 30 points; it's almost one-half of one percent. CAC Quarante, up 23, almost one-half of percent. And the DAX Index in Germany is up two-thirds of a percent, 72 points higher. In Asia overnight, stocks closed mostly higher with the exception of Shanghai in China.And Americans believe the economy is firing on all cylinders, thanks to President Trump. A new vote of confidence for the commander in chief coming up.Democrats, turning up the heat on Hillary Clinton. The former presidential nominee is facing growing backlash from within her own party. The tough words from Democrat Senator Claire McCaskill coming up.Then, Netflix canned at Cannes. Why the streaming giant was banned from competing at the movie festival. We'll tell you why.And going beyond the music. I'll talk to a producer from super stars like Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears about his latest project, where the thinks the industry goes next.All that coming up this morning. But first this, grading the president. A new Fox News poll shows that more than half of Americans think the president is having a positive impact on the economy. 51 percent approve, that's holding steady since January, it is up about four points from just about this time last year. Lee, your reaction to this? We've seen a lot of criticism about this administration's messaging. Do you think this tells a different story?CARTER: I think it does. I mean, there's a lot of criticism on the messaging of the president, but I think that's because people are looking at it in a very traditional way when this is a nontraditional president. I think the fact of the matter is that as erratic and difficult to follow as the president's messaging is, the Democrat's messaging is that much worse. And so, you're looking at it, you're saying OK, the president is getting credit for the economy. There's other things he's not getting credit for and people are justifiably concerned, but when you have sound bites like crumbs, you know, about tax reform, when you have sound bites about white women are only voting the way they are because that's what their husbands tell them to do, when you have comments like basketful full of deplorables, who will get credit? It's certainly not going to be the Democrats. And so, while the Democrats have an opportunity right now to really start picking things up especially when you see some disapproval ratings out there, they're not doing a good job doing it.ROSCHELLE: My question to you, Lee, is can the democratic candidates running in the mid-terms in a couple of months really sort of leverage the -- what's going on here? Because I'm looking at what happened in Pennsylvania, it sort of went the opposite way. You had a candidate who sort of threw Nancy Pelosi under the bus and that was the entire campaign strategy and it worked. So, can Democrats want to sort of use that to their favor, it could be sort of problematic for Republicans.CARTER: It could be. I mean, the bottom line is we're living in an anti- establishment world, whether you're on the right or the left. People are fed up with politics as usual. So, the candidates are going to run on something different, on something new, on the willingness to compromise, on saying look, I might disagree with the president but I agree with him on trade or whatever it is like they did in Pennsylvania. You're going to start seeing shifts in policy. If the Democrats continue to run in many places where they still are running against, you know, against the president, against Trump supporters, I mean, really almost making fun of them and being pejorative towards them, they're not going to win, there's just not a chance.MCDOWELL: But to point that out about the Pennsylvania election, that was a Republican candidate, Saccone, that moved away from hammering Nancy Pelosi. So, it wasn't just the Democrats' strategy, it was Republican strategy. But he pivoted at the very end of the campaign toward the tariff as if that was a good thing for those voters in Pennsylvania and it didn't resonate, obviously.CARTER: Well, he was a weak candidate to begin with.MCDOWELL: I just wanted to point that out.BARTIROMO: And I think the Republicans knew that.CARTER: Yes, absolutely. When you see a candidate that keeps waffling on message -- shifting directions -- you saw this with Ted Cruz, during the presidential election. When you see somebody continuously changing like that, you know they're losing. So, somebody need to stay on course, get in touch with the voting population which you are representing, and keep, you know, keep on going with the president or without.BARTIROMO: People are confident and happy about the economy right now but what will they say about the spending? I mean, conservatives were very upset about the spending plan last week, but Lindsey Graham, Senator Graham had some comments about this and here's what he said, and he said the president -- listen up to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GRAHAM: We're not in debt because of discretionary spending. We're in debt because Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security are just exploding in cost at 2/3 of the federal budget is entitlement spending, plus interest on the debt. So, if you want to get out of debt, let's do entitlement reform.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: You're not going to get that this year, Dagen, you've been a critic of this; you've been talking about this for a long time. You're not going to get any proposal on this this year in an election year.MCDOWELL: I don't think that you'll get it for a year -- I don't believe that anybody in Congress and anybody in the White House, regardless of party, will act on this until it's too late, until interest rates are at a point that the interest that we're paying on our debt is swamping all other spending, that it's putting constraints on the economy. Again, it's less than a decade that very interest payment is going to top what we spend on our military every year. You've got the hospital trust fund and Medicare goes broke in 11 years where it's going to pay out, I say this all the time, $0.88 on the dollar in benefits. I don't think that anybody in Washington is going to act until, quite frankly, it's too late.CARTER: I mean, the issue about this is almost like the toothpaste is out of the tube, because you're looking at it, the issue has become social security, Medicare, Medicaid, all of these are human fundamental rights in the opinion of most Americans. So, how do you take away a right to health care, a right to your money?BARTIROMO: And they don't call them entitlements.MCDOWELL: Look, I paid in. I paid in. It's not an entitlement. Well, here's the newsflash, when you have a $60 trillion hole in Medicare and Social Security, that means that people are taking out more than they ever paid in. That is a fact. It is a fact, particularly with Medicare. So, you are now -- you didn't pay in what you're getting back in terms of health care in your retirement. So, I tell my parents that all the time. I'm like, I'm paying for your health care. Stop telling me that you pay for it. You've taken way more than you ever paid in.CARTER: The bottom line, though, is voters are hearing this and it's so hard for people to get their arms around. It's a scary thing so people avoid it.MCDOWELL: Well, they deny it. They're in denial.CARTER: Well, of course they do.BARTIROMO: Well, it's not so hard to take something back that was given to you.CARTER: That's absolutely right. So, the question is: what do we do about it? I mean, even if there's a think tank on the side that's giving us some kind of pragmatic solution that people can get their arms around, that's not happening.BARTIROMO: (INAUDIBLE), you don't think it's going to happen for years?MCDOWELL: I think that you literally will have a 10 percent interest on -- a 10 percent yield on the 10-year. And then, all of a sudden, people are like, wait a minute, our national debt is how our interest on the national debt is how much every year?BARTIROMO: Guys, we got to get to this because another Democrat is coming out against Hillary Clinton and her recent comments about the 2016 election. Remember what she said in India? Missouri Senator, Claire McCaskill, now says that the former presidential candidate needs to stop being disrespectful to the Americans who elected President Trump because Trump won her state. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. CLAIRE MCCASKILL (D), MISSOURI: For those of us that are in states that Trump won, we would appreciate if she would be more careful and show respect to every American voter and not just the ones who voted for her.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: So, McCaskill has to say something. She's running for re- election and she says she disagrees with the president on many things but her entire agenda is not just about being against this president.CARTER: Thank god.ROSCHELLE: You've got to be for something. You can't entirely be against something.CARTER: That's right.ROSCHELLE: And what's happening right now is a massive blame game. We've been talking about the spending bill for a while. The reality is, the president's blaming Congress, the House is blaming the Senate, and the blame game's not going to play well with voters.BARTIROMO: And Hillary Clinton is blaming everybody else for losing the election.ROSCHELLE: It's everybody else's fault.CARTER: Blame the policies, not the people. This is a really, really important lesson. People look at things, it is not helping them to blame the voters and the people who they say are ignorant or the people who caused this mess. You know, the issue is the policy, and that's what people need to focus on.BARTIROMO: But this has come up to bite her. I mean, you know, she said in India anybody who voted for Trump did so because their husband told them to do it, remember that comment?MCDOWELL: Yes, she has an open disdain for any woman who doesn't agree with her. It's not just Republican --CARTER: And it's not just Hillary Clinton.MCDOWELL: It's Nancy Pelosi. You hear the same underlying rhetoric from all of these women that if you -- you are nothing unless you agree with them. You don't have a mind of your own. You can't think for yourself. I mean, says a woman who took up for her husband who was basically having an affair in the White House in the oval office with a woman and she went out on national T.V. and lied repeatedly for him. I'm not some Tammy Wynett, stand by your man, she said during the first campaign. So, I just think that women are sick of this individual talking down to them.CARTER: Of course, they are now.BARTIROMO: Well, the other thing is, I don't know what she was talking about. She said things like, well, you know how it is, you hate women, you don't want women to get ahead, you hate Indian-Americans who are getting ahead. I'm like, what? I have no idea what she's talking about.CARTER: This is how bad it is. I was speaking at a women's event. And I said, I'm going to say something shocking thing to all of you that you're going to hear today, is that I am a conservative woman and I'm here speaking at a woman's event and there was like a gasp in the audience. And then afterwards, they were like, how can you be a conservative and a woman, and think for yourself? I'm like, how has this gotten to the point where people -- people actually believe that? But you can't be -- it's true.BARTIROMO: Come on. That's crazy.ROSCHELLE: It's an echo chamber.BARTIROMO: That is crazy. All right. So, the president is tweeting right now, I want to get to it, and here's what he said just a moment ago: "So much fake news, never been more voluminous or more inaccurate. But through it all, our country is doing great." Country is doing well, economically speaking.MCDOWELL: I think that we would like to see the market turn around after that, it fell of last week. But one thing I'll point out about women on some of the other networks, I didn't realize that sneering was a job requirement.BARTIROMO: Oh yes, let's talk about that. Are you talking about MSNBC?MCDOWELL: I'm talking about MSNBC, because I didn't bring this up. I'm talking about Larry Kudlow, he said, you know, if god-willing or something like that.BARTIROMO: She made fun of his face.MCDOWELL: (INAUDIBLE), she made fun of his face, she did apologize. But I'll say one thing that struck me, for somebody who has openly talked about his recovery and the process of that, basically looking toward a higher power is a critical element of the recovery process, and your faith in something higher than you and greater than you. For you to sneer at that, I'm sneering back because I find that utterly appalling.BARTIROMO: Yes, she apologized. It didn't seem like an apology.MCDOWELL: But it's that kind of women, it's that -- I don't think that women are helping women point.BARTIROMO: Yes. Coming up, the Trump administration is reportedly seeking a trade solution with China following the threat of hefty tariffs on imports. Stuart Varney has something to say about that, he'll weigh in next. And then, Dropbox shares up in the premarket following the public debut last week. The IPO went well; how the data storage company sacks up against other technology rivals next.BARTIROMO: Stocks are on a tear this morning. Take a look, Dow Industrials expected to be up better than 300 points at the open, better than 100 points on the DASDAQ. Dropbox is also watching a strong day after a good IPO performance on Friday. Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, watching all the action. Nic, good morning.NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria. Bring it on for the bulls this morning. As you noted, 316 points for Dow Futures, and Dropbox which was the large tech IPO late last week on Friday which soared at the market open, did great on Friday. It's looking higher once again today with a number that was raised for their IPO, it was a $21.00 IPO. It traded over 30 bucks. And you could see here, this morning, $30.09. The high was 31.60 on Friday. We'll see if we can break through that for the folks who are bullish on tech. It was the largest IPO certainly of the year and since Snap.I wanted to move onto Netflix, also looking to the upside this morning, Maria. Well, this one obviously it's been a winner this year, up 56 percent. But here's the thing, Cannes says Netflix, you're out. Last year, they brought Netflix in with two films, but with that, they thought that those films were going into the cinemas. There were unions, filmmakers, protesters, saying that the concept of Netflix streaming does not correlate with everything else that goes on in Cannes. And now, Cannes basically saying that they're barred from entering the palm door which is the -- which is the golden palm, that is the highest honor. Netflix looks like they're going to be out on this one. Back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Nic, thank you so much. We'll be watching that big rally at the open. Futures indicating a gain of better than 300 points due to easing fears about a trade war with China. The Wall Street Journal is reporting that the U.S. and Beijing are in talks to curb trade concerns on both sides. Joining us now to weigh in is host of "VARNEY & COMPANY," Stuart Varney. Stu, good morning to you.STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria. I actually want to talk about Zuckerberg and Facebook if that's OK with you.BARTIROMO: Of course.VARNEY: I do agree with you that the two sides of the China trade dispute talking to each other, quietly as the Wall Street Journal says, that's why we're going to get a big rally at the open today. But look at Facebook. Now, that's a bit of a comeback, up a buck 80 at $1.61. But it sure ain't much when Facebook was all the way up into the high 180s at one stage a couple weeks ago. I think Zuckerberg is the problem. He's not doing well. He doesn't appear in public very well. On television, it's just not convincing, and those apologies that were published in newspapers over the weekend were kind of not that much. I don't think he'll do very well if he's hold before Congress and I don't think he'll do very well if he's hold before the British Parliament either. And yet, Facebook is stuck with Zuckerberg as its leader. They're stuck with a leadership problem because Zuckerberg, what, he controls 75 percent of the voting stock. His board is his board. Nobody is going to raise an eyebrow to him. I think Facebook is stuck with Zuckerberg and I think that will hurt the stock in the long run.BARTIROMO: Well, he's got voting control. You know, investors need to better understand when investing in companies that have no voting independence at all when you -- when you have a voting in control situation like you do at Facebook and other media companies, by the way.VARNEY: Yes, because there's no response on the part of leadership. They don't have to respond to the pressures bubbling up from underneath.BARTIROMO: Exactly. Stu, you're right, they're stuck with him.VARNEY: That's Zuckerberg. Yes, I think so.BARTIROMO: Stu, thank you.VARNEY: Sure thing.BARTIROMO: We will see you in a few minutes. I know you'll have a lot more on that. "VARNEY & COMPANY" top of the hour at 9:00 a.m. Eastern right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Join Stuart and his great team, next. But first, coming up, the man behind the hits, award-winning record producer Harvey Mason, Jr. will be joining us to talk about the collaborations with the music industry's biggest stars and his latest project, right here.BARTIROMO: That was the song "The Living Proof" from the film "The Help" just one of the many Golden Globe nominated pieces produced by or next guest, Harvey Mason, Jr., he's a six-time Grammy winner, who is now taking his talent to live T.V. Great to see you, Harvey, thank you so much for joining us.HARVEY MASON, JR., RECORD PRODUCER: Thank you. It's good to be here.BARTIROMO: Yes, we want to talk about so much because you're also serving as music producer for NBC's "Jesus Christ Superstar Live" which airs Sunday. Let's take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In three days, I shall return.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This endeavor is unique. It's a broadway show, it's a concert, it's a television show, it's kind of the best of all of these worlds.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: That is awesome. I can't wait to see that one. Tell us why, what attracted you to that project?MASON: Well, the story, the music, the cast. It's just this -- it's an epic story and we've got an incredible cast. The music is amazing. Andrew Lloyd Webber, iconic music, iconic story so --BARTIROMO: Sure. But does -- did the challenges change with live T.V.?MASON: Totally. We've got over 30-piece band and orchestra, full strings, and everybody is singing live. Nothing is recorded, nothing is pre-done, all the musicians are playing. So, it's going to be exciting.MCDOWELL: Have you worked with Lloyd Webber, has he been involved in this production at all?MASON: He has.MCDOWELL: And how has he contributed? Because I know that having met him before, he is so focused on the music and the musicians, like he is a composer's composer.MASON: He is. And it's amazing music. So, he's handling it in very, very great -- it's a great way that he approaches his music and he interacts with the cast, and working with me, a lot of details, specifics, this baseline, this vocal part. But I mean, it's iconic music. You can't go the wrong way with it. You have to address it very carefully.CARTER: Do you have one piece in the show that you're most excited about?MASON: Sara Bareilles and John Legend sing a couple things where they're interacting on a couple numbers that are really special and both of them have such great voices. So, it's really hard to hard to pick one but those two going back and forth is special.MCDOWELL: I followed both of them on Instagram --MASON: So, do I.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: Well, there's an array of talent, right? There's John Legend is out, Alice Cooper. So, what it's like working with such a wide-ranging cast?MASON: It's great. But that's what makes it so special is the variety and different genres they all come from and the different skillsets they bring to the table. But I've been doing that my whole career and I've been fortunate to work with some great, great people.BARTIROMO: I bet.ROSCHELLE: Do you think having contemporary performers performing something that's I guess from the 70s, Jesus Christ Superstar, can sort of bring some of that sort of classic broadway to a younger demographic?MASON: Yes. And I think that's the goal with casting the right people, you want people who can obviously carry the songs and really pull it off, but you're using some great music along with these new talents to bring the audiences together. And that's what we're trying to do with the music, we try and present it in a new and fresh way, but we're very respectful of the way that it was originally conceived. You don't want to offend the original fans. We want to reintroduce it to new --BARTIROMO: How do you -- how do you carry the songs from Aretha Franklin? I mean, you're also producing the upcoming Aretha Franklin biopic called "Respect" starting Jennifer Hudson. That's going to be hot.MASON: It is. That's another amazing project. Again, I'm very fortunate I'm working on some great things.BARTIROMO: Tell us about Jennifer Hudson, how she -- how she's doing for, you know --MASON: Well, that project is early on. We haven't moved past the script yet but we do have her excited about the project and we've been working together for almost 11 years on different projects. We did "Dreamgirls" together, so I'm a huge Jennifer Hudson fan.MCDOWELL: But the idea of it gives me chills.BARTIROMO: I know, it's great.MCDOWELL: Thinking about just Aretha and her catalog and her voice and her achievements and Jennifer, too.MASON: And it's a great story. A lot of people don't know the story and the depth of the things that went on with her, so it's going to be really an empowering story.BARTIROMO: Oh, I'll be there watching that one.

Chinese Media Warns of 'Bumpy Journey' With U.S. in 2018USNEWS.comJanuary 4, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 U.S. News & World Report All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Economy; Vol.; No.Length: 760 wordsByline: Andrew SoergelHighlight: China's state-owned press warned retaliation could be coming after American regulators blocked a Chinese bid for MoneyGram.BodyChinese press Wednesday warned of a "bumpy journey in trade in 2018" between Beijing and Washington -- the latest wrinkle in the complicated relationship between the world's two largest economies. China's state-owned Xinhua news outlet published an article critical of American regulators' decision this week to block a $1.2 billion merger between currency transfer company MoneyGram and Ant Financial, an affiliate of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. Reuters cited sources familiar with discussions that took place within the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. as saying safety concerns related to the sensitive information of U.S. MoneyGram customers factored into the government's decision not to approve the deal. "With deep-rooted strategic mistrust toward China, U.S. politicians have failed to catch up with China's understanding of cooperation and adopted an increasingly protective and isolationist approach," the Xinhua report said. "China and the United States are about to ride a bumpy journey in trade in 2018 if the U.S. government goes it[s] own way, and retaliatory measures by China could be on the table." Exactly what sort of retaliation the U.S. can expect remains unclear. But the comments are some of the most pointed to come out of Beijing as President Donald Trump's administration has cracked down on Chinese purchases of American companies and continues to threaten trade restrictions in response to what it feels has been an insufficient response to North Korean provocation. Trump on the campaign trail repeatedly threatened to label China a currency manipulator and pledged to enact steep tariffs, saying the country was "killing us" on trade. But the president hasn't done either since taking office and admitted in a recent interview with The New York Times that he had been "soft on China" with the hopes that it would more actively oppose North Korea's ballistic missile testing. "If they're helping me with North Korea, I can look at trade a little bit differently, at least for a period of time. And that's what I've been doing," Trump said. "China can help us much more, and they have to help us much more." Amid news that a Chinese-linked vessel had been seized under suspicion of distributing oil to Pyongyang, Trump has threatened to pivot to more aggressive trade treatment of China in the months ahead. But Chinese state media has argued that such an adjustment already played out in the latter half of 2017. "The hawkish turn became ear-piercing when President Trump described China as a strategic 'competitor' in his first national security strategy [document] in December, accusing [the Chinese government] of pursuing economic aggression designed to weaken America," the report said. The Xinhua report goes on to note the Trump administration's Section 301 trade investigation announced in August, which accuses Beijing of intellectual property theft of American companies trying to conduct business in China. It goes on to cite additional anti-dumping duties on Chinese aluminum sheet products and America's opposition to China's bid for "market economy" status within the World Trade Organization -- a distinction that would make it significantly harder for the U.S. and other international bodies to impose sanctions and duties on Chinese exports -- as signs that the U.S. has already fired shots on the commerce front. "Narrow-mindedness and rigidity will lead to a zero-sum game," the report warned. Through the first three quarters of 2017, the U.S. maintained a $248 billion deficit in goods and services with China, according to the Census Bureau. In terms of goods alone, 21.3 percent of all products imported into the U.S. through October came from China. In turn, Beijing purchased 8.2 percent of all American goods exports -- a $104 billion sum that placed China third among all countries buying up American-made products, behind only Canada and Mexico. Chinese retaliation to American trade actions under Trump threatens to derail billions of dollars in commerce between the two economic titans -- a reality Xinhua acknowledges, calling for "composure and pragmatism" and suggesting that "the price is too high for the two peoples to pay if [skepticism] grows and tension escalates." But Beijing also doesn't appear particularly eager to back down, which could lead to some tough trade decisions for both countries in the months ahead. Andrew Soergel is an Economy Reporter at U.S. News.

Chinese company won't take over MoneyGram after failing to get U.S. approvalCNN WireJanuary 3, 2018 Wednesday 3:49 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 526 wordsByline: By Julia HorowitzDateline: NEW YORK (CNNMoney) BodyNEW YORK (CNNMoney) --  MoneyGram is calling off its merger with a Chinese financial services giant after failing to get approval from the U.S. government."The geopolitical environment has changed considerably since we first announced the proposed transaction with Ant Financial nearly a year ago," MoneyGram CEO Alex Holmes said in a statement Tuesday.The deal between Ant Financial, an affiliate of Jack Ma's tech company Alibaba, and the American money transfer service was first announced in January 2017. Ant Financial originally agreed to pay $880 million, but upped its offer to $1.2 billion in April after a U.S. company made an unsolicited bid on MoneyGram.The agreement had been under review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the inter-agency body that vets deals that could give a foreign investor control of a U.S. business."Despite our best efforts to work cooperatively with the U.S. government, it has now become clear that CFIUS will not approve this merger," Holmes said.The Treasury Department, which chairs CFIUS, said the agency is "prohibited by statute from publicly disclosing information filed with CFIUS.""CFIUS reviews focus on national security concerns and Treasury takes the role as Chair of CFIUS very seriously, to ensure that CFIUS identifies and addresses any national security concerns posed by such foreign investment," a spokesperson said in an emailed statement.Ant Financial's proposed takeover of MoneyGram had been contentious among some lawmakers.In a Wall Street Journal op-ed published last February, Congressmen Robert Pittenger and Chris Smith voiced major concerns."Should this transaction be approved, the Chinese government would gain significant access to, and information on, financial markets and specific international consumer money flows," they wrote. "We cannot afford to ignore well-coordinated Chinese investments that target our critical and financial infrastructure," they added.The Chinese government holds a 15% stake in Ant Financial, according to the congressmen, who are both Republicans. However, a spokesperson for Ant Financial said the company is "neither owned nor controlled by the Chinese government.""Similar to U.S. government pension funds investing in American companies, a small number of Chinese government investment funds have minority stakes in Ant Financial," the company said. "These are all passive, non-controlling stakes, and none of these investors participate in management or have board representation."The acquisition would have been Ant Financial's first major move to expand its footprint overseas. MoneyGram, which has over 650 million users worldwide, competes with Western Union for cross-border money transfers to countries like Mexico.Ant Financial paid MoneyGram a $30 million fee to terminate the deal.President Trump has made getting tough on China a cornerstone of his foreign and trade policy, though he hasn't yet followed through on campaign promises like labeling the country a currency manipulator.

Retired cardinal hits back at Vatican over deal with ChinaAssociated Press InternationalFebruary 7, 2018 Wednesday 8:44 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: LIFESTYLELength: 743 wordsByline: By GERRY SHIH, Associated PressDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - The retired archbishop of Hong Kong has slammed the Holy See's negotiations with Beijing as a "catastrophe" that would bring suffering to millions of worshippers, as a bitter dispute inside the Roman Catholic Church over its future in China escalates in a dramatic fashion.Cardinal Joseph Zen warned in a blog post this week that some Chinese Catholics who follow so-called underground churches are at risk of arrest even while the Catholic Church pushes for a historic breakthrough in relations with China's ruling Communist Party.Zen, a leading critic of the Vatican's outreach to China, revealed in a statement last month that the Vatican had asked a legitimate "underground" bishop to stand down in favor of an excommunicated one favored by Beijing - a reshuffle that he suggested was orchestrated by church officials without the pope's full knowledge.Zen, 86, doubled down on Monday and denounced church officials for betraying Chinese worshippers in what amounted to a highly unusual attack from a clergyman against the Holy See."Mainland brothers and sisters fear not losing all they have, the prison cell or shedding their blood," Zen wrote. "Their greatest suffering is being sold out by their 'loved ones.'"In an extraordinary escalation, Zen also criticized Secretary of State Pietro Parolin, the official charged with negotiations with Beijing, as a "man of little faith" who did not understand the "true suffering" of persecuted Chinese Catholics.The proposed changing of the bishops was the clearest evidence yet of the Vatican's effort to reach a deal with China, a country with an estimated 12 million Catholics. Of those, about half worship in "underground" churches that recognize only Rome as their highest authority while the rest belong to state-authorized churches with clergy named by Beijing.The Vatican, particularly under Pope Francis, has been keen to reach a deal with the Chinese government and unite the churches. A sticking point in secret negotiations over at least the past year has concerned whether Rome or Beijing has final say over bishop appointments. China's Foreign Ministry has said the government supports dialogue and advancing ties with the Vatican on the basis of "relevant principles" - a likely reference to Beijing holding final say over appointments.Zen said the Vatican had "given in" to the Communist Party by seeking to replace Shantou Bishop Peter Zhuang Jianjian with Bishop Joseph Huang Bingzhang, who is backed by the state. Last month, he disclosed the behind-the-scenes discussions to replace bishops and said he had been so upset that he traveled to Rome to raise objections with Francis."Priests and congregants will have many long nights of suffering over the prospect of obeying and respecting those priests who were illegitimate today but will be legitimized by the Holy See tomorrow, having been approved by the government," Zen wrote.A pro-democracy advocate and longtime critic of the Chinese government, Zen appeared to suggest that China would crack down more on unauthorized congregations after reaching agreements with the Vatican over authorized congregations. He wrote that the government will "strictly enforce regulations on religion" beginning this month and that priests in Shanghai have warned their congregations "not to attend Mass on pain of arrest."An official from the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association, a government body supervising state-authorized Catholic congregations, said he could not respond to Zen's claim that Shanghai priests have warned their followers against attending Mass.The Vatican had no immediate comment on Zen's latest blog post. But it said last week it was "surprising and regrettable" that some members of the church were fostering "confusion and controversy."In an editorial Tuesday, China's state-run Global Times newspaper said Beijing and the Vatican would establish diplomatic relations "sooner or later" and that a deal would be "tremendously beneficial to Catholics." Without directly naming Zen, the paper also rebuked "a few radical religious groups who have no right to intervene in bishop appointments.""Pope Francis has a positive image with the Chinese public," the editorial concluded. "It is expected he will push China-Vatican ties forward and solve related problems with his wisdom."___Associated Press writer Nicole Winfield in the Vatican contributed to this report.___Follow Gerry Shih at www.twitter.com/@gerryshihLoad-Date: February 8, 2018End of Document

Is China using smartphones for spy games?; Cybersnooping claims not without precedent, but companies say they are just following rulesUSA TODAYFebruary 27, 2018 TuesdayFINAL EDITIONCopyright 2018 Gannett Company, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: MONEY; Pg. 1BLength: 1200 wordsByline: Edward C. Baig USA TODAYBodyBARCELONA - Does buying a smartphone from certain Chinese brands expose you to spying?Ordinarily you'd judge the Mate 10 Pro from China's Huawei on its lovely 6-inch OLED display and exceptional battery life.But there's a bigger issue beyond the specs of the flagship handset from the No. 3 phone maker in the world, which has been banking on the $799.99 smartphone to challenge Samsung Galaxy and iPhone in North America.Lawmakers in the United States have placed Huawei -- and another Chinese manufacturer ZTE -- in the crosshairs over their reputed ties to Chinese intelligence and the military establishment. U.S. officials' concern is that their products could be conduits for Chinese espionage, both on a targeted and a grand scale.Both companies have denied any such complicity.At this week's Mobile World Congress, where both companies have a large presence, Huawei's CEO Ken Hu took the opportunity to defend his product's security.Hu is countering increasingly vocal opposition to Chinese technology companies from some parts of the U.S. government.This month, when Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., asked the heads of the CIA, FBI and four other intelligence chiefs to raise their hands if they would recommend private American citizens use Huawei or ZTE products or services, none did.And last month, just before Huawei was set to promote the Mate 10 Pro during the CES trade show in Las Vegas, a deal with a U.S. carrier believed to be AT&T for the phone was scuttled, apparently because of pressure from U.S. government officials. Verizon had also reportedly been in talks with Huawei.At Mobile World Congress, Verizon Wireless senior vice president and chief network officer Nicola Palmer declined to elaborate on the carrier's relationship except to say that "we don't have Huawei equipment in our network and don't have plans to."While no evidence of cyberspying from either Huawei or ZTE has been presented to the public, the idea of cybersnooping involving the Chinese is not without precedent.In 2016, security firm Kryptowire said tens of thousands of mostly inexpensive Android phones, including the BLU R1 HD sold at Amazon from a Miami-based company that was selling rebranded Chinese phones, were secretly transmitting text messages, contact lists and call logs to servers in China. Such phones came preloaded with firmware managed by a company named Shanghai Adups Technology Co.At the time a lawyer representing Adups told The New York Times, "this is a private company that made a mistake."Blu subsequently removed the offending software. Along the way, the Blu phones were removed from, then eventually reinstated, on Amazon. The issue surfaced again in July when Amazon again pulled the phones over spyware. After apparently determining it was a false alarm, Amazon again put the phones on sale.Last year, ZTE agreed to pay $892million to the U.S. government as part of a settlement of claims that it violated sanctions on Iran. While it wasn't a cybersecurity per se, attorney general Jeff Sessions said at the time the export controls that were violated aim "to keep sensitive American technology out of the hands of hostile regimes like Iran's.""The only thing that gives me any pause is that lawmakers have access to classified information," says Jamie Winterton, Director of Strategy for Arizona State University's Global Security Initiative. "They may have a reason for picking out these two particular companies and saying we don't want these particular phones released in the United States."But while Winterton believes there is a general concern with hardware security, "I don't think that that concern is solved by banning phones from companies in China."Rep. Mike Conaway, R-Texas, introduced a bill to prohibit the U.S. government from purchasing or leasing telecom equipment from Huawei and ZTE.Even with the recent concern from Congress over Chinese technology, it's still very easy to buy a Chinese cellphone in the U.S. to use here. Without a carrier deal, you can buy an unlocked version of the Huawei Mate 10 Pro at Amazon, Best Buy and other electronics retailers, then insert your own SIM card to use the device. ZTE sells its own phones in the U.S., several budget models, as well as the foldable dual-screen Axon M smartphone.Playing by the rules: Huawei insists it follows the rule book in the countries in which it operates.In a statement to USA TODAY, the company indicated that it "is aware of a range of U.S. government activities seemingly aimed at inhibiting Huawei's business in the U.S. market. Huawei is trusted by governments and customers in 170 countries worldwide and poses no greater cybersecurity risk than any (communications) vendor, sharing as we do common global supply chains and production capabilities. We are committed to openness and transparency in everything we do."In its own emailed statement, ZTE says it stands behind the security of its products in the U.S. market and includes U.S. made chips and other components in its phones."As a publicly traded company, we are committed to adhering to all applicable laws and regulations of the United States, work with carriers to pass strict testing protocols, and adhere to the highest business standards," the ZTE statement said.Huawei and ZTE are by no means the only Chinese phones sold in the U.S. Even a venerable U.S. brand name such as Motorola is now owned by China's Lenovo, which in September settled with the Federal Trade Commission over charges it shipped some of its laptops preloaded with software that compromised security, related to delivering ads to consumers.When it comes to phones, popular handsets including Apple's iPhones and Samsung's Galaxy's include parts sourced from China.China is also where some of the phones are assembled. Is that an important distinction?Dean Cheng, senior research fellow for Chinese political and security affairs at the Heritage Foundation, says the mere fact that the companies are Chinese means they'll "respond to recommendations and advice" -- read pressure --  from the central Chinese government.Tolerating risk: Part of it boils down to your own tolerance of risk and belief that your personal information will end up in the hands of a state actor, Cheng says."We have pretty good evidence that the Chinese take a Hoover vacuum approach towards information collection," he says.As a typical consumer, you may not think you  need to be on guard, especially if you're not employed, say, by a defense contractor or aerospace company or work for a firm that does business in China.Still, Galina Datskovsky, CEO of Vaporstream, a secure messaging company in Chicago, says you ought to think about "who you know, what you know, where do you work, where does your family work, where do your friends and contacts work (and) with whom are you corresponding."Winterton says "if you're worried about, 'Hey, I have some sensitive conversations either in text messages or in email' -- using (third-party) encryption is a good way to get around some of those concerns."She mentioned by way of example Signal, an encrypted communications program with a feature to auto-delete messages at a certain point, versus standard text messaging. Graphic photo Christopher Dye/USA TODAY NETWORK, AND GETTY IMAGESLoad-Date: February 27, 2018End of Document

Lord Mayor Travels to China to Boost Economic Cooperation and TradeTargeted News ServiceMarch 19, 2018 Monday 7:42 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 769 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: LONDON, England BodyThe city of London issued the following news release:Lord Mayor of the City of London, Charles Bowman, is visiting China from 19 to 28 March 2018 to promote trade and investment, and London's role in the Belt and Road initiative.The Lord Mayor, in his role as an ambassador for the UK's financial and professional services and head of the City of London Corporation, will meet senior members of the Chinese government and business leaders during his visit. The nine day visit, accompanied by senior City figures from sectors such as banking, insurance, accountancy and legal, will include Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Shanghai and Beijing.In China's leading tech hub Shenzhen the Lord Mayor will be highlighting the potential for further collaboration in the area of fintech. He will also promote London as a platform for Chinese companies to reach global markets and realise their international ambitions.In addition, he will showcase London's role in the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area, a region larger than Wales with a GDP of $1.36 trillion (pound sterling981 billion) in 2016 and an estimated population of 66.71 million.In Hong Kong the Lord Mayor will be speaking at the GREAT Festival of Innovation, talking about the importance of collaboration between international financial centres, particularly in the Belt and Road initiative. He will also promote the importance of creating a digital silk road, where the City of London's expertise in fintech and technologies such as blockchain can play a strong role.Moving to Shanghai the Lord Mayor will meet the City's Mayor Ying Yong for a ceremony to re-sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the City of London and Shanghai government. The commitment marks the latest chapter in collaboration between the two cities since the first agreement was signed in 1996. In addition, the Lord Mayor will lead celebrations at a special event to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the City Corporation's Shanghai Representative Office.In Beijing, the Lord Mayor's final stop in China, he will speak at a forum focussed on the Xiong'An New Area- a new economic zone being constructed on the outskirts of Beijing which the Chinese government aims to develop as a world-class digital financial centre. He will also meet with government and business leaders to highlight what London can offer the Belt and Road initiative, and the City's role as a leading hub for infrastructure solutions.Speaking ahead of his trip, Lord Mayor Charles Bowman, said:"The City of London has enjoyed a long and fruitful relationship with China. I hope my visit will lead to even closer cooperation in this Golden Era of relations between our two great countries."Following Prime Minister Theresa May's successful trip earlier this year, a key part of my visit will be promoting London's role as the natural Western hub of the Belt and Road Initiative, for which firms in the City have much to offer."I will also be delivering the message that London is truly open for business, and that the City's position as an international financial centre will very much continue after the UK leaves the European Union. We will remain a hub of creative energy and financial excellence, helping Chinese firms realise their international ambitions and build the relationships and support they need to retain and expand their UK operations."International Trade Secretary, Dr Liam Fox said:"The Great Festival of Innovation is underpinned by a shared desire to build on the success of longstanding trading relationships between Asia and the UK and to stimulate further growth, with the City of London vital for developing the Golden Era of relations between our two countries."As an international economic department, DIT is ensuring British businesses make the most of growing markets like Hong Kong and exporting their goods around the world. The festival will be a major showcase for the UK in Asia, and a shop window for the best of our creativity and innovation."Sir Tom Troubridge, Chairman of the PwC China Business Group said:"We have assembled a very senior delegation representing the UK's key strengths in Assurance, Insurance and Financing."These are all the skills the Chinese Government tell us are critical to the success of the Belt and Road Initiative where infrastructure projects alone have been estimated at $25 trillion over the next three decades."We will be meeting Chinese banks and construction companies during our visit to discuss how best the UK can work with China in this historic endeavour."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6210515 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: March 20, 2018End of Document

We got the NASDAQ down better than one percent right now, 78 points lower.Stocks settle lower yesterday of course going a mix session when the federal reserve raised interest rates for the first time this year under new Chairman Jay Powell.

Mostly lower, although the NIKKEI average in Japan, up about that one percent.And move over the dollar, while Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey says that Bitcoin will replace the Greenback for the world currency in the next decade.Then, MIT joining a new type of school. We've got to look at the fish robot set to explore the secrets of the deep.All those stories coming up this morning. And joining me talk all about it, Fox Business Network, Dagen McDowell. PWC partner, Mitch Roschelle. And the Wall Street Journal Assistant Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman. Great to see you guys.MITCH ROSCHELLE, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Good to be here.JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for being here.ROSCHELLE: Look at all the news we have today.BARTIROMO: Oh my God.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR: I think the biggest headline is now we know at least one person who's not going to be running for the presidency ever. Mark Zuckerberg.ROSCHELLE: Don't be so sure.MCDOWELL: He has the charisma -- well, my shoe has more charisma than Mark Zuckerberg.BARTIROMO: Well, he had just had an apology.MCDOWELL: Again, it's like something out of "Westworld". He's a robot.FREEMAN: Well, you know we have had a President who did an apology to her. So, it's happened before.BARTIROMO: That's true.FREEMAN: Maybe this could work. Until we start paying in Bitcoin, the fact that the rates on borrowing dollars are going up, should have been a signal for Washington to restrain the spending but didn't happen --BARTIROMO: That's true.MCDOWELL: Real quick on the issue with Jack Dorsey, he's talking his own book, he runs square. Square pay is basically selling people fractional Bitcoin shares. They're advertising that garbage all over Podcast to millennials, essentially in -- he's running a casino if you will.BARTIROMO: Bitcoin the world's currency? Really?MCDOWELL: Sorry. I know it only 6:02. But, I got to get the big old raspberry.BARTIROMO: Wow, you got fire up today. Spending bill, you're not happy with the spending?FREEMAN: No, it's the Federal Reserve is telling us, rate is going to maybe double in the next two years. And --BARTIROMO: -- at a cost of that.FREEMAN: The cost of borrowing money, right. And now, Washington's response is basically blowing more than 100 billion past the sequestered caps that in 2011, you know, we're in 20 trillion in debt and it's about to get a lot more expensive --BARTIROMO: Yes, you're right.FREEMAN: -- to a service like that.BARTIROMO: Well look, they have to give to get according to Paul Ryan. They have to spend more on other things in order to get the agreements on the military spending, James.FREEMAN: Yes, I think, I understand the concern about readiness, but I think, you do have to consider that we need to be ready to fight 10 years from now, or 20 years from now, 50 years from now. And, if we are not an economic superpower, we're not going to be a military superpower, long term.MCDOWELL: Do they raise hogs (INAUDIBLE) because that's the slop you throw in the trough to feed the hogs. Because that is poppycock whatever the Republicans is doing.BARTIROMO: We will talk about that. We got a lot on the table this morning. Joining the conversation this morning, White House, National Trade Counsel Director, Peter Navarro, head of what will be a big afternoon. The President is going to announce those restrictions against China at 12:00 noon today. Also joining the conversation, Utah Senator, Senate Finance Committee Chairman, Orrin Hatch is going to walk us through the new spending bill. Our Intel Congressman and House Budget Committee, Chair. Steve Womack is going to do the same. He will explain that spending bill. And former presidential candidate, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee is here. Former Republican presidential Candidate Herman Cain is here and the CEO of Overstock.com, Patrick Byrne has a thing or two to say about Bitcoin as well.Big show ahead, you don't want to miss a moment on that. We'll take it off right here with the top story and that is Mark Zuckerberg breaking his silence. The Facebook CEO now publicly addressing the growing privacy scandal that allowed an outside firm, Cambridge Analytica to gain access to the personal data of more than 50 million Facebook users. In the new interview, Zuckerberg said he is willing to testify before Congress. He suggested his company may need to be regulated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: This was a major breach of trust and I'm really sorry that this happened. You know we have a basic responsibility to protect people's data.LAURIE SEGALL, TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT, CNN MONEY: Will you testify before Congress?ZUCKERBERG: So, the short answer is this, I'm happy to, if it's the right thing to do. I actually am not sure we shouldn't be regulated. I think in general technology is an increasing the important trend in the world and I actually think the question is more, what is the right regulation rather than yes or no, should it be regulated.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: And the stock extending the recent decline following that interview is down 1 2/3 percent right now. Joining us right now, Political Reporter for Axios, Alexi McCammond. Alexi, good to see you. Thanks very much for weighing in this morning. What was your reaction to the interview?ALEXI MCCAMMOND, POLITICAL REPORTER, AXIOS: It's so -- as you mentioned at the top of the show, it took Mark Zuckerberg five days to make this statement and someone else was saying he lacks charisma and I think that is all fair criticism of him. My reaction though and this is what we've reported in Axios is that the statement left out a lot of critical things. The statement it self didn't include an apology, didn't have an explanation for why in 2015 when all of this is happening with Cambridge Analytica.They didn't come forward and say anything. It also left out why they didn't say anything in any of the conversation or public discussion we've been having about Facebook's rule with, you know, Donald Trump's campaign in the 2016 election. So, there are a lot of key things missing, I think, that's what was what we're really hoping to be seen in the statement.BARTIROMO: Are you expecting new legislation on the technology companies as a result of this powerful position and influence that they've never had -- never as powerful as they are today?MCCAMMOND: That's an interesting thing that we've seen how both sides of the aisle, Republicans and Democrats sort of agree on, is that they think there should be more regulations on tech companies and I think as we see the power that Facebook and Twitter and Google have as well as this almost lackluster statements saying made, Congress will move forward on legislation to regulate these companies. And Mark Zuckerberg said himself in that statement in that interview just laid, that he's not sure that they shouldn't be regulated. So, I think, what we will see is obviously Congress is calling on him to testify in front of them. That will help inform any legislation their considering moving forward.ROSCHELLE: Alexi, Mitch Roschelle. One of the things I just want to chill down a little bit more, and obviously we're not big fans of regulation here, but if there was regulation, what would it look like? Because the regulation of Facebook in companies like that isn't really that new because the internet's been around for 25 years and there's more privacy issues a sort of across the internet. So, what would regulation look like if there was regulation?MCCAMMOND: I think, that's a great question. And that's something a lot of people are curious about as we're getting more information, not only that the security breaches, but how this platforms can be used as almost weapon against its their users. So, I think, what we can expect to see is regulation that is important side this testimony we're just talking about. We don't have specifics on what this could like against Facebook. Because unfortunately, what we're seeing is that all of this is so new. There's more information coming out in the days -- in the five days since this was announced in Mark Zuckerberg statement and whatever he could possibly reveal that he hasn't revealed (INAUDIBLE) yet.MCDOWELL: This policy was put into place in 2007. It ended after 2014 and that allowed opening up these acts to developers and giving them access to not only the people who use those apps, but the -- all the information of their friends. That's what helped the Facebook grow from 48 million users to more than two billion users right now. And time and again, I will just say, I think that the righteous indignation from the left right now is laughable because this has been going on for years in terms of Russian manipulating the platform, they were letting people kill other people and commit suicide via Facebook live, a fake news.BARTIROMO: You can't forget the Barack Obama presidency in the election.MCDOWELL: Exactly.BARTIROMO: President Obama knew exactly how to mind game and capture the voters and potential voters.MCDOWELL: That was 2012.BARTIROMO: And that's what the Facebook wanted, come on -- come on in President Obama. We wanted you to win.MCDOWELL: It was perfectly legal and people on the left felt like Zuckerberg and company were their friends, that they were in their corner and this is what happened. It's hilarious the smearing that you see on other network by these commentators. It's like they -- hello, we've been talking about it on FOX News for years.BARTIROMO: Which is why -- which is why when we spoke with Congress about this, everybody I asked in the last several weeks said, yes, we're expecting some kind of legislation. Just, Chris Collins yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. CHRIS COLLINS (R), NEW YORK: I'm confident you will see new legislation coming out, and where the enforcement where it belongs, the FTC will be coming down on them. So, that it's more evident for someone that you're checking a box.REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R), CALIFORNIA: I don't want Congress to over act -- overreact without having all the information. First thing I want Congress to do is learn everything that happened. But this is a technology that's continue to grow this is where a lot of people get their information, even though it may not be true information. So, what rules do we see that should change in there? First thing that has to happen is, Facebook needs to come and talk to Congress. They need to answer the questions and after we get all the information, we should see what's appropriate and what's appropriate for the future for the individual going forward.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: There you go, top conversation one, James Freeman.FREEMAN: OK, let's see, as you know, Facebook is in political terms right now. Mainly guilty of being useful to the Trump campaign in 2016. So, given that this service has allowed a lot of people for free to enjoy a lot of services in return for trading information about them, I'm wondering about the downside risks here from regulation. The fact, that Mark Zuckerberg doesn't seem to be opposed to it. We've seen this before, big companies, big incumbents benefiting from regulation because it means new competitors have a tougher time competing with them. Isn't this likely if we get a new round here to help Facebook because it's going to make it very expensive for someone to create the next competitor to them?MCCAMMOND: That is a very good question. And I don't know the exact specifics of what this could mean for Facebook but I think, that is something we should be considering. Because obviously I think, there's a lot of political calculus going on behind Mark Zuckerberg saying, I'm not sure that we shouldn't be regulated, right. Showing his willingness to be regulated but could benefit him as you just mentioned. So, I think, all that remains to be seen. In terms of regulation back to the earlier question, I think, the idea of how much data is given and available is something that Facebook mentioned in their four step plan to sort of taking action after they admitted to this.They said that they would notify users of apps that are misusing and cracking their data. I think that is hugely important and something that could be considered in legislation. They said they would give limited access to apps that they considered to be misusing data, that they would cut them off in the platform. I think, that is something that is going to be concerning these regulations and also this barrowing people from even joining the platform if they've had previous sort of shady ways of collecting information.MCDOWELL: I just want to be clear. I sat on this very program for years now and as more problems developed at Facebook like, not really cracking down on terrorist content and actual people who committed terrorist acts and stepping back and trying to wash their hands with that. I sat in this present time, and said you better get your arms around what is going on, on this platform. You're asking for regulators to come in the front door of your company and crack down on it. I said it time and again --BARTIROMO: Right, been calling it for a long time.MCDOWELL: -- and by the way, when they found out in the past, there's been myriad abuses of data -- of their data. Cambridge Analytica, is not the first. Their way of pleasing it has been like, don't do that.BARTIROMO: Right.MCDOWELL: You really shouldn't do that. You need to stop that. That's really not good. That's been their way of enforcing it.BARTIROMO: Yes and you've call that actually, by the way. Real quick, Alexi, your thoughts on this, you know, effort to avoid a government shutdown. $1.3 trillion spending bill.MCCAMMOND: It's an expensive package but I've heard from law makers and both sides of the all in Congresses they obviously want to do everything they can to avoid a government shutdown. I think, there are couple of bipartisan wins in there, especially, the opioid epidemic using nearly $3 billion increase in funding as a huge deal. The (INAUDIBLE) that has bipartisan support is a huge win for both sides of the aisle. I think, that we can expect the government will remain open and that is a good thing for everyone.BARTIROMO: Good thing for everybody. But we are looking at a $1 trillion deficit for 10 years out and beyond. Alexi, good to see you. Thank you.MCCAMMOND: Thanks.BARTIROMO: Alexi McCammond there. Coming up this hour, White House, National Trade Counsel Director, Peter Navarro. Getting his take on what we're going in here today noon time from the President new restrictions and tariffs against China. Don't miss it, it's coming up, back in a minute on that. And then, new clues in to the Austin bomber. Officials say, a reported confession video was left behind by the serial bombing suspect. We'll tell you what he had to say, up next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back now. The Austin bomber leaves behind a detailed recording of his deadly plans. Lauren Simonetti with the headlines now. Good morning, Lauren.LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria. Authorities say they found a trove of bomb materials and a recording in which Mark Anthony Condit confessed to his crimes. He also listed future targets he was intending to blow up before he was stopped. Authorities say Condit never mentioned the motive.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BRIAN MANLEY, POLICE CHIEF, AUSTIN TEXAS: On this recording, the suspect describes the six bombs that he constructed with a level of specificity that he identified the differences among those six bombs. It is the outcry of a very challenged young man talking about challenges in his personal life.(END VIDEO CLIP)SIMONETTI: Police also say there is no further threat from Condit, but at the community should still remain vigilant.Well, millions of people in the northeast starting to dig out from the fourth Nor'easter in less than three weeks' time, just a spring gets underway. The storm dumping more than a foot of snow in some parts of the region, knocking out power to tens of thousands of homes. Airports cancelling over 5000 flights yesterday. Another 1500 today and guess what, a possible fifth Nor'easter could arrive on Sunday.Well, two American astronauts and one Russian cosmonaut are on their way to the International Space Station. The crews successfully blasted off from the Kazakhstan yesterday and they will dock at the Space Station tomorrow afternoon. Maria.BARTIROMO: All right, Lauren, thank you so much. Let's talk about that in terms of a lot of headlines around Russia. Now, I just want to get your take on this memo that was given to the President with caps saying, do not congratulate Vladimir Putin. And then he calls and congratulates him. What do you think?FREEMAN: Yes, it's disappointing. I think it was disappointing when President Obama did it. I, there's a -- I suppose there's an argument that it's one of these courtesies you extend in service of a larger long-term agenda in terms of trying to build a relationship with Putin, but one of the great weapons that the United States has the Ronald Reagan understood that I don't think Mr. Trump always does is our moral authority in the world and we should never give essentially dictators the cover of legitimacy. This is not a real election opposition. People in Russia are not allowed the rights we have here. You don't have a free press, so, I don't think we should ever acknowledge or pretend that Putin is legitimate similar to the Chinese government.BARTIROMO: And this is what the President tweeted about it yesterday, he says, "I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory. In the past, Obama called him also. The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong, getting along with Russia -- and others -- is a good thing, not a bad thing. If they can help solve problems with North Korea, Syria, Ukraine, ISIS, Iran and even the coming Arms Race. Bush tried to get along, but did not have the 'smarts.' Obama and Clinton tried, but did not have the energy or chemistry -- remember RESET -- Peace Through Strength!" Democrats of course, slam the President for the call he is not the first to congratulate Putin as we just said, former President Obama did the same in 2012. Bad timing, we know Theresa May is targeting and, you know, going right at Putin for murdering two people with poison in the U.K. Dagen, and this is just a few days ago.MCDOWELL: A nerve agent. A former spy and his daughter, which again even overstep the most hideous acts of the -- Soviet Union. But I'll -- let me quote Mary Kissel, a pair of phrase the great Mary Kissel from --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: It's good. Maybe she's watching and mama Kissel might be watching.MCDOWELL: Exactly, so, President Trump went through those areas of we can help solve problems. North Korea, Syria, Ukraine, ISIS, Iran and even the coming arms race. They do not share our interest in any way, shape or form in any of those areas.BARTIROMO: Not a zip code --MCDOWELL: Zero zip, not a (INAUDBLE)BARTIROMO: Exactly, we'll take a break. When we come back, crypto crackdown has assort of regulation is impacting Bitcoin and all the other digital currencies.Then Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey, he says Bitcoin is going to be the world's single currency in the next decade.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We have breaking (AUDIO GAP) President Trump just Tweeted this. Here's what he says, Crazy Joe Biden is trying to act like a tough guy. Actually, he is weak, both mentally and physically, and yet he threatens me, for the second time, with physical assault. He doesn't know me, but he would go down fast and hard, crying all the way. Don't threaten people Joe. Hey, it is a little weird that Joe Biden is out there he's saying it again, I would have taken him behind the schoolyard and beating him up, I mean, really.ROSCHELLE: This is like a south park cartoon.BARTIROMO: It's hilarious. Crazy Joe Biden. All right, so, the President says he can take him.MCDOWELL: Washington, I'm sorry would be a whole heck of a lot more interesting if Joe Biden wasn't so fair.BARTIROMO: Right.FREEMAN: This is a 20-20 preview, get ready for some exciting debates next time.BARTIROMO: Wow.MCDOWELL: This is pay per view, pay-per-view.BARTIROMO: Pay-per-view, all right, we going to keep talking about that. Meanwhile, interest rates on the rise, we know what happened yesterday. Federal Reserve announcing it will raise rates. Jay Powell's first meeting as Chairman, here's what he said:(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JAY POWELL, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL RESERVE: As you already know, we decided today to raise the target rate for the federal funds rate by one quarter percent point bringing it to 1.5 to one and three-quarter percent. This decision marks another step in the on-going process of gradually scaling back monetary policy accommodation, a process that has been underway for several years now.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: All right, one and three quarter's percent. Markets raised the gains following the decision we are looking at another day of decline this morning. Futures indicating the Dow will open down 150 points. Joining me right now, Federated Investors Portfolio Manager, Steven Chiavarone, good to see you, Steven.STEVEN CHIAVARONE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, FEDERATED INVESTORS: Good morning, Maria.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us.CHIAVARONE: Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: Are you fully invested?CHIAVARONE: We absolutely are.BARTIROMO: And you were expecting the rate hikes?CHIAVARONE: Look, we thought the number was kind the right down the trail way. The Fed's trying to refill their quivered arrows. Normally, you can't rates 500 basis points in a recession. They want to get as much in terms of rate hikes as they can, but they're trying to go in the phase that's measured so they don't cut thing off too soon. They kept three rate hikes this year, they added one for next year. And I think the most important thing, was they forecasted that inflation rate above two percent, which tells us they're comfortable that this thing run a little hot 19 and 20. That's savage.BARTIROMO: And when markets sold off yesterday, on this.CHIAVARONE: Our thought is that, people weren't necessarily expecting to move from two hikes to three and 19. They're trying to understand that. Look, if people want to give us their shares at the discount on this news, we'll take them.ROSCHELLE: We talked an agreement a little bit so maybe it's the audience could benefit. The thing that freak the market out most recently in a big way was fears of inflation. They had an earnings report yesterday that sort of hints about inflation but the supply to ends yet.MCDOWELL: Rates in Syria, their costs are going up.ROSCHELLE: Yes, and they talk about 20 year high in transportation cost, cost in a supply chain, sanctions tariffs, what's your thought on the inflation and what that could do to the market?CHIAVARONE: Yes, we think inflations going to build, I mean, it should build. We've got a lot stimulates in the system, we've got wager shortages in certain areas. But there's also a lot of countervailing trends, right. You've got the Amazon effect, the Uber effect, you've got things like the substitution of machines for people. And wage inflation builds slowly. We were talking in the green room, you get your raise in the beginning of the year, you can't go back three months later and ask your boss for another.BARTIROMO: Right.CHIAVARONE: You've got to go to the next cycle. So, it takes a while for that to build. And every day that a boomer retires, their retiring it a higher wage when a millennial enters.BARTIROMO: That's interesting.CHIAVARONE: And that holds it back (INAUDIBLE)FREEMAN: Wondering how you look at trade. Is this a big risk? Is that a small risk, do you see President Trump eventually getting lower tariffs out of other countries or is this a problem that you see as a downside versus the tax cuts?CHIAVARONE: Look, a tariff is a tax. Which is another word for tax. Right now, we're dealing with a series of benefits from tax reform and repatriation and even the spending bill in the short run that measures in the trillions. And we're talking about tariffs that measure in the billions. So, the balance is positive. That said, we're going to see what we come up with today. If you hit the Chinese on intellectual property, that's at the core of their economy, we'll see how they react.BARTIROMO: We're getting question, what do you do that they steal our intellectual property? Is that right? I mean, this is -- everybody get back.CHIAVARONE: And I think, the President is trying to force a better deal. And he's --BARTIROMO: He's negotiating point.CHIAVARONE: So many administrations have gone and try to get a better deal and got a cigar put out in their forehead. He's trying to come with a stick, we'll see if it works.BARTIROMO: Steven, great to see you. Thank you so much for your good point. Steven Chiavarone there.Coming up, dramatic new dash cam video release showing the moment the bridge collapsed in Miami last week. Unbelievable video to show you. Then, Meredith is planning layoffs Time Inc. collecting two months after taking the company over. Details ahead, as it explores the sale of iconic magazines as well.

I'm Maria Bartiromo, happy Thursday, it is Thursday, March 22nd, your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast. Time for tariffs, President Trump set to unveil his trade plan targeting Chinese imports today, around noon time, U.S. trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, explaining why intellectual property is at the core of this action.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ROBERT LIGHTHIZER, TRADE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE UNITED STATES: We have a very serious problem of losing our intellectual property which is really the biggest single advantage of the American economy. We are losing that to China, in ways that are not reflective of the underlying economics.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Straight ahead, I'm speaking with Peter Navarro, White House National Trade Council President. Stay with us for that. Fears of a trade war sparking worries on Wall Street, meanwhile, markets looking at another down day, Futures indicating a decline of 150 points this morning on the Dow, down 70 points on the NASDAQ that is one percent, this after modest losses across the board, yesterday, stocks erased gains when the Federal Reserve announced it is raising rates by a quarter of a point, as everybody expected.Global markets this morning, take a look at European indices right now, declines across the board.

We will give it to you.First though, this top story this half an hour, targeted tariffs against China, this afternoon, President Trump is expected to announce up to $60 billion worth of tariffs on Chinese imports. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer says the move aims to curb the theft on American technology.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LIGHTHIZER: Our view is that we have a very serious problem of losing our intellectual property which is really the biggest single advantage of the American economy and we are losing it to China in ways that are not reflective of the underlying economics. The remedies, in my judgment, at least, would be one, doing something on the tariff front, and two, doing something on the investment front.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is the White House National Trade Council Director Peter Navarro. Peter, it's good to see you this morning, welcome.PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL TRADE COUNCIL: Hey, good morning, Maria.BARTIROMO: So, the President's going to announce this today at noontime. Now, we know that in China, there are restrictions in terms of investing in China. Does the President want see a reciprocal situation here in terms of investing in U.S. companies? NAVARRO: No, I mean, the big picture here, is that in December, the National Security Strategy, this government recognize for the first time that China is a strategic competitor, engage in economic aggression against the U.S and some of the worst kinds of aggression is Ambassador Lighthizer said in that clip, is how they, basically, force American companies to transfer their technology in exchange for market access, even as they're stealing our intellectual property through things like cyber-theft and traditional espionage. So, what the President wants to do is to have the Chinese stop doing that stuff.And we're going to see today, in the Oval or the Roosevelt Room, is a package, as Ambassador Lighthizer indicated that will likely contain tariffs which are designed, basically, as a compensatory mechanism to, basically, get back the damages that China is causing to our economy and investment restrictions, basically, to prevent the Chinese as a matter of their own industrial policy and strategy from coming into America and robbing us of our seed corn, the technology we need for the future. So, this is a courageous day for the President, a visionary day and promises made, promises kept, which my favorite President likes to do. And this is a big one he made on the campaign trail.BARTIROMO: So, we've got a $375 billion deficit with China. What's the goal here? Does the President want to get that number lower?NAVARRO: Well, the tariff package, I don't want to steal the thunder of the President today, but the tariff package will be designed to lower that deficit and also compensate us for the tremendous harm that China does by taking our intellectual property. But, don't -- the investment restrictions are every bit as important. We have, trillions of dollars of state finance money coming into America, plucking the best over the best in Silicon Valley, Boston, Austin, in terms of high-tech and these are these kinds of things that threaten our future.If we allow China to, basically, capture the energy -- the industry of the future. We won't have a future, so that is what this is about. And it's a historic day, this is a fundamental shift in American policy towards China after, literally, decades of economic dialogue. And you know, talk is not cheap with the Chinese. It's actually been very expensive been because while we've been talking with them 2003. They've been robbing our technology, blind.BARTIROMO: Yes, but what about the fact that we know that there's going to be something that will be a retaliatory move. I mean, there's this growing concern that any tariffs will stoke China to do something back and create a global trade war. The Wall Street Journal is reporting. Beijing is ready to respond with tariffs targeting President Trump support against us farmers. Is there a plan in place to mitigate the retaliatory measures that are coming?NAVARRO: Sure. I mean, there are a couple things to say. First of all, this policy on behalf of the President that has been developed is literally a whole of government approach. We've had hundreds of people working on this for many months, looking at the strategy, the contingencies, but, you know, this talk like this, I think and contingencies but, you know, this talk like this, I think is irresponsible in some sense because if you look at the chessboard, I think it is clear that all we want is to defend ourselves against economic aggression and I see this as bullish for corporate America.I mean, look at the typical company that had goes over to China. They want to get access to that market. This is the biggest growing, fastest-growing market in the world. You want to get access to that for some term profits. But in exchange for that, they have to surrender their long growth. They surrendered their technology to a Chines competitor and within three to five years that competitors, basically, knocking them out of the market.So, just, you know, from a bottom line, stock market perspective, long term profits are going to be a lot better for American companies under this kind of policy. The second that you say, Maria, look, China's doing a lot better with this trade relationship than we are. It's $370 billion trade surplus in goods that they ran with this, every year. So I don't see them wanting to jeopardize that. They know -- they know what they've been doing and taking from us and actually, they're probably surprised that, finally, a President is willing to stand up for the American people and for American companies.BARTIROMO: Maybe, but isn't this going to result in higher prices for consumers? I mean, let's talk about the impact on the economy and on people, because one of the beauties of having this cheap stuff coming from China, is it ends up being really affordable for American consumers. How significant will we see prices go up?NAVARRO: Well, I think that's a false narrative in a lot of ways, what's going to happen here is modest. minimal kinds of price effects if at all. What we've seen, for example, with the solar and washing machine tariffs, is not rising prices. What we've seen is a flood of new investment into this country creating American jobs.And remember, since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, their economy has grown from $1 trillion-$12 trillion, that's an 800 percent growth rate. It's phenomenal but it's been on the backs of the American people, the American workers. We went through 15 years of stagnant wages, slow growth and now, we have a president in President Trump, who has during the first year in office, had the most remarkable year of the economy of any president, in any recent memory going back a very long time. BARTIROMO: Right.NAVARRO: So, I see nothing but bullish signs on the horizon. I see higher wages, strong economic growth, and this kind of policy, Maria, is absolutely fundamental to our future. We should make no mistake about that.BARTIROMO: We should point out that the Chairman of the Federal Reserve J. Powell, was asked about it yesterday. And he too, is not expecting an impact on the economy. Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)POWELL: A number of participants in the FOMC did bring up the issue on tariffs, and if I could summarize what came out of that, it was first that there's no thought, I think, that changes in trade policy should have any effect on the current outlook. Second thing is, I would say, is that a number of participants reported in about their conversations with business leaders around the country and reported that trade policy has become a concern going forward.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: All right. So that was -- that was a good comment in terms of no impact in the economy. Peter, we got to take your take, though, on the aluminum and steel tariffs, as well, they're going to go into effect, what, Friday? How many exemptions will we see? Will Europe be exempt?NAVARRO: So, there will be an announcement this afternoon, I don't want to, again, pre-empt Ambassador Lighthizer, Secretary Ross or the President. Let me just say this, the proposal that's going to come out today in terms of implementation, will have absolutely strong for the goal of protecting our aluminum and steel industries from this flood of imports, so we're going to have a system --BARTIROMO: Yes, but people are worried about 25 percent tariff retaliation from Europe, that's the issue here, Peter.NAVARRO: Well, again, Maria, this kind of talk, I think, doesn't serve anybody. If you look at the chessboard, OK, let's take Europe, they run $150 billion a year surplus in manufactured goods with this country. At 6,000 jobs we lose for every billion dollars a deficit that we create with Europe, that over 1 million jobs that are created over in Europe, Belgium, Germany, where ever, instead of right here in America.Now, if they want to jeopardize that, that wouldn't be a rational act. So, we can expect some chest thumping, I would assume, for politics. But at the end of the day, President Trump has said this repeatedly, every country in the world ripping us off with these -- with these high trade surpluses. All we want -- all we want, Maria, is fair and reciprocal trade, and I think the American people deserve that and they finally have a president who's going to give that to them.BARTIROMO: Yes, and real quick, before you go, Peter, I know you were there in the room when the President Trump was talking with the Crown Prince in Saudi -- from Saudi, yesterday. Big deal in terms of arm sails that the U.S. is selling to the Saudis.NAVARRO: Yes, that was a great day and i love watching the President with lord leaders. He's just so smart and the friendship between the Crown Prince and the President is just so visible. But at the end of the day, that Saudi deal is over 40,000 jobs America. And they're high-paying good manufacturing jobs. And guess what, when Saudi Arabia buys a weapon system to defend themselves, that means fewer soldiers of America in harm's way. It means more jobs in America and it means we strengthen our defense industrial base, which what's I do at the White House, every day, trying to make that happen.BARTIROMO: Peter, good to see you Sir, thanks so much.NAVARRO: Take care, Maria.NAVARRO: Peter Navarro. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Breaking news this morning: President Trump just tweeted this, "Remember when they were saying during the campaign that Donald Trump is giving great speeches and drawing big crowd but he is spending much less money and not using social media as well as crooked Hillary's large and highly sophisticated staff? Well, not saying that anymore." The president obviously referring to what's happening at Facebook.MCDOWELL: I'll just add that the problem that we're hearing about Facebook, at Cambridge Analytica issue, all of this happened 2014-15. So, Facebook ended the policy; the policy that was used by the Barack Obama campaign, 2012, that was all over -- that was essentially ended, and there was an abuse of the data and Facebook essentially didn't do anything about it, and now they're embarrassed.BARTIROMO: Right. They didn't do anything about it, because I guess they wanted it, they wanted to help President Obama.MCDOWELL: I can't believe it. You're abusing people's data.BARTIROMO: We got the use of this. We got stunning dashcam footage -- we want to show you; it shows the deadly collapse of a pedestrian bridge last week at Florida International University. Lauren Simonetti with all the details right now, Lauren.SIMONETTI: Hey, Maria, the video is posted on YouTube. It captures the moment the bridge crashes to the ground, crushing cars below and killing six people. It was a new bridge. It was installed March 10th, five days before it collapsed, still investigating the cause of the collapse. However, but, many fatalities -- the sad story and that is new video.Well, Meredith Corporation plans to lay off 1000 people at Time Inc. all part of the company's effort to save up to $5 million in the next two years. Meredith also considering selling some magazines, talking a look at shares of the company, they're down 20 percent this year.And check out what the folks at MIT have been doing underwater. They've built a robot fish, Sophie, that could be used to study real fish and other creatures of the deep. These robots are so sophisticated, Maria, that they can swim with schools of real fish in open water for up 40 minutes, and they're being used to explore the parts of the ocean we've never seen before.BARTIROMO: That is incredible.SIMONETTI: I know.BARTIROMO: Really cool stuff. Thanks, Lauren. We'll be right back.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PETER THIEL, CO-FOUNDER, PAYPAL: I'm not exactly sure what I would encourage people to run out right now and buy these cryptocurrencies, but the technology that people like to talk about is the block chain technology. I'm somewhat skeptical about how well that translates into good investments. I would be sort of long Bitcoin and neutral to skeptical of just about everything else at this point.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: That was the Co-Founder of PayPal, Peter Thiel, speaking to me about blockchain and Bitcoin in an exclusive interview last night. Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey, also said, he sees incredible promise in Bitcoin. Dorsey saying that -- here's what he told the Times of London: "The world ultimately will have a single currency. The Internet will have a single currency, I personally believe that it will be Bitcoin." Joining us right now to weight in on that is Overstock.com CEO, Patrick Byrne. And Patrick, obviously, you've been on the show a lot and talked about the wonder of Bitcoin. OK, we're going to get to this -- but that's the first time that I ever heard anybody say they don't trust blockchain but they trust Bitcoin -- Peter Thiel.PATRICK BYRNE, CEO, OVERSTOCK.COM: Peter Thiel, interesting. He's normally a very smart guy -- Peter Thiel. I didn't think that was the smartest comment he's made, but he made me think, I mean, I haven't, which it wouldn't be the first time. I think the blockchain, the underlying blockchain, the technology has this unbelievable promise to reshape civilization. I think Bitcoin is something that may happen or may not happen, whatever. But so, I think, the main event of this all is blockchain. It's very curious to me that he said that. I wonder -- I'm going to look that up and try to understand what he means.BARTIROMO: You've been using Bitcoin, and you believe it is going to be used more --BYRNE: Well, to me, the main event of Bitcoin is not Bitcoin, it's the underlying ledger technology, which is called blockchain.BARTIROMO: Which is blockchain.BYRNE: And it's this -- it's like you have a ledger like your granddad ran his hardware store out of it; it's cryptographically protected and it's a magic ledger, it's immutable, and sort of had all these magic properties, there are all these things you can do with it. So, that blockchain is what's really going to change the world.FREEMAN: OK. I think it does have some magic potential, but I wonder how many people are actually using that magic right?BYRNE: Oh, we are in the very early stages of adoption. We're introducing a blockchain version of Wall Street called tZero.BARTIROMO: Yes, let's talk about why you have the hat today? Because this craze in exchange commission is cracking down the cryptocurrency. This increase scrutiny is impacting -- is this impacting your plan for the coin offering?BYRNE: They have sent us a letter about this. I understand I have a meeting on my calendar next week with some ladies and gentlemen from the SEC and I'm sure we'll have a -- I'll have a report afterwards, Maria.BARTIROMO: Are you going to wear the hat to the meeting?BYRNE: I think. Well, I think they wouldn't expect anything less other than my malice jacket that I wear on this show with you.MCDOWELL: By the way, men shouldn't wear hats indoors. That's just a general rule. Air on the side of that.FREEMAN: There's nothing else.BARTIROMO: Well, it also might ruin your beautiful hair.FREEMAN: Well, thank you. You wouldn't have had it at the SEC.BYRNE: But I actually think this is quite legitimate, I think that is actually overdue. I was wondering last year, kind of, where they were, it's been kind of surprising, they bet how slow they've been to react to. Last year, there was this explosion of something called the ICO -- Initial Coin Offerings -- billions and billions was raised. It sure looked to me like it was way outside the law, and I'm kind of surprised the SEC took so much time. But finally, around July, they made one opinion: the Dow decision where they started hinting it was outside the law, and then nudging and nudging. Now, a week or two ago, the SEC chairman came out and said, all that stuff is, you know, (INAUDIBLE) treated securities.FREEMAN: OK. So, if you buy the security, what exactly are you buying? What do you have ownership in?BYRNE: Well, if you buy a token, if you buy a security token, just like a share of stock, but when you -- it's a slice of the company. It's a piece of the company. If you buy a security token, the big coin explosion, we're talking about last year initial coin offerings, most of them were things called utility tokens, utility coins. Now, it was as far as I could tell - - a real way to pretzel around the federal regulations regarding the offering of securities.BARTIROMO: Patrick, are you going to sell the business stock moves on this speculation?BYRNE: Well, everybody seems to know what the stock; they know what the stock moves on. If we are in discussions, and I think I have a shock collar tides under my collar if I say the wrong thing.Load-Date: March 23, 2018End of Document

Will iPhone Problems End Apple's Winning Streak?; Grappling with challenges, Apple could release a revamped iPhone X and entice the enterprise with offerings around integration, security, cloud services and A.I.Datamation.comFebruary 16, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 Quinstreet, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1432 wordsByline: Mike ElganBodyApple's in trouble.The company depends on iPhone revenue for growth. But the iPhone isn't growing.The competition is. Growth by Chinese smartphone upstarts is in the double digits.Meanwhile, Google is suddenly more serious about smartphone hardware. And Samsung is about to announce a new line of amazing phones.Enterprises and businesses gravitate toward Apple in large part because of its market leadership, which translates into industrywide buy-in by developers and third-party service providers.Is it time to panic about Apple?The short answer is: no.The longer answer is: It's complicated.Let's understand all this.The software troublesApple has a great reputation for quality control. But that reputation has taken a hit lately. Apple recently began investigating widespread problems that occur during calls on its flagship iPhone X.Some users say the touchscreen won't turn on for up to 10 seconds when a call comes in, making it impossible to answer.In some cases, the display won't "wake up" after users move the phone from their ear, so users can't hang up calls. They're also finding that users are accidentally "butt dialing" emergency services, then can't hang up.Others have reported that they can't quit apps during calls.The list of issues is significant. Text messages are showing up in the wrong order. Apps are crashing.In short, the iPhone X has been plagued by a long list of unfortunate problems.The good news is that they're the good kind of problems — they're software-based and therefore fixable with updates.The real "bug" is in Apple itself. The company realized that its own complexity of process and product is leading to an unanticipated lowering of software quality. That's why Apple software chief Craig Federighi has reportedly instructed his team to slow down on some new features and focus instead on improving quality, and also on the ability to ship on time.This dent in Apple's reputation isn't the end of the world, but it won't help iPhone sales.The software troublesA year ago, analysts assumed that iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus sales would be close to normal, and that additional iPhone X sales would drive overall iPhone sales into the stratosphere — an expected event they called the "super cycle."Turns out there was no "super cycle." It wasn't even a regular cycle.iPhone X sales actually fell, prompting Apple to adjust future sales expectations, according to some reports. Apple sold 1% fewer iPhones in the last quarter of 2017 compared with the same quarter in 2016.KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says the iPhone X will be canceled, with "production ceasing in the summer."Kuo said the reason for iPhone X's woes is: China. Chinese consumers, he believes, like bigger screens and hate the iPhone X's "notch."It's likely that iPhone sales in the current quarter will also turn out to be lower than last year.Apple admitted Dec. 20 that as iPhone batteries age, performance is throttled by design. Apple then offered everybody a battery replacement at a steep discount: $29 (instead of $79).By extending the lives of older iPhones with new batteries (and also un-throttling performance), Apple is actually hurting its own sales.Apple's core competency is making money. Even with the iPhone decline, revenue increased by 13% because of higher prices — the average price of an iPhone increased by a whopping $100. While that price increase boosted revenue, it also contributed to the drop in sales.Meanwhile, while Apple sales declined, the Chinese upstarts were on fire (not in the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 sense, but in terms of sales growth). Xiaomi's sales increased by an incredible 70%. Huawei and Oppo each grew by more than 10%.What is Apple going to do about it?The software troublesThe smartphone industry is changing fast. And the iPhone is, too.Kuo says Apple this year will release a new version of the 5.8-inch iPhone X, plus a 6.5-inch "Plus" version. He says a third "budget" iPhone, which could be called the iPhone SE2, will look more or less like the other two, but will be made with an LCD screen instead of OLED, as well as offer inferior camera tech, RAM, battery and frame. By "budget," he means it could cost $699.Even if these phones are amazing and popular with consumers, it's unlikely that Apple will return to the growth we've all come to expect.It seems to me that the smartphone "fever" arguably peaked in 2015. That's when buyers were extremely brand loyal, felt compelled to upgrade faster and when China and many other markets were rapidly switching from feature phones to smartphones.TrendForce predicts smartphone market growth momentum will stay flaccid, with lower demand and fewer upgrades than previous years? The industry should build about 1.5 billion smartphones, which is a 2.8% increase.An increase sounds positive, but the actual number of smartphone users will grow more than that. What's happening is that the rate of upgrades is slowing.I believe smartphones in 2018 are becoming like tablets: The old device is still working fine, so why upgrade?While technology continues to advance, customer satisfaction with new devices is merely matching satisfaction with older devices. In other words, while people love new phones, they increasingly still love their old phones.Is it time to panic about the iPhone?The software troublesThe doom-and-gloom around iPhones is overblown.When we look at sales of iPhones vs. the Chinese upstarts, it's important to understand that the Chinese market is where these changes are most dynamic.The iPhone X sales disappoint because of China. Xiaomi, Huawei and Oppo sales impress because of China.If your company isn't in China, these mega-changes don't really affect you.Apple will continue to decline in China because of the growing appeal of Chinese brands in that market.But those same companies won't challenge Apple in the United States any time soon.In fact, U.S. intelligence agencies, including the FBI, CIA and NSA, this week warned Americans against buying products from Huawei and ZTE, citing security risks from the Chinese government.These brands still have low recognition in the US, and in any event are being largely excluded here by the carriers, which still have enormous control over sales.OK, but what about Google and Samsung?Early last year, it appeared that Google's Pixel line and startup Essential would transform the smartphone market.IDC says Google shipped just 3.9 million phones last year. That's how many iPhones Apple sells in a week. (If that sounds bad, know that Essential sold only 88,000 units shipped in their first six months.)But it appears that Google is getting super serious about phones. The company acquihired HTC’s mobile division for $1.1 billion. HTC is the company that made the Pixel and Pixel XL phones.Meanwhile, Samsung's answer to the iPhone X and Pixel 2 is: Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus, which are expected to be announced Feb. 25.The S9 is expected to have a great camera, which can focus fast and record super slow-mo video. It also should take pictures in very low light.The phone should boost security by adding iris scanning to the face recognition.Despite these market threats, Google and Samsung are unlikely to unseat Apple's dominance in the US market any time soon, especially in the enterprise arena.The software troublesApple is arguably the most successful company in history.The Silicon Valley giant has gifted shareholders with very strong growth, year after year. If you had invested $990 (less than the cost of an iPhone X) when Apple went public in December of 1980, your Apple stock would be worth $394,758 today. Not bad.Growth like that becomes an expectation. So what is Apple going to do in the next 38 years to maintain that clip?It's safe to say that smartphones ain't gonna do it.In the short term, Apple will probably return to smartphone unit sales growth, and maintain revenue growth.In the medium term, I expect Apple to push harder and more explicitly into the enterprise with offerings around integration, security, cloud services and A.I.In the long term, Apple will be forced to enter a gigantic new business to replace the iPhone as the driver of Apple's crazy growth and conspicuous dominance.So what’s Apple’s next move?Smart glasses? Self-driving cars? Content?That transition is the real Apple crisis. When you're the most successful company in history because of your smartphones — and smartphones are losing steam — what's the next big pivot?Without its visionary founder Steve Jobs, it's not clear that Apple has the vision to dominate the industry with one more thing.Load-Date: February 17, 2018End of Document

Proposal For Nationalized 5G Network Draws FCC, Industry OppositionThe FrontrunnerJanuary 30, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 1019 wordsBodyUSA Today (1/29, Snider, Jackson, 8.23M) reports the "Trump national security team is in the early stages of deciding whether or not to build and operate a super-fast nationwide 5G wireless network," according to a "presentation recently made by a senior National Security Council official to senior administration officials [that] was first obtained and reported on by news site Axios." A senior Administration official told USA Today that he memo "is an old one, but its stated strategy is correct."Reuters (1/29, Reuters) says the "5G network concept is aimed at addressing what officials see as China's threat to US cyber security and economic security." A senior Administration official told Reuters: "We want to build a network so the Chinese can't listen to your calls. ... We also have to ensure the Chinese don't take over the market and put every non-5G network out of business." Inside Cybersecurity (1/29, Mitchell) reports the NSC "document suggests the US government take over and lead a 'moon shot' to stand up a 5G network within three years."The New York Times (1/29, Kang, Subscription Publication, 15.39M) reports that federal regulators and major telecommunication companies "pushed back" against the reported proposal. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai opposes the notion, saying in a statement that the "market, not the government, is best positioned to drive innovation and investment. Any federal effort to construct a nationalized 5G network would be a costly and counterproductive distraction from the policies we need to help the United States win the 5G future." Jonathan Spalter, chief executive of US Telecom, the trade group that represents telecom and cable broadband providers, similarly said: "There is nothing that would slam the brakes more quickly on our hard-won momentum to be the leader in the global race for 5G network deployment."The Daily Caller (1/29, Lieberman, 696K) notes that "all five commissioners for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) came out Monday against the idea." The Daily Intelligencer (NY) (1/29, Hart, 882K) reports FCC commissioner Michael O'Rielly "was harsher" than Pai, saying, "I've seen lead balloons tried in D.C. before, but this is like a balloon made out of a Ford Pinto." Meredith Attwell Baker, the CEO of the trade group CTIA, also pushed back against a nationalized network. She said, "The government should pursue the free-market policies that enabled the US wireless industry to win the race to 4G."Reuters (1/29, Shepardson) notes that "any plan" to nationalize a 5G network "would likely cost hundreds of billions of dollars, require the government to obtain spectrum and raises questions whether Americans would want to buy service from a government entity, wireless carriers said." Michael Wessel, a commissioner on the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, which works for Congress and follows China issues, stated: "I don't think the White House options papers do justice to the issue. It goes much deeper." The Wall Street Journal (1/29, Freeman, Subscription Publication, 6.45M) is among the media outlets also reporting on the backlash..White House Downplays Discussions On 5G Network. Politico (1/29, McGill, 3.22M) reports, "Amid the blowback, the White House on Monday sought to downplay the possibility of nationalization, with press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders saying discussions on the future of 5G are preliminary." Another Administration official speaking on the condition of anonymity "said the document that became public is not the latest version of the proposal and that the idea has not yet gained traction with other parts of the administration." Bloomberg News (1/29, Talev, Epstein, 3.31M) reports that Sanders added, "There's been absolutely no decision made other than the fact, the need for a secure network."The Washington Post (1/29, Fung, 11.19M) reports that there was "confusion concerning the significance of the National Security Council memo. Senior officials at the Commerce Department and the White House's National Economic Council were livid at the suggestion that the memo reflects administration policy and called it hogwash, according to a senior industry official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private discussions." The Post continues that "some suggested the proposal was leaked as a trial balloon meant to gauge the public's appetite for the policy."House Commerce Chair Rejects Nationalization: "We're Not Venezuela."The Hill (1/29, Neidig, 1.99M) reports House Energy and Commerce Chairman Greg Walden "rejected the idea" of nationalizing a 5G network, saying, "We're not Venezuela - we don't need to have the government run everything as the only choice." Walden also cited the 2015 data breach of the Office of Personnel Management, stating, "A government that can't protect the data of its own employees - I just struggle with the notion it's going to run a complete architecture and network that will be hack-free." Walden also added that "he doubted" the proposal has been given serious consideration.Roll Call (1/29, Ota, 149K) reports Senate Intelligence Vice Chairman Mark Warner said Monday that the US needs a "viable, cost-effective solution" to deal with concerns about "the Chinese government's influence" in network equipment markets, but said, "Constructing a nationalized 5G network would be expensive and duplicative." Sen. Orrin Hatch "offered a cool appraisal of the idea." He said, "I want to look at it carefully to make sure that it's not counter-productive."Verizon Drops Plans To Sell Huawei Phones.Bloomberg News (1/29, Moritz, Gurman, Shields, 3.31M) reports that "Verizon Communications Inc. has dropped all plans to sell phones by Chinese manufacturer Huawei Technologies Co., including the new Mate 10 Pro, under pressure from the US government, according to people familiar with the matter." Renewed government scrutiny of Chinese espionage efforts "is creating a potential roadblock in the race between Verizon and AT&T to offer 5G, the next generation of super-fast mobile service." Verizon and Huawei declined to comment.Load-Date: January 30, 2018End of Document

The move comes just weeks after Marriott, Delta Air Lines and other big names found themselves in trouble with Beijing over how they described politically sensitive places like Taiwan and Tibet.The Chinese government has launched frequent attacks on the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader of Tibet, calling him a "traitor" and a separatist. Beijing considers Tibet to be part of its territory and comes down hard on any suggestions to the contrary.Mercedes, which is owned by Daimler, ran afoul of China's stance when it paired a quote attributed to the Dalai Lama with a photo of one of its luxury sedans on Instagram -- a social media platform that is banned in China."Look at situations from all angles, and you will become more open," the quote read.The ad was posted on Monday and garnered nearly 90,000 likes before Mercedes deleted it the following day, according to a screenshot posted by Chinese state media.The Global Times, a state-run newspaper that often strikes a nationalistic tone, criticized Mercedes, saying the company was quick to respond to the incident but shouldn't make such mistakes in the first place.Mercedes issued a statement in Chinese about the incident on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, offering a "sincere apology" three separate times."We fully understand how it has hurt the feelings of people in the country, including our colleagues working in China, we sincerely apologize for this," Mercedes said, adding that the post contained "extremely erroneous information."With its rising middle class and growing economic might, China is a key market for many global brands. Mercedes is no exception.Of the nearly 2.4 million vehicles it sold worldwide last year, more than a quarter were snapped up by Chinese buyers.A growing number of international companies have recently found themselves in hot water in China over politically sensitive issues.Authorities last month blocked Marriott's websites and apps for a week in China after it listed Tibet, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan as separate countries in its emails and apps. Marriott apologized profusely, saying it respects and supports the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China.Shortly after that, Delta came under fire for similarly listing Taiwan and Tibet as countries. It said it was "an inadvertent error with no business or political intention" in its apology.At the same time, the owner of European clothing brand Zara was chastised by regulators for listing Taiwan as a country and ordered to rectify the situation.China and Taiwan -- officially the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China -- separated in 1949 following the Communist victory on the mainland after a civil war.They have been governed separately since, though a shared cultural and linguistic heritage mostly endures, with Mandarin spoken as the official language in both places. The government in Beijing has always maintained that Taiwan is a renegade province that is an integral part of its sovereign territory.Communist China sent troops into Tibet in 1950 to enforce its claim on the region, and has controlled it since 1951 -- though the central government in Beijing has faced repeated bouts of unrest from ethnic Tibetans unhappy over its rule.-- Nanlin Fang contributed to this report.Load-Date: February 8, 2018End of Document

All Rights ReservedLength: 500 wordsByline: bbryan@businessinsider.com,  (Bob Bryan)Highlight: New restrictions that are being considered by the Trump administration could limit Chinese investment into Us technology companies.BodyAndy Wong/AP Images• The Trump administration is considering a crackdown on Chinese investments into US companies.• The new rules would focus on preventing Chinese investment into emerging technologies like 5G.• Other ideas include "reciprocal" limits on investments into industries that China is already protecting.The Trump administration could move to block China from investing in certain types of US tech companies as part of a wide-ranging crackdown on Chinese trade with the US, according to a new report.Bloomberg reported Tuesday that as part of new sanctions on China - which included Thursday's            announcement of tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods - the Treasury Department is looking into using a decades-old national-security law to prevent Chinese firms from investing in up-and-coming technologies.Trump said last week that his administration would look into ways to limit Chinese investments into the US as punishment for China's theft of US intellectual property.The new possible restrictions would be created using the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, according to Bloomberg. The administration would place limits under the assumption that Chinese investment in these businesses would constitute an economic threat to US national security, with a focus on emerging tech like 5G networks and semiconductors.The reasoning would be similar to the Trump administration's justification for blocking semiconductor Broadcomm's takeover of rival Qualcomm earlier in March.The Treasury Department is also mulling other steps, according to the report. Among the possible crackdowns is a "reciprocal" restriction in response to China's protections of some industries.Currently, China limits foreign investment into some industries that its government is trying to grow domestically. So under the new rule, the US would also prevent investment in those industries coming from China to the US. For instance, since China places limits on investment into specialty chemicals, the US could move to do the same.Additionally, the administration is considering an expansion of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, a panel that reviews takeovers of US companies by foreign firms.Fears of a trade war with China were quelled on Sunday after reports that the Trump administration had entered into negotiations with the Chinese government to address concerns over the theft of IP and other trade issues. It is unclear how these new restrictions could play into those talks.NOW WATCH: How a series of deadly Russian apartment bombings in 1999 led to Putin's rise to powerSee Also:• Stormy Daniels' terrifying recollection of a parking-lot ultimatum wouldn't be the first reported threat from a Trump associate• Florida's governor is about to set up a blockbuster race to flip a Florida Senate seat red• The trade war with China could turn out to be Trump's 'economic Afghanistan'SEE ALSO: The trade war with China could turn out to be Trump's 'economic Afghanistan'Load-Date: February 11, 2019End of Document

China just made this trade war very personalBusiness Insider USMarch 13, 2018 Tuesday 07:58 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 996 wordsByline: llopez@businessinsider.com,  (Linette Lopez)Highlight: OPINION: If China wants to send the White House a message, Steve Schwarzman is one way to do it.BodyChip Somodevilla/Getty Images• Right in the midst of heightening trade tensions between the US and China, China's sovereign wealth fund has sold its entire 9% stake in US investment firm Blackstone.• That firm is helmed by Trump's friend and informal adviser, Steve Schwarzman. • The fact that this is the way China chose to hit the Trump administration - very personally - says terrible things about what US policy has become.China has dropped one of President Trump's closest friends at a rather delicate moment.In a recent government filing Blackstone, the investment firm founded by billionaire Steven Schwarzman, revealed that China's sovereign wealth fund had sold the entirety of its almost 10% stake in the firm. There is talk from Chinese officials that this sale was some time in coming, some also argue that this is just part of a bigger push on China's part to invest more domestically. Those explanations are hard to swallow if you've been paying attention. It's no secret that, just as the Chinese were offloading their strategic investment in one of the world's largest dealmakers - a stake, incidentally that was touted as giving Blackstone a huge leg up in the Chinese market - the U.S. was making moves of its own.  On Tuesday, the United States rejected Singapore-based chipmaker Broadcom's almost-attempt to acquire California-based Qualcomm. The White House statement on that matter cited national security concerns. It fears Broadcom will strip Qualcomm, making it unable to compete with China's aggressive 5g agenda.That same day Politico reported that President Trump is seriously considering putting aggressive tariffs on China after a lengthy investigation into the country's theft of US intellectual property. That investigation was announced            in August - so both the Trump and Xi administrations have had a long time to think about it (and plan accordingly).The fact that amidst all this China chose to take action against Blackstone tells us something about how China may choose to respond to Trump's tariffs and other steps: by making this personal. Trump has said trade wars are "easy to win." But if Blackstone is indeed a response to Trump's own trade actions, it means the Chinese have decided that the best way to make Trump feel consequences for his actions is to turn on his buddies from New York.  That kind of move - making oligarchs suffer to send a message to their leader - tends to work best in Banana Republics. It's petty, it's sad, and it's our current state of affairs.Xi loves me, Xi loves me notIt's not that Schwarzman hasn't been doing his best to make nice with Beijing. Last year he spent $100 million on "Schwarzman's Scholars" - program that brought 110 students from around the world to China to learn about international relations and warn them against a cold war with China."[W]ith populism, no matter who you attack, your own circumstance doesn't really change, so you keep looking for new targets," Schwarzman told CNBC. "My instinct was at some point different countries in the world were going to find China."With that mindset and his close relationship with Trump it's no wonder Beijing maintained its close relations with Schwarzman. Perhaps it still will, but it certainly won't find him as useful.And things keep happening to people Beijing no longer finds useful.Take, for example, billionaire casino mogul Steve Wynn, who once delivered a message to Trump from the Chinese government, imploring him to extradite a Chinese dissident living in New York City. Attorney General Jeff Sessions almost quit over the whole affair, and Wynn failed.Thomson ReutersShortly after that, when Wynn was accused of some truly disturbing acts of sexual violence against his employees, the gaming regulator in Macau - home to Wynn's most profitable casinos - suddenly became concerned.According to Bloomberg, it has met with members of his Macau management team on the accusations and expressed concern on the matter.  This isn't happening because Macau - a haven for sex trafficking and prostitution - is having a #metoo moment.More likely it's that next year Wynn, and his fellow casino oligarchs, will have to renegotiate their licenses to operate in Macau. Expect those negotiations to be harder for moguls than they have ever been.None of this is over either. Trump's next move on China is going to be over state-sanctioned intellectual property theft, which - to be fair - is a real problem. If you don't believe me then I have a Dairy Queen to take you to in Beijing (you won't even notice the difference from the real one).U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, a Regan administration veteran recently presented Trump with a package of tariffs that would smack China to the tune of $30 billion a year in Chinese imports.            According to Politico, Trump said that wasn't enough. The tariffs could be out as early as next week.In reality, though, this has been over 6 months in the making. China has had plenty of time to plan it's response. And, during that time, Beijing has surely worked out that there are only so many ways to get to Donald Trump. His staff is fleeing or fleeting. The State Department is a mess. There's no ambassador to South Korea, for Pete's sake. If you're China and you want to send a message you've got to do it the way they're used to doing it - through family, through friends, the oligarchy way. This isn't government by the people, it's government for one person.The Chinese know that, and that fact alone should make the hair on the back of your neck stand on end.NOW WATCH: I quit cable for DirecTV Now and it's saving me over $1,000 a year - here's how I did itSee Also:• Friendless and useless, Rex Tillerson couldn't take the hint.

Trump leaves freeway to China and green energiesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 10, 2018 SaturdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 979 wordsBody China is the third rail of the global economy, in which an electrical overload has been created that makes it unstable and prone to produce discharges capable of altering world markets and overloading whole sectors.  On March 1, President Trump announced his intention to impose tariffs of 25 and 10% on imports of steel and aluminum, respectively. This maneuver has represented a latent threat since Trump presented his America First program. However, the recent announcement caused alarm among economists, American industrialists who depend on aluminum or steel, US business partners and members of the Republican Party.  In January, bitcoin and other cryptocurrency prices suffered losses as a result of the Chinese government's antagonistic stance, ending tens of billions of dollars in virtual wealth.  What do bitcoin and aluminum (and, to a much lesser extent, steel) have in common? They are efficient conduits to transform excess electricity into something that can be stored and exported.  Since 2001, China has incorporated more installed capacity for energy development than the rest of the world, since for years central and local governments have prioritized the supply of electricity, from projects as ambitious as the Three Gorges Dam (which it was fully connected until 2012) to hundreds of local coal plants.  China outperforms its closest competitor (Brazil) in the development of hydroelectric power, is the world leader in wind and solar energy, and has exceeded its target of renewable energy. However, it continues to burn astonishing amounts of coal.  For 2016, China's energy development capacity exceeded its domestic electricity demand by 35%, according to Greentech Media; in fact, capacity largely exceeds demand in almost all provinces. The excess electricity generation in China is so vast that in 2016 it had to discard at least 49.7 terawatt-hours of wind energy, more than the individual generation of 20 states and Washington together that year.  As part of the last five-year plan, the central government has canceled the construction of more than 100 plants and has promoted market and grid reforms to distribute electricity more efficiently.  In this way the industry is being restructured to put an end to what Lucy Hornby of the Financial Times called "a mutually destructive race to build new power plants" and is finally dismantling the quota system of the coal-generating plants that guaranteed the profitability and continuous production, regardless of the effective demand for energy. Bitcoin mining  Intuitively it is not easy to find a place where to direct all that electrical energy. The storage of electricity on this scale is not yet feasible and the export of electricity requires extensive and impractical infrastructure. Although faced with the excess of a cheap but valuable resource, companies and entrepreneurs in China have responded creatively, finding ways, through the alchemy of the global economy, to convert electricity into yuan or dollars. And if not in dollars, then in aluminum or bitcoin.  Separating one metric ton of aluminum from its impurities requires approximately 14,500 kilowatt-hours of electricity, enough energy to power one or two American homes for a year. They have not named the metal "frozen electricity" in vain. Unlike electricity, aluminum is easy to export. Just ask Liu Zhongtian, founder and president of one of the largest aluminum companies in China. Liu sent almost 1 million tons of aluminum from China to Mexico andthen to Vietnam for reasons that have not yet been clarified, but that caught the attention of the Department of Commerce.  The production of aluminum is a practical method to convert electricity into something durable and portable, but the outbreak of the cryptocurrency markets originated an even more efficient method.  Bitcoin blocks are produced by making more and more complex calculations with computer processors that consume a lot of energy. Bitcoin miners and other cryptocurrencies could require up to 140 terawatt-hours of electricity in 2018 to validate network transactions, about 0.6% of the world total.  On a global scale, these calculations consume the equivalent of producing between one and three nuclear reactors, according to my colleagues Chris Mooney and Steven Mufson. In China, miners do so at low prices, using hydroelectric power or under cover of shady deals with local power plants.  At the beginning of January of this year, when the Chinese government attacked the production of cryptocurrencies, Chinese miners contributed around three quarters of the world production and a minimum of one fifth of the total transactions of the currency. The once-buoyant cryptocurrencies deflated with the news of the Chinese government's offensive and have not yet recovered their previous highs. Business model Electricity is not the only reason why China's aluminum is cheaper, since it also benefits from cheaper inputs throughout the entire production process, from labor to minerals. That supercharged competition (and international monetary imbalances) has decimated the US aluminum industry: in 1993 there were 23 aluminum smelters in operation, in 2017 there were five and only two were operating at full capacity. The disappearance of the industry of aluminum and steel, another metal that requires a high electrical intensity, prompted the US president to strike the first shots of a trade war.  This reaction is a collateral damage to China's perfectly logical impulse to drive the biggest industrial revolution in history, doing everything possible to provide cheap energy to its companies.  We are facing the first signs of a future in which electricity storage will be possible on a national scale, but for now it remains a volatile resource, which flows or evaporates, distending the global economy in devastating and hypnotic ways. Load-Date: March 10, 2018End of Document

Apple is under fire for moving iCloud data to ChinaCNNMoney.comFebruary 26, 2018 Monday 12:42 AM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: TECHNOLOGYLength: 817 wordsByline: Sherisse PhamBodyApple's latest move in China has privacy advocates and human rights groups worried.The U.S. company is moving iCloud accounts registered in mainland China to state-run Chinese servers on Wednesday along with the digital keys needed to unlock them."The changes being made to iCloud are the latest indication that China's repressive legal environment is making it difficult for Apple to uphold its commitments to user privacy and security," Amnesty International warned in a statement Tuesday.The criticism highlights the tradeoffs major international companies are making in order to do business in China, which is a huge market and vital manufacturing base for Apple.In the past, if Chinese authorities wanted to access Apple's user data, they had to go through an international legal process and comply with U.S. laws on user rights, according to Ronald Deibert, director of the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, which studies the intersection of digital policy and human rights."They will no longer have to do so if iCloud and cryptographic keys are located in China's jurisdiction," he told CNNMoney.The company taking over Apple's Chinese iCloud operations is Guizhou-Cloud Big Data (GCBD), which is owned by the government of Guizhou province. GCBD did not respond to requests for comment.The change only affects iCloud accounts that are registered in mainland China.Apple made the move to comply with China's latest regulations on cloud services. A controversial cybersecurity law, which went into effect last June, requires companies to keep all data in the country. Beijing has said the measures are necessary to help prevent crime and terrorism, and protect Chinese citizens' privacy.The problem with Chinese cybersecurity laws, Deibert said, is that they also require companies operating in China "to turn over user data to state authorities on demand -- Apple now included."Other big U.S. tech companies have had to take similar steps -- Amazon and Microsoft also struck partnerships with Chinese companies to operate their cloud services in the country.Apple says that it did advocate against iCloud being subject to the new law, but was unsuccessful."Our choice was to offer iCloud under the new laws or discontinue offering the service," an Apple spokesman told CNN. The company decided to keep iCloud in China, because cutting it off "would result in a bad user experience and less data security and privacy for our Chinese customers," he said.Apple users typically use iCloud to store data such as music, photos and contacts.That information can be extremely sensitive. Earlier this month, Reporters Without Borders urged China-based journalists to change the country associated with their iCloud accounts -- which is an option for non-Chinese citizens, according to Apple -- or to close them down entirely.Human rights groups also highlighted the difficult ethical positions Apple could find itself in under the new iCloud arrangement in China.The company has fought for privacy rights in the Unites States. It publicly opposed a judge's order to break into the iPhone of one of the terrorists who carried out the deadly attack in San Bernardino in December 2016, calling the directive "an overreach by the US government."At the time, CEO Tim Cook said complying with the order would have required Apple to build "a backdoor to the iPhone ... something we consider too dangerous to create."Human Rights Watch questioned whether the company would take similar steps to try to protect users' iCloud information in China, where similar privacy rights don't exist."Will Apple challenge laws adopted by the Chinese government that give authorities vast access to that data, especially with respect to encrypted keys that authorities will likely demand?" asked Sophie Richardson, China director for Human Rights Watch.Apple declined to answer that question directly, but it pushed back on concerns that Chinese authorities will have easy access to iCloud users' data."Apple has not created nor were we requested to create any backdoors and Apple will continue to retain control over the encryption keys to iCloud data," the Apple spokesman said."As with other countries, we will respond to legal requests for data that we have in our possession for individual users, never bulk data," he added.Rights groups and privacy advocates are not convinced."China is an authoritarian country with a long track record of problematic human rights abuses, and extensive censorship and surveillance practices," Deibert said.Apple users in China should take "extra and possibly inconvenient precautions not to store sensitive data on Apple's iCloud," he advised.Most of those users have already accepted the new status quo, according to Apple. So far, more than 99.9% of iCloud users in China have chosen to continue using the service, the Apple spokesman said.--- Nanlin Fang contributed to this report.Load-Date: March 1, 2018End of Document

CHINA BANS SOCIAL MEDIA TALK OF REPORTER'S VIRAL EYE ROLLStates News ServiceMarch 14, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1111 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:The ruling Chinese Communist Party's censorship machine has suppressed online discussion and reporting of a viral video showing a Chinese journalist covering the country's annual parliament roll her eyes in exasperation at a long-winded, soft-ball question asked by a colleague standing next to her.In the footage, reporter Liang Xiangyi of the Shanghai-based financial news service Yicai Media is seen looking at fellow journalist Zhang Huijun of a U.S.-based TV station with ties to Beijing, then rolling her eyes, as Zhang asks a 45-second question remarkable only for its lack of challenge to the official it is aimed at."How will there be effective supervision for the assets of state-owned companies overseas, so as to prevent capital flight?" Zhang asks, in a rambling question packed full of official media propaganda buzzwords lauding President Xi Jinping's pet Silk Road international infrastructure plan, also known as One Belt, One Road.At one point, she refers to China as "our country."Liang turns to look at Zhang, who works for a China-backed station called American Multimedia TV, possibly wondering which organization she represents, before rolling her eyes in dramatic style at Zhang's sycophantic tone, and turning away again.The video provided a rare moment of color in the heavily scripted environment of NPC press conferences, where tame questions are selected in advance from organizations friendly to Beijing, and was immediately picked up as a meme, spawning several satirical re-enactments, cartoons, and pop-art designs for T-shirts and cell phone cases.But Liang's expression also drew criticism from some in China's tightly controlled state media, amid reports from fellow journalists that her NPC press accreditation was revoked, and that she could face further punishment.Recalled for investigationJournalists said Liang had been recalled by Yicai Media for investigation and self-criticism, and was devastated by the backlash caused by her eye roll, according to unconfirmed posts to social media chat groups.Liang's name quickly became a banned keyword on Chinese social media sites, while the ruling party's propaganda department issued a directive to editors and journalists banning further coverage of the eye roll."Urgent notice: All media personnel are forbidden to discuss the NPC blue-suited reporter incident on social media platforms. Any posts already made must be deleted," a leaked directive published online by the U.S.-based China Digital Times website said."All websites are to avoid hyping this incident," it said.A journalist who gave only his surname Zhang said retribution against Liang may not happen immediately, but is likely inevitable."This has really exploded now," Zhang said. "There is already an emoticon of her facial expression; it's all over the place.""As for how they deal with it, there may be a certain amount of delayed reaction, but it won't be delayed by much," he said. "There will be an internal process first of all [at Yicai Media], and the NPC press center will be sanctioning her. They said her NPC accreditation has been revoked.""The propaganda department will definitely be dealing with the reporter concerned, so this isn't over yet," he said.A second journalist surnamed Chen said Liang had definitely been kicked out of the NPC after the incident."I think we can be pretty sure we won't be seeing any more of Liang Xiangyi at the NPC," Chen said. "This incident has caused so much merriment that you can't even run searches on social media for her name now.""From the point of view of the party, they don't want anyone talking about this ever again," he said.'Sensitive stuff'Chen said that AMTV is one of a number of "overseas" media organizations that are registered outside China, but which put out the official line of the propaganda ministry, and Beijing wants to avoid scrutiny of such groups at all costs."I have written about investment in overseas media, and the identity of these so-called overseas media organizations," he said. "This is really sensitive stuff, I tell you. The party owns these media organizations, but there is far more than that going on below the surface.""I can only really hint at it for now. There are huge risks involved," he said.In 2015, Reuters reported that the Chinese government secretly controls a network of 33 overseas radio stations in 14 countries via its international broadcaster, which is structured so as to hide its true ownership, and which broadcast Beijing's take on global events to listeners in their own countries.The network is run by three expatriate Chinese businessmen who are China Radio International (CRI)'s partners and executives, Reuters said, adding that it reaches from Finland to Nepal to Australia, and from Philadelphia to San Francisco.One of the stations identified in the report broadcasts across the U.S. capital, and Reuters quoted officials as saying they knew nothing of the paper trail leading back to CRI in Beijing.And according to exiled billionaire Guo Wengui, also known as Miles Kwok, the Chinese Communist Party is flooding the United States with its spies, sending dozens of new operatives from the state security police to work in the country at state-owned organizations.State media reportingAn employee who answered the phone at AMTV said Zhang Huijun would be continuing to work as normal following the incident.He denied that the organization has any links to the Chinese government, and tried to distance the organization from Zhang, saying she was a "temporary" hire who didn't represent it.The group's own website says it operates under a "cooperation deal" with state broadcast CCTV, and broadcasts Chinese state television programs in the U.S.The employee cut short the interview when questioned in more detail about its ties to CCTV, however.An employee who answered the phone at Yicai Media declined to comment when contacted by RFA on Tuesday, saying they didn't have details of the incident.The ousted former editor of Baixing magazine, Huang Liangtian, said the huge online reaction to the incident illustrated the sheer dullness of state media reporting."These reporters who are 'covering' the NPC have such a boring time of it these days," Huang said. "I used to cover the NPC as a journalist 30 years ago, and it wasn't like it is now.""Nowadays, it is getting more and more tedious, with both the interviewers and the interviewees just going through the motions," he said.Reported by Wong Siu-san and Sing Man for RFA's Cantonese Service, and by Yang Fan for the Mandarin Service.

This comes as the Commander-in-Chief targets Europe this morning signaling possible payback over what he calls unfair trade policies with the European Union.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I had a lot of problems with European Union and it may work into something very big from that standpoint, from the trade standpoint. The European Union has treated the United States very unfairly when it came to trade. The European Union has been very, very unfair to the United States and I think it will turn out to be very much to their --BARTIROMO: The president will address the trade debate as well as the U.S. economic boom during the first State of the Union Address since taking office where it takes place tomorrow night. We will have it for you live 9:00 p.m. Eastern right here on the Fox Business Network.

CAC Quarante is up a fraction and the DAX index is down a fraction. In Asia overnight, stocks were mostly lower with the exception of Korea which is up one percent. Apple may take a bite out of the iPhone, a new report that claims the technology giant may cut iPhone X production in half in the first quarter not doing as well as they thought I guess.Is technology putting our troops in danger? The new concern over a fitness app that`s used on devices like Fitbit. They are basically indicating exactly where our troops are in the Middle East plus Hillary Clinton uses the Grammy stage to mock President Trump. The appearance that's leaving many feelings fire and fury this morning. All the stories coming up this Monday morning.And joining me to break it all down, Dagen McDowell, Fox Business Network, it's Dagen McDowell, PwC partner Mitch Roschelle, and Pollster and the President of Maslansky and Partners, Lee Carter. Good to see you.LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS: It's great to be here.BARTIROMO: Lots to talk about today and the State of the Union.MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER: Oh yes. Busy week.CARTER: Whoo-hoo. I'm really excited about the State of the Union, you know.BARTIROMO: Yes, me too. We have the State of the Union, we got the FOMC coming out on Wednesday, no interest rate increases expected yet a huge amount of earnings and then the jobs numbers are on Friday. So yes it's a busy week.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Right. And we keep an eye on the 10 year treasury yield because again it -- this is why trade policy and interest rate policy inflation all of wraps up to create some concerns for the market. From here, you know, to talk down the dollar you heard that from treasury secretary last week. Again lower dollar means we are importing inflation that means what does the federal reserve it, that means that we could have higher interest rates this country cannot afford significantly higher interest rates given the levels of debt that were riding and therein lies the problem because Washington won't do anything about these looming problems in terms of the national debt because we're facing a tsunami.BARTIROMO: Well, you know, they're not going to do anything about it during an election year, right? Forget about that. By the way, I know that you don't want to have the treasury secretary talking down anything or talking up anything for that matter. And you mentioned the op-ed and the journal the other day, but don't you in some ways Steven Mnuchin was saying what was so obvious what every administration feels anyway from the beginning of time that yes, a weaker dollar is better for trade, it's just that they don't say it.MCDOWELL: You can say it if you're not the treasury secretary and you can think it if you're the treasury secretary but when it comes to the United States dollar our dear greenback, you just say we support a strong dollar policy.BARTIROMO: Which is every administration has said but they don't do things to indicate that's really how they feel that's what I am saying, I feel like they all think it he just said it.MCDOWELL: And by the way President Trump can say whatever he wants but maybe his cabinet members need to rethink that strategy.BARTIROMOR: Yes, you don't think anybody believed the walk back, do you?MCDOWELL: No, not at all. Not safe.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: -- this morning, former presidential candidate and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee is joining us. He'll be with us momentarily, Eric Trump's wife, President Trump's daughter-in-law Lara Trump for president, senior-adviser Lara Trump is here and the COO of Lamborghini America Alessandro Farmeschi is joining us as well, host of "VARNEY & COMPANY" Stuart Varney as well is here weighing in. Don't miss a moment of it. First now, let's kick it off with the top stories this hour. Trump administration's trade agenda Canada and Mexico are now rejecting a proposal from the White House to rework a key part of NAFTA. Meanwhile, President Trump is hinting at retaliation against the E.U. from what he says is very unfair trade practices. Blake Burman is live at the White House the very latest. Blake, good morning to you.BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Well, so much for all the niceties coming out of Davos. Maria, good morning to you as well, President Trump giving an interview to Piers Morgan that was shot during world the economic forum but aired for the first time yesterday and in it the president saying that he has a lot of problems with European Union. The president saying on the trade standpoint that, we can't get our products in and the U.S. products come in at a very low taxable rate. The president saying that this could quote morph into something very big from a trade standpoint.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)D. TRUMP: The European Union has treated the United States very unfairly when it came to trade, they are not the only ones by the way, I could name many countries and places that do -- but the European Union has been very, very unfair to the United States and I think it will turn out to be very much to their detriment.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURMAN: Meantime, the Wall Street journal is reporting Mexico and Canada rejected a proposal from the U.S. to change the corporate arbitration system that is wrapped into NAFTA, it's called the investor state dispute settlement and that deals with arbitration claims from companies within all three countries. Maria, as you know when he spoke to the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross on set there in Davos last week. He said things are just beginning from the negotiating standpoint as it relates to NAFTA.BARTIROMO: All right. Blake, thanks very much. We will keep following that. Joining us right now is former presidential candidate from Arkansas Governor Fox News contributor Mike Huckabee. Governor, it's good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR: Well, thank you Maria. Great to be with you.BARTIROMO: Well, your reaction here as we know that Canada and Mexico are rejecting this proposal to rework the arbitration part of the NAFTA agreement.HUCKABEE: Well, I'm sure they would but I think they also have to understand that Donald Trump is elected in large measure because he said he would renegotiate the trade deals make it more fair for the United States. None of these trade deals came from Mount Sinai, they weren't on Two Tablets of Stone, they all have the provision that they are made to be changed and to be updated as the economy changes, as conditions change and I think this president should be commended for saying you know what our job is to protect America, American jobs, American economy, we are going to do that, we want to trade that is all an important part of growth. But it's got to be where it's reciprocal and fair. Bravo to the president for doing exactly what he said something were not used to seeing politicians often do.CARTER: So governor, I have a question for you. You know, there is so much talk about how these trade policies -- if we don't get a deal on it might harm U.S. What about these other countries, if they don't do a deal with us, is it going to hurt them as well?HUCKABEE: Of course it would Lee. And I think that's something that maybe needs to be said a whole lot more. I don't hear a lot of people saying what you just said and thank you for saying it because some of these countries they've got a whole lot more to lose than we do. Because they are utterly dependent upon our dollars buying their products and if we decide look, you guys aren't playing fair so, you know, we'll look elsewhere. It's going to put them in a world of hurt, it is really a position of strength that the president looks at. And this is not a president who sees America as weak, a country we have to apologize for, even our economic strength is not a weakness it is something that we should be proud of and we got there by capitalism. Capitalism is a good thing, it empowers people, it helps poor people to become not so poor people and without it we end up like Venezuela. I think we got a great model to say to the rest of the world you want to be better off? Be capitalist, it works.MCDOWELL: Governor, it is Dagen McDowell but some of these policies that the world doesn't exist in a vacuum that these other countries when you -- you have to say these tariffs that were slapped on solar cells and washing machines just last week that actually does impact jobs here in the United States. The jobs created by companies like Samsung and the very red state of South Carolina, you have higher prices on washing machines, you've already heard that from L.G. Electronics so again this actually is done poorly and this is kind of a little willy-nilly side thing with the small tariffs. It's not -- it's not the sky is falling. But again it can hurt Americans if executed improperly or poorly.HUCKABEE: Short term that may be true but long term a trade deal where everybody is playing with the same rules is like playing the Super Bowl where everyone has to play within same rules. If one team gets special treatment and the other team doesn't that is not a fair game, you don't know who the champion is. So short term there may be some, you know, some pain. But the long term is the prices are more realistically reflecting what it cost to produce something, it does mean that Americans have a chance to compete to make those very things. But Americans need to make things, we always have to be able to do some things that if we don't we can't be free. Provide our own energy, make our own food, be able to feed ourselves and to be able to fight for ourselves which means we manufacture our weaponry and items of defense. Manufacturing is a critical part not just of our economy.BARTIROMO: Right.HUCKABEE: But quite frankly without it, we can't be free.BARTIROMO: Well, we already saw L.G. get back and say look we are going to raise prices. Now, obviously if there are going to be tariffs on certain products these companies just going to raise prices. So that's going to be a negative for consumers having said that there is real impact from this tax plan that's very positive. And yet house minority leader Nancy Pelosi continues to criticize it. She's getting a criticism from even within her own party governor after dismissing the president's immigration plan, she's now calling it make America white again proposal. Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NANCY PELOSI, UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVE, MINORITY LEADER: That plan is a campaign to make America white again.SEN. JOE MANCHIN (D) WV: We don't need that type of rhetoric either side. From Nancy, Paul Ryan, or anybody else and I come down this, the president has laid out a template. We are going to look at that template and we are going to work with it.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: You know governor before we get your reaction, I got to get the panel's reaction. I mean what --she is not doing anything that is showing progress for her party.MCDOWELL: No.BARTIROMO: I mean she keeps -- making America white crumbs like you said Armageddon.MCDOWELL: Armageddon, this pathetic little crumbs, a thousand dollars is pathetic crumbs to her. It's a little piece of cheese. I think that she is doubling down but she doesn't -- she sounds moronic and she's doubling down on these comments. I don't understand in what universe she thinks that this resonates with the American people. Let me say this again, a thousand dollars is more than 20 tanks of gas, a thousand dollars can feed a family of four in this country for nearly a month and she lives in a bubble that is San Francisco.CARTER: Absolutely.BARTIROMO: It's absolutely true. Governor, your reaction? Jump in here.HUCKABEE: Well, I tell you Nancy Pelosi is making Marie Antoinette look like Mary Poppins. Oh my gosh, to say the things that she says that is so condescending, so insulting to working class people. Now that's a group of people Nancy Pelosi doesn't relate to, doesn't understand because she lives above them but as Dagen was pointing out and I think so very graphically, a thousand dollars to a family who has a $50,000 annual income look that is a huge amount of money and for most families that is significant, that is a vacation, that is being able to go to the dentist that's a lot of things.BARTIROMO: Yes, but governor you know what the Republicans have some problems of their own. They're distancing themselves after the Steve Wynn allegations, one of the top stories in the journal. Wynn allegations ripple as Republicans seek distance, in the wake of the Wall Street journal report from former employees that there was constant or decades long patterns of sexual misconduct. What say you about that?HUCKABEE: Well, it is a horrible thing. And I am glad that as these things come to life, there's a severance between Steve Wynn and the Republican Party. But if they had known about it and it had been widely known and then they continue the relationship that would be scandalous the fact that they weren't aware of it, they became aware of it, they cut ties. I am not sure what the scandal for the republicans is as much as it is a scandal for Steve Wynn and the tragedy of the people that he abused.BARTIROMO: Yes, we should point out that the Republicans have raised a lot of money this year much more than on the democratic side. But of course he really was a kingpin in terms of raising money. Governor, good to see you, sir. Thank you so much. Stay with us tomorrow.HUCKABEE: Thank you. Thank you.BARTIROMO: We are going to be live in Washington for the State of the Union. We'll be speaking with former DNC Chair Donna Brazil, past Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Congressman Michael McCaul and the Head of Small Business Administration Linda McMahon, plus former White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten with us as well. We have a big show tomorrow live from D.C. as we preview the State of the Union. Back in a moment right here.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Explosions, gunfire, rocking a military base in Afghanistan killing nearly a dozen soldiers, this is the latest in a wave of terrorist attacks across the country. Cheryl Casone with the details there, Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: That's right Maria. So at least 11 soldiers have been killed, 16 of those wounded in an early morning assault on military compound in Kabul. The Islamic State group is claiming responsibility, this comes only two days after more than a hundred people were killed in a suicide attack in the Afghan capital. This month alone more than 200 people have been killed, hundreds wounded in a series of attacks unleashed by the Taliban and the rival Isis.Meanwhile, a popular fitness app is revealing top secret information about the location of U.S. military bases. The Washington post is reporting that the app called Strava shows heat maps which pinpoints soldiers' workouts that they're doing their undisclosed military base even spy out posts. Their information is now out there, it's part of Strava's GPS gathering that is available we should say on smartphones and more importantly the Fitbit which a lot soldiers like to wear.Well, it is merger Monday in the the beverage industry Dr. Pepper Snapple and Keurig Green Mountain are teaming up, it's a great accompany with the combined revenue of $11 billion. Dr. Pepper Snapple's shareholders getting a special cash dividend nearly $104 per share they will hold a 13 percent stake in the newly formed company. The stock is soaring in the premarket as you can see up about 30 -- nearly 38 percent right now, huge stock to watch today. Now you can basically -- I guess you can get Dr. Pepper out of your machine, I made that up. All right. Just kidding. A solid joke. All right.And finally this, Apple is reportedly cutting its iPhone X production in half in the first quarter, this move following disappointing holiday sales in Europe, the West China. Japan's Nikkei Asia reviews that Apple slashed in production down to 20 million units. The publications says part of the problem here could be the iPhone's price tag which starts at about a thousand dollars. Shares of Apple down more than three percent over the last week on concerns about those iPhone sales that stock, remember the company is reporting earnings later this week.And then Japan based cryptocurrency exchange coin check has announced it's going to refund customers about $400 million that was stolen by hackers. About 260,000 people lost their holdings of NEM, this is the world's 10th biggest cryptocurrency last week anyway. Meanwhile, so the U.S. credit card companies are now expected to restrict the purchase of cryptocurrencies in general. Citigroup, Bank of America are reviewing the policies for this. Capital One already deciding it will not allow customers to use credit cards to buy any digital currency. Right now, one Bitcoin worth about $11,000 right now, you'll never know when it's going to start over.BARTIROMO: Right. Down from 20,000 a couple -- a week ago. Cheryl, thank you. Coming up, the Grammys get political, the controversy after Hillary Clinton makes a cameo appearance and bashes President Trump. Then made in the USA, how a luxury eyewear company is changing the industry by manufacturing their products domestically. Back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The eyewear industry, the glasses industry in focus this morning while eyeglasses are in essential for millions of Americans. 95 percent of all frames are made outside the United States according to the Alliance for American Manufacturing. But a company in Chicago is looking to change that, State Optical assembles all of its eyewear here in the United States and we love made in the USA so we are happy to welcome Scott Shapiro to the program. State Optical company CEO and co-founder. Scott, great to see you.SCOTT SHAPIRO, CEO, STATE OPTICAL: Thank you for having me.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much for joining us. So we are all trying on the glasses. I love the way those look on you, Dagen.MCDOWELL: I am blonde legally and so I need a new pair of glasses because I fall asleep in them all the time and crush them and these are -- these are beautifully made.SHAPIRO: They look great on you.CARTER: They look great on you.BARTIROMO: What do you get by manufacturing in the United States? Where here all day having a conversation about trade and about tariffs and tell us how this is economically positive for you.SHAPIRO: So, first and foremost, you know, there is a lot of pride that goes with making products here in United States. We get to put Americans back to work. There is about 50 craftsmen working in our factory today that wouldn't have those jobs if we were outsourcing that overseas. But I think much more importantly for our brand is it really connects the patients or the customers with the craft of making eyewear. You know, we say in our factory it takes 70 steps to make one pair of glasses and over 50 percent of that has to be done by hand. So, I think, you know, in our industry, there is a lot of -- there is a large misconception about what a pair of glasses should be worth, what really goes into making high quality eyewear. And by making it here in the United States, it gives us the opportunity to tell that story to really get people in touch with that craft.ROSCHELLE: Scott, one of the things that we hear, see, and say all the time and I'm curious about your perspective is finding talents. So you said you have 50 people in Chicago, is finding talent a challenge for your business?SHAPIRO: Very, very difficult. So I think what we don't talk about a lot talk when we talk about bringing manufacturing back to United States is the lack of infrastructure we have here in the U.S. to make things particularly something like eyewear. It is a skilled -- it's a very skilled labor. And so everyone of those 50 craftsmen that we trained in our factory have to be trained from step one. None of them have any experience doing that. And it generally takes about six months to get someone up and running before they can do the job on their own.MCDOWELL: Most to the high-end eyewear that would be in the same league as your glasses is made in Japan and you mentioned earlier in Italy. This retail, the ones I've got on for about $400 dollars but is your profit margin slimmer than those manufacturers overseas because your labor costs are more expensive here?SHAPIRO: So great question. First and foremost, I should say that most of the product that says -- or I won't say that, a lot of the product that says made in Italy, made in Japan is in fact made in China.BARTIROMO: Wow.SHAPIRO: A vast majority of product made in China and there's a lot of ways to get around that country of origin. But the product that is genuinely made in Italy or made in Japan, you know, their workforce is well-paid as well, those workers also get paid a similar wage to workers in the United States. So our profit margins aren't significantly worse than theirs. And in fact, there is a lot of benefits conveniences that we benefit from by making frames here in United States. So a lot of -- a lot of advantages that offset that difference.BARTIROMO: Where do people get the glasses?SHAPIRO: So, we're in over 1100 retail locations currently. All independent eye care providers. So, you mentioned you have an optometrist across the street, they might carry the product but only independent offices.BARTIROMO: Really great. Scott, great to have you on the show today. Thank you so much.SHAPIRO: Thank you very much for having me.BARTIROMO: Scot Shapiro. We love your glasses. These are beautiful.SHAPIRO: Yes. Thank you.BARTIROMO: All right. Coming up. President Trump first State of the Union and Trump for president senior adviser Lara Trump will weigh in on what to expect. That's next. And Lockheed Martin reports fourth-quarter results, beating earnings and revenue expectations. We break down those numbers. Stock is up about three percent right now. Back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Monday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining me this Monday. It is Monday, January 29th. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast. President Trump gears up for his first State of the Union Address tomorrow night. He is expected to tout the booming U.S. economy, infrastructure, and trade. We are taking the show live to Washington, D.C. for full coverage tomorrow and Wednesday. Join us live from D.C. as we preview and analyze the president's first State of the Union. Plus, Hillary Clinton making a surprise appearance at the Grammy Awards last night, taking an opportunity to slam the president.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He had a long-time fear of being poisoned. One reason why he liked to like to eat at McDonald's, nobody knew he was coming and the food was safely pre-made.JAMES CORDEN, HOST, GRAMMY AWARDS: That's it. We got it. That's the one.CLINTON: You think so?(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Reaction from Trump family members coming up, straight ahead. Plus, futures pointing to a weaker opening for the broader averages today as we kick off the new week on Wall Street after another record-setter last week. Personal income and spending just hit the wires, both measures rising four-tenths of one percent in the month of December. It is a big week for the markets because the markets are looking lower but they've got a lot to react to this week including an FOMC meeting on Wednesday. The State of the Union, Tuesday night. Apple earnings as well as Amazon earnings on Thursday and then the jobs number on Friday.This all after the major indices closed at another record- high on Friday due to strong corporate earnings. Take a look at that market. Dow Industrials up 223 points Friday, NASDAQ up 95 points. Global markets this morning are mixed. Take a look, European indices are edging higher in London and in Paris but the DAX in Germany is fractionally lower. In Asia overnight, markets closed mostly lower with the exception of Korea which is up one percent. Earnings in focus on Wall Street once again. This is the busiest week so far for fourth-quarter earnings. Lockheed Martin kicked off the busiest week for the fourth quarter with a beat on earnings and revenue. The stock is up 3-1/4 percent surging after the defense giant also offer an upbeat outlook for 2018.Intel under fire again this morning. The chip giant reportedly telling Chinese companies about a security flaw before disclosing it to the U.S. government. Making a legendary sports car more friendly, family friendly as well. We have a look at the new ride from Lamborghini as I speak with the company's COO and he takes us inside those hot wheels. All of that coming up this morning. But first, topping our news this half an hour. Hillary Clinton's Grammy jab. The former presidential candidate makes a surprise appearance at the awards show last night to mock the president and read from the book Fire and Fury.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: He had a longtime fear of being poisoned, one reason why he liked to eat at McDonald's, nobody knew he was coming and the food was safely pre-made.CORDEN: That's it. We got it. That's the one.CLINTON: You think so?(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: All right. Joining me right now is Trump for President Senior Adviser and the President's daughter-in-law, Laura Trump. Great to see you. Thank you so much, Lara.LARA TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP'S DAUGHTER-IN-LAW: Absolutely.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Your brother-in-law Donald Trump Jr. tweeted this this morning after the Grammys. The more Hillary goes on television the more the American people realize how awesome it is to have Donald Trump in office. Lara?L. TRUMP: True. It's so true.BARTIROMO: Did you -- did you watch the Grammys?L. TRUMP: You know what, Maria, I stopped watching all these shows a long time ago for this exact reason and I think the American public as a whole probably feels the same way. I thought it was despicable, disgusting, and quite frankly sad that Hillary Clinton obviously needs to validate herself in some way. If she's so keen on reading things, maybe she could read us her 33,000 missing e-mails because I think I love to hear about those. It was just so disrespectful. I'm so sad that this is the point that this awards show has come to.BARTIROMO: Well, it's also -- from a marketing standpoint or a business standpoint, not very smart because it's just making this assumption that everybody agrees with you.L. TRUMP: Yes. And obviously the country does not agree because Donald Trump is our president, they chose him November 8th, 2016. Look at where this country has come in a year that he's been in office. You know, the economy is booming, people are back to work, unemployment is at, you know, record-lows right now and we have so much to look forward to from this president and I think even people that didn't vote are starting to get onboard.BARTIROMO: Well, you make a lot of good point because the President does have a great story to tell --L. TRUMP: Yes.BARTIROMO: -- for the State of the Union tomorrow night. He is preparing for his first State of the Union tomorrow night and obviously the economy is going to be a positive story that's going to be one thing to talk about also foreign policy.L. TRUMP: Yes.BARTIROMO: How much are you expecting him to get into things like ISIS being defeated.L. TRUMP: Well, I think he should talk about it because nobody does. We went from 44,000 ISIS fighters, just about a year ago to under 1,000 right now and it's really under reported but that's huge, people in this country as of even a year ago, we're very scared about how we were going to defeat ISIS, is it possible? I'm sure we're going to hear about that, were going to hear about the fact that on the world stage, the United States has reclaimed its place as the leader. You know, you see my father-in-law traveled to different countries, you see the respect that he's given -- the welcome that he's given in these different countries. It's so great that we have our country back.BARTIROMO: And that's what he said when he was in Davos, also talking about the economic strength like jobs, like the unemployment rate, where it is and also the regulatory framework which is rolled back. You know, it feels like there is a big runway to this because there's a number of sectors that have not been impacted yet form the regulatory rollback. Is he expecting this 0-- the good times to get even better? I mean, in 2018 and '19, he's talking about continued economic growth.L. TRUMP: Well, I think so, I mean, regulatory reform is obviously huge. You're going to see these tax cuts kick in. I mean, people next week are going to see their paychecks higher in this country. Thanks to Donald Trump. And I think he is right, this is super charged the economy, I think 2018, 2019 even there's opportunity for a lot of more growth in this country.BARTIROMO: So do we have it then, economic issues in the State of the Union perhaps an infrastructure plan? He's going to talk about that as well, right?L. TRUMP: Well, I'm excited as you are, see here what he's going to talk about, I'm sure immigration will be on there as well. That's such a huge topic, you know, it feels like it's on the one yard line, we'er almost there and it's something that's so needed and necessary in this country.BARTIROMO: Will you be in the hall there tomorrow night?L. TRUMP: We're hoping to be there. Yes. I think so.BARTIROMO: Let me ask you this because of course, then there's some bad news as well for the Republicans this morning and that is Las Vegas real estate casino mogul Steve Wynn resigning as finance chair for the RNC after reports of years of sexual misconduct here. Wynn has denied wrongdoing we should say but in a statement, he did not want to be a distraction, he said to the Republican Party. What's your take on this? Shares of Wynn Resorts down sharply as the company announced it will form a committee to investigate these allegations, Lara.L. TRUMP: Yes. Well, I don't know too much about it to be honest with you. I know he resigned and Ronna, the chairwoman of the RNC who's amazing, accepted his resignation and she's going to do what's best for the party. And, you know, we're sad to see him go. He was a great supporter of the President.BARTIROMO: Well, at the same time, the Republican Party has been raising a lot of money, much more than the Democrats. And so, as you see that nest egg getting bigger, it must tell you that business and big donors out there are seeing more opportunity on the RNC side.L. TRUMP: Well, not just -- not just big donors but a lot of the majority of the money that we raised is small dollars, that means that the average person in this country is supporting what the President is doing. They want to see him in office again for another four years in 2020 and I think that speaks volumes.BARTIROMO: So what are President's plans? I mean, when you talk with him sort of off-line, not an official capacity but as his daughter-in-law, what does he want to get accomplished for the next three years?L. TRUMP: Well, I mean it's what you heard on the campaign trail which he is delivering on. He -- the economy was so big to him and obviously as a businessman that was something that, you know, was his target from the very beginning. Let's reboot the economy, let's get it moving, you see where we are now, the Dow hit all-time highs.BARTIROMO: Do we need as a business, look, get stuff done on time, get it under budget.L. TRUMP: Yes.BARTIROMO: It's a really good lesson.L. TRUMP: No. It's so true. I mean, you look at -- I always talk about the Wollman Rink and the story there that the city had it for so long, they couldn't get an ice skating rink though in Central Park. Donald Trump came in, ahead of schedule under budget and that's what he wants to do for this country and I think we're seeing it happens.BARTIROMO: Yes. It's a great point that you make because I was talking about somebody else with that regulations. It took 13 years to build a bridge in Bayonne, took another 25 years to do an infrastructure plan in Alaska. This rollback in regulations just sort of has unleashed animal spirits.L. TRUMP: Yes. Cut through the red tape, let's get it done and this country deserves it.BARTIROMO: And -- but the detractors are still there, Lara. How is the President dealing with the media backlash, the backlash on the left when you see Nancy Pelosi calling the $1,000 checks crumbs?L. TRUMP: Well, that's just -- that's plain sad and it's ridiculous. I think a lot of people in this country would be thrilled to have $1,000 and it's sad that she thinks it's crumbs. And listen, they proved themselves wrong every single day, they lied about these tax cuts that people are going to see next week that it's true that the majority of people in this country, 91 percent of people are going to be making more money. And I think every single day, you know, those people on the left that have been so harsh on Donald Trump, on our president, every day they discredit themselves and they prove themselves wrong a little bit more.BARTIROMO: What are you doing in terms of the 2020 campaign at this point? Do we have a sense of who will be running against your father-in-law?L. TRUMP: Well, I think we ruled out Oprah. initially we thought that was a -- well, like a week ago. You know what, I don't know, I love to know who it's going to be. I think we are just -- we're raising money as you said, you know, and I think the president is going to be able to run on, you know, the great job that he is doing for this country. His track record is going to I think easily take him into another four years.BARTIROMO: Actually since the Democrats are coming out with the resist and, you know, pushing back instead of --(CROSSTALK)L. TRUMP: That's all they have. They have no message, they have no leader, they have no agenda other than resist. And it's very obvious, it's very transparent to people I think.BARTIROMO: All right, Lara. Great to see you. Before you go, any updates on baby Luke?L. TRUMP: Well, we had him on the pool down to Mar-a-Lago, so we're trying to get him swimming.BARTIROMO: That's so great. We have a picture, I wanted to share that picture --(CROSSTALK)L. TRUMP: Oh, his first haircut. Yes. Down in Florida too.BARTIROMO: Cute in his first hair cut. Congratulations, Lara and Eric Trump. Good to see you.L. TRUMP: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much. Coming up. New concerns over Intel's computer chip flaws. Why the company reportedly warned Chinese companies it will (INAUDIBLE) the U.S. government about the security vulnerabilities. And then the Lamborghini gets family friendly. We've got the luxury automaker's newest SUV in our plaza. I'll talk with the COO of the company. Back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Big week on Wall Street even technology earnings this week, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, all set to report their numbers this week. Joining us now, the host of "VARNEY & COMPANY" Stuart Varney to look ahead. Stu, good morning to you.STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria. I've got to two words. Maybe three. Don't disappoint because if any of these big five and this Wednesday and Thursday when we get the big five results. If they really disappoint, I think you can put a crack in the market. All the --not all. A backtrack again, a lot of the money going into the market has gone into the five big tech stocks on expectation of stellar performances each and every quarter. If any of them falters, I think you'll see the market overall falter, but you know, I think, Maria, there's another kind of test coming here as well.What are the big tech companies going to do with the money that they're bringing back to America and the money that they're going to get extra from the tax cuts? I suspect that a good chunk of it will go to stock buybacks, and/or dividend increases. And I think the left will go nuts about that, that will be truly crumbs for the workers, crumbs for America, and everything goes to the rich stockholders. I don't agree with that point of view, but I think that's what they're going to say.BARTIROMO: Yes, I agree there's not a lot of room for error here. These stocks are up big time in the last year. But, Stu, you know, my worry on technology is the regulatory part of thing. I think you're going to see as Donald Trump is rolling back regulations for this economy, actually, I think there's a new approach to technology, because these companies are more powerful than we have ever known, today, and they're probably going to see higher regulation, you see it happen in Europe, and I think you're going to see it here in the U.S.VARNEY: Yes, but I want to know what kind of regulation. It's very hard to break up, say, an Amazon on antitrust grounds because basically what they're doing is helping the everyday consumer and lowering prices, it's to America's benefit that this company exists. So, I'm not sure of what framework they would use to regulate them and rein them in, but I do agree with you that it's heavy pressure to do just that.BARTIROMO: Yes, because they had so much information on us. They may be helping the average person but we're giving something up in the process, and that is privacy, that we've got all these data. So, much is that data worth to government that's overseeing all of this? That's all I'm saying, I just think that the regulatory environment is going to be an unknown for these companies.VARNEY: And why don't I get a piece of the action? If they know everything about me and they sell that information to somebody else albeit anonymously, I don't care.BARTIROMO: Yes.VARNEY: Where do I come in here?BARTIROMO: You made my point. That's exactly right. Stu, we're going to look at those numbers and we'll see if it cracks this market. It's going to be -- have to be really bad to do that. Stuart, thank you, we'll see you in about 10 minutes with more on "VARNEY & COMPANY," top of the hour right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Join Stuart. First though, Lockheed Martin beats on fourth-quarter revenue, expects a rise in earnings this year. Good guidance has that stock up three percent right now. Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange watching Lockheed and the broader market. Nic?NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Hey, good morning, Maria. You're absolutely right. Taking a look at Lockheed Martin which is to the upside. They came out with a fourth-quarter revenue. It beat the streak. Stock is up almost three percent, 2.79, to be precise, 345 and change. They did so well on the higher sales F-35 fighter jet program, also raising guidance for 2018. And don't forget, President Trump's administration, the Defense Department is ready to fork it out, and in fact, ready to spend about $391 billion over 15 years to develop and buy more than 2400 of the supersonic warplanes. So, a winner here for Lockheed Martin and going forward, also upside potential.Then there's Intel, this is an ongoing story about the security flaws; these are critical. The question is why China's government may have known more before about it before even the U.S. government because it seems that they actually let notified a small group of customers, including some Chinese technology customers and because China's government actually monitors those types of conversations, in fact, the Chinese government may have known before the USA, the left out the USA government to let them know about these security flaws. The stock is looking down about a half of one percent, but it's up almost 32 percent in the last 52 weeks. So, it has been a great performer like many of the tech stocks.And coming up, this is great. I love it because I'm definitely into this. A Lamborghini for your whole family, Maria. Checking this one out. Cool features of the Italian automaker's newest luxury SUV, Lamborghini, with Maria, next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. As I come to you from the plaza right now, we've got a set of hot wheels to show you because Lamborghini is roaring in and rolling into the SUV market. Joining me right now is the Chief Operating Officer of Lamborghini America, Alessandro Farmeschi. Good to see you, sir. Thank you so much for joining us, Alessandro.ALESSANDRO FARMESCHI, CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, LAMBORGHINI AMERICA: Good morning. Our pleasure.BARTIROMO: We're going to look at the car in a moment. But first, characterize what you're seeing out there in terms of -- in terms of business and the market. How is the reception for these new -- these new cars?FARMESCHI: Oh, the reception is unbelievable. I'd say that we have already sold out entirely the 2018. We are receiving great, great response from our customers here in U.S. but also worldwide, I would say. This is a great news, the fastest SUV in the planet. And so -- and the only one, by the way.BARTIROMO: Yes. Let's talk about it. This is the Urus.FARMESCHI: Yes.BARTIROMO: The Urus. And this is -- it goes 189 miles an hour?FARMESCHI: Yes, exactly.BARTIROMO: Tell us about it.FARMESCHI: Yes, this is a super sports car, so it has all the feature of a super sports car. 650 horsepower, 0-60 to -- in 3.6 seconds.BARTIROMO: Wow!FARMESCHI: And it has all the technology to support the performances and the agility and the emotion, I would say, of a pure Lamborghini. Also, in terms of design, of a super sports car. Therefore, this car is conceived also not to be just a super sports car but also an SUV. So, it has the (INAUDIBLE) agility.BARTIROMO: Right. Just the fact that you are into the SUV market. I mean, you said earlier, this can hold a couple of golf bags. What was so important -- why was it so important for a Lamborghini to be here, to be in the SUV market?FARMESCHI: Basically, what we saw is that the SUV segment is expanding every year. And number one, United States is having a great success. Before, we believed that not having anything in the super sports segment in the SUV environment, we believe that this was the perfect package to also families, our clients, a different way of living the Lamborghini every day, living Lamborghini during the weekends, during the holidays with their friends so because you can host four, five people, you space for three golf bags. And so, I mean, this the perfect combination.BARTIROMO: Let me ask you, Alessandro, I know that you reported global sales up in the double digits, just recently you did. You took the car at the Detroit Auto Show. How much does this cost?FARMESCHI: This cost $200,000.BARTIROMO: $200,000.FARMESCHI: Yes, we start from there.BARTIROMO: And how does that fit in the overall pricing of Lamborghini?FARMESCHI: This is, like we say, almost in line with our Huracan. And is positioned at the right level to -- let me say -- offer a different product that's not just only a super sports car but something more.BARTIROMO: It feels like a super sports car as well as a big family -- it is very family friendly. And this is gorgeous. Tell us about the interior.FARMESCHI: Here, you can see that you have --BARTIROMO: Oh, now, I feel like I'm in a Lamborghini.FARMESCHI: You immediately --BARTIROMO: Immediately. You're absolutely right.FARMESCHI: (INAUDIBLE) new seater. So, the seats are sporty. Also here, the interior, you have here in the middle, all the commands like you are in a aircraft or --BARTIROMO: Right. You got my iPad right here, right?FARMESCHI: Yes. These are two touchscreens and then you --BARTIROMO: Two iPads.FARMESCHI: Yes, yes, yes. Two iPads, all both touchscreen so you can go and surf here in the navi system into the infotainment system, and you can also with the sensor levers select the driving modes; you can drive in a comfortable way, you can have a sporty way, race way, but also this is the new speaker.BARTIROMO: So, it's almost like autonomous?FARMESCHI: It's not exactly autonomous.BARTIROMO: It's not exactly autonomous because you can't stop and not -- you can't control.FARMESCHI: (INAUDIBLE) the driver is always at the center, because we speak about emotions, and for us, driving the Lamborghini is key, all of our clients want to drive their Lamborghini.BARTIROMO: It's fantastic.FARMESCHI: And in terms of support, the driver, we also provide the technology to help the driver, so recently in this car, we have a full advance driver assistance system that helps the driver in case of a imminent crash to break the car and talk to support in case (INAUDIBLE) situation the driver.BARTIROMO: Yes, which is why we talked all about autos at the CES Show, the technology show, because technology is in all of the cars. Alessandro, this is beautiful, the moment I stepped in the car, I could tell you I'm in a Lamborghini. It's absolutely gorgeous, it's the Urus, and Alessandro Farmeschi, it is good to see you. Thank you so much for joining us.FARMESCHI: My pleasure.BARTIROMO: Stay with us. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Once again, our thanks to Lamborghini and Alessandro Farmeschi, thanks for showing me around this high-tech car. Thank you, Dagen McDowell, Mitch Roschelle, and Lee Carter. We'll see you again tomorrow, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. "VARNEY & COMPANY" begins right now. Stuart, over to you.VARNEY: Maria, thank you very much indeed. Now, this is not the way we usually open the show. It'sLoad-Date: January 29, 2018End of Document

Thank you so much. Good morning, everybody. Happy Wednesday to you. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Thanks for joining us. It is January 3rd, 2018. You're top stories right now, 6:00 am on the East Coast. Betting big on bitcoin.Billionaire and early Facebook investor, Peter Thiel taking a shot on the cryptocurrency to the tune of nearly $20 million. Thiel spoke with him that his optimism for the currency, well, in Saudi Arabia back in October.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PETER THIEL, ENTREPRENEUR: I do think people are a little bit maybe underestimating bitcoin specifically because it is like a reserve form of money. It's like gold. And it's just a store of value, you don't actually need to use it to make payments.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: More in what Thiel's big bet means for bitcoin coming up this morning. The tax bill paying off yet again for American workers. The very latest this morning as the Southwest Airlines and American Airlines say the will give $1000 bonuses to employees.Merger blocked, the U.S. government deny Alibaba's Ant Financial proposed one and a quarter billion dollar acquisition of global payment service Money Gram. The major impact, the decision could have another U.S. companies trying to sell abroad. Markets kicking off the New Year in record territory.Take a look, S&P 500 and NASDAQ closing at new highs yesterday. The NASDAQ cracking 7000 yesterday. Dow Industrials notching their second-highest close on record up 105 point. This morning, take a look at the action, the momentum continues.Dow Industrials set to open up better than 50 points today. NASDAQ up 14 and the S&P 500 also up quarter of a percent. Technology stuff driving the gain across the world this morning in Europe certainly. CAC is up almost half of a percent in Paris, DAX Index in Germany up a 30 of a percent.FT 100 this morning pulling back by a fraction. And in Asia overnight markets is higher. Nikkei in Japan remains closed for holiday. Trading resumes in Japan tomorrow. The other majors up fractionally. Weight Watchers are getting hype in the details as DJ Khaled becomes the brand's newest ambassador.And one Minor League Baseball team is squaring off on the court literally. We've got to look at their Spongebob themed uniform. They've taken the internet by storm this morning. All those stories coming up this morning (INAUDIBLE) to talk all about it.Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Benchmark Managing Partner Kevin Kelly, and "The Wall Street Journal" editorial board member, Fox News Contributor Mary Kissell is here. Great to see you.MCDOWELL: Good morning, Maria. Great to be here.BARTIROMO: Happy Wednesday, everybody.MCDOWELL: Right on.BARTIROMO: Jam-packed show today.MCDOWELL: And there's a deadline at the House Intelligence Committee today. Deadline for the Department of Justice and the FBI to turn over documents related to the Christopher Steele dossier on now President Trump. I read that report, I was like, "Maria is going to be out on this."BARTIROMO: Or they're going to be in contempt of congress. Now what does that mean exactly, this deadline? I mean this is an important deadline and we'll see if they come across because they've stonewalling this group, this committee since August.MARY KISSELL, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: We'll see how far congress is going to go. Is congress willing to put somebody in jail if they don't produce the documents, the defense subpoena or if don't agree to testify? I think it could be a test of executive balance of power here, Maria between congress and the executive. We'll see.BARTIROMO: And I liked the piece of the Journal today basically saying, "What if this is true? What if in fact this dossier was used as the justification to wiretap the Trump campaign?"KISSELL: Yes. And what did the FBI know? Did they know it was full of Russian intelligence and salacious stuff that wasn't true about the president? Did they take it to a judge? Did they vouch for it? Who did that? Lots of questions.BARTIROMO: We're on that today for sure. Coming up this morning joining the conversation, Republican National Committee Chairman Ronna Romney McDaniel is here. Former House speaker Newt Gingrich is with us this morning.Former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. and American Enterprise Institute senior fellow John Bolton joining the conversation. And Citizens Financial CEO Bruce Van Saun is with us. Plus CEO of the U.S. Concrete, Bill Sandbrook. You don't want to miss the moment of it.We've got a lot to talk about this morning, so do stay with us. We take it off right here with this top story. One of Silicon Valley's biggest investor making a massive bitcoin bet, Founders Fund, the Venture Capital firm founded by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel has amassed hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoin.According to "The Wall Street Journal", sources tell the Journal that his firm brought around $15 to $20 million in digital currency which it now says is worth hundreds of millions after it's nearly meteoric rise this year.Here's what Thiel told me about the cryptocurrency's potential when I sat down with him back in October in Riyadh.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)THIEL: I'm skeptical of most of them. I do think people are a little bit maybe underestimating bitcoin specifically because it is like a reserve form of money. It's like gold. And it's just a store of value, you don't actually need to use it to make payments.And if bitcoin ends up being a cyber-equivalent of gold, it has a great potential left. It is a very different kind of thing from what people in Silicon Valley normally focus on companies, not, you know, algorithms or protocols. So this may be one exception that's very underestimated.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Bitcoin prices spike after the Journal report of the investment. Kevin Kelly, what do you think about this? This better certainly paid off big for Thiel so far.KEVIN KELLY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, I absolutely love this. I mean this is the validation of the asset class. I mean you're starting to see the world's largest investors get into it finally after the largest futures exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange launch futures on it as well the CBO (ph).So you have the adaptation of that. But this goes back to basically a currency that can be used should you need to get around price controls or surging inflation in prices. We've seen Latin American investors and citizens are using this to get away from Venezuela.You know, they're getting hyperinflation. So this is a great way. And it's better than gold because what are you going to do, lug around a bunch of expensive gold somewhere? You can't do that, right, in the transfer of that.MCDOWELL: But it's an instrument of pure speculation. And there are literally hundreds of other cryptocurrencies. And for now the mania and fixation is on this one. And I'd argue, it's not like gold. At least gold has a use. You can use it to make jewelry.There is no underlying use or value of this asset if you want to call it that. And by the way, we should remind people, Peter Thiel is one really rich dude and he can afford to lose $20 million just on taking a flyer on something like bitcoin. Your average person cannot afford that.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: It's not a flyer.BARTIROMO: But my think is --MCDOWELL: It isn't a flyer now, it might --(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Can I tell you this? Listen, we're sitting here, we're so privileged to have a banking system we can trust and transact and we get to do that. If I'm somebody in a developing nation where there is no bank or I have a government that imposing its will and it's a dictatorship, I can actually use this and become my own bank. Tons of people have their own phones --MCDOWELL: But you can use any of the other cryptocurrencies. That's my point. And it's not that --KELLY: We're not talking about the other, we're talking about bitcoin.MCDOWELL: OK. But that's why this is dangerous because this is where the speculation is. And my point is is that anybody who needs a way to transact business outside the traditional banking system and transactional networks, they could choose another cryptocurrency at some point.It's not people in Latin America who need to do deals with other people. It's bartenders from coast-to-coast who are speculating on this, who could get their shirts handed to them, and their pants, and their shoes, and their socks.KISSELL: It's not a replacement for the U.S. dollar. Maria, you asked for, you know, what's it backed by? What's the U.S. dollar backed by? The faith and credit of U.S. government because we're no longer on the gold standard.KELLY: And it didn't work in 2008 where people wanted to get their money back from the banks, but they couldn't and there was a run on (INAUDIBLE)(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: Yes. But you know what, the dollar didn't collapse. The dollar didn't collapse. That's a false narrative.BARTIROMO: I think comparing it to dollar value --KELLY: Yes, of course, because it's --MCDOWELL: The dollar didn't collapse in 2008, Kevin. That's the point. You're acting as if this is a currency and it's not.KELLY: It is.MCDOWELL: It's a vehicle for speculators.KISSELL: Look, look, I think it's great that the market is experimenting that our regulators are watching closely but letting this great experiment happen. Maybe bitcoin has a certain purpose in the marketplace, maybe it facilitates certain kinds of online transactions, maybe it is just a tool for criminals.I don't know how it's going to end up. But look, this is a real-life experiment going on. I think it's great. It's not going to replace the dollar. It's not gold, but, you know, let's let the market figure out how to us it.KELLY: If I want to take Western Union and send money to a foreign country, it could take me a couple of days and it's heavy in fees. Or I could just have the party I want to send you, I can buy some bitcoin right now, they could buy some bitcoin to transact and it's faster.MCDOWELL: I'm not arguing that there's a valid use for cryptocurrencies, but that's not how it is being used today. It is being used for people to speculate.And when you convince people that only bitcoin is the future. Why not Litecoin, why not ripple, why not one of the other myriad cryptocurrencies that you're encouraging people to potentially lose everything they own.KELLY: I don't know who's encouraging it.BARTIROMO: We're going to talk about the tax plan and the impact, Southwest and American Airlines are now giving $1,000 bonuses to employees, basically celebrating the new tax plan signed into law by President Trump.I mean, this is just getting better and better. The airlines joining a handful of other corporate giants including AT&T, Wells Fargo all announcing bonuses after the bill passed. Do you think this continues?Do you think, Mary, I mean, some of this bonus payout in 2017 was too obviously get it on the '17 tax as opposed to '18 because you're going to lose deductions.KISSELL: Right. Well, you may see money return to people in other ways, you may see it return through heights in their salary, you may see them get bigger bonuses. I mean, this is what happens when you have a growing economy.But, you know, as far as the airlines are concerned, you know, personally I would like to have, I don't know, a free sandwich on economy in Delta. Maybe the next time I fly, I mean, I'm happy for the employees, but come on.MCDOWELL: But happy employees make for a better flying experience.KISSELL: Yes, that's true.MCDOWELL: We know that because we've seen the opposite of American. Delta, yes. American, not so much.BARTIROMO: But it's great to see all of these companies responding to this tax plan and paying out new money to employees.KELLY: Good corporate stewards --BARTIROMO: A real upside surprise here.KELLY: Yes, good corporate stewards are going to take care of all stakeholders including their employees and we're not seeing it. Not only on the public side here, we're talking about the airlines. But even Bob Parsons who founded GoDaddy.He's a private now. He gave it to his own -- he's a private enterprise now running his own money. So I mean you're seeing it trickle, not only throughout the public corporations, but also private enterprise as well.BARTIROMO: And then there's one of the top stories in the Journal today, the proposed acquisition of global payment service Money Gram by Alibaba's Ant Financial is off after the U.S. government blocked the one and a quarter billion dollar deal.The news coming nearly a year to the day that Alibaba founder Jack Ma met with then President elect Donald Trump in New York where Ma pledged to help create 1 million American jobs. Does this have implications for the Chinese purchases of American companies? What is behind this? Is this a national security issue?KISSELL: Well, these transactions go through a very sophisticated process, Maria, the heads of a lot of agencies come together and talk about these transactions and go through them. And look, Jack Ma, the ownership of Alibaba was never entirely clear.Investors knew that when they took upon on the company. He's very close to the Chinese government. It's a fiction that he's an entrepreneur like a Warren Buffet or somebody in the United States. He's fundamentally different. He operates a different system.KELLY: I can tell you absolutely this is actually a shot across the bow to the Chinese companies and one of the reasons why is the transparency you're talking about and Donald Trump actually blocked an acquisition in September.Lattice Semiconductor was supposed to be bought out by Chinese company. It got denied. You've actually seen even U.S. companies sue against acquires. The transparency isn't there. Yes, it's a national security issue.The last spring, two House of Representative members said the acquisition could allow for malicious actors to obtain data on U.S. military personnel and there's families who use the service. And this goes back to what happened with Aquafax. If somebody gets in, it steals the data and information, we are all in deep trouble.MCDOWELL: We should be clear about something. This is not President Trump willy-nilly bringing the hammer down on this deal. This is a deal that went through the committee on foreign investment in the U.S. and it did not pass muster. So it went through the regular channels for a deal of this scope and size and origin.KELLY: But this highlights back again, the Fintech's base is so competitive, they're competing the, one in IPO later this year, and they're competing against bitcoin for multinational transactions.BARTIROMO: But I think you make a good point in terms of the data and the information on Americans. Should the Chinese acquire this company? All right. We'll take a break. When we come back, new terrorism concerns.Official say a man posted pictures of himself outside several New York City landmarks posing with ISIS logos. The very latest, there's New York City officials beef up security, they are acting on that.And then the new NASDAQ record closing above 7000, first time ever 7000. We're taking a look at the New Year rally and how market optimism might continue into 2018. Back in a minute right here.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A supporter of ISIS posting a disturbing selfie in front of New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art. Cheryl Casone with the detail. Cheryl.CASONE: Yes, Maria, good morning. Somebody is spreading selfies of a man wearing ISIS logos while posing on New York City streets. These pictures are coming up after the terror group called for more lone wolves style attacks. THE NYPD said (INAUDIBLE) of the images.They're investigating, but at this time, there's no credible threats related to the City of New York. Now police sources are telling "The New York Post", they see these kinds of photos all the time. They often end up being fakes. Nonetheless, New York City is beefing up security around Times Square.They've installed more y traffic barriers there. They city expected to double at $7.5 million budget for installing those concrete structure. Plus, 50 million for some new structures over the next few years.This comes two months after an Uzbek national killed eight people by plowing a rented truck down in nearly one mile stretch of the bike path that happened on Halloween here in New York City. Well, a former Taliban hostage is set to be in court today and is facing 15 charges that include sexual assault and even death threats. Joshua Boyle, the Canadian man accused of those crimes.Remember, they were rescued in October. They had been prisoners of the Taliban. He and his American wife Caitlan Coleman were captured by those terrorists back in 2012 where they were backpacking across Afghanistan while their three children were all born in captivity.Of course they were rescued. They've been home in Canada, but now he's got some legal troubles. Maria, those are headlines.BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thank you so much. We are watching that ex- Taliban hostage in court. And I feel like the story is getting stranger and stranger. What do you guys think about this?KELLY: It's too hard to tell. I mean I think the issue here as that he put his family in jeopardy. They lost a child over there, too. It's too complex and convoluted to see what's actually happening, but it reminds me similar to the Bowe Bergdahl situation and that kind of was happening over there where he defected and it's just weird.KISSELL: Yes. I don't know. It's hard to know what to make of this one, Maria, but the guy certainly suffered, the family sufferer. I wonder what they were doing over there in the first place.BARTIROMO: We'll take a break. When we come back, Weight Watchers finding a new beat, music producer, DJ Khaled, Weight Watchers and he seems to be already be giving the stock a bounds. Then Prime Time Amazon shipping over 5 billion items around the globe last year with people using the subscription prime service. We'll back in a minute, stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The changing face of the senate, Utah Republican Orrin Hatch says he will not seek reelection this year.The new triggering speculation that Mitt Romney may run for that seat and another familiar face, maybe eyeing a political comeback as well. Lauren Simonetti with all the latest. A lot happening in the Senate and congress, Lauren.SIMONETTI: A lot happening. So Orrin Hatch is 83 years old, he is the Utah senator and the longest-serving Republican senator. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ORRIN HATCH, UNITED STATES SENATOR OF UTAH: When the president visited Utah last month, he said I was a fighter. I've always been a fighter, but every good fighter knows when to hang up the gloves. And for me, that time is soon approaching.(END VIDEO CLIP)SIMONETTI: So who's going to replace him? A lot of chatter that it will be Mitt Romney. Now if you recall, Mitt Romney was the former Massachusetts Governor from '03 to '07. He was also the failed Republican presidential nominee back in 2012.From Utah instrumental in getting them the 2002 Olympics, right? Salt Lake City got them. And extremely popular, just take a look at that poll. If the 2018th senate race, this is what people were asked were between Mitt Romney and the Democrat Jenny Wilson, 72 percent said they vote for Mitt.And if you flip it over if it were between Orrin Hatch and the Democrat, only 50% said they would go for Orrin Hatch. Still President Trump very fond of Hatch, especially after the tax bill success. He tweeted this, "Congratulations to Senator Orrin Hatch on an absolutely incredible career.He has been a tremendous supporter, and I will never forget the beyond kind statements he has made about me as President. He is my friend and he will be greatly missed in the U.S. Senate." This is not all that is going on in the U.S. Senate.He also have Tina Smith being sworn in today. She's going to be the replacement for Minnesota Senator Al Franken after all the sexual misconduct, allegations.And there's talk that Michele Bachmann who was congresswoman from that state could potentially run next year for that seat. And then you have in Alabama, the Democrat Doug Jones being sworn in. So there is a lot going on in congress.BARTIROMO: Yes, it really is. You know, the president tries to get Orrin Hatch to stay, but it was not to be because I guess Orrin Hatch was a great supporter of President Trump and has been and I guess Mitt Romney and President Trump have been at odds a lot.MCDOWELL: Larry Sabato yesterday when it was in the win, Orrin Hatch now said he wasn't going to run for reelection. Larry Sabato tweeted, "Hatch out, is Romney in?"Excellent Utah source told me two days ago that Romney would almost certainly run for and win Orrin Hatch's senate seat. No Trump friend, but far from certain Romney will be Trump foe.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: I agree with that.KELLY: -- that we've seen all last year that it was hard to get things done in the senate and Orrin Hatch was there for the president. He was agenda across and now he's going to lose that.And so he's going off on a high note with the tax reform, but we do know that Mitt Romney on his Twitter changed it from Massachusetts to Holladay, Utah. So, you know, there's got to be a reason for it.SIMONETTI: He has the ability to talk businessman to businessman with Donald Trump. Yes, he has attached to him particularly on the campaign trail, but was a name being tossed around for Secretary of State? No.BARTIROMO: That's true.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: That's right. Wait, wait. What did they eat there? They didn't have bread. What did they eat there? We were laughing at what they ate.KISSELL: It was a three-course meal.BARTIROMO: We were laughing at some things that they were eating because it was so out-of-reach for most people.MCDOWELL: Billionaire food.SIMONETTI: And then the Bannon angle, right? Because Mitt Romney is everything that Bannon says he's fighting against when we talk about the --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: He was a never Trumper. He was a never Trumper.MCDOWELL: But that works in his favor given Roy Moore's outcome down in Alabama. One thing I want to point out what Orrin Hatch was as a lawmaker, you just don't see it anymore. Somebody who reached across the island, worked with Ted Kennedy on getting the child a health insurance program put together.Basically opened a door for generic drugs in the United States. Some of the legislation that Hatch worked is really astonishing and kind of capping it off with the tax reform.KISSELL: And an elegant guy.MCDOWELL: A liked guy.KISSELL: Republicans need to keep that seat in Utah. So they don't need another contest like Alabama. Let Mitt Romney run, let him win and then forget about Utah and move on to some of the more contested races please. Please stay out of there Steve Bannon.BARTIROMO: Yes, a fair point.MCDOWELL: Yes. We end up with, who was it, Sharron Angle who ran against Harry Reid and Sarah Palin swooped in and basically kind of didn't have the Republicans in race and kept Harry Reid in his seat for years.KISSELL: Yes. We might have a contest like that in Arizona. You know what, a great career Orrin Hatch, Mitt Romney if wants the seat, please win it and then let's forget about it and move on to somebody's more interesting and contested races.BARTIROMO: Good stuff. Lauren, thanks.SIMONETTI: Sure.BARTIROMO: Coming up, by the way at 8:00 am Eastern, we'll take with Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel Romney who is also the niece of Mitt Romney about all these development. She's coming up this morning.So join us with that special interview. First up, the company behind Captain Morgan drops ads on Snapchat after a ruling by the watchdog group.We'll find out why. And then from under the seat to onto the hardwood, find out what team will be wearing Spongebob Squarepants jerseys on the court. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, January 3rd, your top stories right now 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast. Markets kicking off the new year in record territory, the momentum goes on, S&P 500, the NASDAQ, at new highs yesterday, with the NASDAQ leading the way, the NASDAQ cracking 7,000, incredible move.The Dow Industrials notching the highest close on record, up 105 points yesterday. Take a look at the action this morning, futures indicating a pretty good rally at the start of trading once again, futures up 48 points on the Dow Industrials, NASDAQ up 13-1/2, looks like the market continues on the upswing.Technology is certainly driving the gains across the world this morning.

The stock is up eight percent, take a look, that was yesterday's move.New $800 million up for grabs, nobody won last night's mega millions, so the Powerball is tonight, get that ticket. One basketball team soaking in the New Year as SpongeBob SquarePants. Why they're dressing up as the cartoon (INAUDIBLE) coming up this morning.First, though, this top story this half an hour, Wall Street starting up the year strong. Futures indicating another rally at the start of trading this morning, after the NASDAQ composite, yesterday, notched another record close, cracking the 7,000 mark for the first time ever. Many investors are optimistic that this market rally continues into 18.Joining us right now to talk more about that is Oxbow Advisor's Managing Partner, Ted Oakley. Ted, good to see you, thanks so much for joining us.TED OAKLEY, MANAGING PARTNER, OXBOW ADVISORS: Thanks, Maria.BARTIROMO: How do you see this market? You're registered investment advisor, one and a half billion dollars in (INAUDIBLE) assets under management. Do you think this momentum continues this year?OAKLEY: Well, it could for a while. These things are expensive right now, so when they get expensive, they can get more expensive. And we feel like that's where we are at this point in time. I think I've been through, probably, as many tops as anybody in the business right now. So, they all look similar, and this one is similar to the past, in the same way as it is now.BARTIROMO: So expensive, based on what, earnings? What's this market trading at, about 17 times earnings?OAKLEY: It is, forward earnings, 17-1/2 to 18 times, but if you look at price to sales, which is something you can't fool with. You know, it's a solid number. It's about the same as it was in 2000. If you look at market cap to GDP, it's backed up to where it was 2000.And people are obviously, extremely, complacent. They have been for about 15 to 18 months. And so, that gives you a perfect storm. Now, it may not happen this month or something, but, you know, we are running about 20 percent liquid and that's because we really can't find anything to buy right now.KELLY: Ted, one of the interesting things that happened yesterday was the NASDAQ finally topped 7,000. And we're talking about things being expensive, but one of the things I see is that I'm willing to pay, you know, up for a name like, Microsoft, I believe you own it at a 30 --25 times going forward because it's growing at 20 percent.They have solid cash flows that are reoccurring revenues. I don't have to worry about upgrade cycles anymore. They are doing well on the cloud. And so, where are you looking, specifically, putting new capital work? You said you've got 20 percent about liquid, where are you going to deploy that capital?OAKLEY: Well, Kevin, when you get late cycle, what we start to do is try to get more conservative. So, about higher quality bonds, we'll buy some treasuries. We'll also buy companies like Microsoft and we think they can increase the dividend.If I have a dividend payer like Microsoft and it can increase the dividend, say, 10 percent over the next five years, then I know I'm going to get that component working for me over the next five years, even if I don't get a big capital move in the market in general. And those are the kinds of companies we are looking for right now.KELLY: Interesting. And I also noticed that you are pretty pro on goals. You are -- you are thinking that having a couple liquid positions in gold, whether it'd be the miners, is a good way to hedge yourself up, potentially, from inflation.OAKLEY: Well, one of the things you look for -- and you can look at it from the inflation standpoint, we don't happen to look at it that way. If you look at the cash flow multiples in 2011 on the miners, they were about three or four times higher than they are right now.So, they actually hit their lows in the latter part of 15, early 16, and if you look at the miners that we own, which are (INAUDIBLE) we think they have a lot of upside over the next two to three years. If nothing else from the price of gold moving higher, these companies are working on low capital spending budgets, so we think they'll do well from here.BARTIROMO: Ted, let me ask you, what are the risks? I mean, we are all going along this assumption that the economy continues doing well. I mean, we see this tax plan, we see earnings doing very, you know, going very strongly, 13 to 15 percent growth in earnings expected for the S&P 500 in 2018.I know it's hard to see that black swan, but, yes, consumer confidence slipped to 122.1 last month, down from 128.6 back in November. But, where is your worry in terms of what changes the momentum here, changes the direction of this market? Where is the big risk?OAKLEY: Well, most bare markets start, not necessarily with something that you see the economy going but they go -- they'd start falling on their own weight, you have so many buyers and you get people solely in that you get to a point to where there's nothing underneath. And all of a sudden, people will look out six to nine months and they'll start taking money off the table.You can either have that or you can have an outside of that, all our 1987 or 2001 where you have something you did not expect and comes in the market place. But I think this one will come from complacency and it sneaks up on people that, hey, we are probably not going to get what you expected from the tax cuts. And, you know, you can't make it. You can't make a big move in the economy on 80 bucks a month for a family making $60,000.MCDOWELL: Well, Ted, the housing -- the housing bubble and the credit bubble, even in 2007 and 2006, that didn't sneak up on people. People saw it coming. But again, it was almost a mania in terms of people bidding up houses. It was the same thing during the dot-com bubble because we talked about it for, literally, two years that these companies couldn't sustain this. We didn't know when it's going to end, but we knew it wasn't going to end well. So, those were not two shocks, if you will.BARTIROMO: We've talked about it like we are talking about Bitcoin right now.MCDOWELL: Right. That's why I -- yes, that's why I got on Kevin's case earlier about Bitcoin because we have seen people given to mania and lose a lot of money.KISSEL: Dagen, that raises such an interesting question which is, Ted, what if this updraft is different from the rest because the entire market has been lifted all of these asset classes by the fed for so many years. Is that what's different about this side?BARTIROMO: Good point, ma'am.OAKLEY: Well, I think what reeling at the most, though, and you can look at all these other things. We think the Federal Reserve is a bit off course and that you've got brand new people and you've also got, I think, three or four empty spots, but you're in a situation where the spread and the curve is only about 55 basis points right now.And one of the best indicators ever, has been an inverted u curve for recession. And we are getting closer and closer and closer to that. So when you are looking at that, I think you can put that up on top and see that it may not happen tomorrow, but it will eventually have an impact, it has on all the last 10 times. And so I certainly think it will this time as well.BARTIROMO: So I know you're in miners and gold but, is there anywhere to hide? Should we see something like that, a significant sell off?OAKLEY: Well, I know it's controversial, but we have a fairly large position in the 20 and 30-year treasury. One of the things we decided the beginning of 17, is that the long rates would not go up, the short rates would. And oddly enough, everybody hid in two to six-year bonds, which is where they've lost money this year.And we've been in the 15 to 30-year paper and we've actually made money on those this year, and we think that will be the case because when you have a recession, and you tilt that curve enough, that will be a good escape spot for you, long treasuries, not short.BARTIROMO: All right. We'll be watching that. Ted, good to see you, sir, thanks so much.OAKLEY: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Ted Oakley there. And of course, today, we are looking at another rally in stocks at the opening of trading. Coming up, the punishing cold is set to intensify with a bomb cyclone pattern. Yes, bomb cyclone pattern is what they're calling it.It's promising to bring snow and ice even in the south, where officials say, they're so frozen, they want to have a word with Elsa. We'll explain, and then, Weight Watchers' new shining star, DJ Khaled, the hitmaker behind collaborations with Beyonce and others, teams up with Weight Watchers, back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Markets on the move this morning. We're expecting a higher opening for the broader average. Dow Industrials up 45 points right here, NASDAQ up 13. A couple of names on the move, beverage company, Diageo, one to watch. The maker brands like Captain Morgan and Smirnoff putting its Snapchat ads on ice. The decision coming after a U.K. advertising watchdog, said that Diageo did not take the necessary steps to make sure a Captain Morgan ad -- it launched on the social media site was not seen by underage users. Shares of Diageo down two-thirds of a percent this morning in the premarket.We're watching shares of Apple today. The company acquired Canadian-based start-up Buddybuild. The deal aimed at helping Apple's app development team. Terms of that deal not disclosed. Shares of Apple up a quarter of a percent right now.Amazon Prime, meanwhile, the prime choice for customers in 2017. Cheryl Casone now with the details and headlines. It was a good holiday, Cheryl.CASONE: Oh, yes, it was. Well, if you can get it to me in a couple of hours, sure! Amazon says 5 billion items were shipped through their subscription service, that's Prime. Companies of the hot sellers, the Fire T.V. Stick, the Echo Dot, and for all the cooks out there, the Instant Pot. This is the first time that Amazon has released shipping data for the entire year. And more people signed up for Amazon Prime around the world than in any other year in the company's history. Shares of Amazon up more than 55 percent from just one year ago.So, weight watchers has a new kind of unlikely ambassador. D.J. Khaled so far -- well, at least he's getting A for effort. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KHALED: So, basically, I can eat whatever I want. That's what I like about the system. So, you're saying, as long as I low over the 40 points. So, get my cookies ready. Get some cookies ready, too, because I'm craving for some cookies, too. I mean, you can watch right now.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: D.J. Khaled is going to document his experience, and all of his progress on the new Weight Watchers' freestyle program, financial terms not disclosed. Former top show host Oprah Winfrey owns a 10 percent stake at Weight Watchers. Shares of the company rose after it cut a deal with Khaled. Shares nearly quadrupling last year.

Next Mega Million's drawing is set to Friday night. Meanwhile, tonight, there's going to be a Powerball drawing. The Powerball jack pot right now sitting at $440 million.And a monster storm is expected to hammer the East Coast from Georgia to Maine by Thursday. Some parts could see a bomb cyclone even an extreme blizzard. We're talking mega storm here. Meanwhile, folks in the southeast aren't used to this kind of cold crippling that region. Police in Louisiana though have decided to do something about that. The Slidell Police Department has issued an arrest warrant for Queen Elsa, you know, from the movie "Frozen" the Disney film. Here's what it says. As you could see by the weather, she is a very dangerous girl, approach with caution. She's known for her power over ice and snow. This is not the first time that Elsa has been in trouble with the law, we should say. In Kentucky, a police department issued a similar arrest warrant for her a few years ago. A little planned words.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's cute.CASONE: It's cute. You know, they're trying to have fun with that. Stay inside and don't go out. Try not to die during the mega storm is the other point.BARTIROMO: Good call.MCDOWELL: But I'll say this because I'm -- I get up in the morning and look at the temps, there are places in Southern Virginia like where I grew up, a sub-10 degree temperatures like nine degrees this morning. It's the same temperature it is up in Connecticut. It's like single digits throughout North Carolina.(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: So, it's funny, but these police departments and fire rescue teams throughout the south have to worry about people freezing to death in their own homes. These are people who don't have ready sources of heat very often because it never gets this cold down there.BARTIROMO: It's very serious.MCDOWELL: And it's very serious, like, elderly people in their homes with space heaters, you very often have fires because they've got one little electric space heater that's 20 years and it catches on fire. So, it's incredibly serious, what's going on.KELLY: Just real quick on the Amazon thing. I actually asked Alexa over the holidays what she thought of Jeff Bezos and no joke, she said she think he's Prime. I swear to God, asked Alexa that. What do you think of Jeff Bezos? He's Prime. I swear to God.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: That's very funny. That's cute. All right. Coming up, (INAUDIBLE) to be square. SpongeBob SquarePants hitting the basketball court.

Jared Max with the story now. Jared, good morning.JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTSCASTER: Good morning, Maria. The University of Arizona fired head football coach Rich Rodriguez last night. Now, while the school conducted an investigation into a claim that Rodriguez sexually harassed a former employee, it did not find evidence to fire him for it. But the university became concerned enough with the, quote, climate and direction of the program that had fired Rodriguez last night without cause. As part of the term he receives a $6.3 million buyout report after legal paperwork was filled yesterday to initiate a lawsuit. It claims that Rodriguez ran a hostile workplace. Now, he issued a statement in which he said he had been threatened with a 7-1/2 million suit that alleged sexual harassment.One day after Arizona Cardinals' head coach Bruce Arians announced his retirement as quarterback the last five seasons did the same.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Has Limited Risk in a Trade WarUSNEWS.comMarch 15, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 U.S. News & World Report All Rights ReservedSection: INVESTING; Stock Market News; Vol.; No.Length: 543 wordsByline: Wayne DugganHighlight: Apple may be relatively insulated from trade war risk.BodyPresident Donald Trump isn't backing down on his protectionist trade rhetoric, and the potential for an all-out trade war with China has Apple Inc. (Nasdaq:            AAPL) investors on edge. While a trade war is certainly not good news for Apple, the threat of Chinese retaliation may not be as bad as investors think. Just days after implementing tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, Trump once again spoke out on trade policy on Twitter on Wednesday. "We cannot keep a blind eye to the rampant unfair trade practices against our Country!" Trump wrote. [See: 6 Reasons to Love Apple Stock.]On Tuesday, Reuters reported that a source who has discussed the matter with the White House said Trump is considering additional tariffs on $60 billion of Chinese imports. China has said it does not want a trade war with the U.S., but it is prepared to take "necessary measures" if tariffs negatively impact its economy. Goldman Sachs recently listed Apple as among 20 U.S. companies with the most exposure to China. Apple generates about 22 percent of its revenue from China. Still, there are several reasons why China may not choose to target Apple with its retaliation. First, if China wants to retaliate against Trump personally, it would be more likely to single out resources or businesses based in red or swing states that could potentially hurt Trump and Republicans in upcoming elections. In addition, GBH Insights head of technology research Daniel Ives says it may be difficult for China to go after Apple without creating some self-inflicted wounds. "Given the tightly woven integration between Apple and Foxconn in China, we believe there is minimal risk to this relationship, cost increases, and backlash to Apple selling its iPhone devices within China (domestic competition remains a lingering worry), which is a key market opportunity for Apple over the coming years," Ives says. [See: 7 of the Best Tech Stocks to Buy for 2018.]Finally, Ives says Apple, Facebook (            FB), Amazon.com (            AMZN), Netflix (            NFLX) and Alphabet (            GOOG,            GOOGL) are all primarily service-based companies, and most of their platforms are already blocked by the Chinese government. The prospect of a trade war may weigh on Apple's market sentiment for now, but Ives says it's mostly just "a scary headline that ultimately will have minimal financial impact to Apple, FANG, and other tech names." GBH Insights has a "highly attractive" rating and $205 price target for AAPL stock.Wayne Duggan is a freelance investment strategy reporter with a focus on energy and emerging market stocks.

At a Glance: Government-nixed deals over the yearsAssociated Press InternationalMarch 13, 2018 Tuesday 5:02 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 355 wordsDateline: NEW YORK BodyNEW YORK (AP) - President Donald Trump has blocked Singapore-based chipmaker Broadcom from pursuing a hostile takeover of U.S. rival Qualcomm citing national security issues. But it's not the first time a foreign deal has been nixed for this reason. Trump's decision was based on the recommendation of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews foreign purchases of U.S. entities.Here is a look at other blocked deals over the years.- CANYON BRIDGE-LATTICE SEMICONDUCTORIn September, Trump blocked a Chinese government-financed firm's acquisition of this Oregon chipmaker on national security grounds. The deal had been under scrutiny after it became clear that the prospective buyer, Canyon Bridge Capital Partners, which was offering $1.3 billion for the company, is funded by the Chinese government. Lattice manufactures a relatively low-tech class of programmable computer chips that can be adapted for a variety of uses.- AIXTRON SEIn 2016, then-president Barack Obama prohibited a Chinese company's purchase of a U.S. subsidiary of German chipmaker Aixtron SE on national security grounds. The German government then blocked the entire purchase.- RALLS CORPIn 2012, Obama blocked Chinese-owned Ralls Corp. from building a wind farm near a naval base in Oregon. While Ralls is based in Delaware, it is a subsidiary of a Chinese company.- HUAWEI-3LEAF SYSTEMSChina's Huawei Technologies Ltd. called off its planned purchase of 3Leaf Systems in 2011, after the foreign investment committee refused to approve the deal citing national security concerns.- HUAWEI-3COMHuawei's proposed deal to buy a stake in networking equipment maker 3com fell apart in 2008 after the committee raised national security concerns. The worry, according to a New York Times report at the time, was that the Chinese company would be able to alter the electronic equipment and computer software sold to the military in a way to make it less effective.- MAMCO MANUFACTURINGIn 1990, then-President George H.W. Bush blocked the purchase of MAMCO Manufacturing Inc., a maker of aircraft parts, by a Chinese state-owned company.Load-Date: March 14, 2018End of Document

China has found a new way to block banned wordsCNNMoney.comFebruary 28, 2018 Wednesday 9:09 AM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: TECHNOLOGYLength: 637 wordsByline: Sherisse PhamBodyChina's vast censorship apparatus is using a new technique for rooting out banned words, experts say.Censors are now scanning images shared in the hugely popular messaging platform WeChat and pulling them if they contain certain sensitive words or phrases, according to a new report from the SANS Internet Storm Center, an international monitoring organization.Some Chinese social media users had started using images featuring sensitive words because they could slip past the censors' software that scours the text of posts. Images are much harder to filter because they typically require humans to look at each one.Now Chinese authorities have found a way to use computers to do some of the work, according to the internet center's report.The new approach, which uses what's known as optical character recognition technology, is "highly sophisticated" and demands a lot of computing resources, said Johannes Ullrich, the center's director.Ullrich said he and his colleagues started seeing the new technique in action just this week.It first came to their attention when censors banned a photo of a breakfast recipe, much to the amusement of Chinese internet users. The image was banned because the recipe contained the word "end" (instructing cooks to "cut the end of mini sausages into an X-like shape"). In Chinese, "end" sounds like "emperor" or "throne."Those words became sensitive this week because they have been used to criticize President Xi Jinping. China on Sunday proposed amending its constitution to allow Xi to stay in power indefinitely, prompting dissidents and critics to call him "Emperor Xi."Other images featuring sensitive words related to Xi were also being pulled out of WeChat, which is owned by Chinese tech company Tencent.The SANS Internet Storm Center tested the new Chinese filter earlier this week with a list of 25 sensitive words and phrases, such as "long live my emperor," "immortality," "unlimited," and so on.The problematic images were censored while in the digital pipeline between WeChat senders and recipients. They simply didn't arrive."It's about speed," Ullrich said. "They don't want to appear to remove images after the fact. They have a second or so to do it."The technique suggests tight collaboration between Chinese government censors and Tencent.Tencent and China's Cyberspace Administration did not respond to requests for comment.In order to operate their highly profitable internet businesses, Chinese tech companies have to play by the government's rules. US social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter are blocked in the country.The new image censorship on WeChat also appears to be very targeted. SANS Internet Storm Center tested it in a WeChat group with a few dozen people. Users in the US received and saw images containing banned words, while those in China did not.It's unclear how widely Chinese authorities have deployed the technology, though. CNN employees in Beijing and Hong Kong were able to share images with the sensitive words with each other on WeChat.Still, using the software to partially scan some of the huge number of images sent over WeChat highlights the trend of China's increasing automation of censorship."They are more throwing technology at the problem instead of people power, which they had done in the past," Ullrich said.That shift fits with China's vow to become a global leader in artificial intelligence.AI has been hailed as a life changing leap forward for humanity by some, and a harbinger of doom by others. In China, the rise of the technology will likely serve multiple purposes, says Ullrich."With AI it's about keeping people happy by keeping them rich, and also keeping them happy by keeping bad information out of the country," said Ullrich.-- Qiaoqiao Yu, Nanlin Fang and Steven Jiang contributed to this report.Load-Date: March 2, 2018End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 27 of 387Walmart Commits to Reduce Emissions by 50 Million Metric Tons in China;
