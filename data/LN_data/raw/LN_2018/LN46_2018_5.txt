Amid ZTE’s troubles, AT&T’s Cricket turns to Japan’s FreetelFierceWirelessMay 29, 2018 Tuesday 1:00 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Questex Media Group LLC All Rights ReservedSection: ARTICLELength: 366 wordsByline: Mike DanoBodyAT&T’s Cricket Wireless prepaid brand has started carrying a phone from Japan’s budget smartphone provider Freetel. Although AT&T officials said the carrier inked its distribution deal with Freetel last year, before the U.S. Commerce Department issued a ban on U.S. business with ZTE, the action nonetheless highlights the other options available to U.S. wireless carriers looking for inexpensive phones beyond those from China’s Huawei and ZTE.Wave7 Research reported that some Best Buy stores are now selling a smartphone built by Freetel and branded the Cricket Wave, for $59.99. That follows a January report from PhoneScoop that the FCC had approved a phone from Freetel for Cricket.Although AT&T’s addition of a new supplier to its prepaid Cricket brand isn’t necessarily a major development—Cricket also sells phones from the likes of Apple, ZTE, LG and Samsung—it is somewhat noteworthy in light of the U.S. government’s recent crackdown on ZTE. The Commerce Department in April said that U.S. companies could no longer do business with ZTE because the Chinese smartphone company didn’t properly issue penalties on employees involved in violating international sanctions on Iran and North Korea.Related: Industry Voices—Madden: The impact of the ban on exports to ZTEThat ban reportedly forced ZTE to shut down much of its manufacturing operations, considering U.S. companies like Qualcomm supply many of the components that go into its phones and other equipment. (It’s worth noting that recent reports indicate that the U.S. may rescind those restrictions on ZTE.)Further, many see the U.S. crackdown on ZTE as part of a wider effort by the Trump administration to challenge the Chinese government’s trade practices; AT&T and Verizon reportedly dropped plans to sell phones from Chinese telecom giant Huawei due to U.S. government security concerns.Although Huawei has never made headway into the U.S. smartphone market, ZTE is the nation’s fourth largest supplier, having made a substantial footprint in the market for prepaid Android phones.Thus, AT&T’s addition of Freetel to its Cricket lineup indicates that the carrier has options beyond Chinese smartphone makers like ZTE and Huawei.Load-Date: June 4, 2018End of Document

Deutsche down; LendingClub accused of duping customersamericanbanker.comApril 26, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 SourceMedia, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: Vol. 1; No. 1Length: 855 wordsByline: George YacikBodyBreaking NewsRetreat: Deutsche Bank reported a 79% drop in first quarter net income and said it will shrink its U.S. investment bank, "effectively abandoning its ambition to be a member of Wall Street's big leagues." It would instead focus on its European business."The decision, which comes after years of losses, scandals, and management turmoil, ends a 20-year quest by Germany's largest bank to compete eye to eye with the likes of Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase," the New York Times says.Wall Street Journal,Financial Times,New York TimesReceiving Wide Coverage ...Back in trouble: The Federal Trade Commission accused LendingClub of hiding fees and removing money from customer accounts without their permission. The agency sued the company in federal court in California alleging the lender charged borrowers more than $1,000 to take out loans despite advertising "no hidden fees." LendingClub's shares plunged 15% to an all-time low of $2.77 and are down nearly 33% so far this year. The FTC has been looking into LendingClub's business practices since May 2016 after former CEO and founder Renaud Laplanche left the company amid a loan-selling scandal.Wall Street Journal,Financial Times,American BankerPayments news: Visa reported a six-fold increase in its quarterly earnings to $2.61 billion from $430 million a year earlier as revenue rose 13%.Wall Street Journal,Financial Times,American BankerPayPal also had a strong first quarter, with earnings rising by a third to $511 million from $384 million on a 24% increase in net revenue.Wall Street Journal,Financial TimesAmerican Express received Chinese government approval to become the first U.S. card network to offerpayments services in Chinaafter forming a joint venture with a Chinese mobile-payment provider. "Obtaining such regulatory consent marks an important, if only an initial step toward gaining a foothold in China's fast-growing electronic-payment market," the Wall Street Journal notes. "AmEx's decision to take on a Chinese partner - instead of forming a wholly owned entity - shows the difficulties foreign firms face in going solo in a market where the government holds sway. Barriers to foreigners have been high for so long that Chinese institutions now thoroughly dominate many sectors, especially in finance."Don't call them payday loans: Comptroller of the Currency Joseph Otting said his agency wants to loosen rules tomake it attractive for commercial banksto make short-term, small-dollar loans rather than force consumers to turn to high-rate payday lenders. "Banks have historically shied away from providing unsecured loans to cash-strapped consumers, complaining that tough rules on underwriting - and the negative publicity of providing loans with very high effective annual interest rates - made the business more trouble than it was worth," the Journal notes."If we can get people back into the regulated market, that will be better for them and the economy," Otting said at an American Bankers Association conference.Otting's financial disclosure form prior to his being confirmed last November is raising questions that hemay have bought shares in some bankswhile going through the congressional vetting process. His most recent disclosure shows he sold shares in Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley in January but earlier forms don't show any stakes in those banks, indicating he may have bought them after he was nominated earlier last year.Wall Street JournalAwkward timing?: Is now the right time to be pushing for more financial deregulation? The paper has some doubts. "Deep into an economic boom with asset prices near records is when you'd expect the U.S. financial system's guardians to tamp down risk-taking," the paper says. "Instead, federal regulators and legislators are doing the opposite - watering down, narrowing or declining to enforce rules passed after the financial crisis. The deregulatory pushcould aggravate excessesthat come back to haunt the economy in its next downturn."Playing by the rules: Gemini, the bitcoin exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, has signed an agreement to use Nasdaq's surveillance software tomonitor trading for any abusive or fraudulent practicesjust as regulators have increased their surveillance of digital-currency exchanges. "We're doing this because we believe in the importance of creating a rules-based marketplace," said Cameron Winklevoss, Gemini's president.Financial TimesA first: BBVA has become what the paper says is the first international bank to issue a corporate loanusing blockchain technology. The Spanish bank said blockchain enabled the lender and the borrower to stay informed on the loan's progress and reduced the negotiation time for the loan from "days to hours."New York TimesAcquitted: A federal jury in Connecticut acquitted a former precious metals trader at UBS of "spoofing," or trying to manipulate the price of commodities he was trading by placing fake orders. "It's ahuge setbackfor the government," the trader's lawyer said. "We basically smacked them in the face."Quotable"We had ahierarchy in my office in Congress.http://www.americanbanker.com/morning-scan/deutsche-down-lendingclub-accused-of-duping-customersLoad-Date: April 26, 2018End of Document

The FTC has been looking into LendingClub's business practices since May 2016 after former CEO and founder Renaud Laplanche left the company amid a loan-selling scandal.Wall Street Journal,Financial Times,American BankerPayments news: Visa reported a six-fold increase in its quarterly earnings to $2.61 billion from $430 million a year earlier as revenue rose 13%.Wall Street Journal,Financial Times,American BankerPayPal also had a strong first quarter, with earnings rising by a third to $511 million from $384 million on a 24% increase in net revenue.Wall Street Journal,Financial TimesAmerican Express received Chinese government approval to become the first U.S. card network to offerpayments services in Chinaafter forming a joint venture with a Chinese mobile-payment provider. "Obtaining such regulatory consent marks an important, if only an initial step toward gaining a foothold in China's fast-growing electronic-payment market," the Wall Street Journal notes. "AmEx's decision to take on a Chinese partner - instead of forming a wholly owned entity - shows the difficulties foreign firms face in going solo in a market where the government holds sway. Barriers to foreigners have been high for so long that Chinese institutions now thoroughly dominate many sectors, especially in finance."Don't call them payday loans: Comptroller of the Currency Joseph Otting said his agency wants to loosen rules tomake it attractive for commercial banksto make short-term, small-dollar loans rather than force consumers to turn to high-rate payday lenders. "Banks have historically shied away from providing unsecured loans to cash-strapped consumers, complaining that tough rules on underwriting - and the negative publicity of providing loans with very high effective annual interest rates - made the business more trouble than it was worth," the Journal notes."If we can get people back into the regulated market, that will be better for them and the economy," Otting said at an American Bankers Association conference.Otting's financial disclosure form prior to his being confirmed last November is raising questions that hemay have bought shares in some bankswhile going through the congressional vetting process. His most recent disclosure shows he sold shares in Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley in January but earlier forms don't show any stakes in those banks, indicating he may have bought them after he was nominated earlier last year.Wall Street JournalAwkward timing?: Is now the right time to be pushing for more financial deregulation? The paper has some doubts. "Deep into an economic boom with asset prices near records is when you'd expect the U.S. financial system's guardians to tamp down risk-taking," the paper says. "Instead, federal regulators and legislators are doing the opposite - watering down, narrowing or declining to enforce rules passed after the financial crisis. The deregulatory pushcould aggravate excessesthat come back to haunt the economy in its next downturn."Playing by the rules: Gemini, the bitcoin exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, has signed an agreement to use Nasdaq's surveillance software tomonitor trading for any abusive or fraudulent practicesjust as regulators have increased their surveillance of digital-currency exchanges. "We're doing this because we believe in the importance of creating a rules-based marketplace," said Cameron Winklevoss, Gemini's president.Financial TimesA first: BBVA has become what the paper says is the first international bank to issue a corporate loanusing blockchain technology. The Spanish bank said blockchain enabled the lender and the borrower to stay informed on the loan's progress and reduced the negotiation time for the loan from "days to hours."New York TimesAcquitted: A federal jury in Connecticut acquitted a former precious metals trader at UBS of "spoofing," or trying to manipulate the price of commodities he was trading by placing fake orders. "It's ahuge setbackfor the government," the trader's lawyer said. "We basically smacked them in the face."Quotable"We had ahierarchy in my office in Congress.http://www.americanbanker.com/morning-scan/deutsche-down-lendingclub-accused-of-duping-customersLoad-Date: April 26, 2018End of Document

Chairman Chabot Issues Statement at Hearing on Threat to America's Small BusinessesTargeted News ServiceJune 27, 2018 Wednesday 7:30 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 779 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe House Small Business Committee issued the following statement by Chairman Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, at a hearing entitled "ZTE: A Threat to America's Small Businesses":"Good morning. I call this hearing to order. I would like to thank our witnesses for coming here to share their expertise and experience."Today we are here to discuss a topic that has garnered quite a bit of attention in recent months. However, it is an issue that this Committee has paid close attention to for years. That is the looming threat of Chinese telecommunications giant ZTE."As this Committee has learned through past hearings, foreign backed firms from countries like China and Russia regularly target small businesses to steal intellectual property and undermine America's critical infrastructure. The FBI has already determined that foreign state actors pose a serious cyber threat to the telecommunications supply chain. It is also clear that many foreign nations are responsible for direct cyber attacks on the United States in an effort to steal intellectual property and sensitive personal information."In a report by our colleagues on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, U.S. businesses and cyber security experts have reported persistent attacks that could be traced back to China and were thought to be supported by the Chinese government. And studies from the Department of Defense have warned of the difficulties associated with defending against threats posed by foreign nations, stating that, "[the] means and opportunity [for nation-state adversaries] are present throughout the supply chain and lifecycle of software development.""This is particularly troublesome for small businesses that not only rely on products from, but also engage in commerce with, globalized telecommunications firms in countries like China."Hearings by this Committee have shown that small businesses have become top targets for nefarious state-backed actors because they tend to be the softest targets. They have fewer resources to manage their information Technology systems and respond to cybersecurity incidents and they often lack the technical knowledge needed to assess the ever-evolving threats."Additionally, most small businesses are extremely aware of their expenses and, unfortunately, the cheapest technology products available tend to be produced by some of China's largest telecommunications firms. This is a recipe for disaster."Now, let me be clear, I don't believe for a minute that an American small business owner would purposely buy a product that puts their own operations at risk, let alone jeopardize our national security."However, the problem is that most small businesses won't even know that they're using a product or service that has been provided by a nefarious actor. Nor should they. Their job is to run their business, employ hardworking Americans, and keep their customers happy. When we talk about existential threats to national security--and that is what ZTE is--it is the federal government's job to protect Americans and American small businesses."That is exactly what happened in April of this year when ZTE was effectively banned from doing business in the U.S. After years of investigations and deliberations into the ZTE case, after ZTE was afforded its due process in this country (a favor that usually goes unreturned to American"companies in China), and after numerous second chances, the Trump Administration rightfully made the decision to kick ZTE out of the country. A move that many of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle applauded."Now, we face the very real possibility that ZTE may be given yet another chance. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced earlier this month that a new agreement had been reached with ZTE and after paying over a billion dollars, the Bureau of Industry and Security will remove ZTE from the Denied Persons List and they can return to business as usual. I am deeply concerned that this decision could ultimately put Americans at risk. ZTE has consistently lied to this Administration and I fundamentally believe it will do so again."Today's hearing will examine the threat posed by ZTE to American small businesses, if ZTE is allowed to re-engage with the American economy. This is an important decision that impacts both our national security and our economic security and I believe it demands much more attention than it has received so far."I look forward to hearing our witnesses' assessment of this threat as well as their suggestions for how we may better guard against it."I now yield to the Ranking Member for her opening statement."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6350171 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: June 28, 2018End of Document

We always appreciate seeing Dagen McDowell on a Monday. Good morning Dagen.SIMONETTI: Hey Dagen.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK, ANCHOR: Ladies, I'll see you later. Good morning, great to see you as always. And great to see all of you. I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Monday, April 9th. Your top stories at 6:00a.m. Eastern.Crisis in Syria, yet another suspected chemical weapons attack leaving dozens dead, the international community on high alert. As the world waits for a U.S. response, President Trump warning of a big price to pay.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TOM BOSSERT, WHITE HOUSE HOMELAND SECURITY ADVISOR: I wouldn't take anything off the table, these are horrible photos, we're looking into the attack at this point. I think the president's got a point that's been very clear and I'm going to reiterate that point. The pendulum has swung in the wrong direction for too long and the United States of America has been taken advantage of in their responsibility to provide security for the entire world.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Despite the tension, stocks are pointing to a bounce back as concerns over a trade war with China eased a little bit, maybe it was the Sunday morning talk show's rhetoric being thrown out by the White House.Futures are showing this, 172 point gain on the DOW Futures right now, it's losing week for the Blue Chips last week. This comes after that massive selloff on Friday with the DOW, Nasdaq, and S&P all falling more than two percent.In Europe, you have some buying to report, the England, France, and Germany, we have gains across the board. In Asia overnight, stocks also moving higher. The biggest winner there, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong.Zuckerberg taking the Hill, Facebook CEO set to meet with lawmakers in Washington today as he prepares to face a grilling before the Senate tomorrow. The latest as the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower says more people's data could have been exposed.And a change at the top, Deutsche Bank naming a new CEO, the details as shares jumped on the news.And terrifying moments on a New York highway, a tour bus slamming into an overpass leaving six people seriously injured, more on their condition ahead.And the DOJ stonewalling, why Congress Trey Gowdy is calling out the Justice Department over the investigation into alleged FISA abuses.And orange going to love this, Bud Light going citrus for the summer, the new flavor hitting store shelves coming up. I think that's called a summer shandy.All of that and so much more this morning, Pollster Maslansky and Partners President, Lee Carter. Rosecliff CEO and Managing Partner, Mike Murphy. And the King's College Business and Economics Professor, Brian Brenberg.I start with you, markets this week, we get bank earnings, worries about a trade war but, again, now geopolitical concerns that the focusing shifted to that.BRIAN BRENBERG, KING'S COLLEGE AND BUSINESS ECONOMICS PROFESSOR: Yes. Yes, it has. Although it's interesting to watch these back and forth with the trade wars. You get some rhetoric out of the White House, we -- the talk on Thursday night, Friday morning stocks (INAUDIBLE) over the weekend, everybody's out there talking about how this is not a big deal, we don't want a trade war, you come back Monday morning, stocks up again.We're seeing this pattern repeat again and again. It seems to take a day or two for markets to digest that you've got rhetoric and you've got reality on trade and the reality probably isn't going to be as bad or as harsh as a rhetoric sounds.MCDOWELL: Mike, what are you watching this week?MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CEO, MANAGING PARTNER: Absolutely. So watching the volatility in the market, that's really spurn -- spurred by this trade war talk. And I think just a few months ago we were talking about there's no volatility in the market.We haven't had a one percent move in so many months. Well now you're getting two percent move almost on a daily basis. I think the main thing for investors to do here is to try to block out the headlines and stick with their long-term plans. So we're going to get the down 500s, the bounces above 200s. Overall, there's not going to be a major trade war with China in my opinion, it will back to focus on the U.S. economy.MCDOWELL: I think some of the White House officials needs some messaging help because you've got Secretary MNuchin on Friday talking about the potential of a trade war and then trying to walk back those comments yesterday saying, "I don't expect it at all in terms of a trade war." Don't have your Treasury Secretary utter the words trade war ever.LEE CARTER, POLLSTER AND MASLANSKY & PARTNERS PRESIDENT: That would be a good first step. But I think it's fascinating to see how the markets are reacting so much to the rhetoric rather than just the policy.It's unbelievable, a tweet, one announcement can send the markets in a tailspin. And what's happened traditionally is that we've looked at the experts and say, "What are we really supposed to be looking at?" One tweet, one message, one interview can totally change the course of the markets and we're seeing that this week and certainly the White House rhetoric tone way back saying this has always been -- there's nothing new here, nothing's developed here, not a trade war and look, things are softening again.MCDOWELL: And I'm looking forward to Mark Zuckerberg on Capitol Hill. Again, Facebook will reveal today to Facebook users whose data was accessed by Cambridge Analytica, it's about 70 million people. Estimates are in the United States alone.And watch Mark Zuckerberg because back in 2010, he broke out into a Nixonian flop sweat when Walt Mossberg was interviewing him. And I mean sweat was dripping off of his face.CARTER: Yes.MCDOWELL: So if you do that on Capitol Hill, watch your stock tank.BRENBERG: His appearances are always so staged managed. This one absolutely cannot be. And so it's going to be interesting to see what he does under that kind of pressure.MCDOWELL: We're trying to get the video but he had sweat dripping off his nose and his chin. I'm not kidding. It's --CARTER: This is not where he's comfortable.MURPHY: Yes. That was -- that was back in the days of the hoodie sweatshirt.MCDOWELL: Yes. So you're saying he was hot.MURPHY: So he's come a long way.CARTER: (INAUDIBLE) t-shirt.MCDOWELL: He was -- he was just hot. OK. We're going to talk about that all morning. Also coming up, New York Congressman Chris Collins, South Dakota Senator Mike Rounds. Host of Michelle Malkin Investigates on CRTV.com, Michelle Malkin. FOX News Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano. And Legendary Soulman, my friend, Sam Moore. You don't want to miss any of them.Our top story this morning, crossing the red line, the world awaiting the U.S. response to a suspected chemical weapons attack in Syria that killed dozens of citizens. Yesterday, warplanes bombing an airbase near the City of Homs. Russia and Syria have accused Israel of that strike. Meantime, President Trump sending a strong warning to the Assad Regime he tweeted this, "Many dead including women and children, in mindless chemical attack in Syria. Area of atrocity is in lockdown and encircled by Syrian Army, making it completely inaccessible to the outside world. President Putin, Russia, and Iran are responsible for backing animal Assad, big price to pay. Open area immediately for medical help and verification. Another humanitarian disaster for no reason whatsoever, sick."Joining us now is -- this morning is former Commander of the USS Cole, Kirk Lippold. Commander, how do you -- what should the U.S. do to respond? And I should point out that we used that phrase red line that was famously a phrase used by President Obama back in 2010. Assad and Syria crossed that red line and we didn't do anything or we didn't attack. What should we do now?COMMANDER KIRK S. LIPPOLD (RET), FORMER USS COLE COMMANDER: Good morning Dagen. I think the first thing we need to do is verify through intelligence channels that in fact took place who carried it out, where it was launched from, what was used to do it?And then at that point, we take a step back, put together the military forces, and then decide whether we're going to react in a manner that is going to take away that capability not like we did last time with the Tomahawk missiles. But this time, on a more permanent basis and with the backing of the Security Council hopefully at the U.N.MCDOWELL: Well Commander, you brought that up, so there was one -- it was a sarin gas attack last year, a one-time strike by the United States on a Syrian airbase. Why haven't we done more since then? There was a chlorine gas attack this past January which was the State Department and Rex Tillerson, then the Secretary of State basically attacked in a statement. But why haven't we done more to maybe take out all of Assad's air force, the entire air force?LIPPOLD: Well, I think Dagen you have to look at it, what is going to be our engagement? What is the end state we want to have there? Assad is going to continue to exist as the president of Syria because the Russians are backing him, they now have the Iranians that are also providing technical knowledge and an ability to also establish their own basis there which Israel is not going to tolerate, which probably drove the attack into the T4 or Tiyas Airbase last night.But we have to take a look and say, "OK, do we want to be the world's leader in this case where a low level attacks have occurred using chemical weapons?" This was absolutely a much larger scale one, it shows that they're taking out one of the last strongholds of the Syrians rebels. At this point, we need to say, "No, you either go for it conventionally or we will take out that capability." And if it does mean that we take out the Syrian air force, then we better be prepared for a little bit longer investment in time being in Syria with our forces despite what the president has said.MURPHY: Commander, it's Mike Murphy. I love your opinion on the timing of this of attack because do you think it has to do with the fact that President Trump is fighting on many different fronts? We have North Korea, we have the issues here in the U.S., Russia. You think Syria and Putin got together and said, "Maybe this is a good time to test the president's medal?"LIPPOLD: I don't think it was timing for that. I think that the president is going to react to it and how he reacts. I think once again, internationally bent will drive the decision-making process for the U.S. government as it always should especially where military force is involved.I don't think this is going to be a tail-wagging, dog-type scenario, I think in fact we need to look at it and say what are our national security interest there? What is the end state we want to achieve? And if taking out the Syrian air force to send a signal to do that turns out to be the best option for us, then we execute it efficiently, ruthlessly, and with overwhelming force.MCDOWELL: Brian, and I'll let you get in here but the timing, it does beg the question of this attack comes at -- right after President Trump says that we can't wait to get out of Syria, that we -- that -- but, again, he focus on ISIS and we see the threat to the Syrian people and children in the Assad Regime.BRENBERG: Yes, absolutely. And the other timing issue that I'd like to ask you about Commander is you have the entrance this week now of John Bolton into the National Security Advisor role, that has to change things a little bit.He's been critical of these one-off strikes, do we see the tide shift to a more permanent comprehensive approach here with Ambassador Bolton moving into that role?LIPPOLD: Professor, that's a great question. And I think what you're going to see is Ambassador Bolton is now the National Security Advisor, not the executer but the advisor is going to say we need a much more comprehensive plan. We need a long range view. We need goals that we want to achieve for our national security objectives.And he is going to take a more holistic approach into the execution of national security policy across the board. So I think that you're going to see a little bit more robust policy, I think you will see one with more defined objectives in there, and I think you will see one that will be executed in fairly short order because he is a decisive individual and he's going to recommend that to the president who obviously brought him in because he was a little frustrated that he was being held back in some of the execution of our policies.MCDOWELL: The president did tweet because I mentioned the red line at the beginning, "If President Obama had crossed his stated red line in the sand, the Syrian disaster would have ended a long -- long ago. Animal Assad would have been history."Maria spoke with House Homeland Security Committee Chairman, Michael McCaul yesterday and he agrees with the president. Listen to this Commander.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MICHAEL MCCAUL (R-TX) HOUSE HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: There has to be a consequence to this. And I think the president's absolutely right is that President Obama drew the red line, the red line was crossed, he did nothing.And then he negotiate through John Kerry the settlement, this weapons convention. I remember John Kerry saying, "We took all their chemical weapons away." Obviously not. They still have this. And I also blame Russia and Iran, I think they're complicit with this as well.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Commander, I want to get your response to that. But as I mentioned earlier, we had that one-time airstrike last April but since then, there has been a chlorine gas attack that killed 20, mostly children, that happened in January, there was a statement from the State Department then but no enforcement. And Assad certainly knows that he would pay no price and now this, final thought.LIPPOLD: I think you're absolutely right. There has to be consequences for this action. While there was a red line drawn and unfortunately we did not react to the red line when Syria crossed it. We did in fact have one positive development and that was getting rid of the vast majority of chemical weapons in there.Had we attacked immediately, I doubt we would have ever gotten to that point with an agreement working with the Russians to make that happen. That is a positive thing to look at it. But nonetheless, if you draw a line as a state actor especially the United States, you have to hold it, enforce it, and do not waiver on it. And in doing that, it embolden people, the one-off strike, that's clearly going to be a test now whether we react to this in a manner that is much stronger, much more overwhelming and sends a signal, we will not tolerate this.By the same token, going to Russia and Iran and saying, you're complicit in this, you have contributed to it, you have created the conditions that allowed it to happen, you must not do that anymore and there will be consequences and if your folks happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, that is not our responsibility, it's your decision to put them there.MCDOWELL: Kirk, thank you so much. Kirk Lippold. Commander, be well. Thank you for being here.LIPPOLD: Thank you Dagen.MCDOWELL: Breaking news, President Trump just tweeting, "When a car is sent to the United States from China, there is a tariff to be paid of 2.12 percent. When a car is sent to China from the United States, there is a tariff to be paid of 25 percent. Does that sound like free or fair trade. No, it sounds like stupid trade going on for years."Coming up, on the hot seat, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is in Washington today ahead of two intense days of questioning on Capitol Hill. This comes as the company had set to alert millions of users if their data was shared.And tired of being patient? Congress Trey Gowdy calling out the Justice Department over the investigation into alleged FISA abuses.MCDOWELL: New week, new energy for Wall Street, DOW Futures right now are showing gains across the board, 167 point gain on the DOW Futures right now after what was a bruising week. Again, cooler heads prevailing I suppose when it comes to trade war talk. We'll see what comes out of the administration in the coming days. We're also watching the beginning of earning season this week.Meantime, at least six teenagers from New York severely injured after a charter bus crashed. Cheryl Casone has the details, Cheryl.CASONE: Yes, that's right Dagen. The bus packed with high school students returning from a spring break trip to Europe hit an overpass on Long Island last night. The impact was so strong, it tore the roof off the bus. This happened on the southern state parkway which restricts travel by commercial vehicles. Police say the driver did not seem to be familiar with that restriction.Well, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau joining thousands at a vigil honoring the junior hockey team involved in a tragic bus accident on Friday. The team president speaking to the crowd packed into the humble Broncos Arena.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KEVIN GARINGER, HUMBOLDT BRONCOS PRESIDENT: We will find strength in one another. Today and for every day forward, we are all Humboldt Broncos and we will be forever Humboldt Broncos strong.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Fifteen people are now dead after that team's bus collided with a tractor trailer. Among those killed were the team's head coach, the driver of the bus, and several players. While the community in Saskatchewan tries to cope, support has been overwhelming. A victims fund for the Broncos has already exceeded $4.5 million.Well Deutsche Bank is replacing its CEO. John Cryan is out and Christian Sewing is taking over. Sewing is a 47-year-old executive who's worked for Deutsche Bank for nearly three decades. Germany's biggest bank has been struggling since the 2008 financial crisis. Analysts say the change could signal a potential merger with another European bank. Shares of Deutsche Bank much higher in the premarket, up over three and a half percent right now.And then finally there's this, Anheuser-Busch unveiling a new flavor of beer, Bud Light Orange. It is a light lagger that is brewed usually actual peels from oranges. The company says that you will, "taste the citrusy goodness." Bud Light Orange available for a limited time for, yes, the summer. Shares of Anheuser-Busch are down about three percent so far this year.Dagen, if you ever put an orange in a beer like an orange slice, makes sense.MCDOWELL: What you do with a Hefeweizen, wheat beer.CASONE: Exactly.MCDOWELL: I have a question, is this a shandy?BRENBERG: It sounds like it. I don't like any of these kinds of beer. It sounds like a shandy, so I'm negative on it.MCDOWELL: Shandy is tip -- do you know shandies?MURPHY: I don't know shandy but I know this is like Budweiser and Fanta mixed together, I don't like it.MCDOWELL: That actually sounds delicious.CARTER: I know, right?MCDOWELL: People tweet us, I think a shandy is the -- defined by, it is like a juice or some fruit flavor or like soda in a beer. Like, again, the Leinenkugel's summer shandy is quite delicious on a hot day on the golf course.BRENBERG: I think beer goes well with beer and nothing else. So I wouldn't put any of those stuff, no peels, no nothing.CARTER: My guess is you're not the target audience. (INAUDIBLE)BRENBERG: I don't think I am. I don't think I am.MCDOWELL: Coming up, Novartis as closed at $8.7 billion deal for a gene therapy company in the Midwest.

White House officials helping camp down those fears on the Sunday shows yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR: Just technically, we have taken no action. It's a long process, there's several months here, so far no tariffs and no action has been enacted.STEPHEN MNUCHIN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY: I don't expect there will be a trade war, it could be but I don't expect it at all.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: President Trump tweeting this morning, " When a car is sent to the United States from China, there is a tariff to be paid of 2.12 percent. When a car is sent to China from the United States, there is a tariff to be paid of 25 percent. Does that sound like free or fair trade. No, it sounds like stupid trade going on for years."Joining me now is Investmark Advisory Group Principal, Michael Lee. Mike, what's going to keep these trade concerns in the background for investors, the start of earnings potentially?MICHAEL LEE, INVESTMARK ADVISORY GROUP PRINCIPAL: I think this is going to be one of the best earning seasons we've ever had, right? Not only from the actually result but we got to remember that earnings are a forward- looking tool and that's what matters -- I'm sorry, stocks are forward- looking tool.So what earnings are going to look like for the rest of the year and then going out to 2019 when we start talking about 2019, I think a lot of people are going to sit back and say, "Well you know what, stocks are actually really cheap, they're not expensive." We're looking at one of the kind of the greatest growth periods we're going to see in our lifetimes, so.MCDOWELL: But what if we do get into a back and forth, a tit-for-tat with China. Again, you heard from Larry Kudlow and Secretary of the Treasury, Steve MNuchin, they're trying to like wipe away some of the fears.Like, "Oh, this might not happen." But, again, I just wish some of those guys would call people I grew up with, hog farmers, and people who grow soybeans that that impacts the real American economy, that's what the market is reflecting that the economy might not be growing as fast and earnings might not be growing as fast. And it's Boeing and Caterpillar last week.LEE: So a couple of things, right? If you run a small business and your cost are going to go up 20 or 25 or 30 percent based on some tariff like this, this could be terrifying for you. However, on a larger scale, what can China really do to us if that they're not already doing?What, are they going to steal our intellectual property? I mean, the trade imbalance from China or trade deficit, we're annualizing at just under $400 billion a share, OK? That is a much larger portion of their GDP than the $150 billion to $170 billion that we export to them every year. Again, problems for people whose (INAUDIBLE) cost are going to go up.Our economy as a whole can withstand a trade war much easier than they can. The standard of living in China is no one near as high as they make it out to be. So if China were to -- if China gets into a trade war with us, chances are they'll go into recession. If they go into recession, there's a good probability of a popular uprising. So that could -- the only way that the Chinese government could go out of power is by a recession.So the government props up their economy, it's held together with duct tape and elbow grease. So it's -- look, I -- it's -- I'm saying this but people much smarter than me and much more powerful than me know this. So what we're seeing is a lot of posturing. So I don't -- any selloff because of trade war fears I think is a good buying opportunity.MURPHY: Totally agree completely on that because I think what you're seeing in the market though is you get these headlines and you're getting this big whip sauce back and forth and I think that's fine for the professional traders. But for the people at home, they could really get hurt in trading this type of market.I believe a lot of those whip sauce have to do with computerize trading, with the algorithm of trading. So they're pulling headlines and then you're seeing these big drops in the market or these big rallies in the market. And I think it's important for -- and I love your take on that, a huge portion of the volume out there in a day-to-day basis is computerized. So individual people at home can really get hurt trying to get in front of that.LEE: I would say for people over the last couple of years of markets is too high, the market is too high. Well you know what, every time you see an ugly tweet or an ugly headline or Stormy Daniels or something, the market's going to selloff. Here's your opportunity to take some of that cash and buy some stocks.MCDOWELL: The market, do I have hope it doesn't selloff on Stormy Daniels. But go ahead. I hope investors are smarter than that or the computer.LEE: If you start drilling down and looking at the U.S. economy, a durable goods are up year-over-year, almost nine percent, that's the highest number since the early 2000. You look at manufacturing is doing the best since the early 2000s.Non-ISM manufacturing is the highest level it's been in 20 years. You look at the job market, weekly javas claims have been below 300,000 for almost three years. Longest period in almost the history of the entire United States.MCDOWELL: Real quick, earnings. Earnings season starts this week, J.P. Morgan kind of the big one coming out on Friday, what do you expect overall growth for the quarter 17 percent but J.P. Morgan expected to put up even better numbers (INAUDIBLE).LEE: You know, what I'm going to be looking for is the forward guidance. What's dragged a lot of these banks back particularly is sales of trading. And now with the return of volatility, I think sales and trading has kind of been the (INAUDIBLE) as you look at all the different business units in all these banks.It's going to start to get better and then with the banks, as rates are going higher, their net interest margins are going to expand. As net interest margins are going to expand, banks are going to make a lot more money in their wallets. And let's face it, 10 years ago when the banks were in their hay days they were trading shops, now they get back to being traditional lenders.So when you were -- when you have a $1 trillion of loans out there, you make an extra 25 basis points on each loan, it's a lot of money, right? So -- I mean, the forward guidance is what I'm looking at and as the conversation switches from 2018 earnings to 2019 earnings I think people are going to say, "Wow, stocks are really, really cheap. Something's going on here, like the market's going much higher."MCDOWELL: Michael Lee, thank you sir. Good to see you. Come back soon.LEE: Thanks very much guys. Thank you.MCDOWELL: Coming up, facing the music, Facebook CEO is set to meet with lawmakers in Washington today as he prepares to face a grilling before the Senate and then the House tomorrow and Wednesday. Hear from a whistleblower about the data reveal, the reckless handling of your personal information, let's call it that.And Dr. Seuss has bumped into a new beat, the Migos remix, "There's a Wocket in My Pocket," you've got to hear to believe.MCDOWELL: Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Monday, April 9th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern. Easing concerns over a trade war, sparking a rally on Wall Street, Futures are showing gains across the board, 176-point gain on the Dow Futures, this after that sharp selloff on Friday.The major market gauges all down more than two percent, again, a little bit of a disappointing job's number. The chief of the feds speaking and then trade war worries. In Europe, the market is hovering near the flat line this morning. We still have gains across the board in England, France and Germany, and in Asia overnight, stocks moving up from Shanghai to the KOSPI in South Korea.Facebook, under fire, CEO Mark Zuckerberg, gearing up for his trip to Capitol Hill, where he will be grilled over the company's privacy practices. What to expect from the congressional hearings, ahead. Calling for action, House Oversight Committee Chairman, Trey Gowdy, says the justice department is stonewalling when it comes to handing over documents tied to the FISA and Hillary Clinton investigations. Here's what he told Maria on Sunday Morning Futures.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. TREY GOWDY (R-SC), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE: I want to be able to support the FBI and the DOJ, but the world's premier law- enforcement agency can't seem to operate a damn copying machine. That is inexplicable.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: We have the very latest, a strong message for Iran, hackers attacking the country's network, leaving an image of the American flag. Warning, don't mess with our elections. A little bit of a merger Monday on Wall Street, Novartis is getting big on gene therapy with its latest acquisition.And a not so quite start for the box office for A Quiet Place, the horror film soaring passed expectations. We have the full box office recap, ahead, plus, a whole new tune for Dr. Seuss' Wocket in my Pocket, a rap of the childhood classic, going viral.To our top story this half hour, the clock, ticking on the DOJ, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and FBI Director Christopher Wray, now, asking Federal Prosecutor John Lausch to help speed up the response to GOP demands for documents related to the surveillance of former Trump Campaign Advisor, Carter Page. The firing of Andrew McCabe from the FBI and the investigation into Hillary Clinton's private e-mail server, the request, coming after President Trump took to Twitter this weekend, to slam the DOJ and FBI, writing, what does the Department of Justice and FBI have to hide?Why aren't they giving the strongly requested documents, unredacted, to the House Judiciary Committee? Stalling, but for what reason? Not looking good. House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy who has been leading the charge, sounded off, yesterday, on Sunday Morning Futures.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOWDY: I have not seen a clean version and I need to know what's behind those black lines because it's really important how this investigation began, when it began and what is the -- what is the weight, what is the credibility of the evidence upon which this investigation was launched? And the Department of Justice and the FBI have that document, they won't let us see the clean version, and I'm struggling to understand why.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: This all comes as the DOJ promises to turn over an additional 3600 pages from the FBI today, to the House panel. Joining us now is Editor-in-Chief of Axios, Nick Johnston, Nick, your reaction to these new developments and where do we go from here?NICHOLAS JOHNSTON, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, AXIOS: Yes, I think it's really important to hear the frustration in Chairman Gowdy's voice what he told Maria, sort of, how angry he was about how they can't find the copy machine that could underscores the tension here and how these are Republicans on the Hill are still very much focused on getting this kind of information.And this is a Republican justice department that they'd say hasn't been doing it fast enough, even the President, as you showed, has been tweeting that the document turnover hasn't happened fast enough. I think, the appointment of this new attorney, to facilitate that, will probably help. It might make some of these folks on the Hill, a little happier, but this is still a very important investigatory focus for them, and they're not going to give up until they get what they want.MCDOWELL: Nick, how do the midterm elections factor into this, though, because even though we have a Republican president in the White House, and Republican leading the justice department as the Attorney General, you look at Trey Gowdy and the other heads, Devin Nunes, head of the House Intelligence Committee, really there, the time window is closing on them just, potentially, if the Democrats retake the House. How critical is that timing?JOHNSTON: I think it's a really great point. A lot of what Republicans want to accomplish in the House today is set under the guise of what will happen in the midterms and Republicans are coming from a -- from a place of the underdogs, I think, in this election, and if they lose the gavels on these committees, these investigations go away. So I think, certainly, in the coming months, if they don't get the documents, this pressure will only increase because they know they have to finish this by the end of the year.CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS: No, Nick, I think, it's a really interesting conversation that's been have about whether or not the Republican hold strategy, is to undermine -- is undermine the DOJ and say that there's not going to be trust in these institutions that are so important. Do you think that's fair for them to criticize or do you think the Republicans have a fair, you know, have a real beef here?JOHNSTON: Right. This is a really interesting point. We've done some pulling on this, in fact, quickly, after the President went after the (INAUDIBLE) investigation recently, and we saw favorability for the FBI plunge among Republicans which is something we haven't seen, essentially, ever, as long as the department had existed.I think it's a very, sort of, dicey area to be, sort of, attacking these law enforcement agencies the way they ever remember, you know, these are members of congress. They have clear investigatory ability to get these kinds of documents, and you know what? If they subpoena them, you need to provide them.MCDOWELL: I want to move on to Facebook (INAUDIBLE) send out notifications today to millions of affected users in this data mining scandal. This comes as congressional aides are confirming that CEO Mark Zuckerberg will hold meetings today on Capitol Hill, with several lawmakers ahead of this week's hearings. Take a listen to Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and Senate Judiciary Committee, John Kennedy, both suggesting that things are about to change at the tech giant.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SHERYL SANDBERG, COO, FACEBOOK: Mark's happy to go to congress because Mark wants to answer every question people have about the service we office. We weren't focused enough and being proactive enough and Mark is happy to say here's what we weren't doing and here's what we are doing now.REP. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA), MEMBER, SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: I don't want to hurt Facebook. I don't want to regulate them half to death. But, we have a problem.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Yes, our problem. Meantime, a whistleblower, now warning that the millions of affected users' data could be stored in Russia, I think that it's going to be Mark Zuckerberg's performance because he's sending out Sheryl Sandberg in his stead, who clearly loves to tell women how to lean in, in this country, but when -- this is a very serious issue and I would argue that her performance, last week, in terms of giving interviews, was a little light, in terms of really grappling with the seriousness of it.I point to a New York Post, the front page -- the front page of the post, on Saturday, we own you, pay us for your privacy, shocking, and then Mark Zuckerberg, famously, in 2010, was sweating like Richard Nixon, breaking out on a flop sweat-like none other. Again, it's just going to be Zuckerberg sitting there, whether the stocks sold off or not.JOHNSTON: Right. This is a -- this is the main event here. All the pre- interviews last week with Sheryl Sandberg (INAUDIBLE) were opening acts. The real thing here, Zuckerberg is on the Hill -- on the Hill, today, preparing, tomorrow, 2:30, must-see TV. Zuckerberg, appearing before this committee, this is something he's never done before in this kind of hearing, and he doesn't have any natural allies on his committee. These senators on both sides of the aisle are gunning for big tech. And so, this hearing is a start of that.MCDOWELL: Are they really gunning for big tech, though, Nick? I mean, big tech is -- you know, when you talk about Silicon Valley and technology, it is one of the most divided areas, politically, that all of the CEOs have historically been big givers to Democratic candidates. Their policies lean very far left. There's really not room, you saw with the firing of that Google employee, not room for conservative thought or speech. And so, I just wonder what kind of treatments he gets.JOHNSTON: I would separate it from that. What this is, is the final -- the first time congress is really going to ask the questions, are these tech companies too big and if they know so much about their users and have they done a good job of explaining to users how much they know. For a lot of members of the Hill, this is a mystery to them. There are no natural allies for Facebook or rather these big technology companies. I want to look to see any friendly questions for Mark, tomorrow, when he's in congress.MCDOWELL: We've known, Mike Murphy, that this was going on for years, in terms of Facebook not protecting user information, whether you're talking about RapLeaf or Cloud and their way of enforcement was to call up the company telling them, don't do that anymore.MICHAEL MURPHY, FOUNDER, ROSECLIFF: Yes.MCDOWELL: And it's only because this was somehow related to the Trump campaign that people are now furious and up in arms.MURPHY: I think what Mark Zuckerberg's going to talk about a lot, this week, is what Facebook used to do, and what they are doing now, to talk about how the company has shifted, how they're protecting your data, but you'll know when go on there, Dagen. You're giving up a lot of your information. If you don't want to give that up, you shouldn't be on Facebook. They may have a responsibility to not sell it but they -- once you're on there, that data is there, and they own it, they do, as the cover said.BRENBERG,: Do they know what they're doing now? That's -- you said they're going to talk about what they're doing. Now, I think a lot of people look at this and say, do they know what they're doing now or are they really just, like, we actually have no idea what's going on and every single day now, we're seeing new revelations of more, you know, inappropriate data sharing, customers having their data used in ways that they didn't know. I don't think Facebook has a good handle on where they are.MURPHY: I think this is years ago this is years ago when -- I think it was 2014, the Cambridge Analytica information ended up being given to the improper parties. So, I think, Facebook today, 2018, versus four years ago, is a vastly different company, it has run differently. So, I think that's what they want to underline, is how they are now doing their best to potentially protect their data the best possible.BRENBERG: I think they're going to have you lift, kind of, show that, I really do. I don't think people think it's changed that much.MCDOWELL: They knew that data, back in 2015, had been improperly accessed and they basically said, don't, you know, do away. Get rid of it, Nick, final word, real quick.JOHNSTON: I think the key thing here is a lot of people who are, sort of, really into this issue know about how much Facebook has. This is the first time members of congress will learn how big that is.MCDOWELL: And let's hope that they bone up in advance of this, because we know how this can go, if they're really not sure of the questions they are asking. But, again, WilmerHale, the law firm given Mark Zuckerberg some prep in advance to that, the Wall Street Journal reported that today. Nick, thank you so much.JOHNSTON: Always.MCDOWELL: Great to see you, Nick Johnston of Axios.JOHNSTON: Thanks.MCDOWELL: Coming up, hackers hit Iran with the cryptic warning, including an image of the American Flag and a message, don't mess with our elections, details on that. An intergalactic debut, the new Solo, a Star Wars story trailer, finally out. We'll give you a peek.MCDOWELL: Iran hit hard by a global cyberattack with a strong message. Cheryl Casone has the details, Cheryl.CASONE: Yes, they did, Dagen. Hackers targeting networks on a number of countries including data centers in Iran. The hackers let the image of an American flag on screen, saying "don't mess with our elections". The Iranian government says, about 3500 -- across that country.Well, a deal in the pharmaceutical industry to tell you about -- Novartis is buying the AveXis, the price tag, nearly $9 billion. The deal is a bet that at least one promising drug that AveXis is developing to treat spinal muscular atrophy will turn into a blockbuster drug. Shares of Novartis are higher in the premarket, up more than one and quarter percent; AveXis shares are sharply higher as well.Well, this is interesting -- one rapper on YouTube, drew some inspiration from a kind of unusual place while rhyming to the tune of Migos song "Walk it, Talk it".(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Some of them are dreaming like that (INAUDIBLE), but that (INAUDIBLE) when the bottle some are fairly some are not. Let them (INAUDIBLE) on the table when they get under the chair. But that bump on the sofa when I wish she wasn't there.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: So, you get it when you start watching it, right? This went viral. And instead of "Walk it, Talk it", the YouTuber was rapper "walk it in my pocket" but in the Migos style of rapping. It racks up over a million views on YouTube. So, I guess -- I don't know what's next, cat in the hat? Cinderella? Green eggs and ham? Bring it on!MURPHY: I've had enough for 15 years.(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: No, you've been doing -- did you rap Dr. Seuss, Theodore Geisel, for your kids?MURPHY: For 15 years, straight, for every one of mine.MCDOWELL: Give me some green eggs and ham. I want to hear it now.MURPHY: It's on my YouTube channel.MCDOWELL: You give us some green eggs and ham?MURPHY: No.CARTER: (INAUDIBLE) like, when we first heard about this, is this the children that, you know -- like, no, this is a wrapper.MURPHY: Wrapper, Migos. Yes!CARTER: You're all in.BRENBERG: This is how dads keep their kids engaged. I mean, you're reading your book, you've got do something like that. You can't just read the book; you got to rap, you got to sing it.CARTER: You rap your books?BRENBERG: I do something, maybe like an accent. You know, you got to do something to make it, and your kids are just to get bored and whatever. It's a hard job, right?MURPHY: This is iconic, and you kind of bring it to 2018, I think it needs a little hip-hop in there, totally.MCDOWELL: We will not eat green eggs and ham?MURPHY: There you go.MCDOWELL: Give me the next one.MURPHY: Sam, I am.(LAUGHTER)MCDOWELL: Coming up, "A Quiet Place" making a big noise. The thriller is a big win by actors turned director, Emily Blunt and John Krisinski. A box office recap, next.MCDOWELL: Another record-breaking weekend at the box office. Lauren Simonetti has more details.SIMONETTI: All right. Good morning, happy Monday. This is the time we talk about what was a hit over the weekend. So, let's give you the list. In first place, "A Quiet Place". A surprise $50 million opening for this horror film -- and we're going to talk more about it in a second; let's get through the rest of the list. Steven Spielberg's "Ready Player One", 25 million in the second week; "Blockers", 21 million; "Black Panther", took the fourth-place spot, only $8 million this weekend but if you look at what "Black Panther" has done to date, it has unseated "Titanic". So, if you look at total domestic growth, for this movie, $665 million. There it is, number three of all time. "The Force Awakens", number one; "Avatar", number two; and "Titanic", now number four.Let's go back to "A Quiet Place". This is a movie that cost $17 million to make; $50 million in its opening weekend. So, it was written and directed by -- of office fame, John Krisinki and his wife Emily Blunt starred, but it's basically a "A Quiet Place" -- there's no dialogue in the movie, and it's a huge win for Paramount who needed a big hit after about two years of not having a hit. So, there you have it. We're liking horror at the box office. And they got the trailer for the new "Star Wars".MCDOWELL: What do you got, Lauren? Show me.SIMONETTI: Let's watch it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I heard about a job. A big shot gangster putting together a crew.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm a driver. I'm a flyer.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I've waited a long time for a shot like this.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What is he saying? No, what do you know?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You got a line on a ship?(END VIDEO CLIP)SIMONETTI: It hit theaters on the 25th of May. See, it's the young Han Solo. Do we want to see the --BRENBERG: That's a lot of -- it's a lot of pressure to play the young Han Solo. He's such a great character. I think the chances of failing are really high here. I'm excited to see. It looks good in the trailer, but that's a tough role, right?SIMONETTI: Agreed.CARTER: I like the original "Star Wars", I'm not into it.SIMONETTI: It's disconnected. It's another one of the -- I think this one takes place before the first one, in 1977.MURHPY: That tease makes -- while they're getting 600 and 700 million at the box office, you can count and see more and more "Star Wars" prequel, sequels, whatever.BRENBERG: You're going to see Han Solo as a 5-year-old at some point --MURPHY: Yes --BRENBERG: I'm not looking forward to that one.CARTER: If I like something or not, it's pretty much a not a good indicator about whether or not it's going to perform well.MCDOWELL: It's called monetizing the franchise, just like Disney bought it in the first place. And so, they've done a pretty good job.SIMONETTI: It's almost like one a year, right? There's been like one "Star Wars".BRENBERG: One from the regular series, one of the, kind of the, in between --SIMONETTI: In between.BRENBERG: Yes, every single year for the next 20 years, at least, right?SIMONETTI: They get some new characters in this one. And we'll see what the appetite is for a young Han Solo.MCDOWELL: You only need to know one word -- Chewbacca.(LAUGHTER)SIMONETTI: Makes an appearance in one of trailers.MCDOWELL: Exactly.SIMONETTI: And his age?MCDOWELL: 190 -- in the film.MURHPY: (INAUDIBLE) like a long time.(LAUGHTER)SIMONETTI: They sure do.CARTER: I hope that's a good indicator. My dog just looks like him.SIMONETTI: I wish our dogs are the same. Kevin -- someone who looks like him.MCDOWELL: Her dog is named Kevin, just to clear that up. She has two dogs. Lauren, thank you so much. And Lauren is having a baby. Can you reveal the name while we're staying here?SIMONETTI: I don't know if it's a boy or a girl. And we're not sharing names only because I don't care what anybody has to say about them anymore. Not a name. Not talking anymore suggestion,BRENBERG: You don't need it, but yes, forget about.SIMONETTI: Don't want your input. Thank you very much. But you can still guess if it's boy or girl.MCDOWELL: We can segue from Han Solo to Lauren and her impending delivery. Still ahead, gas prices said to hit their higher level in years this summer. We have all the details for you, next on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.MCDOWELL: Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Monday, April 9th, your top stories at 7:30 a.m. Eastern. Crisis in Syria; yet another suspected chemical weapon attacked, leaving dozens dead. The international community on high alert. As the world waits for U.S. response, President Trump warning of a big price to pay. Despite the tensions, stocks reporting to a higher open, bouncing back 160-point on the Dow Futures right now after concerns over a trade war with China, seem to ease a bit -- you see the gains there.Load-Date: April 9, 2018End of Document

FORMER CIA CASE OFFICER CHARGED WITH CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT ESPIONAGE AND RETENTION OF NATIONAL DEFENSE INFORMATIONUS Fed NewsMay 8, 2018 Tuesday 6:30 PM  ESTCopyright 2018 HT Media Ltd. All Rights ReservedLength: 753 wordsBodyWASHINGTON, May 8 -- The U.S. Department of Justice issued the following press release:The Justice Department announced today that Jerry Chun Shing Lee, 53, of Hong Kong, was indicted by a federal grand jury sitting in the Eastern District of Virginia with one count of conspiracy to gather or deliver national defense information to aid a foreign government, and two counts of unlawfully retaining documents related to the national defense.Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers, Acting U.S. Attorney Tracy Doherty-McCormick for the Eastern District of Virginia, and Assistant Director in Charge Nancy McNamara of the FBI's Washington Field Office announced the charges."When government officials violate their oath to defend our nation and protect its secrets, the National Security Division will hold them accountable," said Assistant Attorney General Demers. "Lee, a former CIA case officer, allegedly conspired to provide information to the Chinese government about the national defense of the United States. Lee's alleged actions betrayed the American people and his former colleagues at the CIA. We will not tolerate such threats to our country or its national security.""The allegations in this case are troubling," said Acting U.S. Attorney Doherty-McCormick. "Conspiring with foreign agents poses a real and serious threat toward our national security. The United States will hold accountable those who conspire to compromise our national security.""Espionage is a serious crime that can expose our country to grave danger" said Assistant Director in Charge McNamara. "The FBI will continue to aggressively pursue all allegations of espionage."Lee is a U.S. citizen who speaks fluent Chinese. According to the indictment, Lee was a case officer for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) until 2007. After leaving the CIA, Lee resided in Hong Kong. The indictment alleges that in April 2010, two Chinese intelligence officers (IOs) approached Lee and offered to pay him for information. The indictment alleges that Lee received taskings from the IOs until at least 2011. The taskings allegedly requested that Lee provide documents and information relating to the national defense of the United States. According to the indictment, the IOs provided Lee with a series of email addresses so that he could communicate covertly with them. The indictment further alleges that Lee prepared documents responsive to the taskings, made numerous unexplained cash deposits, and repeatedly lied to the U.S. government during voluntary interviews when asked about travel to China and his actions overseas.In August 2012, Lee and his family left Hong Kong to return to the United States to live in northern Virginia. While traveling back to the United States, Lee and his family had hotel stays in Hawaii and Virginia. During each of the hotel stays, FBI agents conducted court-authorized searches of Lee's room and luggage, and found that Lee was in unauthorized possession of materials relating to the national defense. Specifically, agents found two books containing handwritten notes that contained classified information, including but not limited to, true names and phone numbers of assets and covert CIA employees, operational notes from asset meetings, operational meeting locations and locations of covert facilities. Agents also found a thumb drive on which was stored a document later determined to contain information classified at the Secret level. During voluntary interviews with the FBI, Lee admitted preparing the document in response to taskings from the IO.An indictment is merely an allegation and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law. If convicted, Lee faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. The maximum statutory sentence is prescribed by Congress and is provided here for informational purposes. If convicted of any offense, the sentencing of the defendant will be determined by the court based on the advisory Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.This case was investigated by the FBI's Washington Field Office. The case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorneys Adam L. Small and Patrick T. Murphy of National Security Division's Counterintelligence and Export Control Section, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Neil Hammerstrom of the Eastern District of Virginia.

The Chinese government had promised in November to "gradually and adequately reduce" tariffs on imported vehicles, although it did not give a specific time frame to do so. Even so, investors took Xi's promise as a positive signal.  Facebook shares, whose CEO appears before Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday, are down 0.03% to $ 157.88 per share.  Opinion: 4 questions that the US Congress should ask Zuckerberg  Mexican Stock Exchange  The Mexican Stock Exchange (BMV) operates in the field of earnings in line with its peers on Wall Street.  The Price and Quotation Index (S & P / BMV IPC), which groups the 35 most liquid issuers in the market, increases 0.48% to 48,289 units.  Petroleum  Oil prices rise on Tuesday extending the strong gains of yesterday, as investors were more optimistic with the possibility that a trade dispute between the United States and China can be solved without major damage to the global economy.  West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures for May delivery are trading at 64.57 dollars per barrel (dpb) which means a gain of 1.81% while the North Sea Brent for June delivery rises 1.81% and is sold at 69.89 dpb, according to figures from Bloomberg.  Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday pledged to open more of his country's economy and reduce tariffs, in a speech that had a conciliatory tone amid growing trade tensions with Washington.  Fears of a prolonged trade dispute between the two major world powers and uncertainty about the balance of supply and demand in oil markets have made volatile operations in recent weeks. Load-Date: April 10, 2018End of Document

That is why seasoned currency investment veterans like monitor everything blockchain-related closely. While we don't know what the next big development with blockchain will be, we know something significant is likely on the horizon.To make staying up to date easier, we bring you some of the latest news and analysis on blockchain and crypto from around the world.Crimean Government Employees Fined for Bitcoin MiningEmployees who were fired in September of 2017 from Crimea's Council of Ministers have now also 30,000 rubles for mining bitcoin using the government's computer network. This comes with other examples of state employees utilizing work computers to mine cryptocurrency in Florida and Louisiana.For those unfamiliar with mining, it is the process of verifying transactions and adding new transactions onto the blockchain. Built by Jordan Lindsey, the is one of the solutions designed to address some of the logistical issues with Bitcoin.With more transactions taking place than before, this process is very energy intensive. This has made people question the efficacy of Bitcoin. As cryptocurrency becomes more and more popular, it requires larger amounts of computational energy to work. If Bitcoin is ever going to become a major currency, it will have to find a way to stay energy energy-efficient.Government-Led Research Body in China Unveils Blockchain ServiceWhile big companies in China have already launched blockchain services, the Blockchain Registry Open Platform is notable for being the first blockchain service associated with a government.It's no surprise that the Chinese government has a significant interest in blockchain technology because it has applications that go well beyond cryptocurrency. While Bitcoin may be the most popular application of blockchain to date, there is no telling what could come next. Blockchain presents the potential to change any sector that uses data storage or middlemen. It will be interesting to continue to follow the progress of the government-backed blockchain service.Coinbase Not Adding New CryptosThe San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange is hesitant to add new cryptocurrencies to the exchange. While consumers around the world have increasing desire to be able to buy and sell different coins, that won't be through Coinbase.The hesitation stems from the alleged SEC investigations into new cryptocurrencies. The SEC may be trying to determine whether some cryptocurrencies qualify as securities or commodities. This makes life difficult for Coinbase when it comes to supporting new emerging cryptocurrencies because the exchange may be forced to remove them by the SEC in the future.Much of the appeal of crypto is the claim that it requires no government to regulate it. But the more mainstream cryptocurrency has grown, the more interested government agencies have become in regulating it. However, investors like Jordan Lindsey aren't afraid of potential regulations because they understand that blockchain will eventually change the world, regardless of what governments do.It's worth noting that some believe that regulation is a good thing and will bring legitimacy to the cryptocurrency world.English Heritage Partners with GiftcoinEnglish Heritage is a registered charity that manages the National Heritage Collection. This collection includes over 400 historic sites, landmarks, and buildings in England.English Heritagehttp://blocktribune.com/blockchain-platform-giftcoin-partners-with-english-heritage-to-boost-confidence-in-charitable-giving/ with Giftcoin to try and increase trust in charitable donations. The Giftcoin platform is unique in that it can actually track the money being donated to where and when that money is actually spent. This kind of technology has massive appeal to charitable people who want to ensure that their money is being put to good use. A successful partnership could lead to many more charities adopting blockchain technologies to increase donors' confidence.Keeping Up with Blockchain and CryptoIt's not easy to stay up to date on blockchain and crypto, but it's worth the effort. The invention of blockchain mirrors the invention of the internet in that it's impossible to imagine all the ways it will create change.Long-time currency investors like Jordan Lindsey provide regular news and updates on the state of blockchain technology and crypto.

Rep. Thompson Introduces Resolution on ZTETargeted News ServiceMay 16, 2018 Wednesday 7:31 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 582 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyRep. Bennie G. Thompson, D-Mississippi, ranking Democratic member of the House Homeland Security Committee, issued the following news release:Today, Rep. Bennie G. Thompson (D-MS), Ranking Member of the Committee on Homeland Security, introduced a Resolution of Inquiry directing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to provide the Committee with all information and documentation it possesses related to the cybersecurity threats posed by the Chinese telecom corporation ZTE. ZTE has been considered a significant security and surveillance threat for years and has illegally sold its products to Iran and North Korea, despite sanctions.Earlier this month, the Department of Defense banned the sale of ZTE phones on U.S. military bases because they pose an unacceptable risk. In February, the top officials from the FBI, CIA, NSA, and Defense Intelligence Agency all warned against using ZTE products. In 2012, the House Select Committee on Intelligence warned of potential cyber-espionage by ZTE.This past Sunday, President Trump made a confusing statement via Twitter lamenting the loss of "many jobs in China" as a result of actions taken by the Department of Commerce to punish ZTE for failing to comply with a court settlement. The President directed Commerce to save ZTE, seemingly without engaging in any formal policy processes or consulting the Intelligence Community. Earlier this week, reports emerged that a Chinese construction company agreed to build a resort in Indonesia - financed with loans from the Chinese government - which will license the Trump name.Congressman Thompson released the following statement on the Resolution:"The information sought from DHS will help us conduct oversight into the Federal government's understanding, handling, and mitigation of the potential threats posed by ZTE and its products. Given the Department's role in securing Federal networks and protecting critical infrastructure, it is important to determine what actions they have taken. We must also be able to determine what, if any, information or formal processes informed President Trump's decision to work with President Xi to benefit ZTE. The President's cavalier approach to handling this serious national security matter should be concerning to all.""In this age of ever-changing threats, the cybersecurity of government networks and our national security infrastructure should be paramount - and the President should not be engaging in any conduct or policymaking that could threaten this. I hope that this effort will garner support from my colleagues who, like me, are concerned about the homeland security implications of propping-up ZTE."The Resolution of Inquiry (H. Res. 898) can be found here (https://democrats-homeland.house.gov/sites/democrats.homeland.house.gov/files/documents/zte.pdf).BACKGROUND: A Resolution of Inquiry is a legislative tool that has privileged parliamentary status, meaning it can be brought to the floor for immediate consideration if the relevant Committee has not reported it within 14 legislative days, even if the Majority has not scheduled it for a vote. Once introduced, the Committee must schedule a markup in that period to consider and debate the measure and vote on whether to report it to the house favorably or unfavorably. If the Committee fails to act, it can be called up on the House floor and voted upon by the full House of Representatives.Contact: Adam Comis, 202/225-9978Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6293312 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: May 17, 2018End of Document

LONDON MARKET CLOSE: Stocks End Lower As Trade War Fears PersistLive Briefs PRO Global MarketsApril 3, 2018 Tuesday 12:12 PM ESTCopyright 2018 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 1189 wordsBody Stocks in London ended lower on Tuesday following the long bank holiday weekend, as trade war fears between the US and China continued to plague investors. The FTSE 100 index closed down 0.4%, or 26.15 points at 7,030.46. The large cap index hit an intraday low of 6,996.76 earlier in the session. The FTSE 250 ended down 0.3%, or 62.46 points, at 19,398.01, and the AIM All-Share closed down 0.1%, or 0.95 points, at 1,013.40.The BATS UK 100 ended down 0.5% at 11,938.86, the BATS 250 closed down 0.5% at 17,685.35, and the BATS Small Companies ended up 0.1% at 11,877.27.In Paris the CAC 40 ended down 0.3%, while the DAX 30 in Frankfurt ended 0.8%. "Investors have run through a selection of 'reasons to be fearful' over the past eight weeks, with the narrative changing as fast as the price. Inflation scare, tariff wars, Facebook hacking, tariff wars again, and now concerns over Amazon, have all been cited as the culprits," said IG Group analyst Chris Beauchamp. "In truth the market was merely overexposed and primed for a drop. Sentiment has moved back towards neutral, if not yet completely fearful, providing attractive risk-reward for those prepared to buy on weakness. Valuations are back to early 2016," Beauchamp added. The White House criticised the Chinese government's imposition of tariff on 128 products it imports from the US, saying that the trade measure is "unfair".In retaliatory measures primarily targeting the US agriculture industry, the Customs Tariff Commission of China's State Council imposed a tariff of 15% on 120 items, including fruits and related products. A tariff of 25% will be applied on eight items of imports including pork. The new rates came into effect Monday.The Chinese Finance Ministry said the tariffs affecting about USD3 billion worth of imports was to safeguard China's interests and balance losses caused by new US tariffs.China's action comes in response to Washington's decision last month to impose a 25% tariff on steel and a 10% tariff on aluminium imported from China.On the London Stock Exchange, Sky ended as the best blue chip performer up 1.1% after the pay-TV company noted two alternative remedy proposals submitted by Twenty-First Century Fox to the UK Competition & Markets Authority.The US film and television company is seeking to acquire the 61% of Sky it does not already own.Fox has proposed the creation of Newco, which would be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sky, and the business of Sky News would be transferred into this newly incorporated company.Alternatively, Fox said, entertainment giant Walt Disney Co has expressed an interested in acquiring Sky News "whether or not Disney's proposed acquisition of [Fox] proceeds".Sky advised shareholders to take no action at this stage."Sky shares are bucking the trend today as Fox stated Disney could buy Sky News. It would appear the Murdochs, who control Fox, are trying to sweeten the competition and market authority so they can acquire the remaining 61% in Sky. It was also suggested that Fox could ring fence Sky News if the takeover is approved. Sky shares hit an 18-year high last month, and it would appear the bullish trend is set to continue," said CMC Markets analyst David Madden. At the other end of the large cap index GKN closed down 2.0%, giving back some of Thursday's gains after the engineer lost its hostile takeover battle with midcap turnaround specialist Melrose Industries. The stock closed up 9.5% on Thursday. In the FTSE 250, Fidessa Group ended up 12% at 4,100.00 pence after the financial trading systems provider said it has received takeover approaches from two separate parties, both larger than the GBP1.40 billion initial offer from Temenos Group.Under the Temenos offer, which was first announced mid-February, Fidessa shareholders would receive 3,567.00 pence in cash per share, valuing the company at GBP1.4 billion. This represented a 37% premium to Fidessa's closing price of 2,605.00p on February 16.In addition, Fidessa shareholders will be entitled to receive 2017's final dividend and special dividend, together amounting to 79.7p. In total, Fidessa shareholders would thus receive 3,646.70p for 2017.However, under the first of the proposed new offers, Fidessa shareholders would get GBP38.297 per share, made up of GBP37.50 in cash plus the dividend, a 5% premium on Temenos' offer.It did not give any details of the second possible offer, save that it is also higher than that of Temenos. Fidessa stressed there can be no certainty of a formal offer from either party. The pound was flat quoted at USD1.4064 at the London equities close, compared to USD1.4028 late Thursday.The euro was slightly lower at USD1.2264 at the European equities close, against USD1.2290 at the close on Thursday.On the economic front, the euro area manufacturing activity grew at the slowest pace in eight months in March, final data from IHS Markit showed.The final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 56.6 in March from 58.6 in February. The score came in line with flash estimate.This was the lowest score in eight months. Nonetheless, a reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.Stocks in New York were higher at the London equities close following the sell-off seen in the previous session. The DJIA was up 0.5%, the S&P 500 index up 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.2%.The sell-off on Wall Street came after China announced it is imposing tariffs on 128 imported goods originating in the US.In addition, Amazon shares ended sharply lower on Monday after US President Donald Trump attacked the company's business practices in a post on Twitter.Investors will also be keeping close watch on the highly anticipated stock market debut of music streaming service Spotify on Tuesday.Spotify has opted for an unconventional, cost-saving "direct listing" on the NYSE, which means the listing is not underwritten by a bank and saves the company a number of fees usually associated with an IPO.But it is also a strategy that has analysts uncertain of the company's prospects, as it heightens the risk of a chaotic and unpredictable market debut.In another unusual twist, the company's founders declined to ring the traditional opening bell on the trading floor on Wall Street.Brent oil was down quoted at USD67.91 a barrel at the equities close from USD69.02 at the London equities close Thursday. Gold was higher quoted at USD1,331.30 an ounce at the London equities close against USD1,321.59 late on Thursday.In the UK corporate calendaron Wednesday waste-to-product company Renewi and tile retailer Topps Tiles release trading statements, while digital communications company Next Fifteen Communications publishes its full year results.In the economic calendar on Wednesday, the UK BRC shop price index is at 0001 BST, with Japan's Markit services PMI at 0130 BST and China's Caixin services PMI at 0245 BST.The UK construction PMI is at 0930 BST, with eurozone unemployment and consumer price index at 1000 BST. In the US in the afternoon, ADP employment change is at 1315 BST, with the Markit services PMI at 1445 BST. The ISM non-manufacturing PMI is at 1500 BST.Load-Date: April 4, 2018End of Document

International appeal ofKnives Outcontinues to be strong, consistently topping the charts in Japan.Fortified leading mobile portfolio with the introduction of a number of new games including blockbuster hitChu Liu Xiangin January andIdentity VandShadowversein April.Identity Vis NetEase's first asymmetrical battle arena (ABA) game, achieving over 10 million active users in its first week.Shadowverseis a collectible card game (CCG) licensed from Cygames.Maintained popularity for PC-client and mobile flagship titles includingFantasy Westward Journey,Westward Journey Online,New Ghost,OnmyojiandInvincible.Accumulated over 60 million registeredMinecraftusers in China and introduced an open platform for third party developers.Furthered strategic diversification initiatives with the continued development of upcoming games including manga-based player versus player (PvP) gameQwQand Chinese-style CCGAncient Nocturne.Solidified leadership in cross-border and private label e-commerce markets through enhanced customer services and closer partnerships with international brands, yielding continued strong growth momentum and greater economy of scale."We believe the advancements we made across our business segments in the first quarter put us on track for a successful year. We are excited by the longevity of and player loyalty to our flagship games, the strong performances of our new titles launched in the first quarter, and the continued rapid expansion of our e-commerce business, as well as the healthy development of our advertising services," said Mr. William Ding, Chief Executive Officer and Director of NetEase."We continue to dominate China's MMORPG market with our new chart-topping title,Chu Liu Xiang,which modernized MMOPRG gameplay," Mr. Ding continued. "Our strategy to introduce games in non-MMORPG genres is also beginning to bear fruit. Monetization forKnives OutandTerminator 2is ramping up smoothly, andIdentity V, our very first ABA game, attracted a huge fan base immediately following its launch in April."We are committed to executing on our game diversification strategy, and we are becoming more adept at reaching non-MMORPG users. As we work to expand our award-winning portfolio of online games, we expect our marketing costs will normalize going forward, compared with our marketing expenses in the first quarter of 2018. For 2018, we will work to ensure that each of our business lines continues to thrive, and we remain focused on creating additional value for all of our stakeholders," concluded Mr. Ding.First Quarter 2018 Financial ResultsNetRevenuesNet revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were RMB14,173.0 million (US$2,259.5 million), compared to RMB14,607.6 million and RMB13,640.5 million for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2017, respectively.Net revenues from online games were RMB8,761.2 million (US$1,396.7 million) for the first quarter of 2018, compared to RMB8,004.4 million and RMB10,735.5 million for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2017, respectively. Mobile games accounted for approximately 71.8% of net revenues from online games for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 68.0% and 73.3% for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2017, respectively.Net revenues from e-commerce were RMB3,732.5 million (US$595.0 million) for the first quarter of 2018, compared to RMB4,653.7 million and RMB1,857.3 million for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2017, respectively.Net revenues from advertising services were RMB462.0 million (US$73.7 million) for the first quarter of 2018, compared to RMB736.6 million and RMB445.2 million for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2017, respectively. The top performing advertising verticals in the first quarter of 2018 were real estate, internet services and automobile sectors.Net revenues from e-mail and others were RMB1,217.3 million (US$194.1 million) for the first quarter of 2018, compared to RMB1,213.0 million and RMB602.6 million for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2017, respectively.Gross Profit/(Loss)Gross profit for the first quarter of 2018 was RMB5,953.6 million (US$949.1 million), compared to RMB5,744.6 million and RMB7,483.6 million for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2017, respectively.The year-over-year decrease in online game services gross profit was primarily due to decreased revenue contribution from self-developed mobile games such asOnmyojiand the mobile version ofNew Ghost, partially offset by increased revenue contribution fromKnives OutandChu Liu Xiang. The quarter-over-quarter increase in online game services gross profit was primarily due to the increased revenue contribution fromKnives OutandChu Liu Xiang.The year-over-year increase in e-commerce gross profit was primarily due to the rapid development ofKaola.comandYanxuan.The quarter-over-quarter decrease in advertising services gross profit was primarily due to seasonality.The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter changes in e-mail and others gross profit/loss were primarily due to decreased revenue contribution from certain online platform businesses, which have relatively higher margins, as well as higher recognized costs related to certain copyrights.Gross Profit/ (Loss) MarginGross profit margin for online game services for the first quarter of 2018 was 62.1%, compared to 61.4% and 63.9% for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2017, respectively. The year-over-year decrease in gross profit margin was mainly due to decreased revenue contribution from self-developed mobile games, while certain costs related to the Company's online games segment were fixed.Gross profit margin for e-commerce for the first quarter of 2018 was 9.5%, compared to 7.4% and 13.1% for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2017, respectively. The year-over-year decrease in e-commerce gross profit margin was primarily due to certain sales discounts in the first quarter of 2018 to support the rapid development ofKaola.comandYanxuan. The quarter-over-quarter increase in gross profit margin was primarily due to seasonality as larger-scale promotions and sales discounts typically occur in the fourth quarter of 2017.Gross profit margin for advertising services for the first quarter of 2018 was 59.0%, compared to 71.2% and 57.3% for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2017, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in gross profit margin was mainly due to seasonality.Gross loss margin for e-mail and others for the first quarter of 2018 was 9.9%, compared to gross loss margin of 3.3% and gross profit margin of 20.3% for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2017, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter decreases in gross margin were primarily due to decreased revenue contribution from certain online platform businesses, which have relatively higher gross profit margins, as well as higher recognized costs related to certain copyrights in the first quarter of 2018.Operating ExpensesTotal operating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were RMB4,746.6 million (US$756.7 million), compared to RMB4,317.8 million and RMB2,711.7 million for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2017, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases in operating expenses were mainly due to increased marketing expenditures related to online games and research and development investments, as well as higher staff-related costs. Shipping and handling costs included in selling and marketing expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were RMB325.8 million (US$51.9 million), compared to RMB393.3 million and RMB213.3 million for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2017, respectively.Income TaxesThe Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB282.7 million (US$45.1 million) for the first quarter of 2018, compared to RMB290.4 million and RMB943.0 million for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2017, respectively. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 was 26.0%, compared to 18.2% and 19.0% for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2017, respectively. The changes in the effective tax rate were mainly due to the fact that certain subsidiaries of the Company experienced higher operating losses in the current quarter. The effective tax rate represents certain estimates by the Company as to the tax obligations and benefits applicable to it in each quarter.Net Income After TaxNet income attributable to the Company's shareholders for the first quarter of 2018 totaled RMB751.9 million (US$119.9 million), compared to RMB1.3 billion and RMB3.9 billion for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2017, respectively. Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders for the first quarter of 2018 totaled RMB1.3 billion (US$213.2 million), compared to RMB1.9 billion and RMB4.3 billion for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2017, respectively.During the first quarter of 2018, the Company had a net foreign exchange loss of RMB375.1 million (US$59.8 million), compared to net foreign exchange losses of RMB159.1 million and RMB48.5 million for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2017, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter changes in foreign exchange losses were mainly due to unrealized exchange losses arising from the Company's U.S. dollar-denominated bank deposits and short-term loan balances as the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the RMB fluctuated over the periods.NetEase reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$0.91 each for the first quarter of 2018. The Company reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$1.56 and US$1.55, respectively, for the preceding quarter, and basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$4.76 and US$4.71, respectively, for the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS were US$1.62 and US$1.61, respectively, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$2.28 and US$2.26, respectively, for the preceding quarter, and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$5.26 and US$5.21, respectively, for the first quarter of 2017.Quarterly DividendThe board of directors has approved a dividend of US$0.23 per ADS for the first quarter of 2018, which is expected to be paid on June 8, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on June 1, 2018.NetEase paid a dividend of US$0.38 per ADS for the fourth quarter of 2017 on March 2, 2018.Under the Company's quarterly dividend policy announced on May 13, 2014, quarterly dividends will be set at an amount equivalent to approximately 25% of the Company's anticipated net income after tax in each fiscal quarter. The determination to make dividend distributions and the amount of such distributions in any particular quarter will be made at the discretion of the board of directors and will be based upon the Company's operations and earnings, cash flow, financial condition and other relevant factors.Other InformationAs of March 31, 2018, the Company's total cash and cash equivalents, current and non-current time deposits and short-term investments balance totaled RMB43.5 billion (US$6.9 billion), compared to RMB43.2 billion as of December 31, 2017. Cash flow generated from operating activities was RMB1.9 billion (US$303.7 million) for the first quarter of 2018, compared to RMB3.9 billion and RMB4.0 billion for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2017, respectively.Share Repurchase ProgramOn November 15, 2017, the Company announced that its board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program of up to US$1.0 billion of the Company's outstanding ADSs for a period not to exceed 12 months beginning on November 16, 2017. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had repurchased approximately 1.2 million ADSs for approximately US$376.0 million under this program.Under the terms of the current approved program, NetEase may repurchase its issued and outstanding ADSs in open-market transactions on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. The timing and dollar amount of repurchase transactions will be subject to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 10b-18 requirements. It is also expected that such repurchases will be effected pursuant to a plan in conformity with SEC Rule 10b5-1.  The extent to which NetEase repurchases its ADSs will depend upon a variety of factors, including market conditions, regulatory requirements and other corporate considerations, as determined by NetEase's management team. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.** The United States dollar (US$) amounts disclosed in this press release are presented solely for the convenience of the reader. Translations of amounts from RMB into United States dollars for the convenience of the reader were calculated at the noon buying rate of US$1.00 = RMB6.2726 on March 30, 2018 as set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board. No representation is made that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted into US$ at that rate on March 30, 2018, or at any other certain date. The percentages stated are calculated based on RMB.Change in Segment ReportingEffective in the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company changed its segment disclosure to separately report the financial results of its e-commerce business in light of the significant growth of the revenue contribution from e-commerce to the Company's total consolidated net revenues in 2017. This segment primarily reflects the results of NetEase's two e-commerce platforms,Kaola.comandYanxuan, which were established in January 2015 and April 2016, respectively. The Company now reports four reporting segments: online game services, e-commerce, advertising services, and e-mail and others. This change in segment reporting aligns with the manner in which the Company's operating decision maker ("CODM") currently receives and uses financial information to allocate resources and evaluate the performance of reporting segments. This change in segment presentation does not affect consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of income or consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company retrospectively revised prior period segment information to conform to current period presentation.Impact of the recently adopted major accounting pronouncementsIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)".On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Topic 606, using the modified-retrospective transition approach. Under this approach, the Company applies the new revenue standard on a prospective basis, effective January 1, 2018, and records adjustments to its fiscal 2018 opening balance sheet (as of January 1, 2018) to reflect the cumulative effect of the new revenue standard.The new revenue standard primarily impacts the accounting of the recognition of breakage associated with its unused online points in a personal game account as a result of recording revenue based upon estimates of breakage under the new revenue standard. Under the historical accounting standard, revenue for unused points was not recorded until the points expired. Thus, for unused points, revenue will be recorded earlier under the new standard. The cumulative-effect adjustment includes a reduction of its deferred revenue of approximately RMB81.7 million and a net increase to its retained earnings of approximately RMB27.4 million (net of tax). The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a significant impact on the Company's operating results for the first quarter of 2018 and comparable periods.In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01 (ASU No. 2016-01) "Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities." The Company anticipates that the adoption of the new standard will increase the volatility of its investment income, net, as a result of the remeasurement of its equity investments. The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2018 and RMB38.2 million of accumulated other comprehensive income for the Company's available-for-sale equity securities that existed as of December 31, 2017 was reclassified into retained earnings upon the adoption. For equity investments without readily determinable fair value, the Company elected to measure them at their costs minus impairment (if any), plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investments of the same issuer. In the first quarter of 2018, the Company recorded a net investment loss of RMB56.3 million related to the equity investments with readily determinable fair value. Given that there were no material observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investments of the same issuer, the Company did not record any changes to the carrying value of equity investments without readily determinable fair value in the first quarter of 2018.In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18 "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash". The guidance requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown in the statement of cash flows. The standard should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2018. Pursuant to the new guidance, the net change of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash decreased RMB360.0 million and increased RMB13.8 million for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2017, respectively, compared to the amounts presented under previous guidance.Conference CallNetEase's management team will host a teleconference call with simultaneous webcast at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 16, 2018 (Beijing/Hong Kong Time: 9:00 a.m., Thursday, May 17, 2018).

The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP").NetEase defines non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders as net income attributable to the Company's shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders enables NetEase's management to assess its operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses, which are non-cash charges. NetEase believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating the Company's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP financial measure facilitates investors' assessment of its operating performance.Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders is that it does not reflect all items of expense that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses have been and may continue to be incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. See "Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results" at the end of this press release. NetEase encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.Contact for Media and Investors:Margaret ShiNetEase,

Continue reading NetEase Reports First Quarter 2018 Unaudited Financial ResultsBEIJING,   NetEase, Inc.

Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders was RMB1.3 billion (US$213.2 million).[2]• Diluted earnings per ADS were US$0.91; non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS were US$1.61.First Quarter 2018 and Recent Operational Highlights• Progressed monetization of Knives Out and Terminator 2: Judgment Day, mainly through the sale of a range of virtual items. International appeal of Knives Out continues to be strong, consistently topping the charts in Japan.• Fortified leading mobile portfolio with the introduction of a number of new games including blockbuster hit Chu Liu Xiang in January and Identity V and Shadowverse in April. Identity V is NetEase's first asymmetrical battle arena (ABA) game, achieving over 10 million active users in its first week. Shadowverse is a collectible card game (CCG) licensed from Cygames.• Maintained popularity for PC-client and mobile flagship titles including Fantasy Westward Journey, Westward Journey Online, New Ghost, Onmyoji and Invincible.• Accumulated over 60 million registered Minecraft users in China and introduced an open platform for third party developers.• Furthered strategic diversification initiatives with the continued development of upcoming games including manga-based player versus player (PvP) game QwQ and Chinese-style CCG Ancient Nocturne.• Solidified leadership in cross-border and private label e-commerce markets through enhanced customer services and closer partnerships with international brands, yielding continued strong growth momentum and greater economy of scale. We believe the advancements we made across our business segments in the first quarter put us on track for a successful year. We are excited by the longevity of and player loyalty to our flagship games, the strong performances of our new titles launched in the first quarter, and the continued rapid expansion of our e-commerce business, as well as the healthy development of our advertising services,  said Mr. William Ding, Chief Executive Officer and Director of NetEase. We continue to dominate China's MMORPG market with our new chart-topping title, Chu Liu Xiang, which modernized MMOPRG gameplay,  Mr. Ding continued.  Our strategy to introduce games in non-MMORPG genres is also beginning to bear fruit. Monetization for Knives Out and Terminator 2 is ramping up smoothly, and Identity V, our very first ABA game, attracted a huge fan base immediately following its launch in April. We are committed to executing on our game diversification strategy, and we are becoming more adept at reaching non-MMORPG users. As we work to expand our award-winning portfolio of online games, we expect our marketing costs will normalize going forward, compared with our marketing expenses in the first quarter of 2018. For 2018, we will work to ensure that each of our business lines continues to thrive, and we remain focused on creating additional value for all of our stakeholders,  concluded Mr. Ding.First Quarter 2018 Financial ResultsNetRevenuesNet revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were RMB14,173.0 million (US$2,259.5 million), compared to RMB14,607.6 million and RMB13,640.5 million for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2017, respectively.Net revenues from online games were RMB8,761.2 million (US$1,396.7 million) for the first quarter of 2018, compared to RMB8,004.4 million and RMB10,735.5 million for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2017, respectively. Mobile games accounted for approximately 71.8% of net revenues from online games for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 68.0% and 73.3% for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2017, respectively.Net revenues from e-commerce were RMB3,732.5 million (US$595.0 million) for the first quarter of 2018, compared to RMB4,653.7 million and RMB1,857.3 million for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2017, respectively.Net revenues from advertising services were RMB462.0 million (US$73.7 million) for the first quarter of 2018, compared to RMB736.6 million and RMB445.2 million for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2017, respectively. The top performing advertising verticals in the first quarter of 2018 were real estate, internet services and automobile sectors.Net revenues from e-mail and others were RMB1,217.3 million (US$194.1 million) for the first quarter of 2018, compared to RMB1,213.0 million and RMB602.6 million for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2017, respectively.Gross Profit/(Loss)Gross profit for the first quarter of 2018 was RMB5,953.6 million (US$949.1 million), compared to RMB5,744.6 million and RMB7,483.6 million for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2017, respectively.The year-over-year decrease in online game services gross profit was primarily due to decreased revenue contribution from self-developed mobile games such as Onmyoji and the mobile version of New Ghost, partially offset by increased revenue contribution from Knives Out and Chu Liu Xiang. The quarter-over-quarter increase in online game services gross profit was primarily due to the increased revenue contribution from Knives Out and Chu Liu Xiang.The year-over-year increase in e-commerce gross profit was primarily due to the rapid development of Kaola.com and Yanxuan.The quarter-over-quarter decrease in advertising services gross profit was primarily due to seasonality.The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter changes in e-mail and others gross profit/loss were primarily due to decreased revenue contribution from certain online platform businesses, which have relatively higher margins, as well as higher recognized costs related to certain copyrights.Gross Profit/ (Loss) MarginGross profit margin for online game services for the first quarter of 2018 was 62.1%, compared to 61.4% and 63.9% for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2017, respectively. The year-over-year decrease in gross profit margin was mainly due to decreased revenue contribution from self-developed mobile games, while certain costs related to the Company's online games segment were fixed.Gross profit margin for e-commerce for the first quarter of 2018 was 9.5%, compared to 7.4% and 13.1% for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2017, respectively. The year-over-year decrease in e-commerce gross profit margin was primarily due to certain sales discounts in the first quarter of 2018 to support the rapid development of Kaola.com and Yanxuan. The quarter-over-quarter increase in gross profit margin was primarily due to seasonality as larger-scale promotions and sales discounts typically occur in the fourth quarter of 2017.Gross profit margin for advertising services for the first quarter of 2018 was 59.0%, compared to 71.2% and 57.3% for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2017, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in gross profit margin was mainly due to seasonality.Gross loss margin for e-mail and others for the first quarter of 2018 was 9.9%, compared to gross loss margin of 3.3% and gross profit margin of 20.3% for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2017, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter decreases in gross margin were primarily due to decreased revenue contribution from certain online platform businesses, which have relatively higher gross profit margins, as well as higher recognized costs related to certain copyrights in the first quarter of 2018.Operating ExpensesTotal operating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were RMB4,746.6 million (US$756.7 million), compared to RMB4,317.8 million and RMB2,711.7 million for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2017, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases in operating expenses were mainly due to increased marketing expenditures related to online games and research and development investments, as well as higher staff-related costs. Shipping and handling costs included in selling and marketing expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were RMB325.8 million (US$51.9 million), compared to RMB393.3 million and RMB213.3 million for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2017, respectively.Income TaxesThe Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB282.7 million (US$45.1 million) for the first quarter of 2018, compared to RMB290.4 million and RMB943.0 million for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2017, respectively. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 was 26.0%, compared to 18.2% and 19.0% for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2017, respectively. The changes in the effective tax rate were mainly due to the fact that certain subsidiaries of the Company experienced higher operating losses in the current quarter. The effective tax rate represents certain estimates by the Company as to the tax obligations and benefits applicable to it in each quarter.Net Income After TaxNet income attributable to the Company's shareholders for the first quarter of 2018 totaled RMB751.9 million (US$119.9 million), compared to RMB1.3 billion and RMB3.9 billion for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2017, respectively. Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders for the first quarter of 2018 totaled RMB1.3 billion (US$213.2 million), compared to RMB1.9 billion and RMB4.3 billion for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2017, respectively.During the first quarter of 2018, the Company had a net foreign exchange loss of RMB375.1 million (US$59.8 million), compared to net foreign exchange losses of RMB159.1 million and RMB48.5 million for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2017, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter changes in foreign exchange losses were mainly due to unrealized exchange losses arising from the Company's U.S. dollar-denominated bank deposits and short-term loan balances as the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the RMB fluctuated over the periods.NetEase reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$0.91 each for the first quarter of 2018. The Company reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$1.56 and US$1.55, respectively, for the preceding quarter, and basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$4.76 and US$4.71, respectively, for the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS were US$1.62 and US$1.61, respectively, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$2.28 and US$2.26, respectively, for the preceding quarter, and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$5.26 and US$5.21, respectively, for the first quarter of 2017.QuarterlyDividendThe board of directors has approved a dividend of US$0.23 per ADS for the first quarter of 2018, which is expected to be paid on June 8, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on June 1, 2018.NetEase paid a dividend of US$0.38 per ADS for the fourth quarter of 2017 on March 2, 2018.Under the Company's quarterly dividend policy announced on May 13, 2014, quarterly dividends will be set at an amount equivalent to approximately 25% of the Company's anticipated net income after tax in each fiscal quarter. The determination to make dividend distributions and the amount of such distributions in any particular quarter will be made at the discretion of the board of directors and will be based upon the Company's operations and earnings, cash flow, financial condition and other relevant factors.Other InformationAs of March 31, 2018, the Company's total cash and cash equivalents, current and non-current time deposits and short-term investments balance totaled RMB43.5 billion (US$6.9 billion), compared to RMB43.2 billion as of December 31, 2017. Cash flow generated from operating activities was RMB1.9 billion (US$303.7 million) for the first quarter of 2018, compared to RMB3.9 billion and RMB4.0 billion for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2017, respectively.Share Repurchase ProgramOn November 15, 2017, the Company announced that its board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program of up to US$1.0 billion of the Company's outstanding ADSs for a period not to exceed 12 months beginning on November 16, 2017. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had repurchased approximately 1.2 million ADSs for approximately US$376.0 million under this program.Under the terms of the current approved program, NetEase may repurchase its issued and outstanding ADSs in open-market transactions on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. The timing and dollar amount of repurchase transactions will be subject to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 10b-18 requirements. It is also expected that such repurchases will be effected pursuant to a plan in conformity with SEC Rule 10b5-1.  The extent to which NetEase repurchases its ADSs will depend upon a variety of factors, including market conditions, regulatory requirements and other corporate considerations, as determined by NetEase's management team. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.** The United States dollar (US$) amounts disclosed in this press release are presented solely for the convenience of the reader. Translations of amounts from RMB into United States dollars for the convenience of the reader were calculated at the noon buying rate of US$1.00 = RMB6.2726 on March 30, 2018 as set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board.

The percentages stated are calculated based on RMB.Change in Segment ReportingEffective in the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company changed its segment disclosure to separately report the financial results of its e-commerce business in light of the significant growth of the revenue contribution from e-commerce to the Company's total consolidated net revenues in 2017. This segment primarily reflects the results of NetEase's two e-commerce platforms, Kaola.com and Yanxuan, which were established in January 2015 and April 2016, respectively. The Company now reports four reporting segments: online game services, e-commerce, advertising services, and e-mail and others. This change in segment reporting aligns with the manner in which the Company's operating decision maker ( CODM ) currently receives and uses financial information to allocate resources and evaluate the performance of reporting segments. This change in segment presentation does not affect consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of income or consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company retrospectively revised prior period segment information to conform to current period presentation.Impact of the recently adopted major accounting pronouncementsIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) .On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Topic 606, using the modified-retrospective transition approach. Under this approach, the Company applies the new revenue standard on a prospective basis, effective January 1, 2018, and records adjustments to its fiscal 2018 opening balance sheet (as of January 1, 2018) to reflect the cumulative effect of the new revenue standard.The new revenue standard primarily impacts the accounting of the recognition of breakage associated with its unused online points in a personal game account as a result of recording revenue based upon estimates of breakage under the new revenue standard. Under the historical accounting standard, revenue for unused points was not recorded until the points expired. Thus, for unused points, revenue will be recorded earlier under the new standard. The cumulative-effect adjustment includes a reduction of its deferred revenue of approximately RMB81.7 million and a net increase to its retained earnings of approximately RMB27.4 million (net of tax). The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a significant impact on the Company's operating results for the first quarter of 2018 and comparable periods.In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01 (ASU No. 2016-01)  Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.  The Company anticipates that the adoption of the new standard will increase the volatility of its investment income, net, as a result of the remeasurement of its equity investments. The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2018 and RMB38.2 million of accumulated other comprehensive income for the Company's available-for-sale equity securities that existed as of December 31, 2017 was reclassified into retained earnings upon the adoption. For equity investments without readily determinable fair value, the Company elected to measure them at their costs minus impairment (if any), plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investments of the same issuer. In the first quarter of 2018, the Company recorded a net investment loss of RMB56.3 million related to the equity investments with readily determinable fair value. Given that there were no material observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investments of the same issuer, the Company did not record any changes to the carrying value of equity investments without readily determinable fair value in the first quarter of 2018.In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash . The guidance requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown in the statement of cash flows. The standard should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2018. Pursuant to the new guidance, the net change of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash decreased RMB360.0 million and increased RMB13.8 million for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2017, respectively, compared to the amounts presented under previous guidance.Conference CallNetEase's management team will host a teleconference call with simultaneous webcast at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 16, 2018 (Beijing/Hong Kong Time: 9:00 a.m., Thursday, May 17, 2018).

These statements are made under the  safe harbor  provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these forward-looking statements by terminology such as  will,   expects,   anticipates,   future,   intends,   plans,   believes,   estimates  and similar statements. The accuracy of these statements may be impacted by a number of business risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or anticipated, including risks related to: the risk that the online game market will not continue to grow or that NetEase will not be able to maintain its leading position in that market, which could occur if, for example, its new online games or expansion packs and other improvements to its existing games do not become as popular as management anticipates; the ability of NetEase to successfully expand its mobile internet offerings; the ability of NetEase to effectively market its games and other services and achieve a positive return on its marketing expenditures; the risk that NetEase's affiliates will not be able to continue operating Minecraft, World of Warcraft®, StarCraft® II, Hearthstone®, Diablo® III: Reaper of Souls , Heroes of the Storm®, Overwatch® or other games licensed by it for a period of time or permanently due to possible governmental actions or the risk that such games will not be popular with game players in China; the risk that changes in Chinese government regulation of the online game market and the market for NetEase's e-commerce businesses may limit future growth of NetEase's revenues or cause revenues to decline; competition in the online advertising business and the risk that investments by NetEase in its content and services may not increase the appeal of the NetEase websites among internet users or result in increased advertising revenues; the risk that NetEase may not be able to continuously develop new and creative online services, including its ability to maintain and enhance the popularity of its e-mail, mobile and e-commerce businesses and develop attractive mobile games; the risk that NetEase will not be able to control its expenses in future periods; competition in NetEase's existing and potential markets; governmental uncertainties (including possible changes in the effective tax rates applicable to NetEase and its subsidiaries and affiliates and the ability of NetEase to receive and maintain approvals of the preferential tax treatments and general competition and price pressures in the marketplace); the risk that fluctuations in the value of the Renminbi with respect to other currencies could adversely affect NetEase's business and financial results; and other risks outlined in NetEase's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. NetEase does not undertake any obligation to update this forward-looking information, except as required under the applicable law.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresNetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS, as supplemental metrics in reviewing and assessing its operating performance and formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ).NetEase defines non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders as net income attributable to the Company's shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders enables NetEase's management to assess its operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses, which are non-cash charges. NetEase believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating the Company's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP financial measure facilitates investors' assessment of its operating performance.Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders is that it does not reflect all items of expense that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses have been and may continue to be incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. See  Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results  at the end of this press release. NetEase encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.Contact for Media and Investors:Margaret Shi NetEase, Inc.ir@service.netease.comTel: (+86) 571-8985-2955Brandi PiacenteInvestor Relationsbrandi@corp.netease.comTel: (+1) 212-481-2050NETEASE, INC.NOTES TOUNAUDITEDFINANCIALINFORMATIONNote 1: The conversion of Renminbi (RMB) into United States dollars (USD) is based on the noon buying rate of USD1.00 = RMB6.2726 on the last trading day of March 2018 (March 30, 2018) as set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board.Note 2: Share-based compensation cost reported in the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income is set out as follows in RMB and USD (in thousands):See Campaign:http://corp.netease.com/Contact Information:NetEase, Inc.Tags:,            Wire,            Disclosure Newswire,            Asia,            EnglishLoad-Date: May 29, 2018End of Document

Trade War Is an Opportunity For Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock InvestorsUSNEWS.comJune 20, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 U.S. News & World Report All Rights ReservedSection: INVESTING; Stock Market News; Vol.; No.Length: 543 wordsByline: Wayne DugganHighlight: Apple investors should expect a timely resolution to the trade war.BodyApple, Inc. (Nasdaq:            AAPL) stock is down 3.3 percent in a week on concerns that the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China could take a bite out of Apple's iPhone sales. Apple may have more exposure to the China market than its mega-cap U.S. tech peers, but analysts still see any trade war-related weakness in AAPL stock as a buying opportunity for long-term investors. [See: The 10 Most Valuable Tech Companies in the World.]After the U.S. and China exchanged new sets of tariffs on $50 billion of each other's goods last week, President Donald Trump said on Monday that he is exploring the possibility of adding new tariffs on another $200 billion of Chinese goods in coming weeks. Apple investors are understandably concerned China will single out Apple if the trade war escalates further. Last year, roughly 20 percent of Apple's total revenue came from China, where it sold more than 41 million iPhones. Apple also operates roughly 40 stores in China. In addition to tariffs, Apple could face potential supply chain disruptions if the Chinese government chooses to restrict its business with suppliers. Taiwanese company Foxconn assembles iPhones in China as well. Fortunately for Apple, analysts say Trump is under immense pressure not to let the trade war drag on too long. Height Capital Markets analyst Clayton Allen says Republicans in Congress will have little patience for negative trade war headlines that could potentially undermine their message to voters highlighting a successful tax reform and a booming economy heading into the midterm elections in November. "China's President Xi Jinping, facing no significant domestic political threat following the announcement that he will serve as president for life, can outlast Trump, who must contend with the backlash from farmers and other groups negatively impacted by a trade war," Allen says. [See: 9 Ways to Invest in Red-Hot Tech Stocks.]With Trump under pressure to bring the trade war to a timely end before November, GBH Insights head of technology research Daniel Ives says long-term investors should be thinking about the future. "We would be buyers of Apple/FANG brethren, as we believe the underlying fundamentals and healthy consumer and IT spending environment should drive further multiple/earnings expansion as the Street digests the unparalleled growth dynamics for tech stocks set to play out over the next six to 12 months," Ives says. GBH Insights has a "highly attractive" rating and $200 price target for AAPL stock. Wayne Duggan is a freelance investment strategy reporter with a focus on energy and emerging market stocks.

U.S. farmers fear a crippling trade warThe Tartan: Carnegie Mellon UniversityApril 22, 2018 SundayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: FORUM FORUM; Pg. 1Length: 735 wordsByline: Madeline KimBodyEver since Donald Trump announced he was running for president, he remained skeptical of the status quo of trade. His "America first" vision involved pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and hefty negotiations with the North American Free Trade Agreement . He pledged to declare China a currency manipulator. Trump claimed that ultimately, he can bring back jobs to America. However, the people who Trump appealed to and promised to help are now becoming fearful for a trade war that will ultimately hurt them.Earlier this month, Trump threatened to burden Chinese goods with a hefty $100 billion tariff. Consequently, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, on CNBC, recognized the "potential of a trade war," which led to Dow Jones plummeting. The Chinese government responded to the threat of a tariff by saying that it would "fight at any cost." This included a proposed retaliatory tariff on soybeans, corn, and other row crops, biting at the farmers here in the U.S.Even those who believe that the U.S. is being taken advantage of by unfair trade policies and demand change are wary of the potential trade war. Farmers, especially, are beginning to fear a trade war and what that would mean for them. Already, the threat of a trade war was enough for the price of soybeans to plummet. If tensions were to escalate to a trade war, Americans should anticipate higher price tags on imported goods. Conversely, struggling farms would be slashing prices to try to make ends meet, if they can even stay in business at all.As bleak as some farmers' futures may be, not all have lost faith in Trump or are completely disenchanted. Some perceive the threat of a tariff to be a gateway for negotiations. A threat would catch attention; striking a deal would come after. Some others do believe that he acted harshly, but regardless of the possible motives, there is a theme that ties all the speculations: hope that Trump would be a man for the working class. After being left unsatisfied during the Obama administration, farmers wanted someone who would bring something different and who would change the status quo. Clinton would deliver no change; Trump, on the other hand, would.Unfortunately, the change that was anticipated was not the fear of a trade war.Yes, the U.S. has a trade deficit of approximately $375 billion. However, slapping on tariffs is not the way to go. This resonates with the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act during Herbert Hoover's term. The Great Depression made isolationism appealing, and the act appeared to be a potential solution to pull the U.S. out of the depression and protect U.S. farmers against agricultural imports. However, this tariff led to the over-production of agricultural goods, causing farmers to drop their prices. Farmers cannot indefinitely drop prices; once they pass the break-even point, selling their crops would cause them to lose profit, not gain profit, leading them to go out of business. More than a thousand economists urged Hoover to veto the bill, but the bill was signed and the depression was further exacerbated.Just as it was in the 1930s, there is not much room for optimism in Trump's threat to burden China with tariffs. If the mere threat of a tariff was enough to trigger a change in prices in soybeans, it is hard to imagine the reach of actual tariffs implemented. Additionally, this would create further tensions with China, something the U.S. cannot afford to do.There is a significant reason Trump is reluctant to explicitly label China a currency manipulator despite the fact he promised to do so on the campaign trail. In 2017, Trump tweeted, "Why would I call China a currency manipulator when they are working with us on the North Korean problem?" If the U.S. has strained relations with China, Trump would have a harder time pressuring North Korea to de-nuclearize. Given the potential stakes and unpredictable behaviors of North Korea, Trump cannot ruthlessly provoke China for possible personal gain.Of course, no single person or political figure can singlehandedly start a trade war, and President Trump is no exception. However, trade is essential to the U.S. economy and President Trump does have power and influence. If he truly wants to put "America first," perhaps he should reconsider provoking a major trade partner and instead create policies that would actually benefit the working class and those he promised to help.Load-Date: April 22, 2018End of Document

Senior year is hard enough with graduation looming and the future standing right there waiting to smack you around.You fret over your dress. If it goes viral, you want it to be in a good way.It didn't work like that for Keziah Daum. The 18-year-old at Woods Cross High School in the northern suburbs of Salt Lake City found herself too intimately engaged in the broad reach and instantaneous judgment of social media.We know about Keziah today because of what she wore to prom. It was a cheongsam.Yeah, I had to look up the word. Fortunately, the good people at Merriam-Webster know it to be "a dress of southern Chinese origin with a slit skirt and a mandarin collar."Here's the thing: Keziah is not Chinese. And quicker than you can spell I-N-D-I-G-N-A-T-I-O-N, the teenager got accused of a cultural offense.Some saw her picture on Twitter and declared the prom attire to be a rude appropriation of Chinese heritage.Critical tweets rained down upon the Wasatch Mountains, one getting almost 179,000 likes. Keziah must have been stunned.After picking out the dress at a vintage clothing store, the student, in a bid for individuality, felt elated. After the controversy ... deflated.She rallied to a defense, insisting she meant no harm. It's a dress, she said, "and it's beautiful."Wildfires of this sort begin with the most unlikely spark. Like countless other kids in recent weeks, she posted a prom picture online. She happened to be the one who garnered headlines around the world for insensitivity.Not exactly everywhere in the world. The South China Morning Post, an international newspaper headquartered in Hong Kong, carried the story and compiled social media comments praising the Utah girl."Very elegant and beautiful!" one person wrote. "I suggest the Chinese government, state television or a fashion company invite her to China to display her cheongsam!"(In truth, this came at the end of a tumultuous senior year. Last fall, Woods Cross High School also gained notoriety for having its student body chant "Build The Wall" during a football game with nearby Bountiful High. It meant to encourage a defensive stand but instead got wrapped in a political context. Students there should know how these things go.)With six decades of experience as a white male, I admit being a poor judge of what might be cultural appropriation.Shakespeare robbed from the writings of Plutarch. Was he a Greek appropriator or a Greek appreciator?The Rolling Stones stole from American blues masters. They gave credit but kept all the money.I know that if Keziah had dressed for the prom like a Native American fancy dancer, it would have gotten some backlash.On the other hand, our nation's capital has an NFL team with a racist nickname and a president who refers to a U.S. senator as Pocahontas, so you never really know the bar is set with that.Put in a buffet line, I will load up on General Tso's chicken. I also love pizza. And a good chimichanga. (Let's keep that quiet; my cardiologist doesn't need to know.)Are these misdemeanors of cultural theft?Another recent story featured a university library installing a small booth where students, pushed to the brink by final exams, could go for a quick release of tensions.It was dubbed a "cry closet." It was located at the University of Utah.Without being insensitive, or meaning to give offense in any way, I must ask the question.What is going on with Utah these days?Ken Newton's column runs on Tuesday and Sunday.

Asian Shares Mixed In Cautious TradeCE Noticias Financieras EnglishApril 9, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 446 wordsBody       Asian stocks were trading mixed in cautious trade on Monday despite steep declines on Wall Street Friday after U.S. jobs data for March disappointed investors and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell backed a gradual approach to rate hikes unless events change. The U.S. Labor Department said non-farm payroll employment rose by 103,000 jobs in March after spiking by an upwardly revised 326,000 jobs in February. Economists had expected an increase of about 193,000 jobs. The jobless rate came in at 4.1 percent in the month, unchanged from the five previous months. Trade worries persist after China's official news agency Xinhua said on Saturday that US "waywardness" in its tit-for-tat tariff exchange will only end in defeat.  Meanwhile, "China will take down its trade barriers because it is the right thing to do," Trump said in a tweet on Sunday. China's Shanghai Composite index was down about 0.2 percent as investors waited Chinese President Xi Jinping's Tuesday speech at the Boao Forum for directional cues. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was rising 0.6 percent. Japan's Nikkei index was marginally higher in lackluster trade as the yen held steady against the dollar after the release of current account balance data for February.  Japan had a current account surplus of 2.076 trillion yen in February, the Ministry of Finance said. That was shy of expectations for a surplus of 2.196 trillion yen following the 607.4 billion yen surplus in January. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was little changed in choppy trade, with banks and miners underperforming. New Zealand's S&P/NZX 50 index was marginally lower. South Korea's Kospi average rose 0.2 percent, led by technology stocks. Market heavyweight Samsung Electronics was up 1.3 percent while Hyundai Motor and Posco lost 1-2 percent.  U.S. stocks fell sharply on Friday after closing higher for three straight sessions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the tech-heavy Nasdaq slid around 2.3 percent each and the S&P 500 tumbled 2.2 percent on renewed trade-war worries after President Donald Trump threatened to impose $100 billion of additional tariffs on Chinese imports and the Chinese government declared it would retaliate to new tariffs "with force and without hesitation." European markets ended Friday's session lower after the release of downbeat U.S. jobs data for March and amid rising tensions between the United States and China. The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index eased 0.4 percent. The German DAX dropped half a percent, France's CAC 40 index shed 0.4 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 slipped 0.2 percent. Oil prices rose in Asian trading after falling more than 2 percent on Friday.        Load-Date: April 9, 2018End of Document

But for a significant number of American evangelicals, that's not a bug - that's a feature."Stephen Colbert:Trump celebrated "Mother's Day in the traditional way: a trade war with China."Stephen Colbert:Trump's effort to help the Chinese company ZTE "is directly opposed to everything he's said. I can't wait for his next tweet: 'Have you heard about all the problems in Mexico? We've got to let those good people into our country. Build the ramp!'"Stephen Colbert:"Make no mistake, ZTE is no friend of the US. In fact, the FBI, CIA, and NSA have publicly accused the company of allowing its devices to be used by the Chinese government to spy on Americans. And as an American, I do not want some Chinese company spying on me. I want Facebook doing it."Stephen Colbert:"ZTE is only in financial trouble because they admitted to making illegal shipments to Iran and North Korea. So the Trump Administration banned American companies from selling it components. You can't just reverse your own penalty. 'Sir, I pulled you over because you were driving 90 in a school zone. But you seem upset, so want to drive my car? It's got lights.'"Stephen Colbert:"According to the US Ambassador to Israel, the act of moving the embassy sends the message to Israel that, 'you are not alone.' It's true, Israel isn't alone. There's a bunch of other people who live there, too. They're the angry ones."Stephen Colbert:"The world's on fire, but at least we know Donald Trump is getting advice from the best people. For example, Fox News host and hurtful Irish stereotype Sean Hannity."Jimmy Fallon:"I saw that President Trump made a Mother's Day video where he called his mom a great person, really warm and really smart, which can only mean one thing - Trump was adopted."Jimmy Fallon:"Trump released a video message for Mother's Day where he called his mom warm, but also tough. Then he released another video where he said the same thing about thin-crust pizza."James Corden:"The highest court in the land has struck down a federal law that banned sports gambling. So now it's going to be legal to bet on sports. ... This is all part of Trump's new economic initiative, 'A Failed Casino For Every State.'"James Corden:"President Trump is still trying to work out a trade deal with China. Yesterday on Twitter, Trump tried to reassure Americans that the United States would work out a deal, writing, 'Be cool, I will all work out!' Be cool? What are his next words of wisdom? Chillax? If it doesn't work out with China, no biggie. Either way, it'll be sick."James Corden:"According to a new article, most weeknights Donald Trump and Fox News host Sean Hannity have a bedtime phone call with each other. Just when you thought Trump couldn't be more in love with Fox News. You just know they end every phone call like, 'You hang up first, Sean.' 'No, you hang up first. 'Well, you didn't hang up either!'"Seth Meters:"White House senior adviser Jared Kushner spoke today at the opening of the new US Embassy in Jerusalem. It's great practice for Kushner because next week, he has to do an oral report in Social Studies."Seth Meyers:"During his speech today, Jared Kushner credited President Trump for recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.

The businesses is escalating investment in R&D and internationalisation as part of its growth plans.NISCO has a total asset of 50 billion RMB (~6 billion in GBP). In 2016 NISCO achieved an operating income of 50.2 billion RMB and their total profit in 2016 reached 1.152 billion RMB.On 18 May, at a special ceremony in China marking the 60th anniversary of NISCO - with University of Leicester delegates in attendance - it will be announced that a joint NISCO-UK Research Institute is to be established at the University of Leicester in the Department of Engineering.The Chair of NISCO Board, Yixin Huang, from NISCO said: "A NISCO branded Research Centre is to be established at the University of Leicester. The institute will focus on research and development activities in a number of areas where the University of Leicester's expertise can be deployed in areas of mutual interest. The Institute will be jointly supported by NISCO and the University to support research and potential collaboration with external partners in the UK and Europe."Professor Hong Dong, Professor of Materials Engineering at the University and Research Chair of the Royal Academy of Engineering is the driving force for the new Centre.He said: "This is a tremendous coup for the University bringing our world-renowned expertise to bear on international industrial processes for metal processing and production. The Research Centre will be supported by NISCO at pound sterling400,000 per annum over an initial period of 5 years. The University of Leicester will co invest through non-financial contributions."It will provide a focal point for industrial partnerships conferring significant benefits to the partner including preferential industrial access to equipment; a defined quota of post-graduate student projects; prominent branding of the centre within engineering and wider promotion. Leicester will benefit from collaborative research opportunities, research impact, publications and international profile."The technology focus of the NISCO UK Research Centre will be:* Low Carbon Manufacture* Novel Manufacture (Robotics, AI, Sensing)* Novel Casting Technology* New Metallic MaterialsProfessor Dong said the joint NISCO-UK Research Institute would:* Conduct the sponsored R&D projects from NISCO. These would be open to all UK universities and research organisations through a bidding process* Within 5 years of operation, NISCO will sponsor research projects with a total value over pound sterling2 million* Areas of R&D activities: (1) new materials, (2) intelligent manufacturing and allied technologies, Energy conservation & environmental protection in manufacturingNISCO owns the supporting capacity of 8.5 million tons of steel annually including the production capacity of its key product plate (coil) covering more than 3 million tons per year with integration of iron ore mining and dressing, iron making, steel making, steel rolling and steel processing.Professor Dong added: "The Centre will exploit UK's research strengths in metallic materials, manufacturing and informatics, and will deliver funded, high quality, high impact collaborative research. We aim to achieve world leading status in the area of metallic materials and advanced manufacturing. By developing patents and translating technologies for adoption by NISCO we will create an excellent research environment and become world leaders in our field."The Centre's Collaborative jointly funded by Innovate UK and Chinese Government has also already announced funding of pound sterling500K to develop an innovate "Super slab" technology to produce extra thick casting steel slabs for use in harsh environments with applications for wind turbines and marine environments.A NISCO delegation has already visited the University and now an announcement is to be made on 18 May in Nanjing, along the Yangtze River in China. The event will be attended by Professor Dong along with Professor Paul Monks, Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Science & Engineering.Professor Monks said: "Applying cutting-edge technological innovation to the next generation of materials is critical to a whole range of real-world problems from medicine to buildings. The NISCO centre will develop new metallic materials and next generation manufacturing methodology. It is exciting to be working in a global partnership bringing together the best of UK and China together. This will drive in the longer term jobs and growth in both China and the UK."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6293248 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: May 17, 2018End of Document

COMMERCE SECRETARY WILBUR ROSS, REMARKS JUNE 12, 2018, BEFORE THE NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION SPECTRUM POLICY SYMPOSIUM, NATIONAL PRESS CLUB, WASHINGTON, D.C.States News ServiceJune 12, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1041 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by U.S. Department of Commerce National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA):June 12, 2018Thank you, David, for your kind introduction. Thanks to all of you for attending this first Spectrum Policy Symposium. And thank you, panelists and speakers, for your commitment to advancing our high-tech industries like telecommunications and commercialization of space.The United States leads the world in these industries, and the Commerce Department is committed to fortifying that leadership.The U.S. wireless industry supports more than 4.7 million American jobs and contributes almost a half-a-trillion dollars $475 billion annually to the economy.But we cannot be complacent. While the United States leads the world in the application of 4G wireless technology, China and South Korea are trying hard to position themselves to dominate the next generation of 5G.China is shaping up to be the biggest 5G market by 2022, and the Chinese government has targeted 5G to develop its indigenous industry and dominate global export markets. But, as you know from the recent publicity surrounding ZTE, they do not yet themselves have all of the necessary technology.It is estimated that 5G could create up to 3 million new American jobs, and generate $500 billion a year in economic growth. That would be a 2.5 percentage point increase in our GDP.The first 5G phones should be ready in 2019, and all four nationwide mobile operators in the United States (ATandT, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon) are expected to be generating 5G service revenues of at least $1 billion in the U.S. by the end of next year. This will be a major milestone for our wireless industry; and we are working at creating the conditions for 5G to prosper here.We understand the importance of a sound spectrum policy to accelerate 5G growth. That is why we want to hear from all of you as policymakers and leaders, inside and outside of government about the spectrum needed for 5G, and for American companies to be successful in both domestic and global markets. This includes the satellite industry, as new technologies, including those powering non-geostationary constellations, promise to support widespread connectivity.On the government side, we are dedicated to ensuring that NASA, DOD, FAA, NOAA, the intelligence community, and other agencies have access to the spectrum needed to support their missions to protect the public, foster economic activity, and advance our scientific enterprises.Across all of these areas, our international efforts are critical. The Commerce Department engages actively in the international forums that determine global spectrum allocations, set technical standards, and develop new technologies.NTIA represents the federal government's positions on spectrum issues at the International Telecommunication Union's World Radiocommunication Conferences, which occur every three to four years. These conferences determine global spectrum allocations, and the processes to coordinate orbits of satellites through a treaty-level agreement.Our staff at NTIA is currently working with other federal agencies and the FCC to develop negotiating positions for the next WRC, which is scheduled for the fall of 2019.As we engage with the ITU, I ask that you support the election of Doreen Bogdan-Martin, a former NTIA staffer, as the ITU's Development-Sector Director. Our Administration has put its full support behind Doreen. She is well versed in U.S. policy objectives, and has championed our pro-growth and pro-competition satellite policies. If elected, she would be the first woman on the ITU's senior executive team.On May 24, President Trump issued a directive aimed at taking additional steps to maintain and extend the nation's global leadership in commercial space activity. Space is already a $340 billion business and may soon be a trillion-dollar industry.To realize our commercial space potential, our government needs to make it easier for the private sector to achieve success. We are already seeing improvements. Last year, Commerce signed an agreement with the Departments of Defense, State, Interior, and the Director of National Intelligence, to reduce wait times on satellite remote sensing applications. The agreement sets more definitive timelines for license decisions, and elevates decision-making to senior government officials if deadlines are not met. Before its implementation, the average time to receive a NOAA license was 210 days. Now, thanks to these improvements, NOAA estimates the average time to grant licenses has been reduced by more than 50 percent, to an average of 91 days.This brings me to the Space Council's initiative to create a "one-stop shop" at the Commerce Department for space commerce. The Department is creating a new Space Administration within the Office of the Secretary, and is repositioning and consolidating its space commerce functions under my direct supervision.This office will create a streamlined, central interface at the Department for industry needs relating to remote sensing, export controls, spectrum concerns, trade promotion, space traffic management, and space situational awareness, to name a few.The Office of Space Commerce, and the Commercial Remote Sensing Regulatory Affairs Office both currently housed in NOAA are being elevated to the new Space Administration. We will also soon name a Director of the Office of Space Commerce, a position that has been vacant for almost 10 years.Our ultimate objective is to provide the space commerce industry with a single place within the federal government to address the majority of its needs. This includes support of NTIA's spectrum management and policy functions.Spectrum policy will play an important role in our efforts to advance space commerce. This symposium comes at an opportune time as we strive for U.S. leadership in 5G and other advanced technologies. We are focusing on spectrum policies to guide our efforts now and into the future. The views you share with us today will help advance the President's goals both domestically and internationally.Thank you again for your participation and your ongoing work to maintain U.S. leadership in these important industries.Load-Date: June 13, 2018End of Document

Ping An Technology wins International AI+ Environmental Protection Competition; The high-tech arm of China's leading insurance provider continues to support the group's development in the smart environmental protection sectorPR NewswireApril 10, 2018 Tuesday 11:45 PM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 793 wordsDateline: SHANGHAI, April 10, 2018 BodyPing An Technology, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ping An Insurance (Group) Company of China, Ltd. ("Ping An" or "the Group"), recently announced another milestone in artificial intelligence (AI). The team at Ping An Brain, a big data platform developed by the subsidiary, won the AI+ Environmental Protection International Competition "Power Laws: Detecting Anomalies in Usage" that has just concluded.     It is another award garnered by Ping An in a world-class competition in the AI sector, on the heels of the international awards won by Ping An Technology's Ping An Yingxiang platform for the solution of interpreting CT scans using AI and by Ping An Technology's composition technology using AI. The new milestone demonstrates Ping An's increasingly mature technologies in AI while also laying a solid foundation for the group's further research and development in the smart environmental protection and smart city fields.The competition, co-organized by Schneider Electric, a global leader in energy management, and the leading global data competition community DrivenData, is an important and powerful event in the environmental protection field. The two-month competition themed "Energy Conservation and Environmental Protection" was attended by over 1,700 teams from leading colleges and universities, research institutes and well-known international organizations.The over 40 million pieces of data in connection with actual power consumption used in the competition was collected from 187 buildings of various types across the world over a seven year period. The biggest challenges facing the competition participants were the detection of unmarked anomalies in power usage from the massive amount of data and the accurate detection of the most relevant anomalies to the actual energy consumption at the anomaly points. An analysis of the anomalies data was required to provide a solution for energy deployment optimization by leveraging the data to build a model, predict the future energy consumption and monitor the anomalies. During the two-month competition, Ping An Technology combined the semi-supervised learning, unsupervised learning and other AI technologies with a professional power energy model to provide a set of anomaly detection algorithms with the aim of saving energy and intelligently protecting the environment. Just one month after the competition started, the company was already maintaining a leading position among the competitors.During the competition, the data prediction model built by Ping An Technology delivered the highest accuracy and was able to identify anomalies in energy usage and provide a solution for addressing them. The anomalies detected during the competition could help the real-life buildings save 15 to 30% in their consumption of energy.  As energy consumption continues to increase worldwide, a science-based efficient anomaly detection solution helps improve the utilization of energy as well as reduce waste and emissions significantly. As a result, the detection of anomalies in energy usage is becoming increasingly important to the environmental protection sector. Monitoring the usage of energy with advanced technologies, such as AI, will further inspire the research and application in the smart environmental protection field.As a major high-tech subsidiary of Ping An, Ping An Technology has rich experience in the application of AI technologies and is capitalizing on its leading technologies to support its involvement in building smart cities. The success in the world-class competition reflects the point to which Ping An has seized the opportunity in taking the lead in applying its AI+ capabilities in the environmental protection sector in line with the Chinese central government's roll out of initiatives focused on the development of the AI sector. The combination of AI and environmental protection supports more accurate pollution prediction, smarter pollution control and more intelligent waste disposal. Ping An's Smart Environmental Protection Cloud solution using AI+ technology will help the responsible government authorities in boosting the development of smart cities.Ping An plans to continue implementing its Finance + Technology dual strategy and innovating. In addition to strengthening its core businesses with technological achievements, the group, supported by Ping An Technology, aims to boost the real-life application of its core technologies, serve the entire community and ultimately, become a leading global technology-driven personal finance and life services provider.  View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ping-an-technology-wins-international-ai-environmental-protection-competition-300627833.htmlSOURCE Ping An TechnologyCONTACT: Qiqi Gao, +86-21-38642313, GAOZHENGQI089@pingan.com.cnLoad-Date: April 12, 2018End of Document

NPR News Interview With Tim CookTargeted News ServiceJune 4, 2018 Monday 7:04 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 600 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyNPR issued the following news release:In an interview airing tomorrow on Morning Edition, NPR's Steve Inskeep and Laura Sydell spoke with Apple CEO Tim Cook on the opening day of the company's annual Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC).Stations and broadcast times are available at NPR.org/stations.Excerpts of the interview are available below and can be cited with attribution. A full transcript will be made available after the interview has aired. Audio clips available upon request, please email mediarelations@npr.orgIn response to a New York Times report about Facebook having made data-sharing agreements with other software and hardware companies in the past, Cook denied that Apple ever accessed or asked for Facebook user information that was shared without users' explicit knowledge. "The things mentioned in the Times article about relationship status, all these kinds of things, is so foreign to us, and not data that we have ever received at all or requested -- zero."He went on to clarify that what Apple did do with Facebook involved making the photo-sharing experience easier for Facebook users on iOs devices: "We integrated the ability to share in the operating system, [made] it simple to share a photo and that sort of thing," said Cook. "So it's a convenience for the user. We weren't in the data business. We've never been in the data business."A highlight from Cook's announcement in his keynote address included new and stronger features coming in iOS 12 to help users combat smartphone addiction and constant device distractions. When asked how that squares with Apple simultaneously rolling out features designed to integrate its devices more fully into people's daily activities, he said: "We have never been about maximizing the number of times you pick it up, the number of times you use it."He added: "All of these things are great conveniences of life. They change your daily life in a great way. But if you're being bombarded by notifications all day long, that's probably a use of the system that might not be so good anymore."Cook declined to share specifics of his private meeting with President Donald Trump at the White House that took place in April, but suggested he supports a less hawkish policy on trade and doesn't agree with tariffs: "Trade brings people closer together. If I can do some business with you, I'm going to find out some things about you and we're going to get along a lot better, and I think that's true about countries as well," Cook said. He added: "I don't think that Apple is going to get caught up in a tariff there, but I don't know. This could, but I don't think so, because if we were, it would hurt the U.S. And so it doesn't make sense to do from that point of view."Cook also addressed Apple's move to comply with Chinese law and store its physical iCloud data for Chinese citizens and cryptographic keys on servers located in China. When asked about concerns that doing so could make user data easier for the Chinese government to access, Cook said: "It doesn't really matter where they're kept, it matters whether they're safe or not." He also said the only government, at this point, that's tried to force Apple to release encrypted user data is the United States, referring to the case of the FBI suing Apple to unlock an iPhone belonging to a shooter in the 2015 San Bernardino attack. "To everyone else's credit, no one else has asked for a backdoor [into a user's encrypted iPhone information]. No one in the world at this point. I'm not saying I want change tomorrow."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6318838 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: June 6, 2018End of Document

Closing Bell: LIVE MARKETS BLOGRealMoneyMay 4, 2018 Friday 4:06 PM EDTCopyright 2018 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 861 wordsByline: Tony OwusuHighlight: Markets ended the week on a strong note across the board Friday.BodyClosing Bell Markets had their strongest day of trading to close the week Friday with the Nasdaq and Dow Jones Industrial Average both rising triple digits. The Dow climbed 1.39%, or 332 points to 24,263, while the Nasdaq gained 1.7%, or 121 points to 7,210, while the S&P 500 gained 1.28%, or 34 points to 2,663. Instagram Now AllowsIn-App Purchases Instagram  is finally allowing users to purchase items through the application without having to be redirected to an outside website. For more security, users can set up a PIN that must be entered before the app will allow purchases to go through.Instagram has not publicized the change, but the option apparently has been available for some time. The U.S. Makes Trade Expectations Known to China The trade negotiations between the U.S. and China is moving forward after the U.S. handed Chinese officials a list of demands, including a $200 billion reduction in the trade deficit between the two countries by the end of 2020. The U.S. is also seeking to stop Chinese government support for advanced technologies and reduction to tariffs on imports of American products. China responded to the requests by calling them "unfair," according to the Wall Street Journal. A statement released by the state-run Xinhua News Agency described the talks between Vice Premier Liu He and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin as "frank, efficient and constructive."Alibaba Is Betting Big on Commerce Revenue, Cloud Business Chinese e-retailer Alibaba BABA believes that its commerce and cloud business will drive 60% overall revenue growth next year. The company reported a 29% decline in fourth-quarter profit from the year earlier, due in part to a one-time gain from the divestiture of assets. Without those disposals, the company reported a 37% increase to its fourth-quarter bottom line. The 7.56 billion yuan the company cleared in the quarter was short of the 7.7 billion yuan analysts at S&P Global were looking for, even as revenue for the period increased 61% year over year to 61.93 billion yuan. The company did top earnings estimates from Thomson Reuters and FactSet. Alibaba shares were rising 1.2% in morning trading Friday. Walmart Offers $15 Billion for 75% Stake in Flipkart Walmart's  battle for global domination against Amazon  is headed for India after the big box retailer submitted a $15 billion bid for a 75% stake in Flipkart, India's premier e-commerce company. Flipkart was started by two Amazon employees in 2007 and has risen to become one of India's most popular retailers with billions raised from investors like SoftBank Group, Tencent Holdings  and Microsoft  . As of its last funding round in April, Flipkart said it was valued at $11.6 billion. U.S. Adds 164,000 Jobs in April, Unemployment Rate Dips to 3.9% The U.S. economy added 164,000 jobs in April, causing the jobless rate to fall to 3.9%. However, economists were expecting the country to add 192,000 jobs in the month and the jobless rate to fall to 4%. Average hourly earnings increased by 4%, or a 2.6% increase on an annualized basis. That pace is slightly off the norm as average hourly earnings have been increasing at a 2.7% hourly pace. The jobs numbers are important as the Federal Reserve watches employment and inflation in order to determine when to raise interest rates further. Berkshire Hathaway Upped Apple Stake in a Big Way in Q1 Count Warren Buffett among the Apple Inc.  bulls.Berkshire Hathaway  purchased 75 million shares of the tech company in the first quarter, adding to the 165 million share stake the fund had invested in the company as of the end of 2017. "If you look at Apple, I think it earns almost twice as much as the second-most-profitable company in the United States," Buffett told CNBC. Apple shares are on fire after an earnings beat earlier this week as the company sold 52 million iPhones in the most recent quarter. Xerox Reverses Course, CEO and Board to Remain Intact If you thought the drama with Xerox  and Carl Icahn was over once the company agreed to oust its CEO and several board members, guess again. The company announced that its board and CEO Jeff Jacobson will stay intact following the expiration of a settlement agreement with activists Icahn and Darwin Deason. On May 1 the company agreed to oust the executives in exchange for Deason dropping litigation against the company. He hasn't done so and the agreement is now expired. Xerox had previously agreed to let go of Jacobson and force the resignation of six of the company's 10 board members. Premarket Futures contracts were faltering ahead of the market open Friday one day after markets sold off to end Thursday's session on a mixed note. Dow futures were falling 0.17%, indicating an open 41 points lower, while Nasdaq futures fell 0.19%, indicating an open 13 points lower, S&P futures fell 0.2%, indicating an open 5 points lower. Major Asian markets had a dismal day, led by the Hang Seng which declined 1.28%. The Nikkei fell 0.16% and the Shanghai Composite declined 0.32%. In Europe, the CAC 40 fell 0.04% while the DAX in Germany rose 0.45%, and the FTSE 100 gained 0.42% with about four hours left in trading. Load-Date: May 5, 2018End of Document

Tesla, Boeing and Merck Among Companies Hurt by Latest TariffsRealMoneyJune 15, 2018 Friday 1:04 PM EDTCopyright 2018 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 564 wordsByline: Jim CollinsHighlight: The latest announcement from the U.S. Trade Representative's office is chilling reading for free trade supporters.BodyIt's increasingly difficult to separate the noise from the facts when it comes to international trade, especially that between the U.S and China. Friday morning's press release from the Office of the United States Trade Representative breaks out the specifics in much more detail than a presidential tweet. Of the $50 billion of proposed tariffs, $34 billion, representing 1,102 separate product categories, are scheduled to go into effect on July 6th. An additional $16 billion worth (at 2017 trade levels) have been submitted for public comment.if you believe in free trade the USTR release -- which contains  to the full Section 301 report -- is chilling in its rhetoric. It is clear that the administration is targeting the official Made in China 2025 policy as a means of exposing the Chinese government's pattern of protectionism and promotion of state industries. It's difficult to take the moral high ground on protectionism when imposing tariffs, though, and it seems the trade hawks at the USTR and elsewhere in the administration are hell-bent on undermining their president's greatest foreign policy achievement -- this week's unprecedented sit down with Kim Jong Un.So, it's difficult to go through 1,100 separate line items, but in the first portion of the tariffs (the $34 billion) there are many references to finished goods and components. The USTR press release makes specific mention of aerospace, information and communications technology, robotics, industrial machinery, new materials, and automobiles.So, the biggest loser there would be -- as I have pointed out frequently in my RM column including yesterday - Boeing  . I would also add Lockheed Martin  , Northrop Grumman  and larger suppliers such as United Technologies  and Precision Castparts (a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway  ,  .) In the auto sector, companies that rely heavily on imports from Chinese auto suppliers would be hit hard, but that list really only consists of one: Tesla  . I have no idea why Tesla sources so much from mainland Chinese suppliers while the other U.S. manufacturers (both native and captive) depend on local suppliers. Of course, as a general rule, I have no idea why Musk does what he does from a manufacturing perspective, and I probably never will.The second list of affected goods (the $16 billion that has been proposed with no date set yet for implementation) is heavily represented by engineered chemical compounds, mainly organics. Seeing styrene on the list immediately brought to mind the tiremakers, whose need for synthetic rubber is obviously large, so Goodyear  and Cooper Tire  would be losers in that aspect.From a sectoral basis, the largest importer of chemicals into the U.S. is the pharmaceutical industry, so I would include Merck  , Bristol Myers  and Johnson and Johnson  on a list of companies that would be hit if the second set of tariffs are imposed.So, that's a long list of names, and really only covers the impacts of U.S. importers. My inclusion of several of the biggest names in the S&P 500 though, should show that the impact of trade troubles is widespread. We will see how China responds to Friday's announcements, which had been telegraphed for the past few weeks, but a tit-for-tat would not be good for equity holders in any geographies. Trade worries could be the anchor that finally stops the S&P 500 from its wildly bullish run.Load-Date: June 16, 2018End of Document

Tim Cook isn't too worried about a trade warCNN WireJune 5, 2018 Tuesday 12:57 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 373 wordsByline: By Julia HorowitzDateline: NEW YORK (CNNMoney) BodyNEW YORK (CNNMoney) --  Tim Cook doesn't think tariffs are going to make your iPhone more expensive.The Apple CEO said Monday he didn't expect a full-blown trade war to break out and dismissed the notion that the company's flagship device would be subject to tariffs. "I don't think the iPhone will get a tariff on it," Cook told CNN's Laurie Segall in an exclusive TV interview.Cook, who visited President Donald Trump to discuss trade in April, also said he was "very optimistic" that the United States would not escalate its trade fight with other countries, adding that "no one will win from that.""That's going to be a lose-lose, and when the facts are so clear like that, I believe both parties will see that," he added. The Apple CEO's remarks come as the United States stokes trade tensions on multiple fronts.Early last week, the Trump administration said it will move forward with $50 billion worth of tariffs on Chinese goods as punishment for intellectual property theft. China has pledged to retaliate with $50 billion in tariffs of its own on items like cars, planes and soybeans. And on Friday, the administration imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico and the European Union. So far, countries have not threatened duties on Apple's smartphone directly. And since the iPhone is imported to America as a finished product, Apple does not have to worry about US tariffs on many Chinese components, according to Virginia Howard, a supply chain analyst at Gartner.As a master of supply chain management, Apple can likely absorb any temporary disruptions, Howard said."They've got the money, they've got the research and they've got the partners," she said. "I suspect Apple is in a fairly good position to recover."However, an escalating trade war could still affect the tech giant, which considers China a vital market.Apple competes in China against phone makers like Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo. Any effort by the Chinese government to curb iPhone sales amid a trade fight could cause the company to lose momentum."There are a lot of manufacturers that are head-on-head competition in that market," Howard said.TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

PACIFIC for April 2: Zuckerberg fires back at AppleCNNMoney.comApril 2, 2018 Monday 12:37 PM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: TECHNOLOGYLength: 1599 wordsByline: Dylan ByersBodyWhat's Next: Blame Congress.Lawmakers have spent months beating up on Facebook, Google and other tech giants for their mishandling of user data. But several tech execs, insiders and investors I've spoken with in recent days say Congress deserves a share of the blame for failing to introduce privacy regulations that would actually protect consumers.Sign up for PACIFIC: The new CNNMoney newsletter about the center of change and innovationWhat's more: These sources believe the current Congress may ultimately be incapable of passing regulation that does more than pay lip service to the privacy issue. They fear any new laws will fall short of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, which will offer users a clear and obvious way to protect their data.Right on time: "Facebook Is Not the Problem. Lax Privacy Rules Are," by The New York Times Editorial Board:"What is needed is for Congress to adopt rigorous and comprehensive privacy laws.""In 2012, President Barack Obama proposed a privacy bill of rights... [It] fizzled out when Congress showed little appetite for it."What's Ahead: Zuckerberg testifies on Capitol Hill.When: We still don't know.---Today's PACIFICWhat Silicon Valley is talking about: Mark Zuckerberg's return-fire on Apple, the Spotify IPO and Elon's April Fools' joke ... What Washington is talking about: China tariffs ... What Hollywood is talking about: Mohammed bin Salman ...Good morning. Tonight: Michigan vs. Villanova in the NCAA National Championship. 6:20 p.m. TBS. Odds, via VegasInsider: Villanova: 5/16, Michigan 13/5While we're talking sports... Please, please tell us you saw that crazy Zlatan Ibrahimovic goal from L.A.'s first-ever el Trafico.---Apple vs. Facebook: Zuckerberg fires backThe longstanding war between Apple and Facebook has broken into the mainstream. Apple CEO Tim Cook spent the last week criticizing Facebook for abusing and profiting off user data. Now Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is portraying Apple as a company that caters only to rich people. The message from both men is that the other guy's company doesn't care about you.The Latest: Zuckerberg talks to Vox's Ezra Klein:Klein: "Tim Cook... argued that Apple sells products to users, it doesn't sell users to advertisers, and so it's a sounder business model that doesn't open itself to these problems."Zuckerberg: "I find the argument, that if you're not paying that somehow we can't care about you, to be extremely glib. And not at all aligned with the truth."More Zuck:"The reality here is that if you want to build a service that helps connect everyone in the world, then there are a lot of people who can't afford to pay. And therefore, as with a lot of media, having an advertising-supported model is the only rational model that can support building this service to reach people.""If you want to build a service which is not just serving rich people, then you need to have something that people can afford.""I don't think at all that that means that we don't care about people. To the contrary, I think it's important that we don't all get Stockholm Syndrome and let the companies that work hard to charge you more convince you that they actually care more about you. Because that sounds ridiculous to me."Why the spat mattersTech companies almost never beat up on one another, as Nick Wingfield points out in today's NYT:"A spirit of comity prevails among its leaders in moments of crisis...""Part of the silence, people in the industry say, comes from a desire to avoid the business equivalent of bad karma ? knowing that they, too, may one day face the buzz saw of public censure."The Big PictureThe war between Apple and Facebook is different:The two companies have spent a decade sparring over these issues -- see Steve Jobs in 2010 -- and have fundamental differences of opinion on the privacy issue.Apple is seeking to distinguish itself from Facebook, Google and other ad-reliant data harvesting companies amid growing public scrutiny and impending regulation.More: "Why Apple uses privacy as a sales pitch" by CNNMoney's David Goldman.---Too big to fail"They Tried to Boycott Facebook, Apple and Google. They Failed," by NYT's Jack Nicas: "As the reach and influence of Silicon Valley's tech giants have increased, so have the calls to boycott their products and services. The problem is that pulling off a boycott is not exactly easy: The tech companies' products are so pervasive that they are difficult to avoid."---Going Public: Spotify's momentSpotify goes public tomorrow. Its seen as the biggest tech IPO since SNAP, and is notable for being a "direct listing" that does not rely on investment banks.The Big Picture: Spotify faces an uphill climb, as I wrote in the inaugural edition of PACIFIC almost one month ago:What Spotify has: 71 million paying subscribers, double that of Apple Music and four times that of Amazon Music.What it doesn't: Substantive differentiation. At the end of the day, all music streaming services provide roughly the same content.Without differentiation, the advantage may go to those with scale. Spotify's competitors have greater brand recognition, their own hardware distribution (iPhone, HomePod and Echo) and far greater resources.My colleague Jordan Valinsky rounds up some of the best Spotify coverage ahead of Tuesday's "direct listing" IPO:"Spotify CEO Daniel Ek: Once the Music Industry's Slayer, Now Its Savior," by WSJ's Maureen Farrell and Anne Steele:"The 35-year-old Swedish CEO faces the daunting task of making his company profitable while fending off streaming competition from tech giants such as Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Amazon.com Inc.""Investors are counting on Mr. Ek to innovate and differentiate Spotify's offerings and gain a foothold in scaling the service onto users' smartphones in new markets.""Meet Barry McCarthy, the man behind Spotify's daring public offering" by Recode's Teddy Schleifer:"McCarthy first joined Spotify in 2014 as a member of its board, and moved to the CFO role a year later. As the company started edging toward a long-awaited IPO, he started selling Ek on the direct listing.""If the direct listing works, it could pave the way for other tech startups to follow suit. That could potentially cut out Wall Street banks and their clients from a lucrative revenue stream, and would roil the financial services industry."Sign up for PACIFIC: The new CNNMoney newsletter about the center of change and innovation---April Fools: Musk makes lightElon Musk's April Fools' Day tweet:"Tesla Goes Bankrupt Palo Alto, California, April 1, 2018 -- Despite intense efforts to raise money, including a last-ditch mass sale of Easter Eggs, we are sad to report that Tesla has gone completely and totally bankrupt. So bankrupt, you can't believe it."What's not funny: Tesla is facing serious concerns about its inability to hit production targets on the Model 3.The Latest, via Bloomberg's Dana Hull:"Moody's Investors Service last week downgraded the company's credit rating further into junk, saying production problems and mounting obligations could necessitate a more than $2 billion capital raise soon to avoid running out of cash. Tesla shares plunged as much as 5.7 percent in early trading Monday."More: A follow-up tweet in which Musk appeared passed out next to a Model 3 seemed to overlook Tesla's potential role in a recent fatal crash.---Trade Wars: China's new tariffsValinsky emails: "China just sent up a flare signaling it's ready to take the U.S. on in a trade war following Trump's tariffs."The Latest, from our colleague Daniel Shane:"The Chinese government said that tariffs on about $3 billion worth of US imports are going into effect Monday, hitting 128 products ranging from pork to steel pipes.""Authorities are imposing tariffs of 15% on 120 American products -- such as fruits, nuts, wine and steel pipes -- and 25% on eight other products, including pork and recycled aluminum."What's Next:"Top US and Chinese officials have been holding talks in an effort to stop the trade tensions from spiraling out of control. But so far, neither side is backing down.""Experts say they expect further retaliation from China once the Trump administration reveals more details on which products its planned $50 billion in tariffs will target."Sign up for PACIFIC: The new CNNMoney newsletter about the center of change and innovation---The Prince's Diaries: MBS in Hollywood"Hollywood rolls out the red carpet for Saudi Arabia's crown prince, hoping to cash in on a new market" by LAT's Ryan Faughnder:"Mohammed's trip to Los Angeles... has elicited excited curiosity among entertainment industry executives who see the desert kingdom as a lucrative new market for movies ? and a potential source of much-needed financing.""Saudi Arabia, like China, wants to use its investments to learn about the global entertainment business and build a modern media industry. A major motivation for the country's plan is to drive tourism..."Tonight: As I reported last week, MBS will be having dinner tonight at Rupert Murdoch's Bel-Air estate with Disney CEO Bob Iger, Warner Bros. Chairman Kevin Tsujihara, 21st Century Fox President Peter Rice and media investor Peter Chernin, among others.Bonus: "A Saudi Prince's Quest to Remake the Middle East" by The New Yorker's Dexter Filkins.---Thanks for reading, folks.

Amazon Criticized Over Conditions At Hengyang Foxconn Supplier Factory; Best And Worst-Case Scenarios For Trump Meeting With Kim Jong-Un; Rising Health Costs; FB's Latest Privacy BlunderMORNINGS WITH MARIA MORNINGS WITH MARIA 8:00 AM ESTJune 11, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; FinancialLength: 7978 wordsByline: Maria Bartiromo, Dagen McDowell, Mitch Roschelle, Deirdre Bolton, Jeff Flock, Rich Edson; Nicole Petallides, Charles Payne, Cheryl CasoneGuests: Lee Carter, Barry Goodfield, Stephen Schork, Bill CassidyBodyMARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good Monday morning. Welcome back, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Monday, June 11th. Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast. Counting down to the North Korea Summit. The meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong-un just hours away now. Final preparations are underway after both leaders arrive in Singapore yesterday.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo holding a news conference earlier this morning. Tackling criticism over the President's approach saying this is unlike anything we've seen before.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE POMPEO, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: President Trump has truly laid out a process here that is fundamentally different than the ones that we've gone through before. And I expect that the process from tomorrow forward will also be fundamentally different, would have resolved America working to try and provide an outcome that benefits both countries. That's different than what we've done before.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: We'll take you live to Singapore coming up this morning. And the trade war of words, President Trump taking on American allies at the G7 meeting this weekend, particularly Canada and the European Union over trade policies. We're taking a look at where our relationships stand across the world. Global markets are mostly higher this morning, take a look. Futures are lower, however. We've seen a complete reversal this morning. We had been showing a gain for futures of about 50 points on the Dow Industrials. We're looking at a decline right now of six points, S&P 500 is also negative as is the NASDAQ. Investors are awaiting the Federal Reserve and the decision later this week where the Central Bank is expected to raise interest rates on Wednesday this after modest gains on Friday. The major indices rising for the week. Take a look at the Dow up 75 points, one-third of one percent.In Europe this morning, gains across the board. Investors are waiting on the ECB decision on Thursday. European Central Bank may discuss taking away stimulus come Thursday. FT-100 this morning up 46 points, two-thirds of one percent, the CAC Quarante is up a fraction as is the DAX Index in Germany. The CAC and the DAX are off of the best levels of the morning. In Asia overnight, markets are mostly higher with the exception of China. Shanghai Composite down one-half of a percent. Amazon is facing questions over working conditions, concerns rising about a Foxconn facility in China that makes devices for the technology giant. What Amazon is saying about that this morning. Stocks is down a fraction. Bitcoin under pressure, prices sliding over the weekend as cryptocurrency exchange is hacked. Elon Musk's Boring Company delivering its first flame throwers, the pictures are going viral.All those stories coming up this morning. And joining me to talk all about it, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, PwC Partner, Mitch Roschelle, and Maslansky and Partners President, Lee Carter. Good show. Great -- good to see everybody.LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS: Great to be here.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: So much going on with --BARTIROMO: What a week. Big week.MCDOWELL: -- between the G7 -- just on the political stage and the world stage but then there's so much going on here in the United States. We've got the Fed meeting coming up this week. That's going to be incredible.BARTIROMO: A quarter of a point is what they're talking about in terms of raising interest rates. I think it's a done deal that we're going to see a rate hike, right?MITCH ROSCHELLE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. I would suspect that. That would be shocked if that wasn't the case. But coming out of it, there's always a press conference and there's a lot of signals and code that come out of the press conference. So all ears will be on that.BARTIROMO: We could see news coming out of the ECB on Thursday.MCDOWELL: Right. And you tie that to the collapse in some emerging markets assets. Like you watch Mitch was talking about this Brazil on Friday, and the question is, now, do you have this domino effect? And some of that has to be related to the withdrawal of monetary stimulus by the central banks, particularly the Federal Reserve as they winds down the balance sheet.BARTIROMO: Yes. And that's going to be the focus this Wednesday when we hear from the Fed after the two-day meeting. Meanwhile, the big story of the week, it is the eve of the U.S.-North Korea Summit where President Trump will meet face to face with Kim Jong-un. Deirdre Bolton is live on the ground in Singapore this morning, she has the very latest. Diedre, good morning to you -- actually, evening to you.DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning. Well, good evening, good morning to you, Maria. You are exactly right, 13 hours away, before President Trump and Kim Jong-un sit down together in one room. This is completely unprecedented. It is the first time that a U.S. sitting President meets with a North Korean leader and also for the first hour we expect it will just be the two of them with translators, so no advisors, no cabinet members. Earlier today we hear in Singapore did get a briefing in the room with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, he said he's optimistic about the meeting tomorrow. Here's his whole comment.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)POMPEO: I'm very optimistic that we will have a successful outcome from tomorrow's meeting between these two leaders. It's the case in each of those two countries there are only two people that can make decisions of this magnitude and those two people are going to be sitting in a room together tomorrow.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLTON: I spoke with a former ambassador to Singapore, one who worked under President George Bush and he is so familiar with all these machinations and what happens behind the scenes. So, I spoke with him, I asked him what measure is he going to use to judge if it was a successful meeting or not. Here's the ambassador.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FRANK LAVIN, FORMER UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO SINGAPORE: When they wrap up the leaders wrap up, is there a process or mechanism in case for any kind of follow-up meetings? If they just say it was good to meet you and goodbye without any calendar or schedule, then you say it probably wasn't a positive meeting.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLTON: So that idea of follow-up of next steps that you would have with any meeting seems to really be front and center as to how people are going to be judging this tomorrow, just 15 hours from now. I also spoke with the ambassador about the role of NSC, Mike -- John Bolton rather, NSA John Bolton who's going to be in the room along with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and White House Spokesperson Sarah Sanders. So we have it on good sourcing, Maria, that they are actually going to be joining the two leaders, President Trump and Kim Jong- un after Kim Jong-un and President Trump have had time to speak one-on-one. So those are the cabinet members that will be joining President Trump afterwards and you had am Ambassador Lavin telling me it is very good that John Bolton will be there because he said you do want somebody who is a hawk, you do want somebody who is skeptical. He told me pointblank, North Korea has lied so many times in the past, were neg on promises, were neg agreements, you want someone there who is going to really hold their feet to the fire. And most people, at least in this area, see that John Bolton is capable of that. Maria?BARTIROMO: But how will we know if they're lying right away? I mean, this is going to be a long -- it will be a process.BOLTON: Yes. It's going to be a very long process. So, what most people, the Ambassador included that I've spoken with are looking for are true signs of process in place. We actually heard earlier Secretary of State Mike Pompeo saying this time the process is different. Therefore, we expect a different outcome. Another sign that our bureau chief from Seoul, South Korea talked to me about one of our colleagues at The Wall Street Journal, he said watch for what Kim Jong-un does at home. If he speaks publicly or if the state news agency releases details about the process, he said that is a very good sign that progress can be on the way, Maria.BARTIROMO: Interesting. All right. We'll be watching all of that. Deirdre, thank you. Deirdre Bolton on the ground this morning live in Singapore. One of the big question ahead of this historic summit between the President and North Korean leader is how they will communicate. President Trump attempting to secure a deal for full denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. Joining us right now is psychologist and behaviorist, Dr. Barry Goodfield whose profiled notorious dictators including Saddam Hussein. Dr. Goodfield, good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.DR. BARRY GOODFIELD, PSYCHOLOGIST: Maria, it's a pleasure to be here. I just need to say something right up front. Everything that we see and say and do is based on observable, testable, referential behavior. In other words, this isn't just a guess about what he will feel, what he will say, it's something based on what we actually see.BARTIROMO: What we see from his body language?GOODFIELD: Exactly. Yes.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: And you stress -- you stress that Kim must be respected from that body language. Tell us about that.GOODFIELD: It's totally true. That -- this young man basically has one goal is to be respected on the world stage. And the one thing that's important for us to realize is that respect is something that the President can offer when he sees something that he trusts and believes in. The wonderful thing about having President Donald J. Trump in this room with this young man across from him who has -- who's looking at a guy, by the way, who has done more negotiations than the days that this man's been on the earth. So this is -- this is nothing new for President Trump. He knows exactly what to do and what he wants.CARTER: You know, one of the things that I -- the President is very unpredictable, right? I think one of the things that people like about him is the fact that he's not predictable in his behavior and that he's going to be authentic in who he is. What are you looking for in a President as far as body language and what you expect him to -- who you expect him to engage?GOODFIELD: Well, one of the things you can know about the President is when he looks at you, he's looking at you. I mean, you can't sit across from this man and not realize that there's somebody who is really watching, listening and thinking every moment about what you're doing. He's ahead of the game in most all cases. And so what we're looking for with him is the idea of him doing exactly what he's done for all these years of his life. So the art of the deal is not just a title. It's a way of looking at life.BARTIROMO: You say goodwill is going to win out over good judgment in these negotiations. What does this mean that failure is not an option for either man. How do you draw this conclusion?GOODFIELD: Based on the fact that both of these people are not going there to lose. Both of these people are going there with a lot of baggage. The baggage has got to do with they're seen and how they come across. With Kim Jong-un, what you have there is a man who's carrying the father whispering and the grandfather whispering in his ears saying don't trust anybody from the west.BARTIROMO: Oh, that's true.GOODFIELD: Yes. This is exactly what's happening. So these guys are not trusting anybody. And so what he needs to do is to stand on his own and to look at the man who is right across the table from him and to realize that being tough and being arbitrary and being in that sense kind of irrational is not going to do anything to bring him closer to what he needs. This is nothing more, Maria, than a game where you have somebody bringing weapons to the table and somebody at the other end with a cash register willing to give him money. But the President is not offering money. What he's offering is -- and what he's demanding in fact is you will get rid of those missiles. He's not kidding when he says this. And he will walk away. He's a strong, clear thinker. And he will walk away if it's necessary and his nonverbal behavior shows that. And I believe that Kim is smart enough to know that.ROSCHELLE: Dr. Goodfield, Mitch Roschelle here. One of the things you said earlier was that he wants respect and if he's viewed by his own people around the world stage as capitulating, will that be a bit of a trigger and that he feels as though he's been disrespected and he'll want more, perhaps, than just capitulating?GOODFIELD: Well, I think that he will -- he will basically want to have people believe and see him as an individual who has got something for what he -- what he brought to the table. He's got to walk away with the idea that he's gained respect in exchange for those weapons that are at the other end of the table which are going to be melted down or whatever the heck is going to be done with them. He wants to make sure he's going to walk away saying, look what I did. He has to go back to North Korea and face the people and also people who support him and say I was victorious because I didn't outsmart this man, I simply put forward a position that he could -- he could understand and he could go with. He knows that President Trump is not going to back down.MCDOWELL: But Dr. Goodfield -- it's Dagen McDowell.GOODFIELD: Yes.MCDOWELL: But rather than his own people, is he -- is Kim Jong-un more concerned with the world stage, again, he's gone from being a pariah to having a role on the world stage. He's met with the leaders of China and South Korea, President of the United States. He's got meetings lined up with Vladimir Putin and Bashar al-Assad in Syria.GOODFIELD: Well, for what -- look, don't anybody kid themselves. This guy is what you think he probably is. I mean, he is not a nice guy. And he is the kind of guy that victory for him is when he gets his way and when he walks away from the table in the old days, people somehow that were at the table are never seen again. With Donald Trump, the worst he can say is, you're fired. But Trump is going to say --BARTIROMO: But what's I'm saying. He wants respect. And yet, he's a bad guy, you're saying. But we're supposed to respect him.GOODFIELD: Well, he wants respect but the fact of the matter is his behavior is going to be such that what he's -- the respect he's going to get is the handshake and the -- and the standing together with the two of them, smiling, maybe Dennis Rodman in the middle. Who knows. But the fact of the matter is, standing there smiling and saying, we're making a deal and the deal ultimately has got to do with him walking back and getting food and various other things that the starving population that he's in fact responsible for, for starving, is going to get a change.BARTIROMO: Why do you think Kim Jong-un has agreed to do this? I mean, what, you know, what does he care about his people? Why does he care about human rights? Why did he agree to this? Is he afraid he's going to be threatened in terms of his own leadership him taken out?GOODFIELD: Well, of course, that's a very good question because one of the -- one of the things that he fears most is some sort of coup d'etat ore some sort of assassination. So those things are always in the front of his mind. And he's always doing whatever he can to protect himself and he will do just that. But what is he afraid of? What I think he's ultimately afraid of is the fact that this opportunity is a one-time deal. And it is a one-time deal.BARTIROMO: Yes.GOODFIELD: And he needs to understand that.BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Dr. Barry Goodfield. Good to see you, sir. Thank you for weighing in this morning. Wake should up early for MORNINGS WITH MARIA tomorrow morning. We have live coverage of President Trump's meeting with Kim Jong-un starting at 5:00 a.m. Eastern. We are beginning the show an hour earlier. So join us at 5:00 a.m. tomorrow. 5:00 to 9:00 right here. Coming up. First, Amazon under fire over working conditions. The new concerns over a Foxconn facility in China that makes devices for Amazon. What the company's saying about that this morning. Then a price plunge for Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency takes a hit after a cyberattack raising fresh security concerns. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Well after 60 years, IHOP, International House of Pncakes flipping its name to IHOb. The pancake chain announcing the official meaning of its new name this morning. Jeff Flock is at an IHOP in Illinois with the very latest or is it IHOb?JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: IHOb but may put the sign in the window, Maria, take a look. You know what the B stands for, no it's not bacon, no it's not breakfast, no it's not biryani, it's burgers. Wow. Take a look at what the logo -- the new logo will look like, the old logo and the new logo. This news just announced actually over at our friends, on "FOX & FRIENDS" this morning by IHOb -- IHOPs, IHOBs President. Listen to what he said keeping folks -- making folks realize this is about burgers, introducing burger but not losing pancakes. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DARREN REBELEZ , IHOP PRESIDENT: Our breakfast hasn't changed, you know, we're world famous for our buttermilk pancakes and our breakfast foods, so we're going to always have breakfast and in fact, you can get pancakes with your burger at the same time. So you don't even have to choose, you can get it all.(END VIDEO CLIP)FLOCK: But they have not -- they have not yet however decided to put burger between two pancakes, that's maybe under consideration. I say burger this, Maria, that, you know, the burger marketplace is a little bit crowded. You take a look at all the competition they're going to have out there. They are the only guys with pancake in their name and now International House of Burgers? Well, there is a lot of burgers out there, why are they doing this? Well, I got a read from their press release and maybe this is a little caveat. They say they are putting their name for "for the time being." If they actually had to change all of those big IHOP signs to IHOb and, you know, there are 1700 locations, there's another one over there. That would be a lot of doing, it may be that for the time being is not all that long. They sell burgers now, yes, they're emphasizing that but pancakes may be past and present and future as well. Just leave with you that.BARTIROMO: All right, Jeff. Thank you so much. Jeff Flock at IHOP, and we got some burgers on the set actually, Cheryl.CASONE: Yes. We got a few. Yes. I mean, I'm -- so I'm holding up the cowboy barbecue. This has got an onion ring in the middle of it, of course, and barbecue sauce and that's what Lee Carter has as well. And I believe that you got the brunch burger, Mitch.ROSCHELLE: Yes, I do.CASONE: Eggs potato pancake and of course it comes all with French fries.BARTIROMO: Eggs and --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: What the heck. Call the pancakes right on top.(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: So here's the big all onion ring in the middle of the burger which you doesn't want this at 8:00 in the morning but, you know, take one for the team.ROSCHELLE: When you get up at 2:00, it's not 8:00 in the morning --BARTIROMO: Wow. OK. There you go. Is it only temporary, Dagen?MCDOWELL: This is a question, I asked this to Cheryl. Well, she's got her mouthful. It's a marketing campaign, yes. And it just tell all the people who go there for breakfast all day long that if you've got somebody who wants to have a hamburger we sell those too.(CROSSTALK)CASONE: Well, you're going to change the name though like -- we'll, see how it goes, but burgers are available in the mornings. I have confirmed at IHOP.BARTIROMO: OK.CASONE: I just confirm that moments ago breaking news. That's big for some people that work overnight.CARTER: And there are some people who just really like burgers for breakfast.CASONE: Burgers and fries for breakfast.(CROSSTALK)ROSCHELLE: This is good stuff.(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: By the way, real quick. I'll point out. Front page at The New York -- excuse me, oh, The Wall Street Journal rather, a stampede of meatless products have overrun the meat case in grocery stores in the (INAUDIBLE)BARTIROMO: Wow.MCDOWELL: So again, it's like, you find meatless, you know, vegetable- based products in the meat case.BARTIROMO: Increasing.CASONE: Yes.BARTIROMO: Increasing. We'll be right back. Oil prices are slipping this morning. We get into oil when we come back. Fresh signs of rising production abroad. We'll keep an eye on oil ahead of this historic North Korean Summit with oil at 65.14. Then going to like hotcakes, Elon Musk's Boring Company delivering its first batch of flame throwers with a warning inspired by Dr. Seuss. Wait until till you see this. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We are watching oil prices this morning back down to 65.13 right now. Crude is under pressure down about a percent amid increased Russian production in U.S. drilling. Geopolitical tensions also flaring up ahead of OPEC's June 22nd meeting. Joining us now to weigh in is Stephen Schork. He is the publisher of the Schork Report. Stephen, it's good to see you.STEPHEN SCHORK, FOUNDER, THE SCHORK REPORT: Good to be here, Maria. Thank you.BARTIROMO: Let's look at the OPEC meeting coming up, a couple of weeks. What are you expecting?SCHORK: You are -- I expect a lot of contention and just what we've seen essentially over the weekend, and as Justin Trudeau has unfortunately learned, you simply don't poke the bear at this point given the leadership in this country. So that said and I think Maria the last time I was on, we were estimating, it was about $6.00 to $7.00 dollars of a geopolitical risk, premium priced crude oil. Since then the market has come off about $6.00, $7.00. So we're now migrating into an area that is supportive of price. I do think this is an area, your technical quantitative trader, you're kind of pressing the elasticity. Demands -- or excuse me, price has to told at this level. So that said I think we are looking at a situation where prices got a little bit too high, we've migrated into a more palatable level at this point and as far as OPEC is concerned there was a concern with Brent Crude oil trading above $80.00 a barrel and U.S. barrel here trading above $70.00 a barrel with regard to market share. They're just so high. You can push prices without pushing demand given that we have substitutes in the market away. So now the prices have pulled back, I think you're starting to see some slippage here, I think we've seen some hint from the Saudis that they are willing to put oil out onto the market.BARTIROMO: Right. Well, that's what I was going to ask you about because the Saudis say, look, we're going to be producing more oil, but Iraq's oil ministers warning that unilateral decisions on oil output could constitute a breach of OPEC. So is that a warning directed right at the Saudis in their decision to ramp-up?SCHORK: I think it is, but -- and again, you know, referenced before, why did we have that $6.00, $7.00 rise in oil prices? Essentially this is not your grandfather's OPEC, we've never seen the (INAUDIBLE) between the Sunni side of OPEC, Saudi Arabia and the Shia side are at as wide as it is right now. So yes, it could constitute a breach but again, when we at look where supply is and where demand is, right now demand for crude oil has never been stronger, demand regardless of it were above $3.00 hitting United States. Demands for gasoline has never been stronger, stronger economies lift commodity prices. So, there is demand in the world and regardless of sticking to this supply quota, it would behoove Saudi Arabia and the Iraqis for that matter to continue to put oil on the market. And give that Saudi Arabia has been one over the last 2-1/2 years have done the heavy lifting as far as sacrificing market share --BARTIROMO: Right.SCHORK: -- to prop up oil prices. I don't think Iraq is in any sort of position to send a signal to Saudi Arabia.BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Stephen, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much.SCHORK: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Stephen Schork joining us there. Coming up, Bitcoin takes a hit. How much the cryptocurrency is down, following a major cyberattack on a Bitcoin exchange. Then Amazon also under fire, the technology giant facing questions this morning over working conditions at a Foxconn plant in China. The reaction from Amazon later this hour. Back in a minute right here. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Monday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, June 11. Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast. Less than 13 hours away from the historic summit between President Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke at a news conference earlier this morning -- he's optimistic on the outcome of the planned two- hour meeting.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)POMPEO: President Trump believed that Kim Jong-un has an unprecedented opportunity to change the trajectory of our relationship and bring peace and prosperity to his country. We are hopeful this summit will have set the conditions for future productive talks.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Report on preparations from Singapore coming up this morning -- stay with us on that. Meanwhile, the president took to Twitter from Singapore to continue his latest tirade on trade, the president taking aim at U.S. allies over tariffs off the back of weekend's G7 summit. He specifically targeted Canada's Justin Trudeau. We will tell you what the president is saying now. It is going to be a busy week in business; investors are waiting on the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates. We will get a decision on Wednesday. We are expecting the Fed will announce that it is raising interest rates by a quarter of a point on the Fed Funds Rate on Wednesday. That what the market is expecting. Markets right now are mixed. Dow Industrials expected to be up just a fraction at the opening of trading, 13 points. But the S&P and the NASDAQ are both negative by a fraction.This on top of Friday's up day. Take a look at the Friday performance, where all the major indices were up for the week. The Dow Jones Industrials average on Friday was up 75 points, one-third of a percent. The S&P was also up a third of a percent, and the NASDAQ was up a fraction. This morning in Europe, markets are up across the board. Take a look at the FTSE 100 up two-thirds of a percent. Best perform in Eurozone. And in Asia overnight, markets mostly higher with the exception of China. As you can see, the best performer was Korea. The Kospi Index is up three- quarters of one percent.Amazon under fire over working conditions at a factory in China. Details on the investigation and what Amazon is saying this morning about that. Plus, Bitcoin plunges; the cryptocurrency taking a hit after a cyberattack we've got the story. And Elon Musk's Boring Company, flamethrower has finally arrived -- just don't call it a flamethrower. The details on first shipment coming up.All those stories coming up this Monday morning. But first, our top story this half an hour, we are now just hours away from the high stakes summit between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. We are learning brand-new information this morning about what will take place at that meeting. Fox News' Rich Edison is in Singapore with that. Rich, good morning to you.RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL REPORTER: Good morning, Maria. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says he hopes this is just the beginning of a conversation between President Trump and Kim Jong-un. Of course, that's barring that tomorrow is a successful summit. Right now, the secretary of state is the highest ranking American official to have met Kim Jong-un -- that conceivably changes tomorrow. The secretary says the Trump administration wants North Korea to dismantle its nuclear weapons and is prepared to ensure the Kim regime security.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)POMPEO: It is the case that we are prepared to make security assurances necessary for North Koreans to engage in that denuclearization, that is we're prepared to take actions that will provide them sufficient certainty that they can be comfortable that denuclearization isn't something that ends badly for them.(END VIDEO CLIP)EDSON: When pressed, the secretary refused to detail what exactly the U.S. is offering. Last week, Secretary of Defense James Madison said U.S. Military personnel levels in South Korea were not on the table. Two sources familiar with the summit's planning say the meetings tomorrow will begin with President Trump and Kim Jong-un; they'll meet alone with translators, then they'll bring in advisors -- on the U.S. side, Secretary Pompeo, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, and National Security Advisor John Bolton. The secretary says, the U.S. and North Korea negotiating teams met this morning, met again later this afternoon -- those meetings wrapped a couple of hours ago according to an official. The secretary also said, the president spoke with South Korea's president and Japan's prime minister. After this summit, the secretary of state will travel to Seoul to talk to the South Korean government and then onto Beijing to brief them on the developments of whatever happens tomorrow, for the Chinese government. Maria, back to you.BARTIROMO: All right. Rick, thank you so much. Rich Edson in Singapore this morning. Joining me right now is Senate Finance Committee Member, Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana. Senator, it's good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.SEN. BILL CASSIDY (R-LA), SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE MEMBER: Maria, thank you for having me.BARTIROMO: Your thoughts ahead of this summit.CASSIDY: Historic. Can't wait. Can you imagine a momma, a mother whose child is on the front line with North Korea? Just praying for an outcome that would make that her child would be safe? And all the South Koreans -- so it's historic. We have to hope and pray for its success.BARTIROMO: Is success nothing short of denuclearization or is there a process to get to denuclearization?CASSIDY: Clearly, there needs to be a process, to get is there, but success, ultimately will be judged by history, by denuclearization. There are -- Seoul, South Korea is only 60 miles from North Korea. As long as you can destroy Seoul, there is existential threat to the west -- Korea being part of the west, if you will. So, yes, denuclearization not necessarily the summit but in the long term.BARTIROMO: This president has been making bold calls whether it is meeting with the president, or head of now North Korea, to moving the embassy to Jerusalem, to pushing back on China. What are your thoughts on the president's agenda so far?CASSIDY: The president not only will break an egg; he will take a whole carton of eggs and he's going to slam them up and down.BARTIROMO: And then he'll say: you need to crack some eggs to make an omelet.CASSIDY: And he'll scrape it. But the fact that he has been so aggressive with North Korea, clearly has worked. The secondary sanctions where you cut off North Korea from the entire banking system has brought them to the point where they will negotiate. And if they'll negotiate a way for denuclearization, and as Secretary Pompeo says, if they can be reassured that (INAUDIBLE) well for them, then the world will breathe as a sigh of relief.BARTIROMO: Yes, but what are your thoughts on what's going on with trade right now? I mean, everyone we're speaking with on this program, certainly, keeps questioning: why we are fighting with Canada, where we actually have a trade surplus?CASSIDY: Yes. So, first I'll say that we've got to protect American jobs, and there's stevedores in Louisiana, and farmer in Louisiana who very much benefit from international trade. That said, put it in context. After World War II, the United States created a global trading system, which we protect, we allowed other countries to have favorable negotiating terms with us to rebuild Western Europe, rebuild Japan, all to hold off the threat of Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is gone. Russia is fading. And so, now, do we continue need to spend entirely for that defense? Do we need those countries to have an advantage to us relative for trade? Probably not. There probably need to be a little bit of a redo.BARTIROMO: So, you're saying we put ourselves at the losing end of a lot of deals, after World War II. This was by design?CASSIDY: By design, and it worked.BARTIROMO: But now, we're 50 years later.CASSIDY: Yes.BARTIROMO: And things -- plus, 50 years later, and things should change.CASSIDY: So, look at this. In NATO, countries are supposed to spend a certain amount of their GDP on defense. There's supposed to be two percent for Germany. Germany spends 1.2, or 1.4 percent. Jim Mattis, our Secretary of Defense went there and said: Americans cannot care more about the defense of Europe than do Europeans. So why doesn't Germany spend a little bit more? And frankly, Germany does have some advantageous trading terms with us. And so, I think it probably is time for a little bit of a redo.BARTIROMO: I understand all that, but what about Canada? What's the problem with Canada? We have a surplus in Canada.CASSIDY: So, Peter Navarro had an editorial this past weekend in the New York Times, in which he spoke of, for example, tariffs that they put on our dairy results, so that farmers in Wisconsin cannot send their goods across the border. So, obviously there's isolated examples.BARTIROMO: Even though we have a surplus, there are isolated examples where they are charging us.CASSIDY: Apparently, from perspective of the administration.BARTIROMO: Understood. All right, let me turn to health care, obviously, when you try to get health care done; earlier in the year last year, you got a big thumbs-down from one of your colleagues -- where do we stand in terms of changing the health care in America?CASSIDY: We've got to make health care more affordable, we've got to lower the cost of drugs -- and that's not just important for families and for states, it's also important for Medicare which the trust fund will be bankrupt somewhere around 10 years from now, eight years from now. How do we lower drug costs? How do we make things more affordable? One thing we're promoting is price transparency. Imagine, Maria, you go to the doctor, he orders or she orders a C.T. scan, you know the price before you go, as opposed to get a Bill six weeks later. It's what we do for cell phones, what we do for jeans. So, we're promoting price transparency to lower those costs, to make things like drugs and other procedures more affordable.BARTIROMO: Why would that be, you know, such an -- why aren't we doing that already? I don't understand why this is even an issue -- of course, you want to know what something costs before you book it?CASSIDY: Isn't that true? But if somebody is opposed to price transparency, they're probably making money. And if you let the consumer know what she's about to buy, maybe they don't make as much money. And there'll be all kinds of reasons why you can't do it. Ultimately though, the patient should have the power of knowing a price.BARTIROMO: So, can you legislate that?CASSIDY: So, there are some ways you can. For example, a gag clause that forbids a pharmacist from telling a patient that it might be cheaper for her to pay for cash than to pay her insurance deductible. Think about that, the pharmacist by contract cannot tell the patient it's cheaper to pay cash. We can get rid of that.BARTIROMO: Wow. That's incredible. Let me switch gears and as you about the Department of Justice's inspector general report. The I.G. report set to come out on this Thursday, June 14th, and this, of course, report will detail the FBI's handling of the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation. Senate Judiciary Committee Member, Senator Lindsey Graham previewed some questions that he will have when Michael Horowitz sits for that testimony in front of his committee. Here's what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: Do you believe the way the FBI handled the Clinton e-mail investigation, it was on the up and up? Do you believe it was fair? Do you believe they were in the tank for Clinton and hated Trump? Was it really a series investigation or was it a politically compromised? As to the FISA warrant, do you believe it was appropriate for the Democratic Party to hire a foreign agent to go to Russia, to get dirt on Candidate Trump, and the FBI and the DOJ used that dossiers that's never been verified to get a warrant against an American citizen? I want to hear him say one way or the other, whether or not the Clinton e-mail investigation was professionally done on the up and up, and how he -- what he thinks about the FISA warrant.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: So, Lindsey Graham joined me on "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES" on Fox News yesterday, and he said to me, he believes laws were broken. What are your thoughts.CASSIDY: I don't know if laws are broken or not, but I think it's important for the American people to know, and this inspector general report will get there -- and what Senator Graham asked are great questions. Ultimately, the American people don't want FBI to be politicized, they want it objective -- and if you will, the issue now is: were they objective?BARTIROMO: So, I mean, we've seen text from Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, we know they were not subject. Did that go into the handling of the actual investigation is the question.CASSIDY: Totally.BARTIROMO: Because we know a lot of them were already bias. We know the answer to that.CASSIDY: Yes, as well as Andrew McCabe, whose wife had a, if you will, some sort of relationship with the Democratic governor of Virginia.BARTIROMO: Who gave her $700,000 for Senate run.CASSIDY: On the other hand, I am willing to concede that maybe FBI agents had a certain bias in terms of whom they voted for, but nonetheless, they were able to approach as professionals -- the investigation on objective fashion. So, Lindsey Graham is not pre-supposing answers, he is posing questions that if answer is satisfactory, he's OK, as am I.BARTIROMO: And the I.G. report, if there are criminal charges recommended the way they were in the early report, what does that mean?CASSIDY: It means that they were not professionals and rather they were carrying out a political agenda. I'm not going to presume that, but that is what the American people are waiting to see.BARTIROMO: All right. We will be watching that. Senator, it's good to see you.CASSIDY: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Bill Cassidy joining us there. We will a special live coverage of the president's meeting with Kim Jong-un. It all starts tomorrow morning at 5:00 a.m. Eastern; join us bright and early tomorrow as the show starts one hour earlier, ahead of this summit. Coming up, Amazon is under fire this morning over working conditions -- the new concerns about a Foxconn facility in China that makes devices for the technology giant. What Amazon is saying about that, this morning. Elon Musk is delivering the first 1,000 of his Boring company's flamethrowers to customers. It comes with a warning inspired by Dr. Seuss; we're going to bring it to you. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A police officer is shot, four children are being held hostage in Orlando. Cheryl Casone with the details of the standoff right now. Cheryl?CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Well, Maria, police say that the officer was seriously injured but is expected to survive after going surgery -- undergoing surgery. He was shot last night during an exchange of gunfire as police tried to arrest the suspect in an apartment complex near Universal Studios. Now, the children being held are between one and 12 years old. Police say they were responding to a domestic violence dispute. They don't know if the suspect was hit during that shoot-out.Well, we are watching Bitcoin very closely this morning, it's trading sharply lower. Right now, it's at 6,761 after a cryptocurrency exchange in South Korea was hacked and that has raised security concerns about Bitcoin. The incident was in a small exchange called Coinrail, and it happened over the weekend. The company isn't saying how much was stolen but reports say it may have been as much as $40 million. Now, Bitcoin has given up more than of its half value this year and is down sharply from that record high we saw nearly $20,000 late last year.Well, Elon Musk making the first deliveries at its $500 flamethrowers. 1,000 of them went to customers who showed up in his boring company headquarters in California over the weekend. The flamethrowers went like hotcakes when they went on sale in January. They sold out in just four days. And all 20,000 were sold. This raised about $10 million in revenue for Musk's tunnel boring start-up. Remember, he wants to do tunnels under L.A. Musk tweeted the less than serious terms and conditions that come with the flamethrower, "please use as directed to avoid unintentionally burning things down," good advice.All right. Then there is this, the internet buzzing about this story, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau raising eyebrows with this footage from the G7 Summit. This video appears to show one of his eyebrows slipping out of place. Now, social media is loving this, many people are accusing Trudeau of, yes, wearing fake eyebrows. Former Governor of Arkansas, Fox News Contributor, Mike Huckabee, a friend of our show tweeted, "Breaking wind from CNN, President Trump announces new tariffs on fake eyebrows!"One comedian tweeted this, "Justin Trudeau wears fake eyebrows that fell off after he met with Trump at G-7. Art of the Deal Chapter 19: Brow meeting."(LAUGHTER)CASONE: Some people are trying to offer explanations for what looks to be a cosmetic issue for the -- it sort of appears unflattering lighting could be the real culprit, maybe the real? There's a big debate right now. I've studied this, you know, constantly for the last 10 minutes. I think it's fake, I actually do think it's fake.BARTIROMO: But you think it was fake eyebrows.CASONE: Well, yes.BARTIROMO: He wears fake eyebrows?CASONE: Because another picture from earlier in the G7 that I saw that looks like it's kind of falling off his face.BARTIROMO: I don't know what to say about that. I mean, women wear fake eyelashes, we know that, but Dagen, what do you think of --MCDOWELL: Oh, I've got fake eyelashes on right now.BARTIROMO: Yes. What do you think about the eyebrow? What about the eyebrow?MCDOWELL: Well, I'm not going to be throwing stones.CARTER: Somebody is saying (INAUDIBLE) eyebrow pencil.MCDOWELL: No, you -- not pencil. You need to use the powder. The powder makes it look less fake. If you use a brush --BARTIROMO: But that looks like it's an actual like something stepped on it.CARTER: Looks like a caterpillar.ROSCHELLE: Yes.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: Pencil or something or brush would have been better.MCDOWELL: Having had -- having had Brooke Shields caterpillar eyebrows in the 80s, nothing wrong with that.BARTIROMO: OK.ROSCHELLE: These are real, by the way, for the record, all right?BARTIROMO: We're going to have to start checking eyebrows. Coming up, new details about Facebook reportedly brokering deals to get user data well after 2015 when the company claims to have stopped the practice. The worrisome new report this morning, next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Amazon is under fire this morning after a watchdog group raises questions about a Foxconn factory that makes Amazon devices. Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, looking at markets this morning. Nic, good morning to you.NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria. So, we're seeing Amazon under fire this morning, and this is all on a nine- month investigation, a 94-page report about what's going on at a Foxconn factory. This particularly factory back in 2010 had some suicides, this is also where Apple makes the iPhones but now they're looking at these allegations from everything from overtime of hundred hours, these conditions in which the workers worked excessive hours, low wages, inadequate training, overreliance on these temporary workers -- 40 percent of which are temporary workers. Amazon has said in a statement, they looked at this particular factory back in March and said that they saw two issues of concern, that they requested Foxconn correct, but now they are under fire for this, obviously, inhumane and rights violations. The stock is down a quarter of one percent this morning.And then, Facebook, you just mentioned it going into the break, talking about how Zuckerberg back in 2015 said to Congress, it cut off developers' broad access to information on users' friends. Well, after this Wall Street Journal report and Facebook officials and sources, it turns out it's not necessarily the case. In fact, a small number of developers have had access to you and your friends and their phone numbers, so it's under fire this morning, down one-third of one percent. And just on a different note, on the positive side, you see it 188.57, that's where it's closed. KeyBank this morning put a 245 price target on this one, and this all about its baby Instagram, just saying that it's seeing obviously the advertising revenue growth potential there, opportunities to monetize on that, and seeing over a billion users forward that in 2018, over weight 245 target from KeyBank on Instagram for Facebook. Back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Nicole, thank you so much. Coming up, final thoughts from this all-star panel. Stay with us. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: All right. Welcome back. Big show today ahead of this unprecedented summit. Let's get some final thoughts this all-star panel. Lee Carter?CARTER: I'm fascinated to see how things are going to play out. Three out of four Americans right now are expecting the President to really deliver in this North Korean summit, and I want to -- I want to see if that's going to play out. Also, really interested to see what they make of the tariffs comments at the G7.BARTIROMO: Yes, that was incredible, those tariffs comments. Mitch Roschelle?ROSCHELLE: Yes, on the summit, we have the ECB, we have the Fed, we have the I.G. report, and we've got the outcome of the Time Warner-AT&T trial.BARTIROMO: That's it?ROSCHELLE: And the U.S. Open.(LAUGHTER)ROSCHELLE: Busy week.BARTIROMO: What a week. Dagen?MCDOWELL: Right. And adding to that, we have a real rout going on in emerging market assets with Brazil in collapse last week. You know, it'll be interesting to play out with the backdrop of everything going on in the news this week, if that has any impact on the market.BARTIROMO: And, of course, we've got all of that coming up tomorrow as well as all of the details on this unprecedented summit in North Korea. Join us tomorrow 5:00 a.m. Eastern, one hour earlier than normal. Join us for our special coverage. Thanks, everybody, great show.CARTER: Thanks so much.BARTIROMO: We'll see you tomorrow. "VARNEY & COMPANY" --MCDOWELL: Love you.BARTIROMO: Love you right back. "VARNEY & COMPANY" begins right now. Charles Payne in for Stuart this morning. Take it away, Charles.PAYNE: Thank you very much. Good morning, Maria. Good morning, everyone. I'm Charles Payne. Stuart will be back tomorrow, but we've got a lot of big stories for you today. President Trump arriving in North Korea for his big summit with Kim Jon-un.Load-Date: June 11, 2018End of Document

Continue reading Electronic Security Market Share 2017 Global Industry Size, Growth, Demand, Segment, Statistics & Forecast to 2024Latest industry research report on: Global Electronic Security Market| Industry Size, Share, Research, Reviews, Analysis, Strategies, Demand, Growth, Segmentation, Parameters and Forecasts.The state and central governments of various countries are placing high focus on the development and adoption of advanced systems in high-traffic locations such as public roads, transit stations, and malls, contributing to the growth of the electronic security market. For instance, the Indian government in 2014 set up a USD 125 million fund solely devoted to the prevention of sexual violence among women through the installation of security equipment such as surveillance systems at high-risk public locations. These hardware systems are equipped with video analytics and advanced algorithms that allow the detection of criminals. Furthermore, technological advancements have also aided in the improvement of existing technologies such as high-resolution 4k cameras and IP surveillance units. Electronic Security Market size is set to exceed USD 60 billion by 2024; according to a new research report.Get Discount @https://www.marketstudyreport.com/check-for-discount/668596/?utm_source=ICN&utm_medium=SPCrime rates across the world are heavily impacted with the rising penetration of these systems in residential and commercial settings and is anticipated to drive the electronic security market growth. End-users across the world are replacing conventional security systems such as guards and physical body checks with high-tech solutions. Physical body checks in malls and airports can be cumbersome and increase customer discomfort, primarily among women. X-ray body scanners, on the contrary, requires the person to pass through an electronic frame.The rising trend of the development of smart cities in countries such as China and India is contributing to the high growth of the electronic security market. For instance, the Chinese government has undertaken large construction projects for the development of smart cities imbued with advanced security solutions in cities such as Dalian, Hangzhou, Nanjing, and Tianjin. The rise in traveler population across the world is also leading to the growth of the electronic security market.The surveillance and alert system market is anticipated to exhibit substantial growth during the forecast timeframe. The reduction in component and raw material costs is contributing to the decline in the electronic security market price trend. Remote monitoring systems are increasingly finding application in developed regions such as U.S and Western Europe. Installing a home security solution with remote monitoring capabilities allows the homeowner to access security cameras and video units situated inside the residential location in real-time.Public-sector applications are the largest revenue-generating segment. Various government bodies are making use of advanced solutions for surveillance and criminal detection applications. For instance, in September 2017, a police department in Arkansas was reported to be using drones for highly specialized missions such as the tracking of a suspect or obtaining an inside view and additional information in a hostage situation.Request a Sample Copy of Global Electronic Security Market Research Report @https://www.marketstudyreport.com/request-a-sample/668596/?utm_source=ICN&utm_medium=SPThe North America electronic security market is projected to dominate the global business landscape owing to the government initiatives to integrate these systems into their public safety segment. For instance, the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 contains provisions to make the unmanned aerial systems (UAS) licensing process easier and quicker for law enforcement officials.

PRINCE NEO, Part Three of Chronicles of Ethereum, Published by Strategic CoinGlobeNewswireApril 17, 2018 Tuesday 10:06 AM PTCopyright 2018 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: PRESS RELEASESLength: 471 wordsBodyNEW YORK, NY, April  17, 2018  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Strategic Coin, a leading crypto-research and advisory company, today published Part Three: "PRINCE NEO" of the company's five-part, in-depth research series entitled: Chronicles of Ethereum. Part One of Chronicles of Ethereum, titled: ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Protocol," introduced the mastermind behind Ethereum. Published on March 20, Part Two, "Return to Classic," delved into Ethereum's differences with Ethereum Classic. Today, "PRINCE NEO" is available on the Strategic Coin website."PRINCE NEO" examines the evolution of China's first public blockchain. The NEO platform, started by Da Hongfei, was designed to satisfy the needs of existing enterprises and cater to Chinese government regulators and authorities, a very different approach when compared to Ethereum's focus empowering decentralized communities of individuals. The publication concludes with a table comparing the two technologies based on ten different key criteria.The study also examines how NEO strategically entrenched itself as a business-friendly blockchain poised to thrive in the world's largest blockchain restricted population. Strategic Coin's Director of Research, Sam Lee, stated: "Today's publication of "PRINCE NEO" is perfectly timed to offer insights into blockchain as it evolves in The People's Republic of China. Recent events in China underscore the power and controversies surrounding blockchain, which will face challenges and regulations during its adaptation. As the world's second largest economy, according to the most recent figures from the World Bank, China will have a tremendous impact on the application of blockchain. We hope readers will download our publication and become more educated about NEO, which is attempting to position itself as the de facto Chinese public blockchain in a market handling approximately $1 trillion in digital payment transactions annually." About STRATEGIC COIN:Strategic Coin is a premier provider of market and sector research, strategic consulting, and token launch services to the blockchain industry.

What Should Really Matter to Investors Now: Whiplash Headlines or Earnings?RealMoneyApril 10, 2018 Tuesday 7:36 AM EDTCopyright 2018 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1375 wordsByline: Stephen GuilfoyleHighlight: A potential stabilizing force for the stock market arrives this week -- and have I got an idea for you.Body"Headlines, in a way, are what mislead you because bad news is a headline, and gradual improvement is not"-- Bill GatesEquity markets rallied hard last Thursday. That night the president unveiled his ideas on expanding tariffs on Chinese imports. Friday morning, markets opened deep in the hole, and kept on going. Treasury Secretary Mnuchin spoke out, and markets got even worse ... until around 3 p.m. ET. Markets then promptly rallied sharply into the closing bell. Traders waited on Sunday evening. All expected that China might drop a couple of sharp words on the Sunday night futures markets, in order to amplify their intent. Nope. Not to be. Equities then roared into the new week. Huzzah, Monday was a "risk on" session... until around 2 p.m. ET.The worm turned yet again. Stocks sold off hard into the closing bell. The catalyst for this particular bout of selling? The president's personal lawyer had just seen his office, home and a hotel room raided by the FBI. Uh oh.Wait !! There's more. Overnight, in a much anticipated address, China's President Xi, while not mentioning the United States or President Trump, announced that plans are now under way to increase the economic liberalization of China. Xi struck a conciliatory tone, referencing greater foreign access to his nation's financial, and manufacturing sectors, while reducing tariffs on imported vehicles. Is now the time when China finally embraces the protection of intellectual property rights? That is, after all, the core of the quarrel at hand. Everyone back in the pool!! Equity index futures once again took off, this time to the upside.Split PersonalityIt would appear in 2018, that long gone are what traders used to consider to be either "up days" or "down days." The terms "risk on" and "risk off" are used to describe moves in the modern era, not days or even more ridiculously... weeks. Headline risk comes hand in hand with a volatile administration in Washington, that regularly rattles the cages of some investors. Now, throw in, ever-changing responses from the Chinese government, pervasive geo-political risk that is currently centered on Syria, and the circus that seems to be landing squarely on Facebook's  Mark Zuckerberg. Traders are left wondering just what matters right now.A great deal of the current state of volatility obviously has to do with the withdrawal of monetary accommodation. This may not be the catalyst for volatility, but this is the environmental change that no longer subdues market volatility. As the Fed tries to normalize, there is more and more reason to watch headlines. It's not just us humans watching. Not even close. Automated trading has easily taken the lead in these markets, and will pick up on keywords, making the 24-hour news cycle the dealer of speed, and the catalyst of over-reaction.I do not see any way to put this particular monster back inside the box. Oh, Pandora. A stabilizing force could... should be earnings. Wall Street looks for another quarter of double-digit earnings expansion. The belief is that we will see more revenue growth, but more importantly thanks to the implemented tax cuts on top of a regime that supports deregulation, it will be margin expansion that investors watch closely.Current ConditionI wish that I could tell you that earnings will matter more so than swirling headlines. The fact is that earnings will matter on a case by case, or maybe even a sector by sector basis. That will come with the power to improve investor sentiment (or hurt it), but those headlines will continue to cause the seismic shifts (rotations) that we have seen in market behavior.How to deal with this? One must, in my opinion, anchor one's portfolio. One must also learn how to hedge through the options market, as well as through diversification. One must also become more comfortable with a heightened level of intra-day volatility. There is no way around that one, other than exiting the marketplace. In other words, if the suddenly larger swings in your P/L ratio bother you, then you are playing this game deeper than is your tolerance for risk.Fortunately, this a problem easily handled. Getting this condition under control is as easy as cutting back on one's open positions even if this is not the right price. At what price I ask, the quality of life? Precious, I would think.Dawn of The SeasonOnce upon a time, I used to fancy myself a trader that focused on the financials. As a professional, I morphed into other arenas by necessity. The tech space became my darling, After that, it became aerospace and defense that caught my fancy. However, a piece of my heart still looks back at the banks, and sees them in the way an old beau might look at a picture of someone they used to know.That said, I never completely abandoned the space. I remain long Citigroup  , I am flat KeyCorp  , having managed to maximize that trade earlier this year. Recently, your pal even reloaded his Goldman Sachs  long after having trimmed that position appropriately. That, friends, is based on my belief that volatility will allow this legendary firm to reclaim its reputation. This one, I'll watch with great anticipation. They report on Tuesday, April 17. My trigger finger itches now.What if a trader wanted to "play" this Friday's earnings? I've already told you that I am long Citi. That long position is there for strategic reasons, namely the firm's pledge to return $20 billion to shareholders this year. Nothing playful about that. Know who I haven't held in a long time, and kind of missed the boat on? JPMorgan Chase  , that's who. Hmm.Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase are holdings in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio.Want to be alerted before Cramer buys or sells C, GS and JPM? Learn more now .Playing JPMorgan Into EarningsOne can see that the name currently trades about two bucks below its 50-day simple moving average, and below where it has traded for most of the year. Technically, the stock has fallen below trend and has seen resistance at the lower bound of its broken Pitchfork model. Relative Strength is mediocre. The daily MACD (moving average convergence divergence) looks poised for some short-term positivity, but Money Flow remains dreadful.My Trade IdeaObviously, markets are volatile, and these last sales, or strike prices may have to be adjusted once the bell rings, but to simplify, I am using Monday's closing prices, and we'll use minimal lots for the example.-- Purchase 100 shares of JPM at or close to the last sale of $110.40.-- Sale of one $115 January 2019 call at or close to the last sale of $7.00-- Sale of one $90 January 2019 put at or close to the last sale of $2.77.The trade has the investor laying out the $110.40 for the equity. The trader has also raised $9.77 in revenue, reducing the net basis to $100.63. The trader has limited upside profit in the equity position, as the shares might be called away at $115 in January. The trader has also exposed him or herself to being forced to buy another 100 shares at $90 in eight months if the shares are trading below that price at the time of expiration.Of course, to avoid that scenario, the trader might also buy back the options positions as time premium withers.The beauty of this trade is that the stock price would have to drop by nearly ten bucks for the trader to actually net lose money. Even wrong, the trader would still have eight months to be right, all the while the short options positions, in theory, would not lose any value over time other than the difference between the strike prices and the equity last sale.

House passes $675B defense spending billPolitico.comJune 28, 2018 Thursday 6:27 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 908 wordsByline: ghellman@politico.com,  (Gregory Hellman)BodyThe House easily passed $675 billion in defense spending Thursday after lawmakers tacked on provisions to bar the Pentagon from doing business with the Chinese telecom firms ZTE and Huawei and to pave the way for a dual purchase of aircraft carriers by the Navy.The vote was 359-49, with 137 Democrats joining all but three Republicans to pass the fiscal 2019 defense appropriations bill. The legislation would continue Republican-led efforts to build up the military. Rep. Kay Granger (R-Texas), who chairs the House Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, called the legislation the "next critical step" in boosting U.S. military might."The priorities funded in this bill not only stop the erosion, but also enable our military to restore and increase their competitive advantage," Granger said on the floor.The House appropriators struck first in the annual defense appropriations process, breezing through just over 50 amendments in three days of debate. The Senate Appropriations Committee is considering its version of the Pentagon funding bill Thursday. And Senate leaders are eyeing combining it with legislation funding labor, health and education programs to ease its consideration on the floor.Before passing its bill, the House adopted by voice vote an amendment from Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) to bar funding for the Pentagon to procure goods and services from ZTE and Huawei, which Democrats and Republicans alike have called a risk to national security."Time and time again, we have seen that these companies, along with many others, abuse and manipulate their placement in the market to attack sensitive American communications, the technology sector as a whole and our national critical infrastructure," Gallego said. "There is no disagreement on this point."The Trump administration stirred up controversy earlier this month when it struck a deal with ZTE to lift sanctions on the company. And since then, lawmakers have sought to limit the companies, which have ties to the Chinese government. Defense policy legislation passed by the House and Senate contain varied bans on the Pentagon and other government agencies doing business with ZTE and Huawei.But the mostly amicable floor debate dissolved into an outright food fight between appropriators and their Armed Services counterparts over a pair of costly shipbuilding proposals.Appropriators beat back by a wide margin,144-267, an amendment from Reps. Joe Courtney (D-Conn.) and Rob Wittman (R-Va.) to increase advance procurement funding for the Virginia-class submarine by $1 billion. The measure was aimed at pressing the Navy to build a third sub in each fiscal 2022 and 2023."We are losing submarines because we are not building them fast enough to replace the ones that are retiring," Wittman argued. "Are we willing to look at our children and grandchildren and tell them when we had a chance to do something, we didn't do it?"Wittman and Courtney, who lead the House Armed Services Seapower Subcommittee, contended the measure is needed to build more subs faster. It drew opposition from both House appropriators and Pentagon brass. Opponents warned the proposal would eat into other shipbuilding programs and would stick the Navy with a bill in the billions of dollars when the subs are built.The House, however, adopted another amendment from Wittman and Courtney, over appropriators' objections, to permit the Navy to procure two aircraft carriers simultaneously, mirroring the House-passed defense policy bill.The bill would allocate $606.5 billion for base Pentagon spending and another $68.1 billion to fund U.S. war efforts through the Overseas Contingency Operations account.The legislation most notably boosts funding to buy 93 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, 16 more than requested by the Pentagon, at a cost of $9.4 billion. Granger's Fort Worth congressional district is home to the Lockheed Martin plant that builds the next-generation fighters. The bill would also allocate $22.7 billion to build 12 new Navy ships, including three littoral combat ships, two more than requested. The White House criticized appropriators for funding the extra ships and insisted one LCS in the coming year, when combined with three procured in each of the past two years, would keep shipyards in Wisconsin and Alabama humming until the Navy awards a contract for a replacement ship, known as the frigate.The spending bill would also continue to grow the ranks of the military services by 15,600 active-duty and Reserve troops over this year. And it would fund a 2.6 percent troop pay raise, the largest in nearly a decade.The bill would provide $623 million for the JSTARS recapitalization program, which the Air Force wants to cancel because it says the aging surveillance planes are ill-equipped to survive against adversaries like Russia and China with advanced air defenses. The administration has instead called for investing in the Advanced Battle Management System, a new follow-on to JSTARS.The House also brushed aside administration objections to a provision that would fence funding for Pentagon cloud initiatives. It would restrict funding for both the so-called Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud initiative and the Defense Enterprise Office Solutions initiative until the Pentagon provides an acquisition plan to Congress. Amid concerns the Pentagon plans to contract with just one company, that plan should include opportunities for multiple providers.Load-Date: June 29, 2018End of Document

Judge denies bail for Hong Kong businessman in bribery caseAssociated Press InternationalMay 18, 2018 Friday 12:48 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 418 wordsByline: By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated PressDateline: NEW YORK BodyNEW YORK (AP) - A New York judge rejected bail on Thursday for a prominent Hong Kong businessman awaiting trial in a United Nations-linked bribery conspiracy, saying evidence in a prosecution that could result in decades in prison was strong enough to make him want to flee.U.S. District Judge Katherine B. Forrest rejected a $10 million bail package suggested by lawyers for Dr. Chi Ping Patrick Ho, saying she saw no conditions that would adequately ensure that the 68-year-old onetime home affairs secretary of Hong Kong would not try to leave a country where he has no assets and scant ties.She said Ho may want "to stand and fight" charges, but he also is facing "risks that would reasonably motivate him to flee."Ho was arrested in November on charges he conspired in October 2014 to pay bribes to the president of Chad and the Ugandan foreign minister so a Chinese energy conglomerate could secure business advantages.Prosecutors have said the conspiracy to bribe Uganda's foreign minister was created in the halls of the United Nations in New York while the foreign minister of the African nation served as the president of the U.N. General Assembly.Andrew Levander, one of Ho's lawyers, said Ho believes it is "important to vindicate his name even if it means spending the rest of his years in jail."Levander said his client has said in emails to a colleague that he would "rather die in jail than embarrass my family and sacrifice my reputation.""Flee at age 68? Where is he going to go?" Levander asked. "This man would not relish the life of a fugitive. This man wants to vindicate himself."Ho has pleaded not guilty to violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, international money laundering and conspiracy.Forrest listened to lengthy bail arguments even though she said at the outset that she believed the government had better arguments based on court papers it had submitted.Assistant U.S. Attorney Douglas Zolkind said it would be "extremely unlikely if not impossible" to extradite Ho from Hong Kong if he fled and made it there.He said the Chinese government is now more closely linked than ever to the energy conglomerate that was the source of the bribes.As she ruled on bail, Forrest attacked what she called one of Ho's chief defense arguments against the charges, citing evidence that there were communications in which it was made clear that the energy conglomerate would benefit from favors it offered.She also noted that the company paying Ho's legal fees has ties to China.Load-Date: May 18, 2018End of Document

THIS WEEK IN CONFLICTS: TAXPAYER SPENDING AT TRUMP PROPERTIES, THE KUSHNERS AND TRUMPS BACK OUT OF A DEAL AND HOW TRUMP IS LEAVING HIS MARK ON A PRESIDENTIAL KEEPSAKEStates News ServiceJune 30, 2018 SaturdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1025 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the Sunlight Foundation:by Lynn WalshThis week, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, campaign finance reports and other documents reveal political groups and taxpayers have spent at least $16 million at Trump-branded properties since President Donald Trump said he was running for president and the Kushner Companies and the Trump Organization will no longer be partners on an oceanfront development at the Jersey Shore.Donald Trump speaking at CPAC 2011 in Washington, D.C. (Image Credit: Gage Skidmore)Paying the PresidentSince President Trump said he was running for president in late 2015, his campaign, Republican organizations and government agencies have spent at least $16.1 million at Trump-branded hotels, golf courses and restaurants, according to a new data project by ProPublica.The news organization used campaign finance reports, government spending reports and federal agency expenditure records obtained by Property of the People, a Washington D.C.-based transparency group, to total up the amount of money spent by the organizations."Because Trump's business empire is overseen by a trust of which he is the sole beneficiary, he profits from these hotel stays, banquet hall rentals and meals," the article reads.More than 84 percent of what ProPublica tracked was spent by President Trump's campaign. At least $2.1 million was spent at Trump-branded properties by Republican Senate and House political committees and campaigns, according to the data.Search the database here to dig in deeper.Photo of President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping posing for a selfie in November 2017. (Image Credit: U.S. Embassy Canberra)"Serious Concerns" but No InvestigationRemember the group of 60 Democratic lawmakers that asked the Office of Government Ethics to investigate a Chinese-government owned company's involvement in a Trump-branded project in Indonesia?Well, the lawmakers have received a response."Under the Constitution, the primary authority to oversee the President's ethics rests with Congress and ultimately, with the American people," David Apol, acting director and general counsel at the ethics office wrote. Apol said while some of President Trump's business dealings "raise serious concerns" his office lacks the authority to launch an investigation.As the Washington Post reports, Apol told the Democratic lawmakers, "at the outset, I agree that the information cited in your letter raises serious concerns," however he said his office has "no authority to opine on Emoluments Clause issues."The Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution prohibits public officials from receiving anything of value from foreign governments, including foreign government-owned businesses, without the approval of Congress. One emoluments case against President Trump was dismissed by a trial-level judge in New York, but is on appeal. Another emoluments case brought by state attorneys general in Washington, D.C., and Maryland is ongoing. They claim hotels and event space in their states have lost business to the Trump International Hotel in D.C.Jared Kushner, Senior Advisor to President Donald J. Trump, speaks Lt. Gen. Stephen J.

"It was the first hotel the Trumps managed that did not carry their name. And its suburban location contrasted with the five-star urban high-rises synonymous with the Trump hotel brand, though the Trumps had hotel management experience that the Kushners lacked, and the family connection helped bring them together."The companies also killed an arrangement set-up to have the Trump Organization managing a hotel in Livingston, N.J., Kushner's childhood hometown, according to the New York Times.More conflicts of interest in the newsTrump Leaves His Mark on a Presidential KeepsakeZinke's sock tweet may have violated U.S. campaign lawSon of U.S. Envoy to China Used Trump Ties to Lure BusinessCorruption in the Trump Administration Is SpreadingAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez Says Donald Trump Should be Impeached Over Emoluments Clause Violations from Day One of his PresidencyAmid Signs of Cronyism, Nepotism, and Conflicts of Interest,' Watchdog Demands Probe of Trump-ZTE DealingsBooker asks how Trump can pick Supreme Court justice while Russia probe continuesDonald Trump's IRS Nominee Didn't Disclose He Owned Multiple Properties In Trump HotelPresident Trump's money-making power is as unprecedented as his wordsAbout this ProjectSunlight's "Tracking Trump's Conflicts of Interest" presents a comprehensive, free, searchable database detailing all of President Donald J.Trump's known business dealings and personal interests that may conflict with his public duties as president of the United States.

Global Syngas Chemicals Market Briefing 2018 - ResearchAndMarkets.comBusiness WireJune 20, 2018 Wednesday 8:35 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Business Wire, Inc.Distribution: Business EditorsLength: 442 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "Syngas Chemicals Global Market Briefing 2018" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The Syngas Chemicals Global Market Briefing 2018 provides strategists, marketers and senior management with the critical information they need to assess the global syngas chemicals market.Syngas chemicals are primarily produced from synthesis gas, a gaseous mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. The prime compound obtained from catalytic reaction of syngas is methanol. Methanol is further utilized to produce other industrially important chemicals such as formaldehyde, and acetyls.Asia-Pacific was the largest region in the syngas chemicals market in 2017, accounting for 37.2% share in the market. This was due to persistent demand from the infrastructure sector from China, India and Southeast Asian nations.North America was the second largest region in the syngas chemicals market in 2017, accounting for 22.5% share in the market. This can be attributed to presence of numerous gasification facilities to fulfil the demand for energy.Middle East was the smallest region in the syngas chemicals market in 2017, accounting for 4.0% share in the market.Coal gasification as feedstock is being widely used to increase petrochemicals production in general and specifically syngas. Petrochemical companies in China developed coal-based liquid fuels as a raw material to reduce its dependency on imported oil. The Chinese government is also encouraging petrochemical companies to use coal as feedstock to reduce oil and gas imports. Chinese and Indian companies should adopt coal gasification technologies to reduce dependence on imported oil and gas.Scope• Markets Covered: Acetyls; Formaldehyde and Resins; MTBE; and Methanol• Time Series: Five years historic and forecast.• Data: Market value in $ billions• Data Segmentations: Regional breakdowns, market share of competitors, key sub segments.• Sourcing and Referencing: Data and analysis throughout the report is sourced using end notesCompanies Mentioned• Celanese Corporation• China National Petroleum Corporation• East-man Chemical Company• LyondellBasell Industries Holdings BV• Methanex Corporation• Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC)• The Linde GroupFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/qf4nr3/global_syngas?w=4View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180620006285/en/CONTACT: ResearchAndMarkets.comLaura Wood, Senior Managerpress@researchandmarkets.comFor E.S.T Office Hours Call 1-917-300-0470For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call 1-800-526-8630For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900Related Topics: Biofuelshttp://www.businesswire.comLoad-Date: June 21, 2018End of Document

LONDON MARKET EARLY CALL: Higher Call Ahead Of UK Unemployment DataLive Briefs PRO Global MarketsApril 17, 2018 Tuesday 2:02 AM ESTCopyright 2018 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 732 wordsBody Stock prices in London are seen opening slightly higher on Tuesday, following a solid performance by US markets overnight, ahead of UK unemployment data at 0930 BST.  IG futures indicate the FTSE 100 index is to open 17.80 points higher at 7,216.00. The blue chip index closed down 0.9%, or 66.36 points at 7,198.20 on Monday. "Europe is taking the lead from the US, with European bourses pointing to a stronger start on the open, as investors take news of a possible military cyber-attack from Russia on millions of homes and business and infrastructure in the US and the UK in their stride, for the time being. This will remain a closely watched headline with the potential to weigh heavily on stocks," says London Capital's Jasper Lawler. Britain and the US have issued a formal alert about "malicious cyber activity" by Russia amid warnings that relations with Moscow have hit an all-time low.The UK National Cyber Security Centre combined with the FBI and the US Department of Homeland Security to issue an unprecedented joint "technical alert" setting out the threat across the public and private sectors. Officials said the move had been planned for "some time" and was not directly related to the US-led missiles strikes over the weekend on Russia's ally Syria.However, NCSC Chief Executive Ciaran Martin said it was a "significant moment" in the fightback against Russian aggression in cyberspace while the White House vowed to use "all elements of national power" to combat the threat.It came as Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov warned East-West relations are now worse than during the Cold War following the Syria strikes and the bitter diplomatic row over the Salisbury nerve agent attack.The UK corporate calendar on Tuesday has full-year results from roadside assistance provider AA and from sportswear retailer JD Sports Fashion. There are also half-year results from Primark clothing chain owner Associated British Foods and a trading statement from emerging markets focused asset manager Ashmore Group.Sterling was firm quoted at USD1.4339 early Tuesday ahead of the unemployment data, than USD1.4326 at the London equities close on Monday. Overnight, the pound touched a high of USD1.4354 against the greenback - its highest since the Brexit referendum in mid-2016. Last month's figures from the UK Office for National Statistics showed the ILO unemployment rate eased to 4.3% in January from 4.4% in the three months to December. The jobless rate in the three months to January was the joint lowest since 1975 and the employment rate rose to a record high. The figure is expected to come in unchanged. "It has already been established that a significant number of Bank of England policymakers are expecting wages to start outstripping headline inflation in the coming months, and today's average earnings number for the three months to February, could well be the first sign post on the way to that becoming a reality," says CMC Markets chief market analyst Michael Hewson.Also still to come in the economic calendar there is Italy inflation and trade data at 0900 BST and 1000 BST, respectively. In the afternoon there are US housing starts figures at 1330 BST. In the US on Monday, Wall Street ended higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing up 0.9, S&P 500, up 0.8% and Nasdaq Composite ending 0.7% higher.Ahead, banking giant Goldman Sachs will report first-quarter earnings before the start of trading on Tuesday.The Japanese Nikkei 225 index is flat Tuesday. In China, the Shanghai Composite is down 0.8%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is down 0.4%.China's economy showed a robust year-on-year growth rate of 6.8% in the first three months of 2018, the country's statistics bureau said, just as Beijing became embroiled in an escalating trade spat with the US.The economic results were in line with GDP growth of 6.8% reported in the last quarter of 2017. The world's second-largest economy beat expectations to grow by 6.9% in 2017, helped by surging foreign trade and retail sales.This year, the Chinese government has set an economic growth target of around 6.5% as it aims to shake up state-controlled industries, expand the high tech sector and boost domestic consumption. Although, the results announcement was overshadowed by trade frictions with the US, which has threatened punitive tariffs on USD150 billion worth of Chinese imports.Load-Date: April 18, 2018End of Document

Entasis Therapeutics and Zai Lab Announce Exclusive License Agreement in Asia-Pacific and Global Strategic Development Collaboration for ETX2514; Collaboration will facilitate enrollment of pivotal global Phase 3 trial of ETX2514 in combination with sulbactam for the treatment of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infectionsGlobeNewswireApril 25, 2018 Wednesday 5:00 AM PTCopyright 2018 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENTLength: 1911 wordsBodyWALTHAM, Mass. and SHANGHAI, China, April  25, 2018  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Entasis Therapeutics Holdings Inc., a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of novel antibacterial products, and Zai Lab Limited (NASDAQ:ZLAB), a Shanghai-based innovative biopharmaceutical company, today announced an exclusive license agreement for ETX2514 in the Asia-Pacific region and a global strategic development collaboration. Entasis' ETX2514 is a novel broad-spectrum intravenous inhibitor of Î²-lactamases, which are a major cause of antibiotic resistance. Entasis is developing ETX2514SUL, a fixed-dose combination of ETX2514 and sulbactam, for the treatment of a variety of serious multidrug-resistant infections caused by Acinetobacter baumannii, representing a healthcare challenge of global importance with over 200,000 occurrences estimated in China each year. ETX2514SUL is currently in Phase 2 development with plans to move into global Phase 3 clinical trials in the first quarter of 2019. Zai Lab will manage the portion of the Phase 3 trial conducted in China.Entasis Therapeutics Holdings Inc. Logo"Entasis remains committed to building a pipeline of life-saving treatments for patients affected by drug-resistant bacterial infections around the world. We are thrilled to partner with Zai Lab on the further development and potential commercialization of ETX2514SUL in the Asia-Pacific region, most notably in Greater China, where the rate of A. baumannii infections rank among the highest in the world," said Manos Perros, Chief Executive Officer of Entasis. "With their experienced leadership team, focus on innovation and established expertise and network within the infectious diseases arena, Zai Lab is the ideal partner to help bring ETX2514SUL to the numerous patients in the region who need a new effective treatment option. The collaboration will offset costs and enable enrollment of patients from China into our global Phase 3 clinical trial, further supporting our plans to rapidly progress ETX2514SUL to market.""Infectious diseases are a key focus area for Zai Lab due to the serious problem of multidrug-resistant infections both in China and globally. We are excited to collaborate with Entasis, a company that has extensive expertise and know-how in developing anti-infective products that address multidrug-resistant infections, and we look forward to working together to accelerate the global development of this potential life-saving therapy. We expect ETX2514SUL will be a positive addition to Zai Lab 's anti-infective portfolio, and we remain committed to developing a drug to combat multidrug-resistance, which currently poses a serious global threat to our society," stated Samantha Du, Ph.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Zai Lab. "This collaboration reinforces the strength of the Zai Lab team both in China and globally, and we believe will help us further progress on our mission to establish Zai Lab as an innovative, fully integrated, global pharmaceutical company."Under the terms of the agreement, Entasis has granted Zai Lab an exclusive license to develop and commercialize ETX2514SUL in specified countries in the Asia-Pacific region, including Japan. Entasis and Zai Lab will cooperate in conducting a pivotal Phase 3 trial in China, with Zai Lab taking the lead by conducting the screening, enrollment and treatment of patients, and coordinating development, registration and commercialization of ETX2514SUL in the territory. In addition, Entasis and Zai Lab have an option to collaborate on the development and commercialization of ETX2514 in combination with other active ingredients. A joint steering committee will be formed between the companies to oversee development, regulatory and commercialization activities in the Asia-Pacific territory. In addition to financial support for the portion of the Phase 3 trial conducted in China, Entasis will receive a $5 million upfront payment and is eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $7.6 million in near-term development milestones and up to an aggregate of $91.0 million in additional development, regulatory and sales milestone payments related to ETX2514SUL and other combinations, plus royalties.About Acinetobacter baumannii InfectionsA. baumannii is a Gram-negative bacterium causing severe infections associated with high mortality and has emerged as a cause of numerous global outbreaks, displaying ever-increasing rates of antibiotic resistance, which greatly limits treatment options. Consequently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has placed carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii at the top of its list of "Critical" priority pathogens for new antibiotics. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) also recognizes A. baumannii as a serious public health threat and estimates that 63% of A. baumannii are multidrug-resistant.In China, A. baumannii accounts for approximately 11% of total Gram-negative infections. Based on a national surveillance of over 1,300 hospitals in China, there are over 200,000 A. baumannii infections per year, although the actual incidence is estimated to be much larger. The resistance of A. baumannii to the carbapenem class of antibiotics has increased significantly, estimated at 60% in 2016, with some provinces as high as 70-80%. In other Asia-Pacific countries, such as Japan and Korea, it has also become an increasingly significant challenge for physicians. Due to the high rates of multidrug-resistant infections, the Chinese government has identified the goal of developing one to two innovative anti-infective drugs by 2020.About ETX2514ETX2514 is a novel broad-spectrum intravenous inhibitor of class A, C and D beta-lactamases. ETX2514 restores the in vitro activity of multiple ²-lactams against Gram-negative, multidrug-resistant pathogens. Entasis is initially developing ETX2514SUL, a fixed-dose combination of ETX2514 and sulbactam, for the treatment of a variety of serious multidrug-resistant infections caused by A. baumannii. Sulbactam is a generic ²-lactam that has intrinsic activity against A. baumannii but suffers from widespread ²-lactamase-mediated resistance. In preclinical studies, ETX2514 restored sulbactam antibacterial activity against A. baumannii. ETX2514 has completed single- and multi-ascending dose Phase 1 trials. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) designation and Fast Track designation to ETX2514SUL for the treatment of hospital-acquired and ventilator-acquired bacterial pneumonia and bloodstream infections due to A. baumannii.About EntasisEntasis is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of novel antibacterial products to treat serious infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Entasis' targeted-design platform has produced a pipeline of product candidates, including ETX2514SUL (targeting A. baumannii infections), ETX0282CPDP (targeting Enterobacteriaceae infections), and zoliflodacin (targeting Neisseria gonorrhoeae). Entasis is also using its platform to develop a novel class of antibiotics, non-²-lactam inhibitors of the penicillin-binding proteins (NBPs) (targeting Gram-negative infections).

China willing to defend its technological unicorns from the USCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 9, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 731 wordsBody Given the entry into the stock market of Chinese emerging companies, the government is willing to defend these unicorns of the technological sector, their best card against US hegemony.  The world has 236 unicorns, that is, those new private companies valued at more than 1,000 million dollars. According to a CBInsights classification, almost 30% of them are in China, and two thirds were born after 2015.  Lee: The attempt to avoid a EU-China trade war is going to phase two.  Above all, the list of unicorns susceptible to be introduced soon on the Stock Exchange is dominated by the Chinese, with a brilliant growth.  Among them, the pioneer of the payment through mobile telephony, Ant Financial-estimated value of 100,000 million dollars-, the champion of the VTC (rent of vehicles with driver) Didi-Chuxing and the Meituan-Dianpin meal delivery app -all estimated in tens of thousands.  For the Chinese authorities, it is a matter of not allowing this train to pass by and acting in such a way that these companies are listed on the Shanghai or Shenzhen stock exchanges.  Lee: The airline websites, the most recent battlefield between the US and China.  It's a paradox: among the Chinese internet mastodons, no one is listed in mainland China. Baidu and e-commerce giants Alibaba and JD.com chose Wall Street, and Tencent - video game expert and messaging operator WeChat - were introduced in Hong Kong.  The fault is the Chinese stock market regulations, which are very demanding, something that the communist regime now wants to flex to seduce the "unicorns".  The goal is for local investors to "benefit from the success of these startups," reinforcing the State's imprint on a "quasi-nationalized" technology sector through generous public subsidies, observes Christopher Balding, a professor at Beijing University.  Lee: The stellar year of the initial public offerings of Chinese technology companies.  For him, "Beijing controls each stage, within the framework of the China 2025 agenda".  This ambitious plan has the objective of making the technological champions emerge in the field of artificial intelligence, data analysis, microprocessors ... This is to the disgust of the United States that denounces state support, which distorts competition and the technology transfers imposed on foreign companies.  Flexibility  To be listed in Shanghai or Shenzhen, a company must register three consecutive years of benefits.  But this rule could be lifted for those technological firms valued at more than 3,000 million dollars.  Lee: The hot smartphone market in China is cooling.  And, in addition, certain companies that are listed in New York or Hong Kong would be authorized to issue "share certificates" (CDR) in the Mainland, alternative securities linked to their shares abroad.  For its part, the Shanganian stock exchange operator proposed in March a regulatory change to authorize the listing of companies that have a system of preferred shares.  This system, which allows the founders of a group to maintain control through actions with differentiated voting rights, is used by technological giants, but until now it does not exist in China.  Lee: The great Chinese technology, under the microscope for sexist ads.  The Hong Kong Stock Exchange recently changed its rules to authorize it, which has allowed it to attract the Chinese smartphone giant, Xiaomi, which will enter 10 billion dollars this year.  The details and exact timing of these measurements atRegulations in China remain vague, but Beijing had assured at the end of March that it was targeting "strategic" industries on the Internet and in the development of artificial intelligence.  Another advantage: markets of Chinese stocks, volatile and dominated by financial and industrial companies, would be reinvigorated.  Lee: China puts the world in trouble by refusing to take its garbage.  The arrival of unicorns "will increase liquidity and activity volumes," explains Jackson Wong, of broker Huarong International.  According to figures cited by the Wall Street Journal, the introduction of technology firms could contribute 50,000 million dollars in new titles to the Chinese stock exchanges.  And, according to Bloomberg, the groups authorized to issue CDRs could collect in this way up to about 235,000 million dollars. Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent have already expressed their interest in this. Load-Date: May 9, 2018End of Document

TIME TO RECYCLE SMARTERStates News ServiceJune 27, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 669 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: ARLINGTON, VA BodyThe following information was released by the National Waste & Recycling Association (NW&RA):The United States has exported a third of its recyclables to China for many years without any issues. It worked well. Americans like to recycle and China wanted the materials to feed their manufacturing base. However, beginning in 2013, China began to make a series of policies shifts to reduce the amount and types of recyclable materials into their country.In July of 2017, China announced a ban on the import of 24 materials, including mixed paper and mixed plastics. This ban went into effect on January 1, 2018, and was followed by the implementation of a policy limiting contamination to 0.5 percent. With these new policies, China is no longer available as a recycling market for mixed paper or mixed plastics. Unfortunately, there is not sufficient demand from other alternative markets to replace the capacity lost by China's import restrictions.China's new policies have significant impacts on global recycling, effectively creating more supply than the global market place can handle. As a result, many recyclers in the U.S. and in other countries are unable to find markets for paper, in particular. And because of this supply and demand imbalance, commodity prices have plummeted, while processing costs have increased as recyclers work to produce the high quality product that markets demand.The U.S. waste and recycling industry is committed to improving recycling quality. Many of our service and supplier member companies have already made major investments to develop and deploy equipment to remove as much contamination from the recycling stream as possible. They have invested in new screening and sorting technology, including robotics and machine vision, made improvements to existing equipment, and hired more workers to remove contaminants from the process by hand. They do all this as prices for recyclables fall.The waste and recycling industry has not stopped there. Many companies have embarked on education campaigns to remind customers what items can and cannot be recycled. About three in four Americans recycle. We all want to be "green" and protect the planet but a lot of us do not recycle correctly. Instead, we toss things in the recycling bin even when we don't know if it is recyclable. We hope that it will all just get sorted out at the plant.That's called "Wishcycling" and is leading to more and more contamination in the recycling stream. It is not uncommon to find pizza boxes stained with grease, old garden hoses, plastic bags and more plastic bags. These items cannot be recycled in the curbside bin. Food contaminates paper and cardboard making them less likely to be recycled. The hose and the plastic bags wrap around the machines that screen and sort items disrupting the operations and reducing the amount of material that can be recycled.Contamination has been a problem for a long time. However, with increasingly stringent standards, it becomes more important to try to limit it. We need the public to help us by recycling smarter. We need them to be thoughtful, intentional, and deliberate with their recycling. We need everyone's support to make recycling successful again.This effort requires a partnership between the recycling industry and the public. We need the public to help by changing behaviors and doing things differently. Start by keeping out the food and bags and check in with local municipalities or service providers to see what can be recycled.The waste and recycling industry is leading on this issue, continuing to meet with federal officials and responding to the multiple rules promulgated by the Chinese government. Most importantly, we are supporting our members' efforts to educate the public on how to recycle smarter so we can all get this right. If we want to continue to recycle then we must do it well.We all have a stake now in America's recycling future.Darrell K. Smith, Ph.DPresident and CEONational Waste and Recycling AssociationLoad-Date: July 6, 2018End of Document

BYD's super car models debut at Beijing Auto Show, sharing their e-platform technologiesPR NewswireMay 9, 2018 Wednesday 7:32 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1033 wordsDateline: BEIJING, May 9, 2018 BodyAt the recently concluded Beijing Auto show, new energy vehicles have once again become the highlight of the auto industry. As a globally iconic car company, BYD provided an excellent and influential exhibition at the Beijing Auto Show with the new generation of Tang, Qin Pro, the all-new concept car E-SEED, and the Song MAX DM, along with other models.Undoubtedly, as the global leader of new energy vehicles, BYD has attained several achievements not only in updating car models, but also in promoting revolutionary technologies for the whole industry. BYD Chairman Wang Chuanfu announced that BYD would launch an innovative E-Platform and DiLink Intelligent Network System at this auto show, which would completely reshape the layout of industry and the mobility of people in the future.The all new E-platform due to be launched by BYD, is its brand new BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle) platform, which comes with exclusive features of independent innovation, high integration and exceptional performance.The E-platform can be interpreted through a series of numbers "33111", where the double three means the "Three-in-one" Powertrain and "Three-in-one" Power Distribution Assembly. And the "111" indicates a motherboard, a panel and a battery. The "Three-in-one" Powertrain is the high integration of the driving motor, the electronic control and the transmission. And the "Three-in-one" Power Distribution Assembly represents the combination of DC-DC, OBC, and the PDC. The first "1" is a PCB board with ten-in-one control modules including instruments, air conditioners, stereos, smart keys among other features. While the second "1" refers to a large smart automatic rotatable screen equipped with the DiLink; and the last "1" represents one battery with long life and stability.Speaking about the brand new E-platform, Wang said: "The auto industry has been witnessing an unprecedented revolution, adopting the trends of internationalisation, electrification and intelligent network that are gradually turning into reality." BYD is the global trailblazer in launching innovative E-platform and DiLink. As an advocate and promoter of the revolutionary automotive electrification, BYD will share its technological innovation with major players in the auto industry globally, in order to accelerate the industrialization of electric vehicles, and jointly boost the auto electrification process.At present, the market of new energy vehicles in China has shown steady potential for further development. In order to further accelerate the growth of new energy vehicles, the Chinese government has also introduced a series of policies that are proving beneficial for the development of new energy vehicles. For instance, the implementation of the Measures for the Parallel Administration of the Average Fuel Consumption and New Energy Vehicle Credits of Passenger Vehicle Enterprises and the construction of 600,000 charging poles by the National Energy Administration in 2018, will further improve the supportive facilities, which are undoubtedly conducive to BYD's development.

Different from the industrial convention, BYD will open not only the In-Vehicle Information system, but also almost all the auto sensors, amounting to 341 sensors and 66 controls. A common mobile phone has only 10 sensors, yet it can generate tens of millions of applications. While the 341 automotive sensors will open through the BYD DiLink intelligent network system, from which a "super car ecological cycle" will be derived. This will help in updating BYD's auto intelligent networking.For the entire global automotive industry, DiLink intelligent network system is regarded as the first large-scale opening of the auto system. This will open unprecedented avenues for global developers to launch diverse innovations, which will affect the entire transport industry in a far-reaching way. In addition, BYD's customized automotive platform for the autonomous driving community will also accelerate the development of the auto-driving industry. The introduction of DiLink intelligent network system reflects Wang Chuanfu's extraordinary charisma.The BYD headquarter is located at the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, which is also known as China's Silicon Valley. Thus, the found of BYD is endowed with multiple characteristics of Silicon Valley, such as innovative, forward-looking, open, and technology-oriented. As a microcosm of the development of China's auto industry, BYD is growing rapidly, and it has bagged the global sales championship for new energy vehicles during 2015-2017 and China's new energy vehicle sales championship during 2014-2017.

Gartner Says Worldwide PC Shipments Declined 1.4% in First Quarter of 2018Targeted News ServiceApril 11, 2018 Wednesday 8:14 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 953 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: STAMFORD, Connecticut BodyGartner, a information technology research and advisory company, issued the following news release:Worldwide PC shipments totaled 61.7 million units in the first quarter of 2018, a 1.4 percent decline from the first quarter of 2017, according to preliminary results by Gartner, Inc. The PC market experienced a 14th consecutive quarter of decline, dating back to the second quarter of 2012.Asia/Pacific and the U.S. experienced declining shipments, while other regions saw some minimal growth, but it was not enough to drive overall growth for the PC industry. In the first quarter of 2018, PC shipments in Asia/Pacific declined 3.9 percent compared with the same period last year, while shipments in the U.S. decreased 2.9 percent."The major contributor to the decline came from China, where unit shipments declined 5.7 percent year over year," said Mikako Kitagawa, principal analyst at Gartner. "This was driven by China's business market, where some state-owned and large enterprises postponed new purchases or upgrades, awaiting new policies and officials' reassignments after the session of the National People's Congress in early March."In the first quarter of 2018, there was some inventory carryover from the fourth quarter of 2017," Ms. Kitagawa said. "At the same time, vendors were cautious in overstocking due to the upcoming release of new models in the second quarter of 2018 with Intel's new eighth-generation core processors."The top three vendors -- HP, Lenovo and Dell -- accounted for 56.9 percent of global PC shipments in the first quarter of 2018, compared with 54.5 percent of shipments in the first quarter of 2017 (see Table 1). Dell experienced the strongest growth rate among the top six vendors worldwide, as its shipments increased 6.5 percent.HP Inc.'s worldwide PC shipments increased 2.8 percent in the first quarter of 2018 versus the same period last year. In EMEA, HP Inc. recorded double-digit growth in both desktop and mobile PCs. This was contrasted with a small decline in other regions. HP Inc. was adversely impacted by declining demand in the U.S., which generally accounts for one-third of its total shipments.Lenovo's global PC shipments remained flat in the first quarter of 2018. Lenovo achieved 6 percent growth in EMEA and double-digit shipment growth in Latin America. However, in Asia/Pacific (its largest market), PC shipments declined 4 percent.After record holiday sales for consumer and gaming products in the fourth quarter of 2017, Dell continued to perform well in the first quarter of 2018. With double-digit shipment increases in EMEA, North America and Latin America, Dell grew in all regions except Asia/Pacific. Desktop and mobile PCs grew in equal measures, showing Dell's strength in the business segment.Rising ASPsThe average selling prices (ASPs) of PCs continue to rise. Acknowledging deceleration in the smartphone market, and uncertainty in PC replacement demand, component companies remain cautious about expanding their production capabilities. Therefore, persistent component shortages and a rising bill of materials continue to create an environment conductive to higher prices."In contrast to other DRAM-related price spikes, PC vendors are not reacting by reducing DRAM content. Rather they have passed the cost increase to consumers," Ms. Kitagawa said. "With fewer people buying new machines, manufacturers need to get the highest profit margin from each sale. To do that, they are raising the selling points and focusing on customer experience or perception of value."Regional OverviewIn the U.S., PC shipments totaled 11.8 million units in the first quarter of 2018, a 2.9 percent decrease from the first quarter of 2017. Dell moved into the No. 1 position in the U.S. based on shipments, as its market share increased to 29.1 percent. HP Inc. moved into the No. 2 position as its shipments declined 4.8 percent, and its market share totaled 28.4 percent in the first quarter of 2018 (see Table 2).PC shipments in EMEA totaled 18.6 million units in the first quarter of 2018, a 1.7 percent increase year over year. Enterprise shipments increased as many Windows 10 projects that were put on hold in 2017 began to be implemented. The fast approach of the compliance deadline for the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe, as well as earlier reports of cybersecurity breaches, made security a strong priority in the hardware refresh cycle among enterprises. Eurasia continued to be a bright spot for EMEA, as several countries, such as Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan, saw strong demand in the first quarter of 2018.PC shipments in Asia/Pacific totaled 21.9 million units in the first quarter of 2018, a 3.9 percent decline from the first quarter of 2017. As previously mentioned, the PC market in China drove the decline in Asia/Pacific. There is no significant sign of strong upgrading to the special version of Windows 10 from the Chinese government institutions. Consumer demand was weak as most buyers already took advantage of the aggressive promotions offered in the fourth quarter of 2017.These results are preliminary. Final statistics will be available soon to clients of Gartner's PC Quarterly Statistics Worldwide by Region program. This program offers a comprehensive and timely picture of the worldwide PC market, allowing product planning, distribution, marketing and sales organizations to keep abreast of key issues and their future implications around the globe.See table here: https://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3871149Document provided to Targeted News Service as a news release through an RSS feed.Contact: Christy Pettey, christy.pettey@gartner.comCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6242093 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: April 12, 2018End of Document

Using QR Codes with a proprietary encrypted reader, TNT will be able to track raw materials at the source, where the SKU and quantity are identified with an initial scan of the QR code.  Subsequently, various tracking points are established throughout the entire supply chain straight through to its final stop, the customer.  The Company tracks the product using a QR code that can only be identified by the Company's encrypted reader, so a chain of custody is established, and the transfer of the product will be registered on the Blockchain.  This same process can then be established and adopted by many different manufacturers across many different market segments.This revolutionary new TNT technology will change the manufacturing process and supply chain system at ZK International remarkably. The Company will use this technologyin the fieldby combining TNT technology with IoT devices.  Every ZK International device, whether it is a part of the manufacturing process or is in the field, is registered on a linked and secured ledger or blockchain to create a digital record, which cannot be altered. It ensures the safety, transparency and origin of all items located on that ledger.  David Christensen commented, "Track-n-Trace is one critically important component of the technology we are immediately in the process of implementing into our operations. Doing so is unique in our industry and presents a strong competitive advantage. Not only will we improve efficiencies and lower costs, we will continue to maintain strong relationships with current customers as well as develop new relationships globally.

Doing so is unique in our industry and presents a strong competitive advantage. Not only will we improve efficiencies and lower costs, we will continue to maintain strong relationships with current customers as well as develop new relationships globally.

ZK International & XSigma Adopt Pioneering New Technology to Revolutionize its Manufacturing CapabilitiesPR NewswireJune 21, 2018 Thursday 9:15 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1193 wordsDateline: WENZHOU, China, June 21, 2018 Body ZK International GroupCo., Ltd.(Nasdaq: ZKIN) ("ZKIN", "ZK International" or the "Company") and its subsidiary, XSigma Corporation (http://www.xsigma.io), is pleased to announce the third component of its licensed technology, which allows the adoption of innovative Blockchain technology into its manufacturing capabilities.This patent pending 'Track-n-Trace' (TNT) Blockchain solution will be integrated into ZK International's manufacturing and supply chain system, significantly improving the ability to follow all items from their source, track them with accountability and create a digital identity which cannot be manipulated. Using this Blockchain ledger to store these records creates a chain of trusted transactions that cannot be changed or counterfeited.Unlike the original method of keeping records in a database file stored on a single computer system, Blockchain is designed to be decentralized and distributed across a large network. This decentralizing of information reduces the ability of data tampering and creates trusted transactions and confidence in the accuracy of the information. In order for more data to be added to the chain, a cryptographic puzzle must be deciphered. This creates the block, then the solution is shared with all computer nodes on the network. Having the information to solve these computationally intensive puzzles is how transactions are validated and new blocks of data can be created and added to the chain. The combination of these complex transactions with multi-node verification is what ensures that we can trust every block of data in the chain.David Christensen, President of TNT Blockchain commented, "Blockchain technology is the future of supply chain solutions. The pioneers and innovators who embrace it and deploy it will clearly have the sustainable competitive advantage. ZK is leading the way by deploying these solutions internally and preparing the way for many future successes."Track -N-Trace Blockchain patent pending solutions are powered by TNT Blockchain Inc (http://www.tntblockchains.com).    About ZK International Group Co., Ltd.ZK International Group Co., Ltd. is a China-based designer, engineer, manufacturer, and supplier of patented high-performance stainless steel and carbon steel pipe products that require sophisticated water or gas pipeline systems.

Pelosi Issues Statement on President Trump's Plan on Chinese TradeTargeted News ServiceMay 29, 2018 Tuesday 8:10 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 236 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, issued the following statement after President Trump announced his plans to punish China for its trade practices:"President Trump campaigned on a promise to confront China's unfair trade practices, but his continued chaotic trade brinkmanship threatens to invite retaliation that harms American workers and farmers, and the American economy. Last week, the President revealed the utter hollowness of his promises by pledging American government resources to a Chinese company that has violated U.S. sanctions by selling technology to North Korea and Iran, and that is a known cyber security risk to the United States."Strong, smart and strategic action not reckless and rash floundering is needed to confront China's brazen trade cheating. Beijing's regulatory barriers, localization requirements, labor abuses, theft of trade secrets and counterfeiting of designs, anti-competitive 'Made in China 2025' policy and many other unfair trade practices threaten America's ability to compete both in China and with China around the world."While the President sells out American workers, Democrats are offering A Better Deal, with Better Jobs, Better Wages and a Better Future for all. We must work multilaterally and in concert with our allies for a full and comprehensive approach to China's abusive trade practices."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6308959 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: May 30, 2018End of Document

(USOTC:ALYI) is producing a brand new electric motorcycle based on BMW's classic R71 motorcycle with sidecar.  Alternet has launched a subsidiary, ReVolt Electric Motorbikes, that will integrate Alternet's patented lithium battery technology into a new line of Electric Motorcycles for both domestic and international markets.  ReVolt will start with the production of retro-classic designs for the US market and later introduce a utility daily driver for everyday transportation in developing economic regions.  The first retro-classic design electrifies the rich history of the BWM R71 motorcycle. The R71 represented an engineering feat with the move away from the conventional pressed steel frame bikes to the higher strength oval tube frame design which was easily able to cope with the additional stresses of a sidecar attachment.  Some version of the R7 has been in almost continuous production since the original design in the 1930's.  Some historians claim a similar Russian Military motorcycle, the M72, was extensively built based on designs stolen from BMW while others claim the designs otherwise came to Russia as part of a negotiated deal.  The Russians later shared the designs with their communist allies, China, and China produced the CJ750, still found in use in the Chinese Government today.  Even Harley-Davidson built its own version of the R71, called the XA, for the US Army and then later integrated R71 innovations into their mainstream line.     Global automobile sales in 2018 is expected to reach just 80 million units. The current global market for motorcycles, scooters and mopeds is approximately 130 million units per year resulting in $120 billion in annual sales.  Alternet's ReVolt Electric Motorbikes plans to become a world leader in the production of electric motorcycles by 1.) first establishing a manufacturing capacity and to then 2.) refine the Alternet Lithium Battery Technology through the production and sales of a fun, useful and affordable electric motorbikes based on classic motorcycle designs for the U.S. consumer market.  With a manufacturing capacity established and a lithium battery technology on the market, ReVolt Electric Motorbikes plans to begin delivering a line of daily driver electric motorbikes to developing economic regions.  Keep up with ReVolt's latest developments by checking back periodically to the company's website:  www.revoltmotorbikes.com   Learn more on the company's website:            www.otc-alyi.com or            www.lithiumip.com   Disclaimer/Safe Harbor: This news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Litigation Reform Act.

Instead, experience one of Europe's best kept secrets: the Faroe Islands. Spectacular secluded landscapes, millennia-old history, and a unique North Atlantic cuisine are just a few reasons this off-the-radar spot should be next on your list.Average airfare for summer travel from the US to the Faroe Islands is $1,193*.Instead of Singapore, try Hainan:China's Hainan Island is being called the "Hawaii of the East" and is even starting to garner comparisons to Dubai for its newfound luxury vibe. To promote tourism, the Chinese government recently launched a program granting 30-day visa-free access to the island for tourists from 59 countries including the United States. While there, check out the 350 ft. Buddhist statue on the shores of the South China Sea.Average airfare for summer travel from the US to Hainan is $1,343*.Instead of Prague, try Wroclaw:Poland isn't one of those countries you hear about tourists flocking to, but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be. Wroclaw is a beautiful city with rich history dating back as early as the 6th century. Don't miss the city's main square surrounded by colorful tenement buildings. The square was destroyed during World War II but was rebuilt to honor Wroclaw's medieval past. Average airfare for summer travel from the US to Wroclaw is $1,086*. Instead of Costa Rica, try the Azores:Black sand beaches, lush greenery, and volcanic peaks make the Azores the perfect backdrop for your next subtropical getaway. Despite being an easy flight from the east coast - under 6 hours from New York, Boston, and Providence - the Azores are still widely undiscovered.  Outdoor activities like hiking, biking, and surfing are popular activities for both locals and visitors.Average airfare for summer travel from the US to the Azores is $770*.Instead of Croatia, try Montenegro:Just across the border from Croatia, Kotor is a medieval town with slightly less exposure than Dubrovnik. The charming town is nestled in a fjord-like bay and is perfect for spending a day getting lost.Average airfare for summer travel from the US to Montenegro is $1,359. Instead of Dubai, try Marrakech:From the delicately painted tiles, to the colorful goods in the souks, to the winding alleys of the old town, Marrakech is a city just waiting to be photographed. Simply wandering around is your best bet for finding a shot that will wow your followers. Marrakech is also a great starting point for visiting the remote, snow-capped Atlas Mountain range.Average airfare for summer travel from the US to Marrakech is $1,206*.  By consistently monitoring travel trends, CheapOair's mission is to educate and aid consumers and travel professionals in both planning their travel accommodations and staying current on the most popular destinations.

Global Gasification Market Analysis, Growth, Trends & Forecast 2018-2023 - ResearchAndMarkets.comBusiness WireMay 24, 2018 Thursday 9:55 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Business Wire, Inc.Distribution: Business EditorsLength: 403 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "Global Gasification Market - Growth, Trends, and Forecast (2018 - 2023)" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.Irrespective of the increasing policies and regulations limiting emissions of pollutants and the concerns over price and availability of natural gas or oil or coal, the demand for low-cost power production in an environment friendly way is certain. Gasification is not only capable of producing power in an efficient and environment-friendly manner, but also supports the production of wide range of chemicals, fertilizers, liquid fuels, among others.In 2016, there were approximately 1,099 gasification projects with around 2,866 gasifiers, which are expected to increase further during 2018-2023.In spite of the high growth of renewables in the European region, natural gas is expected to maintain a significant share in its energy generation mix. Many countries in the European region remain dependent on the other regions for natural gas imports. With the expected increase in the demand for natural gas, implementation of gasification projects is expected to increase in Europe.The Chinese government's initiatives in its 11th and 12th five-year plans have boosted the gasification industry in the country. China produces more than 90% of its ammonia through coal gasification process, owing to the availability of huge amounts of inexpensive coal in the country.Companies Mentioned• Royal Dutch Shell PLC• General Electric Company• Siemens AG• Air Liquide SA• Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V.• ThyssenKrupp AG• Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd• China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation• Synthesis Energy Systems Inc.• KBR Inc.Key Topics Covered:1.

Huawei ready for 5G raceCE Noticias Financieras EnglishApril 18, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 638 wordsBody       SHENZHEN - As in a Formula 1 race where the cars wait for the green light to start and be able to position themselves in the best position on the track, the Huawei technological giant announced to be ready to win the next technological race: the deployment of the Fifth generation network (5G). In this technological competition the advantage is China followed by South Korea and in third position is the United States, according to the firm Mason and Recon Analytics. And it is precisely in Shenzhen, called the Silicon Valley of China, and Huawei headquarters, where this company is confident that it will win this race to offer its customers, mainly telecommunications operators, the technical and commercial feasibility to establish the 5G network. With this announcement, he officially begins the race worldwide for the domain of this network that triggers business opportunities valued at 23 trillion dollars. Erik Xu, Huawei's Itinerant CEO, assured that the 5G Network will revolutionize the lives of people and businesses. "These are the foundations of our vision and mission: Bring the digital to every person, home and organization for a completely connected and intelligent world," said Xu. Currently cellular traffic is, on average, 0.03GB per day, but in 2025 people will consume on average 1GB, Xu explained during his presentation with 600 technology analysts and media. This massive growth will be accompanied by the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that will be applied in all areas of Huawei. For example, said Xu, the AI ??will be able to correct and detect failures of the 5G Network avoiding manual maintenance of the network, which will imply an important saving for the operators. Smartphones will have the ability to "see, feel and listen to people", giving as an example the recently launched P20 phone that uses AI to take pictures with three lenses with an algorithm that produces virtually perfect images under any minimum light condition. Huawei took advantage of this annual event to present the document "The Global Vision of the Industry" with which it indicates where this sector will move towards the year 2025. William Xu, Global Director of Marketing of Huawei, assured that in the coming years it is foreseen an explosion of data use that will allow the development of assisted driving, the use of the cloud that will transform the way of doing business, and the explosion of virtual reality through the 5G Network. In this vision of the industry, there will be 40 billion smart devices of which 20 billion will be connected in real time. David Wang, president of Products and Solutions of Huawei, highlighted the possibilities that can be offered in this context as the creation of smart cities for traffic control or combat insecurity. He estimated that in a decade 200 million cars will be connected to the 5G Network and with Artificial Intelligence the cost of transportation will be reduced by up to 56 percent and the time in traffic will also decrease by 86 percent with smart cars and traffic lights. TRUMP AND HUAWEI United States President Donald Trump has put pressure on US telephone operators and sellers to the extent that Huawei is practically being expelled from this market. When questioned by the media on the subject, Erik Xu evaded criticizing the US policies that have accused Huawei that their networks and devices can be used by the Chinese government to spy. Xu assured that the US blockade is just another challenge that must be overcome. "The position of Huawei and mine has been very clear about the allegations of the United States (...) In Huawei we are focusing on fulfilling our work and we focus on delivering the best results to our customers.not only can we survive but flourish, "said Xu, who has repeatedly denied these accusations.       Load-Date: April 18, 2018End of Document

WHILE POLITICIANS CUT OPIOID PRESCRIPTIONS, FENTANYLWITH HELP FROM THE "DARK WEB" AND THE USPS BECOMES THE NUMBER ONE KILLERStates News ServiceMay 24, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 749 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Cato Institute:By Jeffrey A. SingerA May 22 story in Bloomberg News describes with painstaking detail the underground pipeline through which the powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl floods the US market. According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, while the Mexican cartel plays a role by using its well-established heroin and methamphetamine distribution networks, most of the fentanyl comes in to the US from China.The raw materials to make the synthetic opioids are cheap and they can be manufactured rather quickly in small laboratories. The laboratories are constantly creating new variations so as to skirt restrictions the Chinese government places on existing fentanyl analogs. Online distributors throughout China sell these products, making their transactions over the "dark web," often paid with cryptocurrency, and frequently ship the products to the US via the US Postal Service or United Parcel Service.Many dealers purchase and use pill presses to make counterfeit OxyContin or Vicodin pills and trick non-medical users into thinking they are buying the real thing. That's how Prince died. He preferred to abuse Vicodin (hydrocodone). Records show he never got prescriptions from doctors. He died from ingesting counterfeit Vicodin pills he obtained on the black market that turned out to be fentanyl.The DEA reports this is the way most fentanyl makes its way to the street. As we doctors know, most pharmaceutical-grade fentanyl made for medical use does not get diverted on to the streets. In fact, the forms usually prescribed to outpatientsskin patches, lozenges, buccal filmsare not very suitable for non-medical use.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that fentanyl was responsible for 26,000 overdose deaths in 2017. But already in 2016 fentanyl accounted for more than 20,000 of the roughly 64,000 total overdose deaths (which include cocaine, methamphetamine, and benzodiazepines). Heroin came in second with more than 15,000. In fact, for a few years now, fentanyl and heroin have accounted for the majority of overdose deaths. And a great majority of those deaths had multiple other drugs on board. In New York City in 2016, three-quarters of overdose deaths were from fentanyl and heroin, and 97 percent of overdoses had multiple other drugs on board46 percent of the time it was cocaine.Fentanyl overdoses in the US have been rising at a rate of 88 percent per year since 2013. Heroin overdoses have been increasing at a rate of 19 percent per year since 2014 after climbing 33 percent per year from 2010-2014. Meanwhile, overdose deaths from prescription-type opioids have been increasing at a stable rate of 3 percent per year since 2009.The National Survey on Drug Use and Health reports non-medical use of prescription opioids peaked in 2012, and total prescription opioid use in 2014 was lower than in 2012. And the survey repeatedly reports less than 25 percent of non-medical users see a doctor in order to get a prescription. Three-quarters obtain their drugs through a friend or family member or a drug dealer.Meanwhile, while all this is going on, policymakers in Washington and in state capitals seem intent on getting the opioid prescription rate down further. State-based prescription drug monitoring programs have succeeded in reducing the prescription of high-dose opioids by over 41 percent since 2010, the peak year of opioid prescribing. And opioid production quotas, set by the DEA, were reduced 25 percent last year and another 20 percent this year, generating acute shortages of injectables in hospitals across the nation that is harming patients.With all the evidence that the majority of non-medical users are not patientswith all the evidence that prescription rates have come down while overdose rates keep going upwith all the evidence of fentanyl and heroin flooding the black market and causing those deaths, it is time for policymakers to disabuse themselves of the false narrative to which they've been stubbornly clinging. This narrative blames the overdose problem on doctors prescribing pain relievers to their patients. The overdose problem has always been primarily caused by non-medical users accessing drugs in the dangerous black market created by drug prohibition. And our current restrictive policy is only driving up the death rate by pushing these users to more dangerous drugs while making patients suffer in the process.What's the definition of insanity?Load-Date: May 24, 2018End of Document

All Rights ReservedLength: 675 wordsByline: Jim Cramer and the AAP TeamHighlight: Jim discusses Darden's quarter and our decision to exit the position, Cimarex, Raytheon, 3M, and answers a question about the Bullpen!BodyIn today's Daily Rundown, Jim discusses Darden Restaurants'  quarter and our decision to exit the position (which you can read about ). Other stocks in the portfolio mentioned are Cimarex  , Raytheon  , 3M  , and the FANGs.Also, Jim answers a question a club member had about the Bullpen. To see the full list of the stocks in the Bullpen, please see .Scott GammHi everybody. You're watching Jim Cramer's Daily Rundown from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. And Jim, congratulations on exiting Darden with a gain.Jim CramerOh, thank you. You know, people really hated Darden at $82. We think the world of Gene Lee, we think the world of the Olive Garden. I think it helps. I've always called this a snob stock because I happen to love going to Olive Garden with my daughter. I like Longhorn and I particularly like Capital Grill. I know those are smaller, but the company's put together a great pastiche. But we're going to ring the bell, I mean, there's other things that we want to buy that are really in freefall and you want the capital to be able to buy them. Scott GammYou've just added VMware  to the bullpen, as well. Jim CramerYeah, VMware is doing exceptionally well. I think a lot of stocks are going to come down that are related to the cloud and maybe we get a chance to buy some.Scott GammAnd, actually, a member wants to know about the bullpen. Karen just wants an overview of what it is.Jim CramerIt's stocks that we're looking at that we think could come down and when they come down we want you to be ready. Now, some of them will come down and the reasons why they're down are not good. So, we don't necessarily want to buy them, but we're just taking a very hard look. And this is the way that we're able to figure out what's next, what we look at. And I might add Intel, I don't know. We have a lot of stocks in the bullpen, just go to the bullpen and you can see exactly what I mean. You've got to go look. You're watching the video because you have it. And there's tons of stocks in there. And any time you have a question about any individual one, just send it to us.Scott GammYeah, there's a tab on the left side of the screen that says "bullpen" and you can check all the holdings there. Meanwhile, Jim, Cimarex was upgraded by Bank of America.Jim CramerI mean look it's a bad day to upgrade because of OPEC. I think the Russians and the Saudis are going to increase. Saudis are under pressure from Trump. But I think Cimarex is by far the most undervalued oil. It's been hammered, hammered, hammered, hammered, relentlessly. You know we have stocks -- let me just be really clear -- we have stocks that I'm not giving up on. I'm not going to give up on Raytheon, because it is not Allergan AGN. I'm not going to give up on 3M, because it is not a classic failed industrial like GE  . It's a great American company. The sellers are overwhelming, that happens periodically. You have to just take some pain in those two because they're in secular positive.Scott GammJim, anything else you're watching on this Thursday? We've got the Dow down 150 points. Jim CramerWell, look, I think that the market has overheated and I think that when you see FANG down as much, you could reverse. Micron  reversed. I just want to stay very, very careful here. We do have money from Darden that we want to put to work. I mentioned some of the names that I said that we are not giving up on. It's obvious that people are saying that the China [trade] war is going to heat up this weekend. I know that we are going to say to the Chinese government that we simply do not want any of your companies to buy our companies -- that's about to happen. Stay tuned for that. But we do... it's a long day. And we're sticking by the companies that we want to buy. And I want to make that very very careful As I said in our last call, we recognize that these stocks are going down and we're going to pick at them on the way down because we think that they have a great future.Scott GammAlright. So, stay close to your bulletins. Jim, thank you so much.Load-Date: July 5, 2018End of Document

JONATHAN LYNCH NAMED RECIPIENT OF AMERICAN SOCIETY OF PLANT BIOLOGISTS AWARDUS Fed NewsMay 10, 2018 Thursday 8:31 PM  ESTCopyright 2018 HT Media Ltd. All Rights ReservedLength: 692 wordsBodyUNIVERSITY PARK, Pa., May 10 -- Pennsylvania State University issued the following news release:Jonathan Lynch, distinguished professor of plant science in Penn State's College of Agricultural Sciences, has been named the 2018 winner of the Dennis R. Hoagland Award for his work in improving scientific understanding of crop productivity and plant nutrition to improve production and food security.The American Society of Plant Biologists presents the award every three years to scientists who have made outstanding contributions to plant research in support of agriculture. The award is a tribute to Dennis R. Hoagland, professor of plant nutrition at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1913 to 1949 and a leading authority in plant and soil interactions.Lynch, a plant nutritionist and leading authority on root biology in important crops such as maize and common beans, will receive the award in July at the society's annual meeting in Montreal, Canada.In her nomination letter, Erin Connolly, professor and head of Penn State's Department of Plant Science, praised Lynch's "groundbreaking and transformative" work in understanding the basis of plant adaptation to drought and low soil fertility."Dr. Lynch is an exceptional scientist and is internationally recognized, not just for his contributions to the field but also for the immense impact this work has had on improvement of crop production in North America, Latin America and Africa," she said. "His work provides a platform for improving food security and the lives of people around the world."Connolly said Lynch's work in establishing a clear connection between root traits and the ability of the crop to obtain scarce nutrients and water is unique. Complementary research in the Lynch lab focuses on drought tolerance in crop plants and the role of root anatomy in this process."One of the key features of Dr. Lynch's work is his ability to employ a wide array of approaches and technologies to address the most critical questions," she said, explaining that he has developed new tools to facilitate discovery - in particular, his use of laser ablation tomography to phenotype root system architecture.He developed methods to assess root traits of crops grown under typical agronomic conditions in the field and to predict the effects of various root trait combinations using computer simulation models. This research will foster a better understanding of how plants respond to stress and nutrient availability in a real-world setting.Lynch and his collaborators, including Kathleen Brown, professor of plant stress biology, have identified novel root traits that have been used in bean, maize and soybean breeding programs all over the world, with a goal of improving crop health and yield."These types of studies are quite urgent given the rate of climate change and our need to feed a growing population," Connolly said.Lynch's extensive record of scholarly publishing includes 200 papers and numerous book chapters. He has received $24 million in grants since 2007, from sources such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Department of Energy, the National Science Foundation, McKnight Foundation, the Howard G. Buffett Foundation, U.S. Agency for International Development, and the Generation Challenge Program.In addition, Lynch has been recognized internationally. He was a recipient of the Dundee Medal in Plant Nutrition from the James Hutton Institute, Scotland, and the China Friendship Award, the highest recognition awarded to foreigners by the Chinese government and bestowed upon him by Premier Zhu Rongji. He is a Fellow of the Crop Science Society of America and served as chairman of the advisory committee on plant efficiency for the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research.Lynch joined the Penn State faculty in 1991. He holds a bachelor's degree in soils and plant nutrition from the University of California, Berkeley, and master's and doctoral degrees in plant physiology from the University of California, Davis.

Silicon Carbide Market Size Worth $4.48 Billion by 2020 | CAGR 16.1%: Grand View Research, Inc.PR NewswireMay 30, 2018 Wednesday 7:10 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 900 wordsDateline: SAN FRANCISCO, May 30, 2018 BodyThe global silicon carbide market size is expected to reach USD 4.48 billion by 2020, according to a new report by Grand View Research, Inc., registering a CAGR of 16.1% during the forecast period. Growing automotive, semiconductor, and aerospace industries are key drivers for market growth.     (Logo:https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/661327/Grand_View_Research_Logo.jpg)Increasing use of silicon carbide (SiC) in military applications is expected to boost demand over the forecast period. Regulatory amendments such as the U.S. Defense Protection Act for advancement and establishment of SiC for use in military operations will also benefit the market. In addition, increasing use of carbon fiber reinforced silicon carbide in disc brakes is expected to propel its demand in the automotive sector.The European Commission's announcement of USD 122.1 billion investment for development of semiconductors is expected to facilitate many investors to invest in the manufacturing of semiconductors. Therefore, demand for SiC is expected to grow in semiconductor applications as well.The Chinese government's restriction on export of silicon as a raw material is expected to tighten the supply of silicon as a raw material for the manufacturing of silicon carbide in other countries. This tightened supply is expected to be compensated by surging domestic production of silicon in various countries such as U.S., France, Norway, and Brazil. Domestic availability of raw material in these countries is expected to ensure continuous supply of silicon for production of SiC.Silicon carbide is used as a raw material for refractories on account of its high temperature resistance.

UCLA alumnus steers company toward affordable electric vehicles and car-sharingDaily Bruin: University of California - Los AngelesMay 15, 2018 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 501 wordsBodyA UCLA alumnus said at an event Monday that his company plans to provide an affordable, well-designed and partially automated electric vehicle.Freeman Shen, the CEO of Weltmeister Motor, spoke at UCLA's Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science's Ronald and Valerie Sugar Distinguished Speaker Series. Shen answered questions from Dean Jayathi Murthy and guests who attended the event regarding entrepreneurship and his business model design. Shen received his masters in civil engineering from UCLA in 1994.Shen said he originally wanted to pursue a degree in architecture but was unable to do so because he was color blind. Instead, he decided to design vehicles, which he said is more challenging than designing buildings because cars are moving objects."I always dreamed of doing a project (that) combined technology and art," Shen said.Shen said his company's goal is to create an electric vehicle for the middle class that would cost between $10,000 and $15,000. He added he thinks current electric vehicles are too expensive, such as those built by Tesla, or too small, such as the Nissan Leaf.WM Motor's electric vehicle will be partially automated, Shen said. He said his company's cars can brake, steer and accelerate by themselves as long as the driver is still at the wheel.Sam Ryklansky, a third-year computer science and engineering student, said he attended the event because he wanted to learn about what companies outside of the U.S. are doing for electrical vehicle development and autonomous cars."I thought it was interesting he wants more autonomy in cars," he said.Ryklansky said while the WM Motor's SUV's level of automation is a good place to start, he thinks the company needs to catch up to companies such as Uber and Google, which are developing cars that do not require the driver to actively sit at the wheel.WM Motor is also pursuing a car-sharing model, Shen said. Although car sales might decrease from consumers sharing cars, Shen said because WM Motor is a startup he would be happy to sell a hundred thousand cars, while a larger company might feel threatened at that level of sales. He added he thinks buying cars is inefficient."When you buy a car you get a lot of function you don't need," said Shen added. "You own it for 24 hours a day but you can only use it for two hours (a day) - so you can share it in your down time."Yufan Jia, a third-year mechanical engineering student, said he thinks WM Motor is able to sell such cheap electric SUVs because the Chinese government is giving incentives for electric vehicles.Shen said his company has an advantage in China because the country is looking to reduce the amount of oil they import.He added his company is developing both electric vehicles and autonomous vehicles because the two go hand in hand."When you are looking at an autonomous car you are looking at a robot. Imagine a robot carrying an engine, that would be impossible," he said. "Autonomously driven cars need a battery, not an engine."Load-Date: May 17, 2018End of Document

Global Tin Market Analysis, Growth, Trends & Forecast 2018-2023 - ResearchAndMarkets.comBusiness WireMay 28, 2018 Monday 12:11 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Business Wire, Inc.Distribution: Business EditorsLength: 422 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "Global Tin Market - Segmented by Product Type, Application, End-user Industry and Geography - Growth, Trends and Forecast (2018 - 2023)" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The global tin market valued at 350.74 kilo metric ton in 2017, is expected to witness a CAGR of 2.22% during the forecast period, 2018 to 2023.The Major end-user application of tin in the electronics industry is as a solder. Tin is often used in various purities and alloys, generally with lead and indium. Soldering is one of the potential end-user applications in the electronics industry. About 50% to 70% of the overall tin produced is used in the electronics & electrical industry in various products, such as mobiles, tablets, computers, and other consumer electronic devices. Additionally, according to JEITA, semiconductor manufacturing was estimated to have registered the fastest growth of 21% in 2016, while in 2018, it is forecasted to rise by 7%.China was the largest producer and consumer of tin in 2017. The automotive industry, being one of the major contributors in the tin market, has grown rapidly in the past five years. However, the Chinese automotive industry remains fragmented. This scenario is likely to have a positive impact on the tin demand from the Chinese automotive sector. In addition, Chinese central government officials fear the unchecked expansion of China's auto industry, encouraged by local authorities, could harm the wider economy and that excess capacity must be stopped.Companies Mentioned• ArcelorMittal• Avalon Rare Metals Inc.• DowDuPont• Gejiu Zili Mining and Smelting Co.
