FACEBOOK SUBSIDIARY 'DISAPPEARS' FROM CHINESE COMPANY DATABASEStates News ServiceJuly 25, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 778 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Chinese authorities appear to have withdrawn approval from Facebook's planned "innovation hub" in its eastern province of Zhejiang, according to the New York Times.The social media platform announced on Tuesday it had registered a subsidiary in Hangzhou as part of a plan to invest in local start-ups.But the approval, listed on a Chinese government database, later disappeared, and references to it were partially removed from the country's tightly controlled media, the Times reported.An employee who answered the phone at the Market Regulation Bureau in Zhejiang's provincial capital Hangzhou on Wednesday said they were unable to check the status of the Facebook subsidiary, which had been briefly listed on China's National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System, the paper said."I can't find it from here, because we don't have the system to do that," the employee said. "We're not a companies search facility."Facebook had registered Facebook Technology (Hangzhou) Co. Ltd. on July 18, with start-up capital of U.S.$30 million and a manager named as Zhang Jingmei. The company was wholly owned by Facebook's Hong Kong subsidiary.Commentators said Facebook had likely overestimated the ruling Chinese Communist Party's willingness to cooperate."They don't want real openness on the Chinese internet," Veteran journalist Zhu Xinxin said. "They don't want companies like Facebook bringing more freedom with them."Limited informationRetired Shandong University lecturer and rights activist Sun Wenguang agreed, saying that not everyone in China knows how to scale the Great Firewall of internet censorship coordinated by the government's powerful Cyberspace Administration."We would greatly welcome Facebook being available [here], because a lot of people here have no channels of information through which to gain a real understanding of China," he said. "All they can get is a limited number of websites and newspapers approved by the Communist Party.""According to my understanding, 99 people in 100 have no idea how to scale the Great Firewall."Beijing-based political commentator Zha Jianguo said Facebook's planned venture is likely a casualty of the looming trade war with the United States."One thing we can be sure of, and that is that the Chinese government will be seeking to curb online freedoms and preserve the difference between China's internet and the rest of the world's," Zha said."Particularly when it comes to politics and news."Zhu agreed. "There are bound to be limits to what they will let Facebook do in China, especially when we are looking at a trade war," he said. "There's no way the Chinese Communist Party will loosen up its tight hold on power."According to Guangdong-based activist Jia Pin, Facebook will remain a valuable platform for those internet users who do know how to circumvent the complex system of blocks, filters, and human censorship that make up the Great Firewall."I will still carry on using Facebook, because I need it to put out information on human rights issues," Jia said."A lot of social media platforms here in China have no privacy to speak of. Chinese internet service providers will cooperate and give information [about users] to government departments, especially the police, for certain."'Chinese characteristics'Internet user Hu Qiang said there is little hope of Facebook making an entry into the Chinese market without giving up some important features."Facebook would definitely have to lose some features, so it would become Facebook with Chinese characteristics, and its users would be limited in what they could say on it pretty much as they are on other social media platforms," Hu said."They would still run the risk of censorship and having their account shut down, and Facebook user data would very likely be shared with the government," he said.Facebook has previously admitted to having data-sharing partnerships with at least four Chinese companies, including smartphone-maker Huawei, which has already been the subject of security concerns in the United States.Facebook has said it had allowed Huawei, Lenovo, and smartphone manufacturers OPPO and TCL to access some user data.The companies may have been able to access data about users' friends on Facebook, under the agreement, regardless of what the users' privacy settings were, the Times reported last month.Facebook's Hong Kong subsidiary has been registered for nearly eight years, but the company's capital was increased in May.Reported by Lau Siu-fung for RFA's Cantonese Service, and by Qiao Long for the Mandarin Service.

Crossing Google&#39;s plans to return to China with a censored version of its search engineCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 2, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 506 wordsBody Google plans to relaunch its search engine in China with censored results to meet the requirements of the authorities in this country, according to the electronic publication The Intercept, which cites internal company documents.  The US digital media reported on Wednesday that Google is preparing a mobile version of its search engine, blocked in China since 2010, and that it will veto access to certain websites in order to return to the Chinese market.  In addition, that version would also block searches on human rights, religion and peaceful protests, according to a list that has already been shown to the Chinese government, according to the media.  The project, under the code name of Dragonfly (dragonfly), began to gestate more than a year ago and began to take shape in December after a meeting between the CEO of Google, Sundar Pichai, and a senior official of the Chinese Government , according to the publication.  The final version could be launched in the next six to nine months, in the absence of authorization from the Chinese authorities.  However, according to the state media China Securities Daily, the information about the return of Google to the Chinese market is not true, citing sources of "relevant departments" but without giving more details about it.  An Amnesty International researcher on China, Patrick Poon, today asked the US company to end this plan.  "Internet freedom will see a very black day if Google bows to China's extreme censorship to enter its market, I do not see how such a decision can be compatible with Google's 'do the right thing'. , and we ask for a change of course, "Poon said in a statement.  For AI, the measure would raise serious questions about the protection of the privacy of the users of the technological giant. "Is Google going to deliver personal data of its users to the Chinese authorities if they ask for it?", Poon questioned.  He also added that, in addition to being "a rude attack on freedom of information and the freedom of the internet," a hypothetical return of Google under these conditions would mean "putting benefits over human rights," would establish a "terrible precedent" and it would provide a "victory for the Chinese Government".  In October of last year, Google launched a new campaign to promote its translator among Chinese users, a strategy with which the company took the first step to return to the Asian giant.  In December, Pachai participated in the World Internet Conference that the Chinese Government has organized since 2014 in Wuzhen (center).  Then, in January, the search engine joined an investment in the Chushou live gaming platform, and earlier this month, it launched an artificial intelligence game in Tencent's WeChat social media application.  Google and its mail platforms or maps are blocked in the most populated country in the world, which also has the largest number of Internet users, since the US company and the Chinese Government broke the negotiations on the terms in which it should operate in the Asian giant Load-Date: August 2, 2018End of Document

GOOGLE 'DEVELOPING CENSORED SEARCH ENGINE' FOR CHINA MARKET: REPORTStates News ServiceAugust 2, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 889 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Internet giant Google is working on a version of its search engine that will comply with Chinese government censorship requirements, according to The Intercept.The new search engine will blacklist websites and search terms about human rights, democracy, religion, and peaceful protest, the news site reported.The company has been working on the project since the spring of 2017, and fast-tracked it following a meeting between Google CEO Sundar Pichai and a high-ranking government official last December, the report said."Teams of programmers and engineers at Google have created a custom Android app [that] has already been demonstrated to the Chinese government," the report said.Google left China in 2010 after a showdown with China's ruling Communist Party over internet censorship, and currently redirects Chinese language users from the mainland to a search site run from its Hong Kong-based servers.China has blocked access to Google search, YouTube, and Picasa photographs continually since 2009, according to Google's Transparency Report.The country's complex network of blocks, filters and human censorship known collectively as the Great Firewall already ensures that popular foreign websites like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube are hard to access for the majority of Chinese users.Government censors currently prevent keyword searches linked to politically sensitive topics, including the 1989 Tiananmen massacre, dissidents and any form of political opposition.The proposed new Google app will comply with current restrictions, removing banned websites from the first page of results.Examples cited by The Intercept based on confidential leaked Google documents include U.K. public broadcaster the BBC and the online encyclopedia, Wikipedia.For some blacklisted queries, no results will be shown at all, and the blacklists will extend to image searches, spell checks and search suggestions, the report said. 'Attack on freedom' Patrick Poon, a Hong Kong-based researcher with London-based rights group Amnesty International, called the news "a dark day for internet freedom.""For the world's biggest search engine to adopt such extreme measures would be a gross attack on freedom of information and internet freedom," Poon said in a statement on Amnesty International's website."In putting profits before human rights, Google would be setting a chilling precedent and handing the Chinese government a victory," he said."It is impossible to see how such a move is compatible with Google's ... motto, and we are calling on the company to change course," he said.Poon also asked whether Google would hand over personal data to the authorities if requested, potentially putting peaceful critics of the government at risk.In an interview with RFA, he reminded the company that it had left China in 2010 in order to get away from censorship."And now they seem to be deserting their former principles in order to get a foothold in the China market," Poon said. "I really think they should reconsider this decision."The Intercept said Google's renewed interest in China had been led by Pichai, who became CEO in October 2015. It cited sources as saying that Pichai had met with Wang Huning, Chinese President Xi Jinping's right-hand man and policy adviser, during a visit to China in December 2017.However, a report in China's Securities Daily newspaper quoted official sources as denying the report that Google is planning to return to China.The paper also quoted analysts as saying that such a move would be unlikely in the current international context, a possible reference to the trade war with the United States.An employee who answered the phone at Google's Beijing office on Thursday said they had received no information of any new products aimed at the China market."We haven't received any notification of new products here," the employee said. "All of our existing products are running normally."No public listing was available for the Cyberspace Administration of China. Banning keywords Sang Young, an information security expert at the Hong Kong Internet Society, said Google would have no problem meeting China's requirements."It's pretty simple; you just load in the keywords [you want to ban] ... they could even enable China to enter those keywords directly," Young said. "Then they just ensure that results relating to the keywords provided by China don't show up in search results.""I would imagine China has already provided them with a list of those keywords."An internet user in the southern province of Guangdong surnamed Fan told RFA that Google had clearly been swayed by the sheer size of the potential China market."There are more than a billion people in China, and more internet users here than anywhere else in the world," he said. "I am guessing that they don't want to relinquish such a huge market."But Fan said Google wouldn't be offering unfettered searches to those internet users, as it had done in the past."From the point of view of Chinese internet users, it'll be no different from Baidu; there'll just be one more of them," he said, in a reference to China's homegrown, censored search engine.

Agweek Magazine, Mikkel Pates columnAgweekJuly 16, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 AgweekDistributed by Tribune Content AgencySection: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWSLength: 642 wordsByline: Mikkel Pates, Agweek MagazineBodyJuly 16--If the Chinese government wants to hit Trump where it hurts over tariffs, I would bet on their ability to stick it to Midwest farmers for a bad, long time.I think the Chinese will: 1) find beans somewhere else at a premium and force their consumers to pay more 2) grow more beans or make it seem so 3) reduce the amount of beans imported by reducing the rise in meat consumption 4) all of the above.I have some personal connections to China. My wife and I for several years volunteered in something called the 909 English Conversation Group, which is still operated out of a church in Fargo. The "class" is a cultural exchange, promoted mostly among visiting scholars and spouses at North Dakota State University. Most are here for several months to a few years.The group attracts a smattering of participants from a number of countries: Nepal, Hungary, Afghanistan, Brazil, Pakistan and India. They're Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, and "rationalist," or atheist.Most participants are Chinese.Almost all of our Chinese friends have master's or doctorate degrees in technical fields like engineering or economics. Many of those are professors back home. The "class" is about talking about each other's cultures and helping to correct pronunciation glitches. We've shared holiday parties and taken them to the Minnesota lakes for ice fishing and fishing demonstrations or to local events. We help them practice driving tests. We act as surrogate relatives for their kids.When the U.S. institutes tariffs and the Chinese counter-tariff, I think of their impact on U.S. farmers first, but also about how it affects the Chinese. It won't be easy on anybody.A few observations:China's government controls mass media as well as social media -- in ways that Americans would never accept. (Want a Chinese friend to see a picture from an event? Send a photo through a secure e-mail address. Forget posting it on Facebook.)There have been recent international stories about how cameras in public places, equipped with facial recognition software, are becoming more popular in China, reputedly to apprehend criminals or even shame people who are jaywalkers at intersections. It's been described as a "panopticon" -- not as all-seeing as the headlines, but it gives people the feeling they're being watched all of the time. The government is trying to institute a "sincerity culture" based on social credits calculated on formulas using personal information and online activity.The Chinese ruling Communist Party seemingly does what it wants, and the Chinese I know are mostly fatalistic about that. Some of the Chinese we've known acknowledge they are members of their government's Communist Party (good for the career). Some seem wealthy. They live in expensive apartments back home and travel to Albertville, Minn., to buy Coach bags for family and friends in China.But when asked about individual impact on government, they smile and shrug. It would be pointless -- silly -- to lobby for policy, even as an intellectual elite. It certainly would be bad for their careers.So, what happens as American soybeans become less available in China? Don't expect a big protest. The Chinese will grow as many beans as they can and will emphasize they're doing that, regardless of reality. I heard a National Public Radio interview with a Chinese farmer who said she'd consider growing more soy, but only if the government pays a bigger subsidy for it. I'm sure they will.In the meantime, China will simply get the rest from Brazil or Argentina. Farmers in Trump country will become residual suppliers to China. Tariffs may help the larger U.S. economy but it will also take dollars from U.S. soybean growers, for years.___ (c)2018 Agweek Magazine (Grand Forks, N.D.)

We now send it over to Neil Cavuto for hour one of six that he'll be broadcasting on.LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: We counted yesterday Neil. Six hours of T.V. for you every day.NEIL CAVUTO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes. It seems like 60.SIMONETTI: Get off the air.CAVUTO: But, you know, I always keep track guys of the e-mail and all, like with people what they -- you know, what they say like, they all miss Maria and that's an understatement.CASONE: They will.CAVUTO: That's what I got was yesterday when someone said, "Boy, Maria really let herself go." How about that. That was a little mean. That was -- that really hurt my feelings and that was from my wife, I don't know why she did that.All right. Thank you. We have a lot more coming up here in the next three hours. But they go by like this on this show, it's a great show. Good morning everybody, I am Neil Cavuto in for my friend and colleague Maria Bartiromo who will be back next week. Relax America. We just swapped one Italian for another, so everyone just calm down here.Meanwhile, not much coming down when it comes to Tesla, the SEC probe as you know is already underway. But what if I tell you there was one underway, a separate one concerning a whistleblower's allegations about hiding some defects in certain models and on and on we go.Then there's Turkey, you know, that's still not a done deal or a resolved deal. In fact, if anything the government there seems to be sort of freezing its case here and keeping Pastor Brunson in jail maybe for up to 35 years.The Futures markets are trying to get a gauge of direction, optimistic over the pace of recovery in United States and a strong retail sales and the prospect that the Chinese and American diplomats are going to be talking next week about resolving this trade dispute, that's agreed to this good news. But, again, concerned about Turkey and where things are going.So, here with me Riverfront Investment Chairman Michael Jones. We've got Benchmark Managing Partner Kevin Kelly. And FOX News Contributor Jessica Tarlov. All right. Let's get right to the whole Tesla stuff first and Kevin on that, the fear seems to be that, you know, when one bubble comes up, more bubbles emerge.And now concerns about tweets from those who are looking into certain models in the past beyond what the chairman has been saying. So, what's going on here?KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK: Yes. Tesla shareholders certainly have had a wild ride especially because it's been self-inflicted from Elon Musk and they tend to be dedicated to him.But the real issues at Tesla are production problems that they've had for years. They've never really met their production goals, albeit he's promised that. Now we're seeing there's a whistleblower that talked about defects with the cars, coming out with different models. And so the board is involved now and that's a real situation.CAVUTO: Well that's not an SEC matter at this stage, right?KELLY: No.CAVUTO: That's a separate venue.KELLY: Yes.CAVUTO: But it's still, you know, more noise, right?KELLY: Right, it's more noise because we also saw Tesla was giving cash flow problems, they were talking about basically getting payments back from vendor -- vendors and also elongating when they're going to pay them instead of 60 days, maybe 90 days.So the issue that you're seeing happen is that you're having cash flow problems, production problems, or having management issues, and now the SEC is in there. And so the SEC's not only investigating his tweet and funding secured which is a material statement especially because of people-based investing decisions off that tweet.Say I bought the stock and now it's down below. I certainly have a recourse to the company that I could say, "Hey listen, it was material. I base in investment decision off of that." Who's going to end up paying in the end? Tesla shareholders.CAVUTO: Yes. Because you can argue. And shorting a stock Michael is a legitimate exercise, right? So if you were burned on that by the back and forth, you do have ground for something. Where is this all going?MICHAEL JONES, CHAIRMAN, RIVERFRONT INVESTMENT: Well I think ultimately what this proves is is making cars complicated. And, you know, when you ramp up -- I mean, let's give Elon Musk credit for visionary innovation.But, you know, the reason why that they're established players that have been around for a hundred years in the automotive market is because it is a really complicated business, it requires a huge amount of working capital and huge amount of engineering expertise that Elon Musk is learning on the job.And I think that's probably the biggest problem is he should have probably partnered with somebody with more expertise. I also think that he seems to be, you know, we're talking earlier about the president and his need to kind of like be out ahead of communication issues, Elon Musk seems to have that same need.And, you know, he doesn't like the short-sellers and he punishes them occasionally with these kinds of tweets and ultimately that came --CAVUTO: That came back with a vengeance, right?JONES: Yes, without question.CAVUTO: What was the (INAUDIBLE) in the last earnings that you got really nasty with some analyst?KELLY: That was with the --CAVUTO: And, you know, he'll ask (INAUDIBLE) like a scorned analyst I guess.KELLY: Well, he's asking about financing questions which is --CAVUTO: Right. You know, you're right about that.KELLY: -- which is -- which is a legitimate concern.CAVUTO: You're right about that.KELLY: -- and he's said this is stupid and he took it off and went to YouTube and then started talking about their vision and it's like, "Well listen, from a shareholder actually own the company." Actually own -- I have ownership in it. And I --CAVUTO: You work for me.KELLY: Yes, you work for me.CAVUTO: But, you know, you got to be careful a little bit too. I mean, whenever you think of Elon Musk, he is the company, right? He's not just some, you know, flack in a suit.JESSICA TARLOV, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, you want a car but you also want to have an Elon Musk car. You know, you want to be part of his dream, his vision for, you know, however faster we're going to be going, how energy efficient, and maybe you're going to the moon. And that's a really exciting thing to be a part of.CAVUTO: And, you know, this demand that came alluded to. I mean, that's there for a reason.TARLOV: Totally.CAVUTO: I mean, the reason why they have thousands of vehicles, you know, already checked off for orders, a lot of people are now cashing those deposit checks back. But it -- they wanted them, they wanted them badly.TARLOV: Yes. Just after -- my parents were in that group they thought, you know --CAVUTO: Is that right?TARLOV: -- you look down to how Manhattan liberals, we need one of these things, right? The tweeting is a problem. We've talked about Elon Musk and, you know, when he kind of went to the max with Trump against the media, you know, the fake news media and he's in all that hustle.I was reading reports, they're saying that they're desperately seeking for a number two that can become the public face of the company while the SEC investigation is going on.CAVUTO: It's like Google, you know, it have like the -- where the Google kids at the time looking for announcement, someone like that with seasoned executive, well schooled.TARLOV: Exactly. An adult needs to say, oh what he meant even though Elon Musk I think is like 45, right? It wasn't exactly like Sergei and Larry in that sense. But I think bringing someone in that can stabilize this.And then you have the sideshows, you know, like the Azealia Bank sideshow about, you know, being trapped in his house for three days with his girlfriend and how weird it is and what drugs they're doing. It's just not good, he should let go of that device.KELLY: Well that's -- I mean, that's speculation. But we know that he actually went after a hero who help save boys in the Thai cave.TARLOV: Yes.CAVUTO: Right. Remember that? Yes, yes, you're right.KELLY: Yes. Right. Exactly. Which is just -- there's a difference that shareholders need to understand between the man and the company. And you need to separate those two.Listen, I've driven a Tesla, phenomenal car. Like, they should continue making as many as those as possible because they're awesome. But the company is in deep problems. And the biggest problem they have is their cash flow and they need to raise money.Who's going to lend the money in this type of environment right now? And we -- and also, Elon Musk knows better. He knows that they need this -- the board need this -- needs to put together a special committee to address the CEO trying to take it public. They need to do disclosure.CAVUTO: But he (INAUDIBLE) though guys if he were out of there and I think it might -- you know, I agree with everything that's been said that he's not your typical CEO, he doesn't, you know, can born to strategies and even the temperament of a typical CEO.But he's like the Steve Jobs of our time, the Thomas Edison of our time, maybe he's a visionary and all. But visionaries tend to have a tough time in the real work a day world doing this. So what's the next solution there because if the SEC were to zero in on him justified or not, he is the company, isn't he?JONES: Yes. And I do believe that, you know, Elon Musk has formed -- has done a great service for mankind. He has shown us that an electric car is not just, you know, New York liberal, you know, save the world. It's a better ownership experience. You get better --CAVUTO: Which is why everyone is doing it now.JONES: Exactly. And that is the problem with that.CAVUTO: In fact, isn't Volvo eventually going to have a complete electric cars?JONES: One hundred percent, yes. That's what they're talking about. And you're looking at all these established names in the automotive industry, they're going to come on, they're following in his footsteps just like, you know, Netscape was a visionary in the internet that created the world that we live in now but they didn't make any money.You know, ultimately it was the second and third the more established companies that came over and followed in that visionary's footsteps and ultimately I'm afraid that maybe what happened (INAUDIBLE)KELLY: Would you think Netscape would have made money if they were subsidized by the government? Because let's talk about how Tesla, people can actually buy them and they get tax breaks.CAVUTO: Yes, you're right.KELLY: So not --CAVUTO: The last people on earth who need them.KELLY: Yes, exactly.CAVUTO: Like Jessica's parents. Like Jessica's parents. They get around (INAUDIBLE)TARLOV: They don't like the tax breaks.KELLY: Yes. So that's another issue that we need to talk about.CAVUTO: No, that's a very fair point. I want to --TARLOV: Well, he want (INAUDIBLE) the environment --CAVUTO: You were saving the --TARLOV: You should get a tax break.CAVUTO: And that certainly helps in lower Manhattan.JONES: And you do get a better weight balance in your performance.CAVUTO: Yes. That's it. And I could just see Jessica's parents fighting for the --KELLY: And you -- and you get a trunk, a full trunk.CAVUTO: Yes.TARLOV: (INAUDIBLE)CAVUTO: It's weird, that's a whole weird thing. All right. I want to bring in my buddy on the Wall Street Journal Global Economics Editor Jon Hilsenrath. This back and forth on Tesla comes at the exactly same time investors are trying to handle on Turkey and what's going on there.And then China and trade talks that resume right where you are next week. How is this all unfolding in Washington Jon?JON HILSENRATH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, in Washington we have low level talks restarting next week at the Treasury Department with china.You know, I think you've got to be really circumspective at whether you think that's going to get anywhere. There are a lot of divisions inside the Trump Administration. I think the Chinese realize at this point after months of this that the Treasury doesn't speak necessarily for Donald Trump.So I think both sides are going to be approaching that very cautiously. On the Turkey front, we have a standoff, the Trump Administration is threatening more action against the Turks and until and unless they release the American pastor. So that doesn't really look like its going anywhere.We also next week have hearings in Washington on $200 billion of additional tariffs against the Chinese and on top of all that we have Chinese statement official threatening sanctions, reprisals against China if they buy Iranian oil.So this isn't a terribly friendly environment right now but I would say is, you know, with all this stuff that we're talking about, American retailers, American consumers are doing great. So from the stock market's perspective, you know, a lot of this looks like noise right now.The economy is doing really well, Americans are spending money, we have really good earnings numbers out from Walmart, Nordstrom, Home Depot. So, you know, I think --CAVUTO: No, you're right. It's on the chart. You touched something about China, I just want to be clear. Look, I've read different views on the timing of the Chinese requests to send the representative, maybe a couple of representatives in United States.The $200 billion in added tariffs on goods that maybe they're trying to get ahead of. Other said it's quite in eastern culture. I don't -- I don't know about such things, culture and me are just too oxymoron there but the notion that Chinese are quite serious about resolving this more so than we'd think.They want this out of the way, they're getting concern, and that that was unusual for them to volunteer to come to the United States to (INAUDIBLE) talks that cynically it wasn't about these $200 billion worth of extra tariffs that could kick in a variety of goods, it's all about resolving this quickly. Do you -- do you buy that?HILSENRATH: I think you have to be fairly skeptical. You know, the Chinese have tried. You know, they've sent senior emissaries here earlier this year back in March and then, again, I guess it was in May or June, they didn't get very far.I think they recognize that, you know, it all comes down to what the president wants that Secretary Mnuchin doesn't -- and this isn't Mnuchin speaking to them this time, it's his deputy David Malpass.You know, I do think that this is -- that the sanction ad tensions with the United States are squeezing the Chinese, their economic data has been kind of soft, their currency has weakened. They do feel it, they would love to get it resolved. But, you know, there's two issues here and one how far are they willing to go?And then the other is, what is that the U.S. really wants? I think there's some confusion in China about exactly what the American demands are. Is that, you know -- that the U.S. wants the Chinese to buy more of our products? They want us to crackdown on factor acquisition of U.S. technology, they want us to close, you know, the trade deficit with them.I think they feel that they've gotten a lot of mixed signals and they don't really know what target they're shooting at.CAVUTO: Yes. There is a lot to that. Thank you very, very much. On that thought Kevin real quick before we take a break here, do you think that it has involved as we suspect that maybe the president would be quite happy for the south Koreans idea that wasn't much of a deal? But I'm not besmirching it.It was an improved number what we had but it wasn't a huge leap. And then he would be satisfied with some concession, it might even be a minor one in the part of the Chinese claim victory and move on.KELLY: Yes. And we saw that happen with ZTE but I think the most important thing and I'm going to defect a little bit from Jon's sentiments, I think the Chinese want a deal and they want a deal bad.We've seen their small caps go down over 25 percent, now it's reverberating in their large caps. Look what happened in Tencent, look at what's happening to Alibaba, look at what happened to JD.com. I'm telling you that Chinese are feeling pressured at home and that's why they're coming over here to get a deal done.CAVUTO: I suspect you're right which maybe make you run the other way. All right. We're going to take a quick break here. Let's get a read also on Google, the (INAUDIBLE) defending is pushed to do more business in China, Alibaba notwithstanding. But the concessions it might have to make to do so are a little bit eyebrow-raising, after this.CAVUTO: All right. Welcome back everyone, 15 minutes after the hour. We've seen it again, Cheryl Casone on another policeman under fire.CASONE: Yes. Neil, good morning. This time it's in Phoenix, Arizona. Police say the officer was attempting a traffic stop when the suspect opened fire. The unidentified officer then shot back. Both he and the suspect are listed in critical condition.Fellow men and women in blue waiting outside the hospital showing support for that young officer. We don't know his name but just that he'd only been in the force about a year. Also, of course, this is more -- another example of police under fire current happens across this country.Well 12 people attending a corporate event of a park in Alabama ended up in the hospital. Traditions Bank was holding its annual shareholder meeting under a large tent when a strong pop-up storm caused the tent to collapse.Two victims knocked unconscious. Report say former Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz was scheduled to speak. It was at the park where the tent collapsed, he luckily though was not injured.Well, Google CEO Sundar Pichai telling the company's employees Google is not close to launching a search engine in China. More than 1,000 Google workers reportedly have signed the letter protesting the company's plan to build a search engine that would comply with strict Chinese censorship laws.The Wall Street Journal has reported that Google is working on a service for Chinese citizen -- citizens, excuse me. Google workers also calling on the company's manager to be more transparent while making decisions about controversial issues like China. Shares of Google's parent Alphabet up about 17 percent so far this year.And then staying on the Google theme here, they're now clarifying based on track you even after you turn off location history on your phone. Google revised a help page days after the A.P. revealed it was wrongfully describing how his location history settings worked.Now the help page acknowledges that, "Some location data, they'd be saved as part of your activity on other services like search and maps. Neil, they are watching you.CAVUTO: You know, it's just something you get used to with technology, right? I mean that's the (INAUDIBLE) if you -- if you want your privacy, get over it. I wondered but it's going to go (INAUDIBLE) but we keep getting confirmation to that. Cheryl, thank you so much.CASONE: Uh-hmm.CAVUTO: Michael, the whole Google thing in China though, if you want to search for something in China, Alibaba presumably, that's about it and their limitations, right?JONES: Tremendous limitations. I'm going to be going back to Asia here in a few weeks and, you know, it's extraordinary when you drop into that market how much information suddenly becomes curtailed.And I do believe though the logic behind Google trying to find a way to work within that market is if Alibaba has a $1.3 billion or billion person market all to themselves, then the profits from that subsidized their attack in Google in every other market in the world.And I think that's -- you look at DiDi right now and what they're trying to do with Uber. I mean, I do think it's unfortunately it choose the cash flow reality that if you're not in China then you're vulnerable to all those protected Chinese companies coming after you.And I don't know how they balanced their culture, their -- what their employees wants with the just hardcore business reality, if you're not in China, you're vulnerable.CAVUTO: It's weird in this day and age.KELLY: Yes. I'll just tell you this much, every company is doing it. Apple's building a data center over there because the Chinese government dictated, that the data needs to be located on the mainland. So people want to use iCloud, they're going to do it.Starbucks is opening up so many locations over there. But as Michael, listen, Alibaba has a giant data center based in Silicon Valley. They're building data centers all over the United States.CAVUTO: Leveraging off of that, yes.KELLY: Absolutely. For their consumers.TARLOV: Because anecdotally I was going to see us in January and my flight had --CAVUTO: Consumer electronic?TARLOV: Ye. Had 75 Alibaba employees on my slides I had all come over from China, they're everywhere, they're expanding here but Google protecting its culture when you look at what's going on out of Facebook right now is so critical because people aren't into working there, they're going to go elsewhere and they're going to build something bigger and better.CAVUTO: Seventy five, were they following you or what?TARLOV: Well, I -- yes, I am that kind of celebrity of Chinese companies at -- no.CAVUTO: I heard her parents had a Tesla and they --TARLOV: They don't have one. They're lusting at them. My dad is saving up still and he thinks he's a little crazy.CAVUTO: I got it. All right. We're going to take a quick break here folks. And then look at the big stock rally that we saw even with yesterday's gains we are still in correction territory for the Dow. A lot of people make a big deal of that. I think it's 132 days, Kevin, or something like that.A lot of people are looking at that and saying, "When do we get past that?" We're still about a percent, percent and a half from those old highs here. So a lot -- technicians look at that as a significant development. May not so much, I just pass it along. All right, we'll have more into this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Our economy is doing better than it ever has before. It was going in the wrong direction when we came on board and now it's doing better than ever before. The African-American, Hispanic-American and Asian-American, unemployment rates have all reached their lowest levels in recorded history.We're creating manufacturing jobs at the fastest pace in memory. During the campaign everybody said that it was impossible to create manufacturing job. So the past administration, I won't say who, but I think you know made a statement that we're not going to have any manufacturing jobs. And we're them by the hundreds of thousands.(END VIDEO CLIP)CAVUTO: All right. Just a quick factor here, president is right t crow about how things are going to right now but I wouldn't say the economy is going in a wrong direction where it came in. Of course, we had an eight- year long bull market in a long year and well off losing about a million jobs a month.But having said all of that, the president, you have to get him credit here for whether it's tax cuts, the cut regulations, he's given this new legs as bull market and this economy and we're seeing it certainly in the retail sector minus JCPenny.If you look at what we've seen out of Walmart and Home Depot and Nordstrom's reporting yesterday, all far, far better than expected and a sign that if the consumer is strong and looking to buy and continue to buy, in fact, the double the level in income that we've seen in the past and what was expected, that could be a good sign that this can keep going and going and going.Mike Lee is with us right now, Investment -- Investmark Advisory Group Principal. Michael, good to see you.MICHAEL LEE, PRINCIPAL, INVESTMARK ADVISORY GROUP: Good morning, how are you guys doing?CAVUTO: Good. Good. So is the consumer. So is that really the life blood of everything here because it stepped back?LEE: Well, I think the only surprise is people that are surprised , right? So the consumer was doing pretty well on their -- you know, towards the end of the Obama Administration.When you add Samsung, Apple, and Amazon to a traditional retail sales, we're growing at four or five percent a year with about one to three percent in traditional retail sales and another two to three percent in Samsung, Apple, and Amazon when you put them all together.Well fast forward to the second quarter of 2017, it goes to six percent, third quarter seven percent, fourth quarter eight percent, and now first quarter this year we're looking at nine percent.CAVUTO: So that's sustainable. That keeps going.LEE: Well what I would tend to say is that the only knock in the consumer is consumer debt. But when you look at household debt, debt service as a percent of disposal income, lowest level in 30 years. When you look --CAVUTO: So the -- just to clarify that, the overall aggregate debt is still at a near records. But --LEE: Yes. But compared to Apple --CAVUTO: -- that ratio, right?LEE: Yes. But -- well -- so debt service, so what it takes to keep the debt going is at the lowest level of disposal income in 30 years. And then when you look at --CAVUTO: Assets have risen.LEE: Well also.JONES: Interest rates have been low.LEE: Yes.JONES: And that's in a nutshell.LEE: Interest rates are low, I definitely think they're going higher. But we are no one near any sort of consumer debt problem. Debt to asset is also near a 30-year low. So while debt has grown, assets have grown much quicker.OK, incomes, so when you add not only average hourly earnings and earnings growth, you add -- when you add on the additional hours worked plus one time bonuses of commissions. You're looking at five percent growth year- over-year. How -- again, household net -- household net worth, all-time high, home prices near all-time highs.And what I think the market is missing and most people are missing is why is this going to decelerate. I tend to think things are going to get better. And why is this happening? As Trump came in and put all this pro- business policies in place, we were sitting on a tremendous amount of cash not only from the personal side, from the corporate side as well.More cash in the S&P500 than ever, so you take a petty good decent economy, I think better than it gets credit for and then you just throw gas on that. And now we are.CAVUTO: So how do you play this? What do you like in this environment?LEE: So I don't think retail is going to stop, OK? I like retail but I think rates are going higher so I like things that are interest-rate sensitive, I like the big banks. Okay? I think we're going to get more raid hikes this yea, four rate hikes next year.OK? What people don't talk about is the discount brokers, they think about those $4.95 trading commissions. It's not that, it's the money market how they make all their money. And so the higher interest rates are, OK, the more -- so they'll pay you too when money markets are paying four or five, right? And they'll make that spread.So those spreadsheet keep expanding, expanding and like I don't know how much day training you do but --CAVUTO: Let's just follow him.JONES: Yes.LEE: Well --KELLY: I just put bye, bye, bye. And the boys won't let me.LEE: You tend to find that most people the thing they could do with themselves and I'm sitting with a lot more cash than you would normally expect.So those cash balances are always high in brokerage accounts everywhere. And when you look at J.P. Morgan, a 25-basis point high for the threat makes a big difference on a trillion dollar balance sheet. So I'm big on the banks. I think --KELLY: And on J.P. Morgan's point, they're actually buying back their stock pretty significantly. This is one of the months they're doing it. So they're lending in and supporting the stock if you -- if you want to think about that.And then -- and buybacks have been demonized but if buyback is a stock -- is a tax dividend because dividends when they're paid out they're double taxed. Meaning the company's already paid taxes on it, they gave it to you then you got to pay taxes that. So why wouldn't they Buyback their own stock? They don't need to pay taxes on that transaction.JONES: And in addition to those buybacks, I think Mike is onto something that people are not talking about enough. For the last 10 years a huge part of the bank earnings machine has been earning a spread on their money market balances and their checking account balances. That has been zero because interest rates have been zero.As we get a decent interest rate on the short-end, there is a huge amount of untapped earnings power that comes back into the banking system.CAVUTO: Can't they invest in anything though, isn't that the whole idea of this?LEE: Well -- so I -- so we are starting to get loosening of the macro potential. So the problem with the financial crisis is banks were to blame partly but entirely. And so, you came in and you over regulated which stiffened the growth of capital, OK?And the free flow of money so that regulation is being reduced. And as (INAUDIBLE) widen on that interest margins, banks can take more risk because there's more cushion.So, you're going to see a greater velocity of money, the economy, from the banks, OK? As rates go out, you're going to see more volatile moves in commodities, in stocks, in bonds. So, the trading departments are going to make more money. They're going to lend more at higher margins.It's -- I think we are entering a golden era for the banks. We haven't quite seen it yet, you know, the fed owns too many bonds, the long end, which is, you know, manipulated the yield curve to be much flatter than it really should be, right now, but --CAVUTO: Glad it is.LEE: So, it is flat and I think at some point, the difference between the short-end and the long-end, has to have a relationship between inflation and GDP. Inflation is going higher, GDP is going higher. We are not in the decelerating economy. We are an accelerating --CAVUTO: This doesn't accurately reflect what's really going on?LEE: No. I think one of the most dangerous securities out there is the 30-year treasury.CAVUTO: Wow.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Agree.CAVUTO: All right, Mike, it's great seeing you, thank you very much.LEE: Thanks so much for having me.CAVUTO: You know your stuff, young man.LEE: Yes.CAVUTO: All right, when we -- when we come back, the President is calling on the Department of Justice to sue opioid makers, we were seeing in that in a live cabinet meeting. What was it? Tape, spray (INAUDIBLE) but it was weird. I've never seen the President call on his attorney general, I want you to sue these SOBs. He didn't say SOBs. It was just --UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He thought it.CAVUTO: He thought it. It was -- it was weird, it was very, very weird. I'll explore that after this.CAVUTO: Good morning, everybody, I'm Neil Cavuto, in for Maria Bartiromo. She returns next week.Meanwhile, the talks with China, by the way, are on for next week. That is seen to be an encouraging development on indications released during the Asian press that the Chinese want to resolve the trade dispute with the administration, sooner rather than later, at least sooner than those $200 million in extra tariffs on a variety of goods could potentially kick in.The Turkish leader, though, is under pressure, and that was laying on Asian markets for a while. It was down about additional three percent on concerns of that crisis is going nowhere fast. Futures are a little bit lower after yesterday's stunning run up in equities across Europe and the United States.Not so much, as I said, in Asia. But, again, some pause after nearly 41- point run up in the Dow, is probably in order.All right, on to the political crisis here at home, and a lot of the security folks around the country, taking (INAUDIBLE) the President taking the security clearance away from CIA director, Brennan, the read on all of that and what this could portend in this on-going battle back and forth between those security agencies and the White House, and who knew what and when.Former Whitewater Independent Counsel, Robert Ray, on this and so many other matters, one of my favorite guests, good read of these issues. Robert, it's good to see you.ROBERT RAY, FORMER WHITEWATER INDEPENDENT COUNSEL: Good morning.CAVUTO: Outside a little bit of your purview here, but it, sort of, set up a demarcation line between those who think the President was petty and went to too far and others who say, you know, whether he was perfectly justified in doing this.What did you make of it? Just as someone who was looked into presidential overreach or the appearance of that? Many were saying that about this.RAY: I think many were saying it but it's a bit overstated, at least, that's my view. I mean, no one is rifling through his trash. He's not being followed by the FBI, as far as I know. His tax returns haven't been audited. They revoked --CAVUTO: You're talking about Brennan?RAY: Yes. They revoked his security clearance. I mean, I-- you know, I - -CAVUTO: So what did you think when he had a New York Times editorial the next day, saying the collusion talk, and that there's no collusion going on, it was hogwash. Does he know something that we don't or?RAY: I -- well, I don't know. I guess, that's probably the big question that remains out there, but I tend to think not.CAVUTO: Yes.RAY: And I think -- you know, a lot of people, you know, for political purposes, have an awfully overblown sense of what they think collusion is.CAVUTO: Yes.RAY: So, I -- you know, look, I mean, I've always wondered why people once they are out of government, you know, continue to have security clearances. I imagine that this is going to, at least, prompt and appropriate look at exactly what security clearances are for and, you know, whether there's any further need to have them once government officials leave their positions.But I really don't -- I mean, you know, it made it sound and awful lot of the press, like you have a right to a security clearance, which, you know, you clearly don't.CAVUTO: No, I was (INAUDIBLE) like Disney fast passes, you know.RAY. No. Look, it's a -- it's a privilege and I think the notion that -- you know, all this notion about what (INAUDIBLE) denial of due process and this is an awful thing and it's political retribution, all the rest. I mean -- you know, I think people have an overly sensitive sense of what kind of impact that really truly has its minimal.And it's not the kind of, you know, power that a President can wield, that would clearly be an abuse of power. I think this falls well short of the mark and I think most of that arguments have been overstated.CAVUTO: Yes, because, I was thinking, as soon as I heard that, and I read his editorial the next day, in the New York Times, that was he trying to say, because he hid -- beating around the bush in the past.But he then seem to state unequivocally, get there was collusion going on here and for the President to say otherwise, is hogwash. Is he leveraging that information that he might have had to make a charge like that or was he expressing his opinion?Either way, it seems to me, responding in a petty manner for something you said was a petty, you know--RAY: Right. And I think -- I mean, I read the response too, and it just struck me as, I don't know how that's an appropriate rejoinder because it only seemed to me, to make him look unseemly.CAVUTO: Exactly.RAY: And so, if your -- if your contention is, that the President was acting in a petty manner, it seemed like it was, sort of, a petty or unseemly rejoinder in response.CAVUTO: Very well put. Your thought of the Manafort, it's now in the hands of the jury, people are trying to extrapolate what will this decision mean in multi-facet and multi (INAUDIBLE)But, what seems to be crucial to Manafort is, you know, business ties, connections, many into Russia. But if you are the President of the United States, what are you looking to see out of this?RAY: I don't know. I mean -- I think -- you know, this -- to me, this prosecution always struck me as one that you could justify independent of all of the political swirl and firestorm around it, that, you know, in the ordinary course, this would be something that the Department of Justice would be paying attention to.And so I understand that it has implications, and so far, as it, you know, raises the question about whether or not, Paul Manafort, at the end of all these, in the event of a conviction decides to cooperate.But, I mean -- I think -- you know, jury's understand lying, cheating and stealing, and, you know, not paying taxes with regard to income derived overseas that was concealed, is a problem. If that's, in fact, what happened --CAVUTO: But would he have gotten that scrutiny if he had not briefly been the chair?RAY: Well, you know, look, you can always make that argument. I -- but there is no question, at least, in my view, that independent of all that, however it is that we came to have this prosecution, that the prosecution, at least, from what I was able to follow based upon the evidence that was admitted at trial, seemed warranted and seemed like a prosecution that should've been brought.CAVUTO: So, when things veer off course, as they always do, and you were dealing with that in the Clinton investigation. It has veered into business ties and transactions.RAY: Right.CAVUTO: And I'm wondering if that is where you think it ultimately goes?RAY: Well, I do, because I don't think at the end of the day, that we are likely to see a provable case in court of collusion that involve the -- you know, involves the upper reaches of the -- of the Trump campaign.CAVUTO: Could you define what you think collusion is?RAY: I mean, what I think it is, I mean, although you don't really hear much about this, in the media, is an effort by the Trump campaign to communicate and coordinate with Russian government officials and make promises once they took office, in exchange for information that would help them in the campaign.I don't think that ever happened because I think at the relevant time when these matters would have been discussed, even the Trump campaign didn't believe that it was going to be elected. So it didn't really have anything to trade in July of 2016 or June or July of 2016, because even they didn't think they were going to be able to be successful against Hillary Clinton in the fall.So, I mean, that's the kind of collusion I would understand, would really constitute a case that would warrant criminal prosecution. A conspiracy to trade favors in exchange for beneficial information from the Russians in order to affect the outcome of the election.I don't -- I mean, so far, you know, call -- tell me if I'm wrong, I have not seen any evidence to suggest that that in fact occurred.CAVUTO: Real quick (INAUDIBLE) my producer's going to kill me unless I -- I did want to get your take on this cabinet meeting yesterday. You might not have seen.RAY: Yes.CAVUTO: But when we were on it, it was interesting that the President turned to Jeff Sessions, his attorney general, on his opioid (INAUDIBLE) I want you to sue these guys. I'm paraphrasing here.RAY: Right.CAVUTO: To go way up to them. What did you make of that? Is that typical --RAY: I heard (INAUDIBLE) think that was so unusual.CAVUTO: Really?RAY: The President, he is the head of the executive branch. He --CAVUTO: I want you to sue these guys.RAY: He says in broad strokes what he thinks the interests of the executive branch are, and then, you know, says to the attorney general, I want you to look into this. Now, you know, you can talk about whether that's artfully done or whatever.But it's certainly the President's prerogative to say, I am very concerned as an elected official on behalf of all the American people with regard to whether or not the federal government is doing all that it should be doing, relative to holding drug companies accountable.Fentanyl makers, Oxycontin, Oxycodone makers, with regard to whether there's a federal interest there. Clearly there is, regulated by the FDA. You know, should a federal lawsuit be brought? And he says to his attorney general, who is the chief law enforcement officer of the country and is in control on the -- now the interest of the United States, in court.You know, do you think -- and I want you to look into whether or not cases of civil litigation can be brought. I think that's entirely --CAVUTO: Concessions indicate we were already there.RAY: Well, there are certainly already there. They -- I think they filed a statement of interest and the pending litigation involving states and cities in the northern district of Ohio. I imagine there's going to be a federal presence there, as there probably should.And that will be up, you know, to courts to decide what to make of all of that. So, you know, that is an appropriate role for the President.CAVUTO: OK. All right, sure. If he says it's OK, then it's OK. Jeff Sessions is still in his job. Are you surprised?RAY: I think he has somewhat of a -- of an insurance plan through all of this.CAVUTO: I think you're right.RAY: I think it's in the country's interest that he remains. I think this investigation through Mueller and the special counsel needs to be seen through to its conclusion. But I do think the clock is running. And I think it needs to be wrapped up if it can be, in short order, meaning, possibly before the midterm elections, but if not then, you know, very shortly thereafter.CAVUTO: Likely that the President talking to Mueller is what, right now?RAY: I think it's slim to none, is the sense that I'm getting. And that is a surprise to me. I would have thought, you know, earlier on in the investigation that the President might well try to offer that which he seemed to do in an effort to try to bring the investigation --CAVUTO: So the September first deadline, what do you make of that?RAY: I think that's you know, I think that's probably a real one. I think that's probably a real one.CAVUTO: OK, Robert Ray, we hit you a lot of stuff today. Flawless as always, thank you very, very much. All right, we've got the Futures, kind of, soft right now. We're going to be into that. Also looking at NYU's plan, if you want to become a doctor and learn about becoming a doctor there, they're going to try to make it easy on you. How about no tuition charges? Go for it, after this.CAVUTO: All right. I don't know how this step. And it's a great step. Maria has a phenomenal step. And I'm not a fan of music because I'm not hip. I might as well not fake it, but I do love Jeff Flynn because I'm old enough to remember them. And this is the second ELL song they've used. It's not quite the Gregorian chant. It urged them to try before but man, oh, man, the coup de grace at the end. Welcome back, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. No, I'm not Maria Bartiromo as I shared earlier. A viewer said, boy, Maria really let herself go. Not true. Hurtful, and stop that. We have the latest headlines going on right now. Cheryl Casone to bring it up, Cheryl.CASONE: Yes, got a little healthcare news to bring to you. Let's start with Facebook now cracking down on opioid dealers to combat the growing abuse of painkillers. The company stops showing content it's site that violates its drug policies. They're also taking steps to block drug sales on the platform, instead showing only links to news about drug abuse awareness. Facebook also launching a get help feature in the Facebook search function. The CDC estimates only 30,000 people died after overdosing on synthetic opioids last year. Shares of Facebook are little changed in the premarket right now.All right. Staying with the healthcare roundup. The FDA, approved a Teva Pharmaceuticals generic version of the EpiPen. The move opens the door to more competition for the emergency allergy medication. Back in 2016, Congress blasted the EpiPen maker, Mylan, for raising the price to $600. The company later launched its lower-cost generic version for $300. Teva probably going to come up with something cheaper -- you know these guys. Shares of Teva Pharmaceuticals, this is their game, up nearly 20 percent this year.All right. Staying with health as the New York University has announced that it will cover tuition for all of its medical students. This is the first among the nation's major medical schools. NYU hopes it's going to expand career options for graduates who will no longer be strapped with six-figure debt. The school raised $454 million of the $600 million it needs to fund the tuition package going forward in perpetuity, we should say. Get this, $100 million, Neil, was donated by good friend, Home Depot co-founder, Ken Langone, and his wife. As you know, Mr. Langone, his generosity really knows no bounds.CAVUTO: Not too shabby. What about for philosophy majors? Did they get any relief?CASONE: No. I think they're not included in this one, yes.KELLY: I just have to say, this is unbelievable and unprecedented and this is going to make Bernie Sanders' head explode because this is a private market doing what it needs to be doing. There's no way that the government should be going in and covering people's tuitions.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Although, if you thought medical school was hard to get into before it was free.CAVUTO: Oh, man, yes. Look, you know, you're right about that. Guys, thank you very, very much. Meanwhile, saying goodbye to the queen of soul but there is a new biotech in the works to remember her right after this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ever since I can remember, my family has been my whole life. Rachel. Rachel.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He chose me with his family. And if he chose his family. He might spend the rest of his like resenting you.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You got nasty.(END VIDEO CLIP)CAVUTO: Well, the weekend box office looking at "Crazy Rich Asians" debuting formally across the world, actually. Mike Sargent, the WBAI Radio Chief Film Critic joins us right now. This is getting off the chart reviews. It's early release, critics like yourself on Wednesday, what's the big deal here?MIKE SARGENT, CHIEF FILM CRITIC, WBAI RADIO: Well, you know, the big deal is several things. One, it's a really fun film, it's essentially Cinderella. But the other thing is, you're immersed into the Asian culture and it's definitely a different experience to see every character you see on screen be Asian. You learn a little bit about the Asian culture and when you come out, I had the strange feeling, like, I want to start talking to Asian people on the train. Are you going to see this movie?CAVUTO: Leave us alone!SARGENT: It just really made you appreciate the culture and so many other things. But Awkwafina steals the film. That's all I got to say. She's amazing. She and Michelle Yeoh. They really do a great job. But that's what you get good characters played by really good actors. There's so many things about it that I think people like. It will be definitely by a classic.CAVUTO: You said your wife and daughter, they went and --SARGENT: They were lined up to go because my daughter -- you know, minored in Asian languages, she speaks Mandarin and Japanese and said I'm going. And thing is, she has so many Asian friends and she said it rings so true in terms of the complexities of the culture, the wonderful richness of the culture. That's really what comes across. You see so many aspects that are just different and it reminds you movies can do. Movies can take you someplace you will never go except your daughter, of course. You know, and then, you kind of come out of it, you know, with a different perspective.CAVUTO: You know, White Anglo-Saxon dominated movies are the only way to make movies. We had the success of the "Black Panther" earlier this year and now this.SARGENT: The thing is stories. Stories are something for all humans. And you know, the best thing about stories is to kind of learn something you never learned about, you know. You get insight to a character you would never be.TARLOV: And it also -- it wasn't martial arts, it wasn't geisha culture. It was relatable to us like trolling through Instagram, you would be seeing these stories and they would be your friends.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It is 0.001 percent that it's about, and yet it is relatable.TARLOV: Pop-culture-wise, I mean, the same references that you would have.SARGENT: Well, you do the same references but also, it's a fantasy in that, you know -- imagine if you been with this guy and then you found out he's like the richest man in Asia. The most eligible bachelor and he just never told you because he wanted you to like him for him.CAVUTO: Never encountered that.SARGENT: No.TARLOV: It rarely happens.CAVUTO: In movies it's a possibility. We'll have more after this as futures markets are soft, stay with us.CAVUTO: All right. Good morning, everybody. I'm Maria Bartiromo. I always wait for a response.Load-Date: August 17, 2018End of Document

Fan Bingbing: Has China's most famous actress been disappeared by the Communist Party?CNN.comSeptember 12, 2018 Wednesday 6:53 AM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: ASIALength: 1141 wordsByline: By Steven Jiang, Ben Westcott and Nanlin Fang, CNNBodyImagine if one day Jennifer Lawrence was walking the red carpet in Los Angeles and the next she vanished completely with no word about where she was.It might sound ludicrous, or terrifying, but it's the reality in China, where one of the country's most famous actresses has disappeared without a trace amid an uproar over tax evasion by celebrities.Fan Bingbing, one of China's highest-paid and most bankable stars, has appeared in both Chinese and Western films, including the multimillion-dollar X-Men franchise.Across the country, her face once adorned thousands of advertisements, her star power used to sell a galaxy of luxury brands, from Cartier to Louis Vuitton. She was a regular sight at major award shows and fashion ceremonies. In 2015, Time Magazine named her China's "most famous actress."But the film star hasn't been seen in public since early June, when, according to a post on her verified social-media account, she went to visit a children's hospital in Tibet.In an article by state media Securities Daily on September 6, which was later deleted, the publication said Fan had been brought "under control and about to receive legal judgment."No official statement has been made as to Fan's whereabouts, or any potential criminal charges against the actress.However, in a country where top celebrities are forced to keep an inoffensive public profile to stay in the Chinese government's good graces, people have drawn their own conclusions about the actress' location."If you are a billionaire, then that is something that obviously you can enjoy to a certain extent, but you've got to be very, very wary that you don't at any stage cross a red line of some sort and fall afoul of the Chinese Communist Party," Fergus Ryan, a cyber analyst with the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, told CNN.In 2011, the country's best-known artist, Ai Weiwei, was detained for almost three months during which time his whereabouts were unclear. He was later released after he signed a confession authorities described as being related to tax evasion.Yin yang contractsFan's purported problems began when alleged copies of a film contract she had signed were leaked onto China's social media in late May.According to state tabloid Global Times, she had two different contracts, one for tax purposes saying she was paid $1.5 million (10 million yuan) and a separate, private contract for $7.5 million (50 million yuan).It's a practice known in China as "yin-yang contracts," a form of tax evasion where the first, smaller contract is reported to authorities while the second, larger one is treated as tax-free income.The man behind the leak, Chinese TV host Cui Yongyuan, apologized in June to Fan for his actions, but the same month the State Administration of Taxation of China urged investigators to look into allegations of yin-yang contracts in the country's film industry.Fan's team issued a furious denial at the time but the actress hasn't been seen in public since the dispute.In September, China's Beijing Normal University released a report, lauded as the first "in the world" and heavily promoted in Chinese state media, which ranked the country's stars by their level of "social responsibility." Fan was ranked last, with a score of 0 out of 100.A producer with a major Chinese studio told CNN the practice of having two contracts, one of them smaller to avoid paying too much tax, was "universal" in the film industry.He said everyone was worried following Fan's disappearance, especially because "almost every contract has some irregularities" and won't stand up to a serious audit.Like other industry insiders CNN spoke to, he declined to be named due to the political sensitivity of the topic.Scaring celebrities into lineJonathan Landreth, former Beijing-based Asia editor for the Hollywood Reporter and longtime observer of China's entertainment industry, told CNN the Chinese Communist Party was treading a tricky line, keen to use high-profile celebrities to sell the "Chinese Dream," but not wanting to promote the stark income divide."Maybe this is just scaring folk to ... start paying taxes. If someone were to get busted, then I think it would send a ripple effect to how film production goes forward in the coming years," Landreth said.An executive in a foreign film studio's China office told CNN the lack of A-list celebrities in China increased the bargaining power and earnings of a lucky few -- high-profile performers like Fan.But while cracking down on them might solve other problems, she said it wouldn't help address the fundamental lack of talent across the Chinese film and television industries.Combined with strict ideological control, such measures act only to create a "sad situation" in China's creative industry, she said.The controls, though, can only go so far. The Chinese government needs the high-profile celebrities to help drive commerce, both domestically and internationally, to promote China, said Landreth.The crackdown may in fact be intended to solve a different problem facing authorities. "It has long been an open secret that a movie budget is a great place to hide money," said Landreth.The Communist Party's leadership may hope that by shining a light on celebrity tax avoidance, it could deflect attention and avoid closer public scrutiny of the rumored corruption among top government officials and their families, Landreth told CNN.Spreading 'positive energy'The Chinese Communist Party has long had an uncomfortable relationship with celebrities.In recent years, state media has called on celebrities to spread "positive energy" on the internet. The threat of career-ending trouble with authorities has led the country's stars to pay attention to the party's wishes.The result is a celebrity culture that has less in common with the salacious and controversial Hollywood familiar to the Western world. In China, celebrities often try to keep their reputations' positive and inoffensive.Australian analyst Ryan said when he lived in China, he worked with the publicity team for Chinese actress and singer Li Bingbing.He encouraged Li to become more involved with environmental causes, including the United Nations Environment Program.But Ryan said the team would never choose a cause, or take up a fight that was ahead of what the Communist Party was comfortable with, especially if it opposed current government policy."You would be foolish to go out ahead of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese authorities on issues and lead the way," he said.Despite the speculation and the concern, Ryan said it was possible the explanation for Fan's disappearance was actually very simple."She possibly did something wrong ... the evidence was put out there for all to see, I guess, in a way that put the authorities in a position where they had to come down hard on her," he said.Load-Date: September 19, 2018End of Document

US, Japan and Australia challenge Huawei in Papua New GuineaAssociated Press Financial WireSeptember 28, 2018 Friday 1:45 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 568 wordsByline: By ROD McGUIRK, Associated PressDateline: CANBERRA, Australia BodyCANBERRA, Australia (AP) - The United States, Japan and Australia are cooperating on a domestic internet cable proposal for Papua New Guinea as an alternative to an offer by Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant that the United States regards as a cybersecurity threat, a U.S. diplomat said Friday.The Australian government blocked Huawei in August from rolling out Australia's 5G network due to security issues and has concerns about the company's involvement in the telecommunication infrastructure of its nearest neighbor, Papua New Guinea.The U.S. charge d'affaires to Australia, James Carouso, said the three Pacific defense allies were negotiating with the impoverished South Pacific island nation of 8 million people, mostly subsistence farmers, on its internet contract."We're working on a counter offer," Carouso told Australian Broadcasting Corp. "These are negotiations that are going on. Absolutely up to the PNG government at the end of the day."Papua New Guinea minister Justin Tkatchenko said his government was willing to work with Australia on the internet network if it offered a better deal than Huawei, The Australian newspaper reported Friday."I know Australia is against Huawei in many situations, thinking they are going to spy on everybody and take all their information," Tkatchenko told the newspaper. "But we will work with Australia, with China, with Huawei, in that regard to get the best possible outcome for our people and for communications domestically as well."Tkatchenko could not be contacted on Friday for comment.Australia proposed the funding for the 5,457-kilometer (3,391-mile) internet network that will provide undersea cabling to connect 14 provincial centers as the first investment of a new trilateral infrastructure fund established this year to counter growing Chinese influence in the Indo-Pacific region, the newspaper said.The Huawei option would involve a $198 million loan from China's Eximbank, the newspaper said.Australia agreed in June to pay most of the $101 million price tag for an undersea internet cable from a Sydney broadband hub to Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. The new Papua New Guinea domestic network would link into that cable.Australia stepped into that project after the Solomons' government signed a contract with Huawei in 2017 to build the cable. The Solomons consequently scrapped the Huawei deal.Several governments have been scrutinizing Huawei over its links to the Chinese government. The private Chinese company started by a former People's Liberation Army major in 1987 suffered a setback in the U.S. market in 2012 when a congressional report said it was a security risk and warned phone companies not to buy its equipment.Shenzhen-based Huawei, the world's largest telecommunications equipment supplier, had also been banned from bidding for contracts for Australia's broadband network in 2011.The U.S. House Intelligence Committee previously found that Huawei was tied to the Chinese government and had failed to provide responsive and detailed answers about that relationship and about its U.S. operations.Huawei denied being financed to undertake research and development for the Chinese military, but the committee said it had received internal Huawei documents showing the company provided special network services to an entity alleged to be an elite cyber-warfare unit within the People's Liberation Army.Load-Date: September 29, 2018End of Document

Sen. Cruz Demands Answers From Google Executive Regarding CensorshipTargeted News ServiceSeptember 26, 2018 Wednesday 7:50 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1413 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe office of Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, issued the following news release:U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation participated in a hearing today titled, "Examining Safeguards for Consumer Data Privacy." There, he directed his line of questioning towards Google's Chief Privacy Officer, Keith Enright, raising concerns of Google's cooperation to abide by the Chinese government's censorship rules yet refusing to fulfill a contract with the U.S. government. He then shifted his questioning to focus on American citizens and political affiliations being censored via the search engine's results."I can tell you millions of Americans, millions of Texans believe that big tech companies are actively censoring the speech of American citizens and are silencing the voices of conservatives," Sen. Cruz said. "One of the frustrating things about this issue is that there's almost no transparency. There are almost no public data to assess if that's accurate or not. So, my question is, is Google analyzing the question? Is Google actually looking--not your own personal experiences in searching--but are you assessing it empirically? Upon what data do you make testimony in this committee that Google is not favoring in its search results one party over another? Or one candidate over another?"Watch Sen. Cruz's full line of questioning here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32Szg7nbCmQ&#38;feature=youtu.be). Full transcript below:Sen. Cruz: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Welcome to the witnesses.Mr. Enright, I want to go back to the topic that a couple of other senators raised with you which is China. After a cyberattack compromised the Gmail accounts of dozens of Chinese human rights advocates, Google decided in March of 2010 to shut down its operations in China. At the time Google released a statement that said quote: 'We want as many people in the world as possible to have access to our services, including users in mainland China, yet the Chinese government has been crystal clear throughout our discussions that self-censorship is a non-negotiable legal requirement.' Despite taking this principled stand in 2010, it's been reported last month that Google has been secretly developing a search engine for China as part of a project known as 'Dragonfly.' Are those reports accurate?Mr. Enright: Senator, thank you for the question. As we've said, I am aware of those reports. I need to be clear for the record that my understanding is that we are not close to launching a search product in China. And, whether we eventually could or would remains unclear.Sen. Cruz: Is there a Project Dragonfly? And if there is, what is it?Mr. Enright: We have an array of internal projects. And, I wouldn't think that it was necessarily appropriate for a privacy conversation to speculate as to what we might be looking at in terms of a product launch in some part of the world.Sen. Cruz: So, you're not answering my question then on Project Dragonfly?Mr. Enright: There is a Project Dragonfly.Sen. Cruz: And it's focused on a search engine in China, is that accurate?Mr. Enright: There is no--we are not close to launching a search engine--Sen. Cruz: You're saying you're not close to launching, but what I'm asking is the topic of Project Dragonfly. Is it a project to develop a search engine in China?I didn't ask timing of launch, I asked what it is.Mr. Enright: Understood. I am not clear on the contours of what is in scope or out of scope for that project. But, I can say that if we were close to launching a search project in China, myself and my team would be very actively engaged to ensure that it was going through the appropriate privacy review process. And, that it was consistent with our privacy values and the commitments that we've made to our users.Sen. Cruz: In your opinion, does China engage in censoring its citizens?Mr. Enright: As the privacy representative for Google, I'm not sure that I have an informed opinion on that question.Sen. Cruz: It's also been reported that more than 3,100 Google employees sent a letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai earlier this year protesting the company's work on 'Project Maven,' a Pentagon pilot program aimed at speeding up the Department of Defense's use of artificial intelligence technologies. Likewise, 1,400 Google employees signed a letter last month protesting Google's plans to create a censored search engine for China.Mr. Enright, you have worked at Google since 2011. Does it concern you that more than twice as many employees at Google have protested working with the U.S. military than have protested creating a censored search engine for China?Mr. Enright: Senator, I take a great deal of pride in the fact that Google is an organization that allows employees to voice their opinions--including opinions about product strategy, product decisions--right up to the senior most leadership of the organization. As to Project Maven, again my understanding is that there was internal concern raised. Employees were given a voice. There was a significant internal discussion around the project. It ultimately affected the strategic direction of leadership. And, while Google continues to commit to meeting the responsibilities of our initial Maven contract, we'll continue to work with the United States government, the Department of Defense in certain areas including: cybersecurity, healthcare, and productivity. But, we are focusing on making sure that our collaborations with the government are consistent with our core values.Sen. Cruz: Let me try it again, because your answer does not answer my question. Does it concern you that more than twice as many Google employees expressed concern about working with the U.S. military as did concern about being complicit in China's censoring its citizens?Mr. Enright: It encourages me that Google is a place where employees are able to voice those kinds of concerns of a project that they want to ensure are consistent with our values.Sen.

And, in my experience I see no evidence of bias in the way that our products and services operate.Sen. Cruz: Okay, so you gave a categorical answer, 'No, they don't favor one party over the other.'

Cruz: Does Google assess whether it's search results are biased in favor of one political party or another?Mr. Enright: My understanding, again as a Privacy Executive for Google, so we're stepping outside of my core domain here. But, my understanding is that one of the paramount design decisions for our engineering teams in our many products is that we are designing for everyone.Sen. Cruz: Mr. Enright, we're having a problem with answering the question. I asked if Google assesses this question. If you studied--I can tell you millions of Americans, millions of Texans believe that big tech companies are actively censoring the speech of American citizens and are silencing the voices of conservatives. One of the frustrating things about this issue is that there's almost no transparency. There are almost no public data to assess if that's accurate or not. So, my question is, is Google analyzing the question? Is Google actually looking--not your own personal experiences in searching--but are you assessing it empirically? Upon what data do you make testimony in this committee that Google is not favoring in its search results one party over another? Or one candidate over another?Mr. Enright: As the Chief Privacy Officer of Google, this is not within my core domain.

SEN. CRUZ DEMANDS ANSWERS FROM GOOGLE EXECUTIVE REGARDING CENSORSHIPStates News ServiceSeptember 26, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1385 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Texas Senator Ted Cruz:U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation participated in a hearing today titled, Examining Safeguards for Consumer Data Privacy. There, he directed his line of questioning towards Googles Chief Privacy Officer, Keith Enright, raising concerns of Googles cooperation to abide by the Chinese governments censorship rules yet refusing to fulfill a contract with the U.S. government. He then shifted his questioning to focus on American citizens and political affiliations being censored via the search engines results.I can tell you millions of Americans, millions of Texans believe that big tech companies are actively censoring the speech of American citizens and are silencing the voices of conservatives, Sen. Cruz said. One of the frustrating things about this issue is that theres almost no transparency. There are almost no public data to assess if thats accurate or not. So, my question is, is Google analyzing the question? Is Google actually looking--not your own personal experiences in searching--but are you assessing it empirically? Upon what data do you make testimony in this committee that Google is not favoring in its search results one party over another? Or one candidate over another?Watch Sen. Cruzs full line of questioning here. Full transcript below:Sen. Cruz: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Welcome to the witnesses.Mr. Enright, I want to go back to the topic that a couple of other senators raised with you which is China. After a cyberattack compromised the Gmail accounts of dozens of Chinese human rights advocates, Google decided in March of 2010 to shut down its operations in China. At the time Google released a statement that said quote: We want as many people in the world as possible to have access to our services, including users in mainland China, yet the Chinese government has been crystal clear throughout our discussions that self-censorship is a non-negotiable legal requirement. Despite taking this principled stand in 2010, its been reported last month that Google has been secretly developing a search engine for China as part of a project known as Dragonfly. Are those reports accurate?Mr. Enright: Senator, thank you for the question. As weve said, I am aware of those reports. I need to be clear for the record that my understanding is that we are not close to launching a search product in China. And, whether we eventually could or would remains unclear.Sen. Cruz: Is there a Project Dragonfly? And if there is, what is it?Mr. Enright: We have an array of internal projects. And, I wouldnt think that it was necessarily appropriate for a privacy conversation to speculate as to what we might be looking at in terms of a product launch in some part of the world.Sen. Cruz: So, youre not answering my question then on Project Dragonfly?Mr. Enright: There is a Project Dragonfly.Sen. Cruz: And its focused on a search engine in China, is that accurate?Mr. Enright: There is no--we are not close to launching a search engine--Sen. Cruz: Youre saying youre not close to launching, but what Im asking is the topic of Project Dragonfly. Is it a project to develop a search engine in China?I didnt ask timing of launch, I asked what it is.Mr. Enright: Understood. I am not clear on the contours of what is in scope or out of scope for that project. But, I can say that if we were close to launching a search project in China, myself and my team would be very actively engaged to ensure that it was going through the appropriate privacy review process. And, that it was consistent with our privacy values and the commitments that weve made to our users.Sen. Cruz: In your opinion, does China engage in censoring its citizens?Mr. Enright: As the privacy representative for Google, Im not sure that I have an informed opinion on that question.Sen. Cruz: Its also been reported that more than 3,100 Google employees sent a letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai earlier this year protesting the companys work on Project Maven, a Pentagon pilot program aimed at speeding up the Department of Defenses use of artificial intelligence technologies. Likewise, 1,400 Google employees signed a letter last month protesting Googles plans to create a censored search engine for China.Mr. Enright, you have worked at Google since 2011. Does it concern you that more than twice as many employees at Google have protested working with the U.S. military than have protested creating a censored search engine for China?Mr. Enright: Senator, I take a great deal of pride in the fact that Google is an organization that allows employees to voice their opinions--including opinions about product strategy, product decisions--right up to the senior most leadership of the organization. As to Project Maven, again my understanding is that there was internal concern raised. Employees were given a voice. There was a significant internal discussion around the project. It ultimately affected the strategic direction of leadership. And, while Google continues to commit to meeting the responsibilities of our initial Maven contract, well continue to work with the United States government, the Department of Defense in certain areas including: cybersecurity, healthcare, and productivity. But, we are focusing on making sure that our collaborations with the government are consistent with our core values.Sen. Cruz: Let me try it again, because your answer does not answer my question. Does it concern you that more than twice as many Google employees expressed concern about working with the U.S. military as did concern about being complicit in Chinas censoring its citizens?Mr. Enright: It encourages me that Google is a place where employees are able to voice those kinds of concerns of a project that they want to ensure are consistent with our values.Sen. Cruz: Do Google search results as a systemic matter tend to favor one political party over another?Mr. Enright: No sir. We build products for everyone. And, in my experience I see no evidence of bias in the way that our products and services operate.Sen. Cruz: Okay, so you gave a categorical answer, No, they dont favor one party over the other. What is the basis for that answer? Upon what data do you rely?Mr. Enright: The basis for that answer Senator, is my own experience and my own understanding of our products. I have not reviewed data, so Im--Sen. Cruz: Does Google assess whether its search results are biased in favor of one political party or another?Mr. Enright: My understanding, again as a Privacy Executive for Google, so were stepping outside of my core domain here. But, my understanding is that one of the paramount design decisions for our engineering teams in our many products is that we are designing for everyone.Sen. Cruz: Mr. Enright, were having a problem with answering the question. I asked if Google assesses this question. If you studied--I can tell you millions of Americans, millions of Texans believe that big tech companies are actively censoring the speech of American citizens and are silencing the voices of conservatives. One of the frustrating things about this issue is that theres almost no transparency. There are almost no public data to assess if thats accurate or not.

Trump Reportedly To Propose 25% Tariff On $200 Billion Of Chinese ImportsThe FrontrunnerAugust 1, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 1202 wordsBodyCiting "a source familiar with the plan," Reuters (8/1, Holland) reports the Administration "plans to propose slapping a 25-percent tariff on $200 billion of imported Chinese goods after initially setting them at 10 percent." The goods include food products, chemicals, steel and aluminum and "consumer goods ranging from dog food, furniture and carpets to car tires, bicycles, baseball gloves and beauty products." An announcement could come "as early as Wednesday," the source said. Reuters says "raising the proposed level to 25 percent could escalate the trade dispute" between the countries. Bloomberg News (7/31, Leonard, Jacobs, 4.46M) likewise reports that the Administration "will propose more than doubling its planned tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports, ratcheting up pressure on Beijing to return to the negotiating table."Mnuchin Aides In Talks With Chinese Counterparts About Potential Trade Deal.Bloomberg News (7/31, Leonard, Martin, Mohsin, Jacobs, 4.46M) reports that the Administration and Chinese officials are "trying to restart talks aimed at averting a full-blown trade war." According to Bloomberg, "Representatives of US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He are having private conversations as they look for ways to reengage in negotiations." However, "complicating Mnuchin's efforts is a harder line taken by US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who has jurisdiction over the US's 301 investigation that sparked the tariffs." According to a front-page story in the Wall Street Journal (7/31, A1, Davis, Wei, Subscription Publication, 6.13M), the talks haven't made much progress and remain at a very preliminary stage, with both sides arguing that it is up to the other to make the first move.Reuters (7/31, Yao, Glenn), however, says the Chinese government is "aware that friction with the United States over trade is creating uncertainty for its job market, and has pledged not to let the row trigger large-scale unemployment."Apple Sales Jump 19% In China Despite Trade Tensions.The Washington Examiner (7/31, Langford, 340K) reports Apple "continued to expand sales in China in the three months through June despite escalating trade tensions between the Trump administration and Beijing." Revenue from China "grew 19 percent to $9.55 billion," the company said in a statement. The numbers show tariffs "have yet to dint Apple's performance," but "that could still happen."WSJournal A1 Analysis: US Bolstered In Trade Fights By Strong Economy.A front-page story in the Wall Street Journal (7/31, A1, Zumbrun, Subscription Publication, 6.13M) reports that China, Europe and Mexico's economies this week have showed signs of stumbling amid trade disputes with the Administration, while the US has powered ahead. Economic reports Tuesday showed US wages and salaries grew in the second quarter at their fastest pace in nearly a decade. By contrast, other data out Tuesday showed Mexico's economy contracted in the second quarter and the Chinese government said Tuesday that the nation's economy "faces some new problems and new challenges."Economic Data Suggests Chinese Economy Starting To Feel Tariff Impact.In what the Wall Street Journal (7/31, Qi, Zhu, Subscription Publication, 6.13M) calls the first official data reflecting the impact of US tariffs, China's economy faltered in July. Official surveys of both factories and service providers pointed to sluggish demand. The Wall Street Journal (7/31, Subscription Publication, 6.13M) editorializes that despite the data, the Administration shouldn't assume that Beijing will cave under the strain of tariffs. Chinese leaders, it argues, still have many options to keep the economy expanding, so the US should work to negotiate new trade rules with China.NYTimes: Xi Faces Rising Discontent Over Vaccine Scandal, Economy.A New York Times (7/31, Buckley, 19.33M) analysis says Chinese President Xi Jinping "seemed indomitable" nearly five months ago "when lawmakers abolished a term limit on his power," but China has since "been ruffled by economic headwinds, a vaccine scandal and trade battles with Washington, emboldening critics in Beijing who are questioning Mr. Xi's sweeping control." Censorship and the threat of "punishment have muted dissent in China since Mr. Xi came to power six years ago," so the "current of discontent does not pose any immediate threat to Mr. Xi's hold on power." Communist Party insiders and foreign experts, however, have "said misgivings about Mr. Xi's hard-line policies appeared to be building among intellectuals, liberal-minded former officials and middle-class people after the recent misfires." There are also some indications "that the trade tensions and domestic criticisms may have already prompted Mr. Xi's government to cool the public tone."Bloomberg News: US, Mexico Nearing Deal In NAFTA Car Talks.Citing five sources close to the talks, Bloomberg News (7/31, Martin, Leonard, 4.46M) reports that the US and Mexico are "in the final stages of negotiating a deal on rules for cars sold under Nafta, one of the biggest sticking points in discussions" to overhaul the trade pact. The two sides have reportedly "exchanged new proposals for the auto industry, and Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo is scheduled to travel to Washington on Thursday for meetings with US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer."Canadian Officials Out Of The Loop As US, Mexican Officials Renegotiate NAFTA.Bloomberg News (7/31, Leonard, Martin, 4.46M) reports that Canadian officials have "been rebuffed in recent attempts to engage on Nafta with US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer amid talks between the Trump administration and Mexico." According to Bloomberg, "The Canadian negotiating team, led by Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, has been told that Lighthizer is focusing on negotiations with Mexico and isn't interested in engaging with Canada at the moment." Freeland "traveled to Mexico last week, and the trip was motivated in part by the US decision to isolate Canada from the talks." The Washington Examiner (7/31, Higgins, 340K) says Lighthizer will be meeting Thursday in Washington with Mexican officials, but "Canada will not be there. Whether they were ever interested in being part of Thursday's talks is unclear." According to a report Tuesday by Canada's National Post, Freeland "made an overture to join Thursday's meeting and the US did not reciprocate."CNBC Poll: 59% Of Economists, Money Managers Approve Of Trump's Handling Of Economy.Breitbart (7/31, Carney, 1.28M) reports in a separate story that CNBC's (7/31, 4.81M) Fed Survey found that President Trump's "handling of the economy has the approval of 59 percent of the economists, money managers, and strategists," who anticipate US economic growth will be "nearly 3 percent in 2018, according to the survey." However, Breitbart adds, "Unsurprisingly, most of the participants in the CNBC Fed survey are not fans of tariffs, with 59 percent saying it will reduce economic growth and 54 percent saying it will reduce employment. ... On average, they see the current round of tariffs and retaliation as reducing annual growth by around one-tenth of a percentage point."Load-Date: August 1, 2018End of Document

Former Glaxosmithkline Scientist Pleads Guilty to Stealing Trade Secrets to Benefit Chinese Pharmaceutical CompanyTargeted News ServiceAugust 31, 2018 Friday 10:47 PM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 482 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania BodyThe U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, William M. McSwain, issued the following news release:United States Attorney William M. McSwain announced today that Dr. Yu Xue, 48, of Wayne, Pennsylvania, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal trade secrets from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) to benefit a Chinese pharmaceutical company named Renopharma.Dr. Xue and two of her associates, Dr. Tao Li and Dr. Yan Mei, created Renopharma in Nanjing, China. Renopharma intended to research and develop anti-cancer drugs and received financial support and subsidies from the government of China. At the time, Xue was employed as a scientist at GSK working on developing biopharmaceutical products. These products typically cost in excess of $1 billion to research and develop.Xue sent a substantial number of GSK's scientific documents, some of which contained GSK trade secrets, to Li and Mei at Renopharma in China. The data contained information regarding multiple biopharmaceutical products under development, GSK research data, and GSK processes regarding the research, development, and manufacturing of biopharmaceutical products. Xue typically sent the documents via e-mail or transferred the documents via portable electronic storage devices. Xue sent these documents to Li and Mei with the intention to steal GSK's information for their economic benefit. On January 5, 2016, the FBI arrested Li and seized his computer on which they found a number of GSK documents containing trade secret and confidential information which he had received from Xue."Dr. Xue used her position at GSK to steal valuable trade secrets to benefit a company bankrolled by the Chinese government," said U.S. Attorney McSwain. "We cannot allow U.S. citizens or foreign nationals to steal sensitive business information and hand it over to competitors in other countries. This sort of economic warfare presents a danger to our economic security, jeopardizes America's position as a global leader in innovation, and will not be tolerated.""Trade secrets are the cornerstone of American innovation and a driver of the nation's economy," said Michael T. Harpster, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI's Philadelphia Division. "When a corporation spends billions of dollars developing products and processes, the theft of valuable intellectual property is a clear threat to the company. When stolen trade secrets stand to benefit a foreign economic rival, it's a threat to our country, as well. The FBI will continue to work vigorously to combat intellectual property theft and bring those responsible to justice."Yu Xue is scheduled to be sentenced before the Honorable Joel H. Slomsky. The case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Robert J. Livermore and Katherine E.

McSwain announced that Dr. Tao Li, 45, of San Diego, California, pleaded guilty today to conspiracy to steal trade secrets from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) to benefit a Chinese pharmaceutical company named Renopharma.Dr. Li and two of his friends, Dr. Yu Xue and Dr. Yan Mei, created Renopharma in Nanjing, China, supposedly to research and develop anti-cancer drugs. In reality, though, Renopharma was used as a repository of stolen information from GSK. Renopharma received financial support and subsidies from the government of China. At the time, Xue was employed as a scientist at GSK working on developing biopharmaceutical products. These products typically cost in excess of $1 billion to research and develop.Xue sent a substantial number of GSK's scientific documents, some of which contained GSK trade secrets, to Li and Mei at Renopharma in China.

On January 5, 2016, the FBI arrested Li and seized his computer on which they found a number of GSK documents containing trade secret and confidential information which he had received from Xue. Xue previously pleaded guilty on August 31, 2018."Dr. Li illegally stole trade secrets to benefit himself and his company, which was financed by the Chinese government," said U.S. Attorney McSwain. "The lifeblood of companies like GSK is its intellectual property, and when that property is stolen and transferred to a foreign country, it threatens thousands of jobs here in America. Not only is this a serious crime, but it is literally a form of economic warfare against American interests. Such criminal behavior must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.""GSK spends top dollar on research and development to bring new medications to market," said Michael T. Harpster, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI's Philadelphia Division. "The theft of valuable trade secrets threatens products in the pipeline, to the detriment of both the company and the patients those drugs might help. It adds insult to injury when that know-how is diverted for the benefit of a foreign economic rival. The FBI is determined to stand up for the innovators creating products that improve people's lives, by investigating and holding accountable those who would steal trade secrets."Tao Li is scheduled to be sentenced on January 4, 2018 before the Honorable Joel H. Slomsky. The case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Robert J. Livermore and Katherine E.

China push to end reliance on US tech at trade fight's coreAssociated Press InternationalJuly 5, 2018 Thursday 6:53 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 1004 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - Chinese telecoms giant ZTE Corp.'s brush with death after Washington barred it from buying U.S. components was a stark reminder that China's industries still depend on American technology despite Beijing's efforts to catch up.The Trump administration accuses China of using theft to fill some of those technology needs and is poised to hike tariffs Friday on its goods in a spiraling conflict that could chill global trade. But at the same time, ZTE and other Chinese tech companies pay billions of dollars annually for high-tech U.S. parts and patent rights.China's ambitious plans to end that dependence by creating its own innovators in fields from robotics to electric cars to biotech are fueling fears of a loss of American industrial leadership. That has worsened tensions in a fraught U.S.-Chinese relationship as business partners, customers and increasingly as competitors.ZTE's chairman said the April ban over its exports to Iran and North Korea could destroy China's No. 2 maker of network gear. To regain access, the company agreed to pay a $1 billion fine, replace its executive team and embed U.S.-chosen compliance officers in the company.ZTE is far from alone. China assembles some 90 percent of the world's smartphones, computers and other electronics. But most of the revenue flows to American companies that supply computer chips and other technology.In the broader economy, Chinese banks, airlines, farms and other industries need U.S. technology from jetliners to drugs to software.Its trading partners complain that Beijing's initiatives to create global competitors in fields from biotech to robots to electric cars are built on know-how the Chinese government has stolen or pressured foreign companies to hand over.U.S. President Donald Trump has responded by threatening tariff hikes on up to $450 billion of Chinese goods, but Beijing struck a defiant note on Thursday, rejecting "threats and blackmail.""China will not bow in the face of threats and blackmail, nor will it shake its resolve to defend global free trade and the multilateral system," a Commerce Ministry spokesman, Gao Feng, said at a news conference.He said China would not "fire the first shot" but would fight back to defend its interests.Communist leaders see advanced technology as a path to prosperity and to restoring national greatness."Self-reliance is the base of the struggle for the Chinese nation to stand among the peoples of the world," President Xi Jinping said in a speech in March to members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Chinese Academy of Engineering."Independent innovation is the only way for us to ascend the world's technological pinnacle," the official Xinhua News Agency quoted Xi as saying.One key Chinese weakness is in semiconductors, used in everything from smartphones to cars. High costs and research challenges mean China still needs years to create its own."I don't think there is a lot of progress," said Nikhil Batra, who follows the telecom equipment industry for IDC.Trade data suggest China imported as much as $26 billion worth of integrated circuits last year, according to Kenny Liew of BMI Research.China does have some success stories, including Huawei Technologies Ltd., the biggest global seller of switching gear for phone companies and the No. 3 smartphone brand.

China push to end reliance on US tech at trade fight's coreAssociated Press Financial WireJuly 5, 2018 Thursday 6:52 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 1004 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - Chinese telecoms giant ZTE Corp.'s brush with death after Washington barred it from buying U.S. components was a stark reminder that China's industries still depend on American technology despite Beijing's efforts to catch up.The Trump administration accuses China of using theft to fill some of those technology needs and is poised to hike tariffs Friday on its goods in a spiraling conflict that could chill global trade. But at the same time, ZTE and other Chinese tech companies pay billions of dollars annually for high-tech U.S. parts and patent rights.China's ambitious plans to end that dependence by creating its own innovators in fields from robotics to electric cars to biotech are fueling fears of a loss of American industrial leadership. That has worsened tensions in a fraught U.S.-Chinese relationship as business partners, customers and increasingly as competitors.ZTE's chairman said the April ban over its exports to Iran and North Korea could destroy China's No. 2 maker of network gear. To regain access, the company agreed to pay a $1 billion fine, replace its executive team and embed U.S.-chosen compliance officers in the company.ZTE is far from alone. China assembles some 90 percent of the world's smartphones, computers and other electronics. But most of the revenue flows to American companies that supply computer chips and other technology.In the broader economy, Chinese banks, airlines, farms and other industries need U.S. technology from jetliners to drugs to software.Its trading partners complain that Beijing's initiatives to create global competitors in fields from biotech to robots to electric cars are built on know-how the Chinese government has stolen or pressured foreign companies to hand over.U.S. President Donald Trump has responded by threatening tariff hikes on up to $450 billion of Chinese goods, but Beijing struck a defiant note on Thursday, rejecting "threats and blackmail.""China will not bow in the face of threats and blackmail, nor will it shake its resolve to defend global free trade and the multilateral system," a Commerce Ministry spokesman, Gao Feng, said at a news conference.He said China would not "fire the first shot" but would fight back to defend its interests.Communist leaders see advanced technology as a path to prosperity and to restoring national greatness."Self-reliance is the base of the struggle for the Chinese nation to stand among the peoples of the world," President Xi Jinping said in a speech in March to members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Chinese Academy of Engineering."Independent innovation is the only way for us to ascend the world's technological pinnacle," the official Xinhua News Agency quoted Xi as saying.One key Chinese weakness is in semiconductors, used in everything from smartphones to cars. High costs and research challenges mean China still needs years to create its own."I don't think there is a lot of progress," said Nikhil Batra, who follows the telecom equipment industry for IDC.Trade data suggest China imported as much as $26 billion worth of integrated circuits last year, according to Kenny Liew of BMI Research.China does have some success stories, including Huawei Technologies Ltd., the biggest global seller of switching gear for phone companies and the No. 3 smartphone brand. The company has developed its own Kirin line of chip sets to power some of its phones, reducing reliance on U.S.-based Qualcomm Corp.'s Snapdragon and other foreign suppliers.Still, such successes are rare. Chinese companies are prolific patent applicants but researchers say many are for minor improvements or "me too" imitations.Beijing's plans highlight an array of areas where Chinese companies lag behind.

The beginning of the 5G passes first by a reconversion of the telecom sector and China knows itCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 18, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1826 wordsBody        The US trade war against China has opened and increased a new front: the predominance in telecommunications. There, the Chinese take the lead and even, Americans are in third place in the global race for the development of Fifth Generation or 5G networks and this is recognized by the same American industry.  In the middle of this pulse between the two powers, which on Saturday opened a new chapter with the idea of ??imposing 200 billion dollars in tariffs on Chinese products, the United States stopped the purchase of the chipmaker Qualcomm by the Asian Broadcom, It also closed the passage of its territory to Huawei and ZTE can now enter, but still with some reluctance. At the same time, brands in both countries seek to consolidate, by their own decision or by government mandate, but with the intention of competing with a better position in the global economy that comes with the 5G.  The deployments of 5G imply a whole rethinking of the action plans in telecommunications. Investment, consumption, technical standards, spectrum bands, new markets and financial or technological partners, everything is being redefined as a priority of company and State among the big economies, which in addition to having begun to impose their vision for the 5G also look in this technology an extension of its geopolitical strength; not just a mere development to enter the digital market.  The 5G -which by its nature will allow the technological enablement of different and simple daily activities when it is a reality in homes- already warns of the need for too many investments to buy now a lot of spectrum of all kinds; modernize and build more robust networks of marine, area and terrestrial infrastructures between radio bases, antennas, "small cells" or fiber optic connected to telephone exchanges and the home, as well as the idea of ??hiring capacity to other industries in the same sector to enhance them in future services.  The United States has understood it well and is the leader in the technology industry, has endorsed the sales, on different dates, of DirecTV and Time Warner by AT & T, while the news today is the merger of Sprint and T-Mobile telephone, whose combination would create the third operator in the country to compete with better horizontal and vertical possibilities and generating economies of scale in a market that tends to consolidate and against monsters such as Verizon and Comcast, which together with AT & T, already outline their 5G strategy via of fixed services starting this October.  China is on the lookout for the world with its 5G  But China has understood it, if not better, in its own way and it runs faster than the United States in 5G. The US wireless communications industry grouped in the CTIA has warned the government of its country that China is moving fast in this type of development and that's why it encourages it, based on an analysis sent to do with the telecommunications firms Analysys Mason and Rencon Analytics , that investing in 5G, at least 275,000 million dollars, will result in the creation of 3 million new value-added jobs and an additional increase in the country's GDP of 500,000 million dollars.  The CTIA has the diagnosis that China is in the first position with plans of 5G, followed by South Korea and then the site is occupied by the United States and Europe is still further away, because in 2017 it recognized that it advanced slowly with the 4G and that the Fifth Generation in telecommunications could bring 22 million well-paid jobs and an additional economy in 3.5 billion euros for all thecommunity block; but in principle, 180,000 million dollars were needed to be directed from 2018. Europe looks for what should be the type of final deployment for its 5G network.  The agency, the CTIA, defines Washington that Beijing is better prepared than anyone to make Smart Cities, autonomous vehicles, industry applications 4.0 or telemedicine, for example. And China goes for more to secure that first place with the Fifth Generation:  The Chinese State, with a different degree of shareholding in its telecommunication badge companies, has confirmed its interest in merging several of these brands.  Publicly, the names of China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom have already sounded, three giants between operators and manufacturers that serve, only three of them, an approximate of 1,734 million Chinese customers between landlines and mobiles in the domestic market and with offices and various contracts won around the world; in Latin America, for example, they already do business in Chile, Argentina, Brazil and Mexico.  China fuses its telecom giants  Measured in dollars, China Mobile achieved a turnover of 57,100 million dollars between January and June, while China Telecom entered 28,127 million dollars in the same period. China Unicom saw a decrease in its assets in the period, as at the end of 2017 they were worth around 60.684 million dollars and 56.763 million dollars at the end of June 2018, a reason why Beijing would also be interested in merging its telecom companies to continue maintaining its strong presence in the sector.  The figures of these three brands are not far from AT & T, the historical emblem of the United States in the industry. This company reported consolidated revenues of 38,000 million dollars in the first quarter of the year; another 39,000 million in the second and in both cases, their income decreased by approximately 1% compared to the reference periods of a year earlier.  In the world ranking of mobile operators, China Mobile ranks first; China Unicom is the fourth operator and China Telecom is the seventh.  The establishment of 5G networks demands strong financial muscle and power to generate economies of scale, which is why Beijing studies merging its brands, although this plan is part of China's trade war with the United States, several experts agree.  "The mergers of Chinese companies would have as a catalyst both economic and strategic elements. A horizontal merger can generate significant impacts on costs, due to the high economies of scale observed in that industry. The possibility of observing vertical mergers has in turn to do more with the identification of efficiencies along the entire value chain of services and in the latter, the deployment of 5G is the important thing, "says Víctor Pavón-Villamayor, President of Oxford Competition Economics.  Pavón Villamayor also proposes that mergers of Chinese brands "may have a strategic component: that China has decided to take the telecommunications industry as one of the key sectors of its economy to develop and promote a 'national champion', that is, a company with all the support of the Chinese State that will seek to go out to international markets and dominate them, why not in 5G ".  The fight with Trump encourages China to take its 5G around the world  Chinese companies, although not yet dominant in other countries, expand across all markets and win contracts. They, as well as Huawei and ZTE, managed to get companies such as Telefónica, Millicom and AMX to hire them technology to start up 4 and 4.5G services in different Latin American nations and they have also been interested in buying operators to enterother branches of the Latin American business and a potential path has already been noticed in the Brazilian Oi.  Javier Morales Fhon, specialist in telecommunications, states that in a purely sectoral sense, comparisons of a possible merger of China Unicom with China Telecom have the same risks and benefits for the market, as in their case would imply the combination in the West of Sprint with T Mobile.  "The potential merger of China Unicom with China Telecom would seek economies of scale to increase investments in 5G and face the competition of the largest operator in China such as China Mobile and AT & T and Verizon in the United States. The Chinese case also has a different component: companies are state-owned and have the special aggregate that is framed in the geopolitical context of the struggle between China and the United States for a new world order and that in these circumstances is summarized in 'who arrives first to develop in the 5G network '", says Morales Fhon in a comment from Lima.  Beijing has long regarded telecommunications as a strategic sector to ensure its role in the world. The Chinese State has a plan "Made in China 2025" in which it established ten sectoral plans related to high technology and all also go through issues such as Internet of Things (IoT) or the cloud, so China sees as a priority the development of 5G networks that realize their goals, even if this implies the merger of China Telecom with China Unicom. "It's what worries" the United States, says Morales Fhon:  "It is very likely that the 5G network is not a business model in the short term when we consider the end users, but the bet is that it is in the industry through the use of the IoT, hence the Chinese government, which It controls technological companies, intends to merge these companies with the objective of making economies of scale and not duplicating investments. "  The Chinese, among those who invest the most and develop 5G and IoT  In China, the peak of 4G networks is nearing completion: in the second quarter of 2018, 75% of the market served already had a 4G service network and operators already find less incentives to acquire customers that generate low consumption. added value and therefore, explains the Peruvian analyst, have been reducing investments in 4G devices, 17% in 2017, to redirect them to 5G investments, first directly to cloud and IoT businesses.  A report by ICEX-Spain Export and Investment, revealed that in 2017, China contributed 28% of all the global investment in IoT and that for the decade 2010-2020, China will have invested 515,000 million euros in technologies that connect to the machines with the other machines. Therefore, by 2020, 95% of all IoT devices that humanity will consume will be released to China.  The push of the 5G networks could also mean support for telecommunications companies in their battle against the Internet giants, who are the biggest beneficiaries of the income that the constant demand for content leaves, and that is why they demand a regulation for that. type of platforms, predicts Jorge Fernando Negrete Pacheco, director at Mediatelecom Policy & Law:  "The 5G is pressing the digital economy of the planet, because it is also a recovery of telecom companies, faced with Internet companies. In the last decade they grew enormously and with the 5G is how the telecommunication companies will try to recover a part of the lost territory. That is why mergers are taking place and Internet companies are starting to regulate worldwide. 5G is a driver to generate all that transformation and China is seeing what is its gear to consolidate value in the industry and its position in thegeopolitics".  apr Load-Date: September 18, 2018End of Document

Delta, United and American face showdown with China over TaiwanCNNMoney.comJuly 23, 2018 Monday 8:21 AM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: INVESTINGLength: 792 wordsByline: Daniel ShaneBodyBig US airlines could soon hit political turbulence in China.Major carriers including United, American and Delta are among those that were given a Wednesday deadline by Beijing to change how their global websites refer to Taiwan.The showdown has been looming for months. The Chinese government wrote to more than 40 international airlines earlier this year demanding they remove from their websites any information that suggests Taiwan is not part of China.Many airlines, such as Australia's Qantas, Air Canada and Air India, have already changed their websites. Others, including the big American airlines, have not.China and Taiwan have been governed separately since 1949 following the Communist victory on the mainland after a civil war, although a shared cultural and linguistic heritage mostly endures.But China considers Taiwan to be an integral part of its territory, and comes down hard on any suggestions to the contrary.Taiwan has called out companies that have changed their websites. In May, it berated Air Canada on Twitter, accusing the airline of buckling under pressure.In an interview with CNN on Tuesday, the island's Foreign Minister Joseph Wu urged global airlines to deal with the issue in a way that means not folding in the face of Chinese pressure.Airlines can "list Taiwan cities as cities, without listing whether it belongs to one country or another," said Wu. "That's a flexible way of getting out of the Chinese pressure."The instructions from China also provoked a strong reaction from the United States earlier in the year. The White House slammed the demands as "Orwellian nonsense," describing them as "part of a growing trend by the Chinese Communist Party to impose its political views on American citizens and private companies."But international airlines, and other global brands, are caught in a bind. It's vital for their business that they stay in China's good books. The International Air Transport Association forecast last year that China would surpass the United States as the world's top aviation market by 2020.Other airlines that currently refer to Taiwan in a way that indicates it is in China include Germany's Lufthansa and British Airways.China's Civil Aviation Administration told state-run media on July 13 that the vast majority of airlines it had spoken to agreed to make the changes months ago. The handful that still had not cited "technical issues," according to the industry regulator.As of Tuesday ? a day before the deadline ? the websites of United, American Airlines and Delta all appear to describe destinations in Taiwan as a separate political entity, rather than as part of China.Spokespeople for all three US airlines did not immediately respond to requests for comment on whether they planned to change their websites before the deadline.What happens if companies don't comply?China hasn't spelled out what the punishments might be for airlines that fail to comply with its demands.Earlier this year, it blocked Marriott websites and apps for a week in the country after the company listed Tibet, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan as separate countries in emails and apps.Marriott issued a profuse public apology over the matter and conducted a full review of its Chinese website and apps.Hong Kong and Macau are former European colonies that were returned to China in the late 1990s, becoming regions with a large degree of administrative autonomy. Tibet has been under Beijing's control since 1951.An article in state-owned Chinese tabloid Global Times earlier this month quoted anonymous experts as saying the business of airlines which do not comply with Beijing's demands "will be affected as Chinese passengers will choose other airlines."

Google reportedly planning comeback in China with censored search engineStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeAugust 2, 2018 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: HI-TECH; Pg. 1Length: 518 wordsByline: Sandy MccarthyBodyBack in 2010, Google pulled its search service out of China because it didn't want to censor the search results; the move reported Wednesday would mark a departure from that.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on trade tensions with China, trade talks with Europe and Mexico and reports Google is working on a censored version of its search engine for China.The company has not operated its search engine in China in nearly a decade and its search service can not now be accessed by most internet users in China because it is blocked by the country's so-called Great Firewall. The Great Firewall has been used to completely block access to Google Search across the country except in Hong Kong, which operates as an independent region and is not subject to the same censorship laws. In its announcement about pulling out of the country in March 2010, Google blamed the Chinese government's censorship and surveillance policies as antithetical to what the company believes. The (successful) refusal of Google staff to work for the United States military has proved that workers have a say in the company's future. And it looks like at least one Google employee familiar with the plansrelated to China is willing to speak up. "In puttingprofits before human rights, Google would be setting a chilling precedent and handing the Chinese government a victory". Earlier past year, Chinese internet regulators authorised the Google Translate app for smartphones.According toThe Intercept's Ryan Gallagher, who first reported on the tech giant's plans on Wednesday, "The project-code-named Dragonfly-has been underway since spring of past year, and accelerated following a December 2017 meeting between Google's CEO Sundar Pichai and a top Chinese government official".The main reason Google took its business out of China was that they believed in free speech and freedom of expression. The Google program is called Dragonfly and would blacklist search terms and websites that promote freedom, democracy, and other topics that could undermine the government's power, the report says. Furthermore, the report claims that said app has already been shown to Chinese government and is only pending approval before its launch, approximately within the next six to nine months.Trump Tweets That Collusion Is Not A Crime. The Internet DisagreesTrump's personal lawyer, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani , was all over the networks and social media over the weekend and Monday with the message.The Intercept spoke to a Google whistleblower who said they had ethical concerns about the project.Google hasn't had a search engine in China in eight years. It complied withBeijing's censorship laws. At the same time, there are over 750 million internet users there, which Google would love to gain access to.According to a report inThe Intercept, Google is going to formally re-enter the Chinese search market.Sen. Marco Rubio and even some Google employees are among those criticizing the company. Google has also undergone changes as a company, with its new CEO Pichai leading the charge to once again get a foothold in the country.Load-Date: August 6, 2018End of Document

China markets swing wildly on uncertainty about growth and tradeCNN WireJuly 3, 2018 Tuesday 11:39 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 699 wordsByline: By Jethro MullenDateline: HONG KONG (CNNMoney) BodyHONG KONG (CNNMoney) --  After taking a hammering in June, China's stocks and currency are off to a rocky start to July.Fears over a slowdown in the country's economy and the start of a trade war with the United States have been weighing on Chinese shares and the yuan. The benchmark share index in Shanghai, which entered a bear market last week, is trading near its lowest level in more than two years. The yuan hit its weakest level against the dollar in 11 months on Tuesday before bouncing back amid reports that the government had intervened to support the currency. A weaker yuan could help Chinese exporters by making their products cheaper, but also risks increasing trade tensions with the Trump administration. Previous big plunges in the yuan in recent years have wreaked havoc in Chinese and global stock markets. The Chinese government said Tuesday it wanted to keep the yuan stable.Other emerging market currencies have also fallen against the strengthening dollar. But the strong dollar "is less of a valid argument" for the yuan's recent declines, according to Tai Hui, chief market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management in Asia. The yuan has also been losing ground against the currencies of China's other major trading partners, like the euro.The question is how much further, and how quickly, the yuan might fall."There is undoubtedly cause for concern, but not alarm on the prospects for the Chinese yuan," Aninda Mitra, a senior analyst at BNY Mellon Investment Management in Singapore, said in a note Tuesday.He acknowledged that in a trip to Shanghai last week, he "detected increasing alarm over trade tensions and a lot of nervousness about a full blown trade war, which comes at a bad time for China, where the economy is undergoing a downdraft at precisely the same time the United States is seeing a sharp upturn."Washington and Beijing are set to impose tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of each other's exports on Friday, prompting fears of a tit-for-tat escalation.Analysts generally reject suggestions that China could use the weaker yuan as a weapon in the trade clash.

China steps in to keep currency stable after trade fears spook marketsCNNMoney.comJuly 2, 2018 Monday 7:53 AM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: INVESTINGLength: 680 wordsByline: Jethro MullenBodyAfter taking a hammering in June, China's stocks and currency are off to a rocky start to July.Fears over a slowdown in the country's economy and the start of a trade war with the United States have been weighing on Chinese shares and the yuan.The benchmark share index in Shanghai, which entered a bear market last week, is trading near its lowest level in more than two years. The yuan hit its weakest level against the dollar in 11 months on Tuesday before bouncing back amid reports that the government had intervened to support the currency.A weaker yuan could help Chinese exporters by making their products cheaper, but also risks increasing trade tensions with the Trump administration.Previous big plunges in the yuan in recent years have wreaked havoc in Chinese and global stock markets. The Chinese government said Tuesday it wanted to keep the yuan stable.Other emerging market currencies have also fallen against the strengthening dollar. But the strong dollar "is less of a valid argument" for the yuan's recent declines, according to Tai Hui, chief market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management in Asia.The yuan has also been losing ground against the currencies of China's other major trading partners, like the euro.The question is how much further, and how quickly, the yuan might fall."There is undoubtedly cause for concern, but not alarm on the prospects for the Chinese yuan," Aninda Mitra, a senior analyst at BNY Mellon Investment Management in Singapore, said in a note Tuesday.He acknowledged that in a trip to Shanghai last week, he "detected increasing alarm over trade tensions and a lot of nervousness about a full blown trade war, which comes at a bad time for China, where the economy is undergoing a downdraft at precisely the same time the United States is seeing a sharp upturn."Washington and Beijing are set to impose tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of each other's exports on Friday, prompting fears of a tit-for-tat escalation.Analysts generally reject suggestions that China could use the weaker yuan as a weapon in the trade clash. They point to the chaos caused in Chinese and global markets by sharp falls in the currency in 2015 and early 2016."This is not a can of worms that Beijing wants to open again," Hui said.Instead, analysts expect the Chinese government to intervene to prevent the currency plunging too rapidly.In a statement posted on the Chinese central bank's website Tuesday, Governor Yi Gang said it's "paying close attention" to recent fluctuations in the market and will seek to keep the yuan stable at a reasonable level.After falling around 0.8% against the dollar early on Tuesday, the yuan recouped its losses in afternoon trading, moving into positive territory.

Another airline has caved to the China's demands and wiped all mention of Taiwan from its websiteBusiness Insider USJuly 6, 2018 Friday 02:23 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Insider Inc.

In April, the Chinese Government requested all mention of Taiwan as an entity separate from China be removed from airline websites.BodyBoeing• Air India has removed all mention of Taiwan from its website.• India's national airline said the changes were based following instruction from the country's Ministry of External Affairs.• In April, the Chinese Government issued a request that all mention of Taiwan as an entity separate from China be stricken from airline websites.• Some airlines have chosen to acquiesce while others have not. Air India has become the latest airline to remove any mention of Taiwan from its website. Instead, all flights to Taipei Taoyuan International Airport have been relabeled "Chinese Taipei" by India's national airline.The Indian government-owned airline updated its website as prescribed by India's Ministry of External Affairs, an airline spokesperson told the Times of India.An Indian Government spokesperson told CNN that "Air India's decision to rename the destination of Taiwan as Chinese Taipei is entirely consistent with international norms, and our own position on Taiwan since 1949."Air India does not actually operate any flights into or out of Taipei. However, it does sell flights to the city through a codeshare agreement with Taipei-based EVA Air with a stopover in Bangkok, Thailand or Singapore. In April, China's Civil Aviation Administration issued a request to 44 international airlines, including US carriers, that all mention of Taiwan as a separate entity be removed from their websites. "Regarding websites, we object to Beijing dictating how U.S. firms, including airlines, organize their websites for ease of consumer use. Chinese companies' websites operate freely and without political interference in the United States," a US State Department official told Business Insider earlier this year. The White House also issued a response to the Chinese request calling it "Orwellian nonsense."Thus far major carriers such as American, United, and Qantas have continued to use to the Taiwan label. While a host of others have chosen to describe Taiwan as Taiwan, China. Some, like Air India, have removed all mention of Taiwan from their websites. Japan's duo of ANA and JAL only made the changes to their Chinese language sites. The Chinese Government originally set May 25 as the deadline for the airlines. However, that has since been extended to July 25. NOW WATCH: A Nobel Prize-winning economist says 'non-competes' are keeping wages down for all workersSee Also:• Mysterious airline fees are costing passengers hundreds of dollars and no one knows what they go to pay for• We drove a $31,000 Honda Accord and a $39,000 Toyota Camry to see which one is the better family sedan - here's the verdict• Emotional-support animals are becoming a big problem on planes, and airlines want them to go awaySEE ALSO: Mysterious airline fees are costing passengers hundreds of dollars and no one knows what they go to pay forFOLLOW US: on Facebook for more car and transportation content!Load-Date: February 11, 2019End of Document

The Chinese Scrap Vehicle Recycling Industry to 2022: A 50 Billion Opportunity, Growing at a CAGR of 28.1% from 2018PR NewswireJuly 31, 2018 Tuesday 9:45 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1224 wordsDateline: DUBLIN, July 31, 2018 BodyThe"Research Report on China's Scrap Vehicle Recycling Industry - 2018-2022"report has been added toResearchAndMarkets.com'soffering.In 2022, the scrap vehicle recycling volume will exceed 5 million and the market size will exceed CNY 50 billion, representing a CAGR of 28.1% from 2018 to 2022.The Chinese government provides that a vehicle should be sent to a qualified enterprise for dismantling and scrapping when it runs for 600,000 kilometers. And scrap vehicles' engines, steering gear, transmission, front and rear axles and frame are forbidden to be sold illegally and should be recycled as scrap metal. The vehicle owner can get the residual value of the recycled scrap metal. However, this provision is poorly enforced.Vehicle consumption becomes increasingly popular in China with the development of economy and increase of income. China had ranked first in vehicle production and sales volume for nine consecutive years from 2009 to 2017. And the vehicle reserves keep rising. China's vehicle reserves reached 217 million at the end of 2017, ranking second in the world. It is estimated that China will surpass the U.S. to have the largest vehicle reserves in the world in 10 years. As the average vehicle age increases, scrap vehicle recycling has become one of the social concerns. On the assumption that the service life of passenger vehicles is between 8 to 10 years, the number of scrap vehicles had exceeded 6 million by 2017 and will grow at an annual rate over 10%. However, only 1.47 million scrap vehicles were recycled in 2017. Many scrap vehicles are still being used or were illegally disposed. For example, some of them were reassembled or refurbished to be sold as second-hand vehicles.Owing to the poor industry regulation, legal scrap vehicle disposal has been affected by the illegal one. China's annual recycling volume only accounts for 0.5%-1% of the vehicle reserves, which is much lower than 5%-7% in developed countries. Because of the quota on the number of scrap vehicle recyclers, the numbers of registered scrap vehicle recyclers and recycling outlets were 660 and 2,465 respectively at the end of 2016, having a wide gap with the fast-growing number of scrap vehicles. To promote the development of the industry, the Chinese government is improving relevant policies. It is expected that the new version of Regulations on Vehicle Recycling Management will cancel the quota on the number of scrap vehicle recyclers, and allow the circulation of scrap vehicles' engine, steering gear, transmission, front and rear axles and frame to qualified manufacturers for remanufacturing. This policy change will greatly expand the market of scrap vehicle recycling.The combination with "internet+" will help legal recyclers to deal with the penetration of illegal recyclers. Moreover, e-commerce platforms will facilitate the recycler's communication with vehicle owners and downstream parts remanufacturers to increase the industry's profitability. The broad market prospect and favorable policy environment will attract a great deal of capital to the industry.Topics include:Development environment of China's scrap vehicle recycling industryVolume and market size of scrap vehicle recycling in ChinaCompetition in China's scrap vehicle recycling industryMajor scrap vehicle recycling enterprises in ChinaFactors influencing the development of china's scrap vehicle recycling industryForecast of market size of China's scrap vehicle recycling industry, 2018-2022Companies FeaturedTianjin Xinneng Renewable Resources Co.

ANOTHER JOURNALIST EXPELLED AS CHINA'S ABUSES GROW, WHO WILL SEE THEM?States News ServiceAugust 29, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 702 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:Maya WangChina Senior Researcher wang_mayaannounced on Twitter last week that the Chinese government had refused to renew her journalist visa, effectively expelling her. The authorities did not explain the decision, which came after her recent reports exposing the growing abuses in the Muslim minority region of Xinjiang, which surely drew the authorities' ire. The Chinese state tabloid Global Times published an op-ed that called her work "delusional western reporting".Rajagopalan's expulsion follows those of French reporter Ursula Gauthier in 2015 and US journalist Melissa Chan in 2012. The US journalists Paul Mooney and Austin Ramzy were denied visas to work in China either because of their reporting on human rights issues or because their news organisations had dug into top leaders' murky web of wealth.The retribution against foreign correspondents is the tip of the iceberg as authorities tighten their grip on the media, particularly since President Xi Jinping assumed power in 2013. In a tour of state media outlets in 2016, Xi told them they must always "reflect the will of the [Chinese Communist] party".The brunt of government press controls is often borne by Chinese journalists, who face intimidation, assault and imprisonment for doing their jobs. In February 2018, the Shandong reporter Qi Chonghuai was released after more than 10 years in prison during which he was tortured for reporting on corruption. Freelance journalist Chen Jieren, who ran a blog that routinely criticised party officials, has been detained since August for "fraud" and running an "illegal business".The state's censorship machine does not simply scrub out sensitive information. Instead, it generates a sophisticated mirage a technique the authorities call "directing public opinion" that allows some accurate reporting but not a full picture of a particular problem. Before Human Rights Watch published an investigative report on the Chinese police's use of torture in 2015, I contacted a number of Chinese journalists. They told me that while it was possible to report on isolated cases of torture, portraying torture as "routine" a central finding of our report would be completely off-limits.So when people read about others falling victim to forced evictions or land seizures without adequate compensation topics the state media are allowed to report they can only see them as unfortunate, isolated incidents, the kind of things that can happen to anyone anywhere. When people point their fingers to systemic failure in government accountability such as when the public reacted angrily to a recent scandal of faulty vaccines state censors were quick to put a positive spin by broadcasting top leaders' commitment to addressing the problem.Imagine how perceptions at home and abroad would change if Chinese government officials, like their counterparts in democracies, were required to answer questions about rumours concerning their unexplained wealth or culpability in public policy debacles in genuine interviews, as opposed to scripted media meetings. What if we could learn the full extent of the authorities' human rights violations against Xinjiang's 13 million Turkic Muslims, as we did with the campaign against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, when the world was flooded with numerous photos and videos illustrating their plight?In Xinjiang, much of the repression is shrouded in secrecy. The authorities so aggressively censor the topic such that domestic journalists know to steer well clear of it, while foreign journalists such as Rajagopalan are closely watched when they venture into that region. As a result, we cannot peer inside the unlawful "political education camps" forcibly indoctrinating hundreds of thousands of Muslims or get a sense of how Turkic Muslims feel when officials occupy their homes as imposed "relatives" to surveil them.The world would probably have reacted to China's growing human rights violations in Xinjiang, the rest of China and, increasingly, abroad, with much greater alarm. For that reason, the Chinese government gave Rajagopalan, whose reporting failed to "reflect the will of the party", the boot.Load-Date: August 30, 2018End of Document

Anger in China over Thailand's handling of deadly boat accidentCNN WireJuly 11, 2018 Wednesday 9:05 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 723 wordsByline: By Steven Jiang, CNNDateline: BEIJING (CNN) BodyBEIJING (CNN) --  While the world celebrated the rescue of 12 boys and their soccer coach from a flooded cave in northern Thailand, in China frustration and anger have grown over Thai authorities' handling of the sinking of two tourist boats which left more than 40 people dead. The two boats carrying more than 120 Chinese tourists capsized and sank in a huge storm last Thursday off the resort island of Phuket. Several passengers were still missing almost a week later.A huge backlash against Thailand ensued after the country's deputy prime minister, Gen. Prawit Wongsuwan, blamed Chinese tour operators in Phuket for the deadly accident."This accident was entirely Chinese harming Chinese," Prawit was seen telling local reporters Monday in a widely circulated video. "The boats were theirs, and they ignored warnings and insisted on sailing out to sea. We weren't responsible for that -- they were. They have to resolve this themselves."Chinese social media and official newspapers responded harshly to Prawit's comments, forcing a hasty apology. The state-run China Daily called his comments "provocative and irresponsible.""Even if what he said is true, the Thai government cannot shirk its responsibility for guaranteeing the safety and security of tourists," it said.Users on the Twitter-like service Weibo, citing witnesses who were at the scene, said there was no official warning in Phuket against sailing when the ship left port, before it encountered inclement weather at sea.They also questioned the actions of the boats' Thai crews, who reportedly abandoned passengers when water rushed in.Some claimed survivors and grieving families arriving from China faced red tape and bureaucratic delays when trying to see and identify the bodies of their loved ones. "Can China be so easily bullied now -- and Chinese lives be so carelessly trampled on?" one popular Weibo post read Wednesday. "I'm happy for the Thai soccer boys who were rescued, but I will never go visit that country again!"Calls for a boycott China is the biggest source of foreign visitors to Thailand, where tourism is a major industry. Almost 10 million Chinese nationals visited Thailand last year, according to official statistics.Amid rising calls in China to boycott Thailand, the military government in Bangkok seems to have switched to damage-control. On Tuesday Thailand's embassy in Beijing issued a statement saying Prawit's remarks "may have traumatized families of the victims," and that the general expressed his "regret and apology" to the Chinese tourists in the accident. "Thailand will provide the best and fairest treatment to all tourists affected by this accident," it added. "We will work closely with China to formulate preventative measures to avoid similar accidents from happening again."Following the Thai embassy statement Tuesday, the Chinese government appeared to move to dampen public criticism, reiterating that the ongoing search and rescue missions conducted by the Thai authorities and highlighting Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha's visit to hospitals where injured Chinese tourists were being treated."The search area has been expanded," said Hua Chunying, a Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman. "The Thai side promised that their search efforts will not cease until every missing Chinese tourist is found."She added that the "Thai police will find out the cause of the accident as soon as possible and figure out the parties who are to blame for the accident and hold them accountable with no tolerance." Phuket Governor Norraphat Plodthong told CNN that a Chinese team has been working with Thai authorities in the rescue effort. He declined to comment when asked about Prawit's comments.But for some Chinese, though, the Phuket accident seems to have become a turning point in their perception about Thailand."(We) were sending well wishes and prayers to the Thai soccer team boys trapped in the cave and China even participated in the rescue," a Weibo user wrote Wednesday. "It was disgusting and chilling to see that Thai deputy prime minister to wave off their responsibility in the Phuket boat accident after so many Chinese tourists perished."CNN's Pia Deshpande in Hong Kong and Nanlin Fang in Beijing contributed to this reportTM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Chinese Cyber Campaigns Undermine U.S. Prosperity and Security: FDD StudyTargeted News ServiceSeptember 5, 2018 Wednesday 6:53 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 532 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Foundation for Defense of Democracies issued the following news release:China's wide-ranging cyber intrusions and network exploitations cause massive damage to U.S. firms and cumulatively degrade U.S. national security, according to a new report issued today by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD).Zack Cooper writes in, "Understanding the Chinese Communist Party's Approach to Cyber-Enabled Economic Warfare," that China's cyber espionage and intrusions into U.S. companies are integral parts of the Chinese Communist Party's strategy. Not only do these campaigns advantage Chinese enterprises over their foreign counterparts by stealing intellectual property and gaining leverage in economic deals, but Beijing also uses cyber tools to pressure foreign governments, Dr. Cooper explains.In a notable example last year, China launched cyber attacks against a private South Korean company as retribution for the deployment of the THAAD missile defense system to South Korea."Even as costs and effects of Chinese cyber espionage, theft, and malfeasance are becoming clearer, China's evolving strategies for their use remain opaque to U.S. policy and decisionmakers," said Samantha Ravich, senior advisor and Principal Investigator of FDD's cyber-enabled economic warfare (CEEW) project. "This report analyzes China's cyber-enabled capabilities in order to pierce the opacity of the strategy behind the Chinese Communist Party's offensive cyber operations. Beijing likely recognizes the most effective way to undermine U.S. military capabilities is by attacking private companies that create, innovate, build, deploy, and maintain the technology at the heart of Washington's ability to advance its national interests and security."Cooper, a member of the board of advisors of FDD's Center on Sanctions and Illicit Finance, writes that in today's business environment, many companies are hesitant to reveal information about data breaches and exploitations. However, there is sufficient information to demonstrate the types of intrusions that are typical of Chinese hackers. The report provides illustrative examples of Chinese cyber intrusions against private and public entities demonstrating the scope and scale of the challenge.Previous U.S. government studies have also found that China's malicious cyber activity poses an economic and national security challenge, yet Washington's response has failed to curb China's offensive cyber operations. Concluding that only concerted and consistent U.S. pressure will change Chinese behavior, Cooper recommends the U.S. government demonstrate to Beijing that failure to cease its cyber intrusions against American private industry will impair progress on all other bilateral issues of concern to the Chinese government.This report is the second in a series of studies on the capabilities and strategies of U.S. competitors and adversaries to engage in CEEW against America and its allies. The previous study examined Russia's CEEW strategy. CEEW is a campaign launched against a nation's economic assets using cyber technology to weaken an adversary politically and militarily.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6431854 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: September 6, 2018End of Document

China Is Treating Islam Like a Mental IllnessAtlantic OnlineAugust 28, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1654 wordsByline: Sigal SamuelBodyOne million Muslims are being held right now in Chinese internment camps, according to estimates cited by the UN and U.S. officials. Former inmates-most of whom are Uighurs, a largely Muslim ethnic minority-have            told reporters that over the course of an indoctrination process lasting several months, they were forced to renounce Islam, criticize their own Islamic beliefs and those of fellow inmates, and recite Communist Party propaganda songs for hours each day. There are media reports of inmates being forced to            eat pork and drink alcohol, which are forbidden to Muslims, as well as            reports of           torture and death.The sheer scale of the internment camp system, which according to The Wall Street Journal has doubledin China's northwestern Xinjiang region just within the last year, is mindboggling. The U.S.            Congressional-Executive Commission on China describes it as "the largest mass incarceration of a minority population in the world today." Beijing began by targeting Uighur extremists, but now even benign manifestations of Muslim identity-like growing a long beard-can get a Uighur sent to a camp, the Journal            noted. Earlier this month, when a UN panel confronted a senior Chinese official about the camps,            he said there are "no such things as reeducation centers," even though government documents            refer to the facilities that way. Instead, he claimed they're just vocational schools for criminals.China has been selling a very different narrative to its own population. Although the authorities frequently describe the internment camps as schools, they also liken them to another type of institution: hospitals. Here's an excerpt from            an official Communist Party audio recording, which was transmitted last year to Uighurs via WeChat, a social-media platform, and which was transcribed and translated by Radio Free Asia:Members of the public who have been chosen for reeducation have been infected by an ideological illness. They have been infected with religious extremism and violent terrorist ideology, and therefore they must seek treatment from a hospital as an inpatient. ... The religious extremist ideology is a type of poisonous medicine, which confuses the mind of the people. ... If we do not eradicate religious extremism at its roots, the violent terrorist incidents will grow and spread all over like an incurable malignant tumor."Religious belief is seen as a pathology" in China, explained James Millward, a professor of Chinese history at Georgetown University, adding that Beijing often claims religion fuels extremism and separatism. "So now they're calling reeducation camps 'hospitals' meant to cure thinking. It's like an inoculation, a search-and-destroy medical procedure that they want to apply to the whole Uighur population, to kill the germs of extremism. But it's not just giving someone a shot-it's locking them up for months in bad conditions."China has long feared that Uighurs will attempt to establish their own national homeland in Xinjiang, which they refer to as East Turkestan. In 2009, ethnic riots there resulted in hundreds of deaths, and some radical Uighurs have carried out terrorist attacks in recent years. Chinese officials have            claimed that in order to suppress the threat of Uighur separatism and extremism, the government needs to crack down not only on those Uighurs who show signs of having been radicalized, but on a significant swath of the population.The medical analogy is one way the government tries to justify its policy of large-scale internment: After all, attempting to inoculate a whole population against, say, the flu, requires giving flu shots not just to the already-afflicted few, but to a critical mass of people. In fact, using this rhetoric, China has tried to defend a system of arrest quotas for Uighurs. Police officers            confirmed to Radio Free Asia that they are under orders to meet specific population targets when rounding up people for internment. In one township, police officials said they were being ordered to send 40 percent of the local population to the camps.           China is going to outrageous lengths to surveil its own citizensThe government also uses this pathologizing language in an attempt to justify lengthy internments and future interventions any time officials deem Islam a threat. "It's being treated as a mental illness that's never guaranteed to be completely cured, like addiction or depression," said Timothy Grose, a China expert at the Rose Hulman Institute of Technology. "There's something mentally wrong that needs to be diagnosed, treated-and followed up with." Here's how the Communist Party recording cited above explains this, while alluding to the threat of contagion:There is always a risk that the illness will manifest itself at any moment, which would cause serious harm to the public. That is why they must be admitted to a reeducation hospital in time to treat and cleanse the virus from their brain and restore their normal mind. ... Being infected by religious extremism and violent terrorist ideology and not seeking treatment is like being infected by a disease that has not been treated in time, or like taking toxic drugs. ... There is no guarantee that it will not trigger and affect you in the future.Having gone through reeducation and recovered from the ideological disease doesn't mean that one is permanently cured. ... So, after completing the reeducation process in the hospital and returning home ... they must remain vigilant, empower themselves with the correct knowledge, strengthen their ideological studies, and actively attend various public activities to bolster their immune system.Several other government-issued documents use this type of medical language. "This stuff about the poison in the brain-it's definitely out there," said Rian Thum, noting that even civilians tasked with carrying out the crackdown in Xinjiang speak of            "eradicating its tumors." Recruitment advertisements for staff in the internment camps state that experience in psychological training is a plus, Thum and other experts said. Chinese websites describe reeducation sessions where psychologists perform consultations with Uighurs and treat what they call extremism as a mental illness. A government document published last year in Khotan Prefecture            described forced indoctrination as "a free hospital treatment for the masses with sick thinking."This is not the first time China has used medical analogies to suppress a religious minority. "Historically, it's comparable to the strategy toward Falun Gong," said Adrian Zenz, a researcher at the European School of Culture and Theology in Berlin. He was referring to a spiritual practice whose followers were suppressed in the early 2000s through reeducation in forced labor camps. "Falun Gong was also treated like a dangerous addiction. ... But in Xinjiang this [rhetoric] is certainly being pushed to the next level. The explicit link with the addictive effect of religion is being emphasized possibly in an unprecedented way."           China's new frontiers in dystopian techTahir Imin, a U.S.-based Uighur academic from Xinjiang who said he has several family members in internment camps, was not surprised to hear his religion being characterized as if it's a disease. In his view, it's part of China's attempt to eradicate Muslim ethnic minorities and forcefully assimilate them into the Han Chinese majority. "If they have any 'illness,' it is being Uighur," he said. In addition to Uighurs, The Washington Post            has reported that Muslim members of other ethnic groups, like the Kazakhs and the Kyrgyz, have been sent to the camps. "I think the Chinese government is saying: 'This ideological hospital-in there, send every person who is not [ethnically] Chinese. They are sick, they are not safe [to be around], they are not reliable, they are not healthy people.'"The doors of mosques closed by authorities in Xinjiang (Thomas Peter / Reuters)The terrible irony is that in "treating" Uighurs for supposed psychological problems, China is causing very real psychological damage, both at home and abroad. One former inmate told The Independent he suffered            thoughts of suicide inside the camps. And as Uighurs in exile around the world learn what is happening to their relatives back home, some            have told reporters they suffer from insomnia, depression, anxiety, and paranoia.  Murat Harri Uyghur, a 33-year-old doctor who moved to Finland in 2010, said he has received word from relatives that both his parents are in the camps. He has launched an online campaign,            "Free My Parents," he said will raise money to start an advocacy organization to help them, but he told me he suffers from recurrent panic attacks. He also described finding himself prone to feelings of anger, powerlessness, and exhaustion. "I try to be normal," he said, "but I have a psychological problem now."In an interview with The Globe and Mail,            a Uighur woman in Canada who said she had a sister in the camps said, "I cannot concentrate on anything. My mind is off. I cannot sleep." She added, "I lost a lot of weight because I don't want to eat anymore."Some Uighurs I spoke to who are living abroad also have to cope with a pervasive sense of guilt. They know that Beijing treats any Uighur who's traveled internationally as suspicious, and that their family members are treated as suspicious by association. For example, a 24-year-old Uighur attending graduate school in Kentucky, who requested anonymity for fear that China would further punish his relatives, said it's been 197 days since he's been able to contact his father in Xinjiang. He tracks the days on a board tacked to his bedroom wall. "I'm afraid for my dad's life," he said. Asked why he believes his father was sent to an internment camp, he replied without a trace of doubt: "Because I go to school here in a foreign country.""Now I know that if I ever go home," he added, "I will be imprisoned just like my dad."Load-Date: August 29, 2018End of Document

ZK International Announces Gross Profit Increase of 44.6% Driven by Record Revenue of $26.6 Million for the Fiscal First Half of 2018PR NewswireSeptember 18, 2018 Tuesday 9:00 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2526 wordsDateline: WENZHOU, China, Sept. 18, 2018 BodyZK International Group Co., Ltd.(NASDAQ: ZKIN) ("ZKIN", "ZK International" or the "Company"), a designer, engineer, manufacturer, and supplier of patented high-performance stainless steel and carbon steel pipe products that require sophisticated water or gas pipeline systems, today announced its financial results for the fiscal first six months ended March 31, 2018.Financial Highlights for the Fiscal Six Months Ended March 31, 2018:Revenue increased 29.2% year-over-year to $26.6 million as compared to $20.6 million;Gross profit increased 44.6% year-over-year to $8.6 million as compared to $5.9 million;Gross profit margin increased to 32.4% as compared to 29% for the same period in the year prior;Comprehensive net income attributable to ZK International increased 80.04% to $3.82 million;Net income increased 29.3% year-over-year to $3.6 million as compared to $2.8 million;Earnings per share for the fiscal first half of 2018 was $0.29, based on 13,175,841 shares total outstanding as of the fiscal period.Mr. Jiancong Huang, Chairman of ZK International, commented, "During the fiscal first six months of 2018 we focused on growth and investment. We have not only successfully increased our manufacturing capacity, but also significantly bolstered our sales and marketing capabilities. In doing so, we increased top and bottom line approximately 29% year-over-year, largely driven by new contracts, growth internationally, and new service offerings. Our increased capacity has allowed the Company to meet the demand of the Chinese government to implement mandatory standards for water and gas infrastructure improvements."Mr. Huang continued, "As we continue to build our brand and cultivate new customer relationships, it is equally important that we remain forward thinkers and innovators. Our investment in research and development has yielded our company the opportunity to one day introduce the Intelligent Piping System to the market which combines revolutionary new aspects to our industry such as the remote water testing sensors and blockchain-based information distribution system. We will continue to invest in ourselves for not only growth today, but for years to come."Operational Highlights for Fiscal First Half of 2018:Strategically focused on providing premium pipeline products and engineering and design solutions to water and gas pipe infrastructure sector that has seen increasing governmental investment to supply clean water and safe gas through stainless steel and carbon steel pipe network to accommodate fast paced urbanization of China. As a result of the market trend and sales network expansion, the revenue generated from sale of pipeline products and engineering and design solutions, which yields higher gross profit than the stainless steel coil business line, increased from 66.7% to 88.4% as a percentage of sales and thus gross profit margin increased from 29% to 32.4%.Expanded business operations into the emerging multi-billion dollar metal pipe market located in Africa, initially targeting Uganda, one of the leading countries in East Africa, for its growth in the Oil and Gas sectors. ZK International is looking to expand its business operations in Uganda as it eyes the Ugandan government's oil and gas initiative to build a 1,445 KM pipeline from Lake Albert in Uganda to the Port of Tanga in Tanzania.ZK International and its subsidiary, xSigma Corporation, have begun the implementation of its patent pending software and blockchain technologies into its manufacturing process and supply chain management system. In addition, the two companies are working together to develop remote water testing system that can test the quality of water that flows through the Company's pipe using water testing sensors.Increased sales force in retail piping division from 15 to 49 professionals in 37 cities and 16 provinces, which have allowed the Company to sell products directly to the interior design firms and home owners and build new customer relationships.Significant Contracts in Fiscal First Half of 2018:Selected as a major supplier during the annual bid with Changsha Water Group to supply stainless steel piping for the water supply infrastructure of Changsha, the capital and most populous city in Hunan Province. In November 2017, the municipal government of Changsha issued a regulation to immediately begin updating the existing water supply infrastructure pipeline to stainless steel.After a 400% increase in orders year-over-year, ZK International renewed its contract withTowngas ChinaCompany Limited ("Towngas China"), one of the largest public utility providers in China and one of the largest suppliers of gas in Asia.Signed agreement with Shenzhen Water Group Co., Ltd. in the amount of $3.0 million to deploy the Company's proprietary stainless steel pipes and fittings through the city's Community Pipeline Network Upgrade Program.Entered into $1.2 million contract with The XingRong Group, one of the largest water treatment and supply companies in Western China, to supply approximately 280,000 meters of piping and 280,000 pipe fittings over the course of one year.Financial Resultsfor the Fiscal Six Months Ended March 31, 2018:For the fiscal first half of 2018, revenue increased by 29.2% to $26.6 million as compared to $20.6 million during the fiscal first half of 2017. The increase in revenue is primarily attributable to the increase in capital expenditure by the government in China to build healthier and safer clean water supply infrastructure in urban areas. Additionally, the Company increased international sales in China by 61.5% during the fiscal first half of 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017.Gross profit for the fiscal first half of 2018 increased 44.6% to $8.6 million as compared to $5.9 million during the fiscal first half of 2017. Gross profit margin increased to 32.4% for the fiscal first half of 2018 as compared to 29% for the fiscal first half of 2017. Gross profit margin increased primarily due to an increase in the Company's sales of premium pipeline products and engineering and design solutions for client construction projects, which yield higher gross margin, increased from 66.7% to 88.4% as a percentage of sales year-over-year. During the fiscal first half of 2018 lower margin stainless steel coil product sales decreased from 33.3% to 11.6% as a percentage of sales year-over-year.Operating expenses increased 82.8% year-over-year to $3.7 million as compared to $2.1 million year-over-year. The increase is mainly due to an increase in selling and marketing expense. The increase reflected higher Selling and Marketing Expenses related to the sales growth, increased general and administrative expenses ("G&A") and higher research and development ("R&D") costs. During the period, the Company increased its sales force by 227% from 15 to 49 professionals in 37 cities and 16 provinces throughout China to strategically target the consumer plumbing market. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses were 14.1% in the fiscal first half of 2018, compared with 9.9% in the fiscal first half of 2017.Income from operations increased 24.6% to $4.8 million in the fiscal first half of 2018 as compared with $3.9 million in the fiscal first half of 2017.

China: Free Veteran Democracy ActivistTargeted News ServiceJuly 11, 2018 Wednesday 7:49 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 616 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK BodyHuman Rights Watch issued the following news release:The Chinese government should immediately and unconditionally release veteran democracy activist Qin Yongmin, Human Rights Watch said today. On July 10, 2018, a court in Wuhan sentenced Qin to 13 years in prison for "subversion of state power." Qin, 64, has previously spent a total of 22 years in prison or in Re-education Through Labor."Qin Yongmin's only 'crime' was to organize a human rights monitoring group to peacefully push for reform in China," said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. "The unjust prosecution and appallingly harsh sentence demonstrate the Chinese government's contempt for fundamental rights and the rule of law."In January 2015, Wuhan police detained Qin Yongmin along with his wife, Zhao Suli, from their home. The police held Zhao, who was never officially accused of a crime, in an unknown location for over three years, during which she was denied access to family and lawyers. After releasing her in April 2018, authorities continued to guard Zhao's apartment closely and tightly restrict her movements. While initially also held in an unknown location, Qin was later transferred to a detention center in Wuhan. In June 2016, prosecutors indicted Qin on charges of subversion. However, Qin was denied access to a defense lawyer until August 2017.In 2014, Qin and other human rights activists founded the "Rose Group," a human rights organization. Comprised mostly of people who have sought redress for abuses by local officials, the group operates the human rights news website Rose China. The organization also published a series of open letters to President Xi Jinping, urging him to hold political dialogues with Chinese citizens. In the indictment letter, the prosecutors' office alleged that the articles Qin published, such as "On China's peaceful transition to constitutional democracy," and the online and offline political discussions and petitions he organized, constituted "activities intending to subvert state power." In February 2018, police detained another key member of the group, Xu Qin, alleging her of "inciting subversion."Qin Yongmin is considered a veteran among democracy organizers in China. In 1980, he participated in the preparations to establish the China Democracy Party. As a result, he was arrested in 1981 and sentenced to eight years in prison for "counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement." Qin was released in 1989, after serving the full sentence. In 1993, in the run-up to the 45th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Qin helped draft and launch the Peace Charter, a manifesto calling for freedom and democracy in China. In December that year, Wuhan authorities detained Qin for "disrupting social order" and sent him to two years in Re-education Through Labor, an administrative detention system that was abolished in 2013.After being released in 1995, Qin continued his pro-democracy activism, including creating the China Human Rights Observer Bulletin, a newsletter on human rights issues in China, and publishing an open letter urging the Chinese government to initiate political reforms. In 1998, Qin and other democracy activists established the China Democracy Party Hubei branch. Later that year, he was sentenced to 12 years in prison for subversion. He was released in December 2012."Having spent over two decades in prison, Qin Yongmin has already paid an astronomical price for exercising his basic rights to advocate peacefully for political reforms," Richardson said. "The Chinese government should reverse the latest judgment and release him immediately."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6368267 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: July 13, 2018End of Document

CHINA: FREE VETERAN DEMOCRACY ACTIVIST QIN YONGMIN SENTENCED TO 13 YEARS ON BASELESS SUBVERSION CHARGESStates News ServiceJuly 11, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 609 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:The Chinese government should immediately and unconditionally release veteran democracy activist Qin Yongmin, Human Rights Watch said today.

In 1980, he participated in the preparations to establish the China Democracy Party. As a result, he was arrested in 1981 and sentenced to eight years in prison for "counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement." Qin was released in 1989, after serving the full sentence. In 1993, in the run-up to the 45th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Qin helped draft and launch the Peace Charter, a manifesto calling for freedom and democracy in China. In December that year, Wuhan authorities detained Qin for "disrupting social order" and sent him to two years in Re-education Through Labor, an administrative detention system that was abolished in 2013.After being released in 1995, Qin continued his pro-democracy activism, including creating the China Human Rights Observer Bulletin, a newsletter on human rights issues in China, and publishing an open letter urging the Chinese government to initiate political reforms. In 1998, Qin and other democracy activists established the China Democracy Party Hubei branch. Later that year, he was sentenced to 12 years in prison for subversion. He was released in December 2012."Having spent over two decades in prison, Qin Yongmin has already paid an astronomical price for exercising his basic rights to advocate peacefully for political reforms," Richardson said. "The Chinese government should reverse the latest judgment and release him immediately."Load-Date: July 12, 2018End of Document

China has an online lending crisis and people are furious about itCNN WireAugust 9, 2018 Thursday 1:47 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 768 wordsByline: By Matt Rivers and Jethro MullenDateline: BEIJING (CNNMoney) BodyBEIJING (CNNMoney) --  The Chinese government is facing anger from mom-and-pop investors after hundreds of online lending platforms imploded, wiping out their savings.The outcry shines a light on a murky corner of China's financial industry that authorities allowed to grow rapidly with little oversight. Promises of double-digit returns attracted people looking for more lucrative places to put their money than conventional banks.But a recent crackdown by the central government in Beijing has helped trigger a sharp increase in the number of platforms going bust. The crisis has hit people like a construction project manager in Beijing who told CNN he invested more than 275,000 yuan ($40,000) with a site that suddenly shut down last month. "The first reaction is disbelief. I didn't believe the platform had collapsed ... But in the end, I had to accept the truth," the 28-year-old man said, declining to be identified for fear of government retribution. He said the amount he lost included his parents' savings, money he'd borrowed from friends and funds he was planning to use to buy an apartment for him and his pregnant wife.The demise of the platform he invested with, Tourongjia.com, is now under police investigation. A government notice from July posted on its site says the chairman is missing and 13 suspects have been detained. It advises investors to report their losses to police as soon as possible. The company's phone lines no longer work.'Misrepresentation and criminality'Sites like Tourongjia, known as peer-to-peer lenders, were supposed to provide an alternative source of credit for borrowers like small businesses that were struggling to secure loans through China's established banking system, which has traditionally favored state-owned companies and large or politically connected firms.The Chinese government initially encouraged the growth of the sector. But it "became a magnet for the misrepresentation and criminality that can be expected in such loosely controlled off-market activities," said Brock Silvers, managing director at Shanghai-based investment advisory firm Kaiyuan Capital.Now the Chinese government is trying to clean up the industry with tighter regulations, part of a broader clampdown on risk in the financial sector. The number of peer-to-peer lenders shutting down spiked from 28 in May to 218 in July, according to Wangdaizhijia, a firm that monitors the sector."The regulators ... have got more serious about trying to crack down on this because they realized it's getting out of hand," said Andrew Collier, managing director of financial research firm Orient Capital in Hong Kong.The construction project manager who spoke to CNN said he thought his investment was safe because Tourongjia appeared to have government endorsement.Multiple reports in Chinese state media mention meetings between company executives and local government officials in the eastern city of Hangzhou, where Tourongjia was based. Government officials toured its offices and even attended fancy banquets.The Hangzhou city government didn't respond to a request for comment.'The law only protects a small group of people'After Tourongjia's collapse, there's no sign of compensation for those who lost their money."In China, the law only protects a small group of people - not us, the masses," the construction project manager told CNN.He and others who lost their money with similar sites are trying to take their grievances to national authorities - but with little success. A planned protest outside the financial regulators' offices in Beijing on Monday was swiftly shut down by police."The government isn't going to bail anybody out. I'd be very surprised," Collier said. He predicts that after the current shakeout, the industry will eventually consolidate around bigger internet players and banks.China's central bank didn't respond to a request for comment on investors' losses. It has previously said it would crack down on bad lenders and urged relevant government departments to help improve "investors' rationality on investing, loans and risk."Those who have lost money say they're not giving up, despite the risk of jail or detention.A 36-year-old healthcare salesman who said he lost about 1.4 million yuan ($200,000) with Tourongjia told CNN he expects the protests to continue. "We need to fight for our rights," he said. "My life is ruined. Now, I'm like a financial refugee."-- Daniel Shane, Serenitie Wang, Nanlin Fang, Yong Xiong and Steven Jiang contributed to this report.TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

3 QUESTIONS: RICHARD LESTER ON THE MIT CHINA SUMMITStates News ServiceSeptember 19, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 883 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. BodyThe following information was released by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT):On Nov. 12 and 13, leaders in industry, government, and academia will convene at the inaugural MIT China Summit in Beijing, to explore topics at the frontiers of science and technology and the role of research and education in shaping tomorrow's world. MIT News spoke with Richard Lester, the associate provost of MIT who oversees international activities, about the summit and its significance for the Institute.Q: Why is MIT doing a summit in China?A: The idea for the MIT China Summit came out of the MIT Global Strategy report published by my office last year. One of the report's recommendations was for the Institute to convene periodic summits in targeted regions of the world, to demonstrate MIT's interest in working with and learning from partners in these regions; to increase regional knowledge of who we are, how we work, and what we stand for; and to provide a focus for developing new collaborations. This is the first such summit. Many people may wonder why we're doing this summit now in light of the current tensions between the U.S. and China. I think the answer is that even though there are aggravated political strains over trade and technology, at the same time there are opportunities for us to work together on issues that are important to both countries and also to the rest of the world issues like climate change mitigation, clean energy, environmental sustainability, urbanization, and food and water security. Indeed, now may be an especially important time for a university like MIT to focus attention on the possibilities for U.S.-China cooperation in applying science and technology to help solve great global challenges.As President Reif recently noted in an op-ed for The New York Times, China is advancing rapidly in critical fields of science and technology. In areas such as quantum computing, 5G technology, and facial and spoken language recognition, China is a leader. The Chinese are also making bold national investments in key areas of research like biotechnology and space, and directly supporting startups and recruiting talent from around the world. Chinese researchers are increasingly present at the frontiers of science and technology, where MIT faculty and students must also be.At the same time, we understand that interactions with China must be approached thoughtfully and should be carefully reviewed, as is the case with our other international engagements. The summit will provide an opportunity for us to talk about what is most important to us in possible future China collaborations.Q: What will happen at the summit?A: The Summit in Beijing will be a two-day event. On the first day, several MIT programs will be hosting activities and events around the city. These will provide snapshots of different facets of MIT and what we are doing in China. For example, Professor Siqi Zheng, Director of the China Future City Lab at DUSP [Department of Urban Studies and Planning], will hold a symposium on new urban developments in China. MIT Sloan Global Programs will hold its inaugural International Faculty Fellows Conference at Tsinghua University. And the Institute will also host MIT Better World (Beijing), a special reception for alumni from China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong featuring a fireside chat with President Reif.The second day will consist of a plenary conference. This event will engage the audience some 500 invited guests from academia, industry, finance, and government, as well as MIT alums in an MIT-mediated survey of some of the most exciting topics at the frontiers of science as well as potential solutions to some of the world's most challenging problems. The conference will be opened by President Reif, and the program will feature 15 leading MIT professors, together with prominent Chinese scientific and business leaders. Two key themes of the event will be: What can we learn from each other, and what might we do together to address major global challenges.Our local host for all these events is the Chinese Academy of Sciences.Q: How far back does MIT's engagement with China go?A: The first Chinese student came to MIT in 1877, to study at MIT's School of Mechanic Arts. Over the next 50 years, 400 Chinese students were enrolled here at MIT, many of them sent by the Chinese government. This history was beautifully told by Professor Emma Teng in an exhibit she curated last year called China Comes to Tech. She showed us that these early Chinese students were deeply involved in all aspects of the MIT community. They came to study subjects like railroad engineering, mining engineering, and naval architecture, and they also participated in athletics, debate, theater, the professional societies, and virtually every aspect of student life.Chinese students have brought so much to our campus over the past 140 years. And our Chinese faculty and alumni, people like I.M. Pei, Sam Ting, Charles Zhang, and others, have enjoyed great entrepreneurial and academic success and made important contributions in the U.S., in China, and around the world. The MIT China Summit will celebrate this history, while looking ahead to what we hope will be a new century of even more creative and dynamic interactions between MIT and China.Load-Date: September 19, 2018End of Document

Stuck in trade war, US and China face uncertain path to dealAssociated Press Financial WireJuly 11, 2018 Wednesday 12:01 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 1228 wordsByline: By PAUL WISEMAN and CHRISTOPHER RUGABER, AP Economics WritersDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - As the trade war between the world's two largest economies nears the end of its first week, its most unsettling fact may be this: No one seems to foresee any clear path to peace.The United States insists that China abandon the brass-knuckles tactics it's used to try to supplant America's technological dominance. Yet Beijing isn't about to drop its zeal to acquire the technology it sees as crucial to its prosperity.Having run for the White House on a vow to force China to reform its trade policies, President Donald Trump won't likely yield to vague promises by Beijing to improve its behavior - or to pledges to buy more American soybeans or liquefied natural gas."It certainly feels like we're in for a protracted fight," said Timothy Keeler of the law firm Mayer Brown and a former chief of staff at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. "Truthfully, I don't know what the off-ramp is."The first shots sounded July 6: The United States slapped 25 percent taxes on $34 billion in Chinese imports. Most of them are industrial goods that the Trump administration says receive subsidies or other unfair support from Beijing. China quickly lashed back with tariffs on $34 billion in U.S. products.The two countries have targeted an additional $16 billion worth of each other's products for a second round of25 percent tariffs. On Tuesday, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative proposed 10 percent tariffs on another $200 billion in Chinese imports, ranging from fish sticks to burglar alarms.All told, Trump has threatened eventually to slap tariffs on up to $550 billion in Chinese imports - more than China actually exported to the United States last year - if Beijing won't relent to U.S. pressure and continues to retaliate.At the heart of the dispute: The Trump administration's complaints that China has used predatory practices in a relentless push to grant Chinese companies an unfair advantage in the industries of the future, including robotics, electric cars and biopharmaceuticals. These tactics include the outright theft of trade secrets, government subsidies to homegrown tech firms and demands that U.S. and other foreign companies hand over technology if they want access to China's vast market.Eliminating the new tariffs will prove a lot harder than it was to raise them in the first place, said Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade negotiator who is a vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute. "Both sides have too much at stake and don't want to back down."So how does the trade war end? Analysts offer several potential scenarios:____CHINA BLINKS.The Trump administration boasts that China has more to lose in a trade war. After all, Beijing sold $524 billion worth of goods and services to the United States last year and bought far less - $188 billion. So China has far fewer goods to tax than the United States does.And China's benchmark stock index - the Shanghai Composite - has dropped 15 percent this year, at least partly on fears about damage from the trade conflict with Washington."It's a dicey time for the Chinese economy," said Claude Barfield, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute and former consultant to the U.S. Trade Representative.Beijing is trying to contain a run-up in corporate debt and manage a difficult transition away from fast but unsustainable export-driven growth based on exports and often-wasteful investment toward steadier growth built on consumer spending. The International Monetary Fund expects Chinese economic growth to decelerate to 6.6 percent this year from 6.9 percent in 2017.So it's possible that economic pressure could persuade Beijing to cave. Yet many analysts are skeptical. Eswar Prasad, an economist at Cornell University, said the economic damage from U.S. tariffs is "likely to be muted since China has enough room to forestall a growth slowdown" by increasing government spending or adopting easy-money policies that put more cash into the economy.Mary Lovely, an economist and trade expert at Syracuse University, says it's unclear how China could appease Trump, even if it wanted to. China has pledged in the past to police cyber-theft and end coerced technology transfers. So any negotiations, Lovely said, would raise more questions: Would the Trump administration accept another promise? How would any promise be verified? How long would it take to determine whether Beijing has actually reformed its ways?And China's leaders might prove reluctant to back down and risk a backlash from the public."They have nothing to gain internally by kowtowing to President Trump, and that's exactly what it would be," Lovely said.___TRUMP BLINKSTrump faces pressures, too. The Chinese designed their tariffs to inflict political pain in the United States. They have, for example, targeted soybeans and other farm products in a shot at Trump supporters in the American heartland. And U.S. farmers are represented by trade groups and congressional delegations who aren't shy about attacking U.S. policies that threaten farm incomes.But the president would also find it hard to back down. He's already considered one possible solution only to back away from it. In May, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced after a meeting with the Chinese that the trade war was "on hold" and the tariffs suspended after Beijing agreed to reduce the U.S. trade deficit by buying more American energy and farm products.Yet the cease-fire quickly collapsed once critics complained that the Trump administration was letting China buy its way out of the impasse."The president felt the sting of that and didn't like that," Keeler said. So the administration decided to "drive a harder bargain," and it revived - and ramped up - its tariff threat.___A WIN-WIN RESOLUTION.Taiya Smith, a former Treasury official who handled negotiations with China, says it's possible a deal could be reached in which Beijing ends its predatory practices but can still keep itself competitive in advanced industries. The key, she says, is persuading China that its tech companies don't need massive assistance from the state."Their companies are becoming very powerful," Smith said. "They have to be willing to compete on a level playing field. They no longer need a leg up."But she said the U.S. would have to make concessions, too, perhaps by agreeing to let China play a bigger role in global economic policymaking."The Chinese have to have a political win somewhere in there, too," Smith said. "You can't design something where we get what we want and China gets nothing. They have their own politics."___THE WAR DRAGS ONScott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing and a sharp critic of Beijing's trade practices, wants to see the tariffs remain until either U.S. companies leave China or Beijing opens its market wider to American goods and investment."They should stay on for long enough that they manifest some change," he said. "I don't see the tariffs coming off anytime soon."Paul notes that China has repeatedly made empty promises to reform its practices. "We have waste cans full of promises by the Chinese government to reform its anti-competitive practices that are completely ignored," he said. "The tariffs are the best and only leverage that we have with China, and we would be foolish to squander them without major gains."Load-Date: July 11, 2018End of Document

Baker Institute Experts: Satellite Data Must Crack 'Great Wall of Secrecy' Around China's Internal Oil FlowsTargeted News ServiceSeptember 17, 2018 Monday 8:03 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 717 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: HOUSTON, Texas BodyRice University issued the following news release:A "Great Wall of secrecy" surrounds a crucial aspect of China's internal oil industry, according to a new report by experts in the Center for Energy Studies at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy. Comprehensive, high-frequency, reliable and publicly available data on China's domestic oil flows and inventory movements are essentially inaccessible, they conclude. So the experts propose creating a forum to more systematically collect and analyze satellite data capable of shedding more light on the inner workings of China's oil sector.Gabriel Collins, the Baker Botts Fellow in Energy and Environmental Regulatory Affairs at the Baker Institute, and Shih Yu (Elsie) Hung, a research associate in the Center for Energy Studies, co-authored "Using Satellite Data to Crack the Great Wall of Secrecy Around China's Internal Oil Flows." The report not only outlines how such an approach would add value to analysis of global flows, but also explores the challenges it would face and how much it would cost."Ultimately, we hope that creating detailed, reliable and publicly available models of China's internal oil flows can provide insights that improve energy and environmental policymaking at a global level -- including work by Chinese scholars who would have access to a broad and deep level of data disclosure previously unavailable to them," the authors wrote. "Perhaps greater transparency created by external governmental, NGO (nongovernmental organization) and academic researchers will eventually stimulate the Chinese government to improve its own oil sector data disclosures. Only time will tell, but the research potential of the satellite-based, open-source China oil data concept is substantial. Analytical dividends could flow for years from investment in the project by government agencies, academic institutions and private philanthropists interested in China-focused energy and environmental issues."China's heft in the global crude oil market exerts profound effects across the energy sector, the environment and the well-being of humans, the authors said.However, for on-the-ground primary commercial intelligence collection, such as that performed by Genscape and other independent analytical companies in the U.S. market, China's oil sector is effectively a "denied area," the authors said."This is not because the data themselves do not exist or aren't being collected," they wrote. "Rather, it is a challenge at its core rooted in the Chinese government's obsession with secrecy and maximum control of information, and data costs. The prime purveyors of insights derived from satellite imagery are generally startups that must first answer to investors seeking returns and are thus often economically constrained from sharing data at a price point low enough to allow large-scale analysis of China's energy sector by academic parties and various NGOs."The authors said specific oil storage data and other information that would improve analysts' ability to ascertain flow patterns within China are not disclosed by the Chinese government in a regular and comprehensive fashion, leaving analysts to try and piece together numerous missing pieces of a very large and complex oil puzzle.The forum the authors propose would provide imagery that can be fused with other data sources and cross-analyzed, with the aim of yielding a level of insight into China's oil inventory and flow dynamics that would be exponentially deeper than the current general state of knowledge, they said."An open-source forum of academic, think tank and government participants would present an ideal channel for aggregating and analyzing the data in a systematic and useful manner," they wrote. "It could leverage and build upon the formidable existing experience of the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the International Energy Agency, both of which already closely track oil sector activity in China as part of their analytical mandates. Neither entity has a proprietary interest in the oil markets, which enhances their ability to cooperate with academic and other participants whose core interests often center on publishing both analysis and the underlying data themselves."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6447507 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: September 18, 2018End of Document

Meantime, today is deadline for a trade deal with Canada. The President thinks a deal will happen, but is ready either way.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We will see what happens. And if it doesn't happen we'll put tariffs on the cars coming in from Canadian and that will be even better, so -- but I think it's going to happen and we've really developed a very good relationship. Look, we love Canada. But they have to treat us fairly. They haven't treated us fairly.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Trade tensions hitting futures this morning at 62-point loss on the Dow futures. We're having a record-breaking run at the beginning of the week as that Mexico trade deal came together. We were making headway with Canada. The S&P 500, the NASDAQ, and the Russell 2000 hit a one record after another earlier in the week. But yesterday, if you look at this chart of the Dow when that news broke that headlined crossed $200 billion worth of Chinese goods we will be hit with tariffs next week, you saw the market selloff.So again, the elephant in the room, the big worry is China. China being our largest trading partner. The Dow yesterday closing down 137 points. But so far this month, the Dow, S&P, NASDAQ, all your major market gauges major winners. But NASDAQ, the biggest winner with a gain of almost 5-1/2 percent. The best August for the NASDAQ in what 18 years. In Europe, we have losses across the board to tell you about the biggest loser, the French market down more than one percent.And Asian markets mostly lower in overnight trading. Those markets wrapping up the month of August. KOSPI in South Korea did manage to eked out a small gain this Friday of two-thirds of one percent. Take down of technology. The President renewing his attacks against technology giants. We have the fallout. And burger boycott, In-N-Out facing backlash from some Democrats over the company's political contributions to Republicans, but it backfired. And guess what?The company gives to both Republicans and Democrats and people regardless of who they vote for, they some In-N-Out Burger. And more new things from Musk. The Tesla chief in another Twitter tussle calling it the best P.R. he's ever had. You will not believe who he's getting into it tweet spat with. And tapping to type, one company says it can replace a keyboard and a mouse with this. We've got the inventors of this tap strap later this hour.Here to break it all down, Fox News Contributor, National Review Reporter, Kat Timpf, Third Seven Advisor's Chief Market Strategist Michael Block, Fox News Contributor, and radio talk show host, Richard Fowler. Good to see you.MICHAEL BLOCK, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, THIRD SEVEN: Good to see you --(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: -- great to be here. Yes.BLOCK: I just got to bring this up. I'm looking at Twitter and W. Kamau Bell who shut -- who does do nice little show on other network is complaining about the GOP support from In-N-Out Burger. Come out. Tune in. We're giving you the whole story here. Come on. Love your show. You got to love this show. We have the whole story. Come on in.MCDOWELL: I don't even know who that is. So again, it's just -- it shows you -- I get it. And you -- and In-N-Out Burger does incredible charity work. They have since the 1980s and don't start a boycott of something that everyone loves because, again, you're overplaying your hand.RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Just do your research and know that they give to both parties.MCDOWELL: Thank you, Richard Fowler.BLOCK: Now a smart guy. Come on. Come out.MCDOWELL: You're ruining the conversation this morning. The Coming Collapse of China author, Gordon Chang, B. Riley Financial Chief Market Strategist, Art Hogan, the host of "VARNEY & COMPANY", Mr. Stuart Varney. You do not want to miss any of what we have coming up. But to our top story this hour, President Trump reportedly planning to move ahead with tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods coming out of China next week.The threat comes ahead of today's looming deadline to strike a trade deal with Canada. Blake Burman is at the White House to break it all down. Good morning Blake.BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Hi there, Dagen. Good morning to you. The important date here is September 5th. That is next Wednesday. That is important because that's when the public comment period ends for this potential next batch of $200 billion worth of sanctions potentially going toward China's way. Here's what we are told from people all across this White House. First off, the President has discussed we are told the possibility of extending these $200 billion worth of tariffs against China.But we're also told that no firm decision has necessarily been made as of this point and we've also been caution that there is potentially a lot of room to run between now and September 5th or now and what might ever happen after September 5th. Meantime, there is a deadline in the much nearer term and that is today, this afternoon, or this evening as it relates with Canada and potentially striking a new trade agreement with them.Negotiators including Canada's foreign minister have been behind closed- doors for days now trying to hammer out a deal. But so far, there's a sense of optimism, but no firm commitment. At a campaign rally last night in Indiana, the Presidents expressed that optimism while also reiterating this warning right here. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We will see what happens. And if it doesn't happen, we'll put tariffs on the cars coming in from Canada and that will be even better, so -- but I think it's going to happen and we've really developed a very good relationship.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURMAN: In an interview yesterday with Bloomberg, the President continued to show off his long list of trade grievances at one point saying of the World Trade Organization the following, "If they don't shape up, I would withdraw from the WTO." Dagen, he also confirmed our report yesterday which is that as it relates to the European Union and potentially lowering auto tariffs down to zero. The President told Bloomberg that he has rejected a deal we're told that the President does not see that as a standalone issue, Dagen.MCDOWELL: Thank you, Blake Burman at the White House for us. Here now Gordon Chang, author of The Coming Collapse of China. Gordon, China now pushing back today saying renewed pressure will not work, are they ready for a long trade war because, again, this $200 billion that was talked about yesterday, this was not new? It didn't come out of the blue. The White House quite frankly has telegraphed that very quickly that it would be 50 billion initially and then maybe another 200 billion, what do you make of it?GORDON CHANG, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, certainly, China is not prepared for a long-term struggle with the United States and the Chinese know that. The only way they can win this trade war is if they bluff President Trump down. And by the way, it's not really a trade war. Now, it's a tech war because we're talking about tariffs that are imposed under Sector 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 to remedy China's theft of U.S. intellectual property.That theft runs in the hundreds of billions of dollars a year and if you don't like the tariffs China, you know, then just stop stealing our stuff.MCDOWELL: What are you looking for in terms of how American companies manufacturers deal with this the increased tariffs because I've listened to or going back and listened to a lot of conference calls from these retailers, and maybe the impact is not as grave as some people might think because a lot of these companies major discount retailers they have pretty diverse manufacturing bases. It's not like that every product that say a discounter sells is going to go up 25 percent automatically?CHANG: Clearly not. If you were to go to a Wal-Mart 10, 12 years ago, you would see that of their house brands and garments, 90 percent or more were made in China. You do the same today. Look at George, their house brand. It's about the reverse. It's about 90 percent elsewhere and so supply chains can move. The only company that really can't move its supply chain quickly is Apple because of Foxconn.But Foxconn will if, you know, if there are the pressures, Foxconn will move elsewhere as they moved into China. They started in Taiwan. They moved to China. They can move out of China. But Apple does have a real problem and the other thing that I'd be worried about would be the pharmaceuticals because they've located a lot of their manufacturing to China.BLOCK: You know, Gordon, you know, I look at this situation and markets don't seem to care that much also the past couple of days, but overall, we're right near all-time highs in U.S. stock markets. What -- what's the real message here because I'm hearing about this and it just seems like for lack of better way to put it, the U.S. President Trump have hands here? They really have a lot more leverage this -- it looks like what's going on here these tariffs is going to hurt China a lot more than it's hurting the U.S. both in terms of manufacturers and consumers, what are we missing here?You mentioned the intellectual property and things like that, but it seems like China has been getting away with that for a long time, is there really a recourse against that, you know, what's really -- what leverage does China really have here?CHANG: Well, the leverage that China has because, first of all, they don't have the leverage on tariffs. I mean last year we imported 505 billion from China. We only exported 130 or so which means that they're going to run out of bullets. The only leverage they really have is to hold U.S. companies like Apple hostage and that is really what they're going to do. But, you know, a lot of Chinese officials really think that's bad idea for China because really what it means is that the European companies, the Japanese, the South Koreans, and, you know, everybody else.They're not going to want to put their companies into China in the future and I think you're going to see foreign direct investment in China really decline precipitously largely because, you know, people don't want to be subject to intimidation.MCDOWELL: I do want to point this out that there's a lot that goes on with them China in terms of misinformation campaigns out of the Chinese government about American companies. You've seen this time and again to try and drive business away from companies that are already doing business there. There's a lot that this try --- this essentially controlled government does not just stealing intellectual property, but really trying to hammer American businesses when we get in a fight with China.CHANG: You know, and Apple has actually been a victim of that in March 2013 and very recently they're now starting to say look, you know, Apple, if you want to stay in China, you're going to have to give more to us which is really extortion. But they really focused in on Tim Cook's company.BLOCK: So Gordon, a question for you. I mean so we don't look at just trade and a vacuum. It seems as though that China other also a player in how we deal with the Korean Peninsula and they're use -- and they are now starting to tinker with that because of this looming trade war, what's the implications of that in a long-term for the market and what implications militarily?CHANG: Yes. If you go and look at President Trump's tweet last Friday even the tweet of Wednesday, he has put two together. He says, our policies are on trade, on -- are actually affecting China's attitude towards us on North Korea. Actually, I don't believe it. I don't think President Trump should blame his policies and the reason is China has been villain for decades on North Korea. They've been a villain for decades on trade.So, you know, basically, they might have, you know, what President Trump does might have a marginal effect on Beijing's reaction. But, long-term, you look at what the Chinese are doing on both issues, I don't think that President Trump's tariffs are having much an effect on their --(CROSSTALK)BLOCK: -- military spending.CHANG: Well, China has been --(CROSSTALK)BLOCK: -- maybe spending.CHANG: Oh, there's a tremendous amount there and in the -- and the question is why are they doing this? They want to do it because they want to take territory from their neighbors. They want to close off the global commerce. This puts them into opposition with everybody else including the United States. There's a very bad story for Beijing long-term.MCDOWELL: But when we started this conversation about what's going on with trade, tariffs, and the White House even Steve Forbes was on the show saying we should have a need to lock arms with all our allies and take on China as a united front from Japan to Canada and Mexico. And that was the disturbing thing about the steel and aluminum tariffs to begin. However, we should put out deal with Mexico. It's a handshake deal.Negotiations with Canada, that's why we are watching this renegotiations of NAFTA so closely and there was just a report out in the globe and mail newspaper in Canada with this headlined. Canada government officials said to doubt -- to deal Friday, so it is a deadline. I mean it is an arbitrated deadline according to some set by the White House, but that's why not just in terms of the United States' economy and out trade with these allies, that's why it's so important to make sure that we get everybody on our side and we can take on China.CHANG: That's absolutely critical, Dagen, and, you know, you're 100 percent right on that. And that's why, the -- sort of the handshake with Europe at the end of July, that was a good thing because really what happened there was for instance you take soybeans, everyone talks about soybeans. The Europeans agreed to buy more soybeans which is a message to China is like, don't mess with American soybean farmers because we won't sell to you China but we will sell to the Europeans.MCDOWELL: Gordon, it's great to see you.CHANG: Thanks, Dagen.MCDOWELL: Gordon Chang with us. Coming up, a Twitter tussle for Elon Musk. The latest controversy for the Tesla CEO. And a burger boycott. Some California Democrats are speaking out after In-N-Out Burger donates to Republicans, but they didn't just donate to Republicans. Will the move fight those Dems?MCDOWELL: Memorial services for the late Senator John McCain getting underway in Washington this morning. Cheryl Casone has the details, Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: You know, that's right. McCain is going to lie in state at the Capitol rotunda today. Yesterday, former Vice President Joe Biden delivered a tearful remembrance of his friend at McCain's memorial service in Phoenix.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Now, John is going to take his rightful place in a long line of extraordinary leaders in this nation's history, who in their time and in their way stood for freedom and stood for liberty. And have made the American story the most improbable and the most the hopeful and the most enduring story on Earth.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Well, McCain's flag grave casket arrive in Joint Base Andrews outside of D.C. late last night. Longtime congressional colleagues are mourning. Citizens are going to be able to pay their respects between 1:00 and 8:00 p.m. Well, now to Detroit, promises to be at funeral that is fit for a queen, a 6th hour invitation only service for Aretha Franklin, the Queen of Soul, is at 10 a.m. this morning in Franklin's hometown and the stars are going to be out to honor her.The long list of big name performers includes Ariana Grande, Stevie Wonder, Jennifer Hudson, and Faith Hill. More than 30 artists paid tribute to Aretha Franklin last night in the Motor City during nearly five-hour concert that celebrated her life and her legacy music. Franklin died just over two weeks ago of pancreatic cancer at the age of 76. Well, Coca-Cola is looking to inject some caffeine into its portfolio. The company is buying British coffee chain, Costa, for $5.1 billion dollars from Britain's Whitbread.Costa is the world's second largest coffee chain beginning Starbucks. Coca-Cola shares are higher in the premarket on the heels of this news up a little bit more than half a percent. And then, funds run by BlackRock voted in favor of a proposal that would have required Tesla to replace Elon Musk with an independent chairman. The proposal which was defeated would not have affected Musk standing as Tesla's chief executive officer.Meanwhile, Musk is welcoming the criticism of Steve Bannon who calls him, "An immature man-child on Twitter." Well, Musk tweeted back, can Steve Bannon please insult me some more? Best P.R. I've had in a while. Musk recently backtracked out of plans to take Tesla private which has denied scrutiny from the SEC and obviously isn't, you know, causing (INAUDIBLE) problems with the board to say the least --(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: -- Elon Musk shouldn't take the bait though, Cheryl. Again, this is what people whose relevancy is in decline often will tweet about someone who is more famous to gets more attention in order to have their name uttered on television shows.CASONE: YEs.KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, it works.CASONE: There we go.BLOCK: It definitely works.MCDOWELL: It definitely works.FOWLER: Can I just say that the funeral -- the funeral for Aretha Franklin today and she (INAUDIBLE) as a queen. Costumer changes during your viewing --(CROSSTALK)FOWLER: The best I've seen.MCDOWELL: I am -- I was reading your mind. I was reading your mind. That is the -- one of the most joyous moments I've seen all week as we celebrate life of Senator John McCain --(CROSSTALK)FOWLER: -- she went from a red outfit on the first day of the view. It was a red shoe. It was red (INAUDIBLE) to the second day of having a blue outfit with blue shoes --(CROSSTALK)TIMPF: I'm going to have to do with my funeral. I've got to have a lot of costumer changes.FOWLER: Multiple.MCDOWELL: I don't know if I should share this. But it's, you know, when you know -- when you and I have sat down with my mother and gone over her funeral arrangements, and it's just -- it actually is a way to make sure that someone's life is celebrated in the way that they wanted, and it takes the pressure off of the family to have to deal with the arrangements, so --(CROSSTALK)FOWLER: A queen in life and a queen in death.MCDOWELL: Oh, my gosh. It is all about Stevie Wonder though. Don't you date put Ariana Grande's name before Stevie Wonder ever again. It's all about --(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: No, just Stevie. All you need to say is Stevie Wonder is going to be performing.TIMPF: I agree.MCDOWELL: Thank you. Coming up, slamming Silicon Valley. President Trump's war of words against Google, Facebook, and Twitter next. And rethinking the traditional keyboard. We check out the new device that lets you type on the go.MCDOWELL: Markets tends about trade. Yesterday, the Dow fell 137 points and it really sold-off as those headline started to cross that President Trump was going to slap $200 billion in additional import from China with tariffs. If you look at this Dow at the chart yesterday, you can see how that hit stocks. But again, we're on track to wrap up but it's been an incredible month. It was a good day for Amazon. Shares of Amazon soaring above $2000 a share yesterday.A major milestone as is climbed to match Apple's $1 trillion market value. Joining us now, Art Hogan, B. Riley Financial Chief Market Strategist. Going into the fall, Art, what are you watching?ART HOGAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, B. RILEY FINANCIAL: You know, it's interesting. Unfortunately, we're going to be going to held hostage to conversation around trade. So the good news is it feels like that's getting better in North America. Clearly a good news around Mexico. We're getting the framework for that deal done, deals like Canada really wants to join that party and that probably happens today at some point in time.Not sure if escalation with the Eurozone is real or just more negotiations. But china is the long-term play and, you know, that news has to get worse before it gets better. So as you mentioned, you know, the White House is going back to that fining $200 billion worth of additional imports to put tariffs on. And that's going to get heated up. I think just like China can play a long game and this -- and obviously, we know what the endgame is, but it's just not going to happen. I don't think before the midterm elections.BLOCK: Hey, Art, you know, Mike Block here. So we're here talking about trade and how enthusiasm and optimism on trade has driven markets, you know, this week. We're just -- or Dagen was just talking about Amazon. We've seen this so-called FANG stocks especially Amazon, Apple, and Alphabet leading the charts higher just feels like this is low liquidity late August momentum driven rally, you know, how -- what kind of leg does that have given the catalyst for lack there is coming? You know, what are you thinking here?HOGAN: Hey, Mike, so, yes, great question. I think that some of the kind -- it's interesting. So you got two different trades going on right now or three really, so you've got the trade darlings, right, so the poster children for trade like the large cap industrial, Boeing, CAT, DEER that all get hammered when there's negative news around trade, right? You've got the trade agnostic group which is the group you just talked about really feeling like they don't adversely get affected and that's necessarily by trade.Although, Apple might come into that at some point in China and then you've got all the retailers in the last two weeks that are reported and you really have the good and the bad there. There's been some amazing great stories like Lululemon overnight that have done well in the consumer land. And then there's been those stories that, you know, where the business models are just not working and those then have gotten tattooed.So to your point in what, you know, otherwise, quiet summer trading. We've seen three different groups that have significantly shown some volume and some activity. And, unfortunately, you know, as trade continues to dominate headlines in September, I think we're going to see ongoing pressure not just on the multinationals, but also on, you know, the emerging markets, you know, the further we get into trade conversations, the more antagonistic it gets, the stronger the dollar it gets to the worst off emerging markets get.MCDOWELL: You know, but as strong as the consumer is, Art, still got a bus stop for the holidays, so --(CROSSTALK)BLOCK: You know, Art made the point about Lululemon, Dagen. You know, I've pointed out yesterday and this morning, we've seen dollar general, family -- a dollar tree and then also big box this morning on the low end of retail, not doing so great.MCDOWELL: Art, final word.HOGAN: Yes. You know what, I'm just happy to see there are winners in the world where we thought Amazon had killed everybody, so I think the consumer is certainly not dead. That rumor has been exaggerated and I think we're going to have a great holiday shopping season. We have a very good back to school shopping season, so I think the consumers are doing great.MCDOWELL: Yes. I was never featured into that buffet that Amazon was somehow going to put every major retailer out of business and they've clearly figured out how to do online, and in store very well like Wal-Mart or Target. Art, thank you so much. Art Hogan.HOGAN: You bet.MCDOWELL: Coming up, some Democrats bring in the beef. The details after In-N-Out Burger donates to Republicans of what's the real story. We'll tell you about it. And as we get to break, check out British Prime Minister Theresa May dancing on a trip to Africa. This has gone viral. Just listen and think of Elaine Benes. We'll be right back.MCDOWELL: Welcome back. I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Friday, August 31st. Your top stories at 8:30 a.m. Eastern. The heat is on, President Trump reportedly ready to hit China with an additional $200 billion of tariffs. It's tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods that could happen next week. The news shook the markets yesterday. You can see it looking at this chart of the Dow exactly when that news hit, investors rattled.Meantime, reports coming out this morning that Canada is doubting if a trade deal with the U.S. can be reached by today's deadline, the stumbling blocks or how you resolve disputes between the two countries, will it stay as it is with panels, tribunals if you will, and also opening up Canada's dairy market for U.S. dairy products? Those are the two main issues, we watched the Futures this morning 56-point loss on the Dow Futures.In Europe, it was selling across the board as well. As Europe moves closer to wrapping up its final trading day of the month, we have losses on England, France, and Germany, down one percent. And then, looking at Asia, Asia overnight, all of the markets there were lower except South Korea. There you go.Moving on, Trump versus technology, the President putting social media and Google on notice at rally last night in Indiana.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Very importantly, my administration is also standing up for the free speech rights of all Americans. You look at Google, Facebook, Twitter, and other social media giants, and I've made it clear that we as a country cannot tolerate political censorship, blacklisting, and rigged search results!(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: President Trump has accused Google of rigging its search results. Social media -- and social media of censoring conservative voices. And then, burger boycott, In-N-Out facing backlash from liberals over the company's political contributions by Republicans. But it's backfiring. To quote the Los Angeles Times, "In-N-Out is as beloved as the Golden Gate Bridge in California.And then, stock to watch, Big Lots tanking as the company missed estimates but Lululemon taking off, raising guidance. Lulemon shares up almost 11 percent. We'll look behind the numbers in just a few minutes. And throwing out the keyboard, one company says the future is tapping to type, we've got the investors of the Tap Strap later this hour. Hey, there.And to our top story this half hour, President Trump slamming social media bias last night at his Evansville rally.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: You look at Google, Facebook, Twitter, and other social media giants. And I've made it clear that we as a country cannot tolerate political censorship, blacklisting, and rigged search results. And you know, it can go the other way also. We will not let large corporations silence conservative voices, we're not going to let them control what we can and cannot see, read, and learn from, we can't do that.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: This, as Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg are set to testify next week on Capitol Hill. Maria Bartiromo breaking that news for you, last week, even earlier about Jack Dorsey testifying. Joining me now to discuss, Republican strategist Bryan Lanza, and Democratic strategist Adrienne Elrod. Bryan, to you first, is this just a -- I mean, this is as Ari Fleischer was saying yesterday, this is high heat ripe for the base. It doesn't really matter unless Congress and the White House steps up to regulate these businesses. What do you say?BRYAN LANZA, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: You know, listen, I think being for censorship is very anti-American, and we see in college campuses and now receded on social media platforms, why is the left so afraid of free speech? It's probably because of the things that Republicans have to say of you know, mad because it's common sense. I mean, let the speech take place, whether it's on campuses or on social media. Should the government step in? It's a large enough platform and they shouldn't censor Americans, it's just not what we do here.MCDOWELL: Adrienne, what do you say, because again, there is -- there is plenty of evidence that social media platforms have tried to suppress conservative speech or they don't treat conservative speech the way that they treat the speech of people who are alike the very people working in these technology companies.ADRIENNE ELROD, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, I agree with Ari Fleischer on this. This is simply another way for Trump to rally the base. I mean, this is -- you know, first he goes after the free press and now he's going after the free internet. This is also a President who had made it very clear that he is trying to get rid of regulations and instead of trying to put more regulations out there. So again, I think it's a way for him to rally his base. Google, and other tech companies maintain that there is certainly no censorship that they based on the search results on algorithms that have nothing to do with political bias. So, again, we'll see what happens next week when Sheryl Sandberg and Jack Dorsey testify. But again, I think this is just another tactic for Trump to try to rally the base against the media and now against Silicon Valley.MCDOWELL: Lady and -- I'll get final word on that Bryan but I want to move on to this other topic. Continue.LANZA: You know, it's not rallying the base when you're fighting defending free speech, when you're against censorship, that's not -- that's rallying America, that's who we are, that's what we believe in. Now, what is the left -- you know, why is the left so offended by free speech and open dialogue? Probably because they can't defend their own positions, whether it's on university campuses or on social media, who knows where it's going to be next, the workplace? This needs to stop its madness.MCDOWELL: Yes. But Bryan, to be clear, the President has hammered many publications and many newspapers, so -- and then --LANZA: Sure. And they deserved it.MCDOWELL: Well, but then the left -- people on the left or the people who work at these publications are worried, they feel like that -- you know, when you called the members of the press the enemy of the people, there's a problem in that, and you're not standing up for the First Amendment.LANZA: You know, the First Amendment is many things, and you are saying it for the First Amendment when you're against censorship. You know, him being critical of the media -- you know, the media is not free of criticism, they've done a lot wrong here. Just look at the recent CNN story with Carl Bernstein, now they only do one sources. The media is complicit in a lot of these problems that the President is criticizing them for.MCDOWELL: Well, I want to move on to this because there's a new beef for the Democratic Party or at least some people who are Democrats out in California. Folks -- some folks are up in arms because the hamburger chain In-N-Out Burger donated $25,000 to the California Republican Party.And California Democratic Party chairman Eric Bauman said this on Twitter to start the firestorm, "Et tu In-N-Out? Tens of thousands of dollars donated to the California Republican Party. It's time to #boycott In-N- Out. Let Trump and his cronies support these creeps, perhaps animal style." Now, Adrienne, we've had a response from In-N-Out, I mentioned the Los Angeles Times article, In-N-Out gives to both parties, equally, they do incredible amounts of work for charity through the In-N-Out Foundation. This just seems like overplaying your hand when you try to boycott something that everybody loves."ELROD: Yes, look, Dagen, I'm going to completely agree with you on this. I mean, first of all, I'm a huge fan of In-N-Out burgers, it's the first thing that I do when I fly in to LAX, I go straight to In-N-Out and grab a burger.MCDOWELL: So does Richard. Richard Fowler does, too.FOWLER: I do, too.ELROD: So, I will not be -- I will not -- as a Democrat, I will not be boycotting In-N-Out burger. Look, I know Eric Bauman, he's a fantastic Democratic operative in California, but I think this is going a little too far. And by the way, In-N-Out Burger has a lot of fans, and that transcends political party affiliations. So, I don't think this tactic is going to work. As you mentioned, In-N-Out Burger does a lot of charity work, they're a very philanthropic company, and I don't see this having really any sort of effect.MCDOWELL: But Bryan, people have pointed out even on Twitter, the company has a reputation. It was founded in 1948. Has a reputation for maintaining strong Christian beliefs and it puts references to bible verses in its packaging. So again, I think that the outrage is -- again, this is what I talk about when I say manufactured outrage, that people have to look and it's not symmetrical with what has been done. And people are sick of it, and it will stop working, and this In-N-Out Burger boycott is an example of that, where you overplay your hand, and your -- people who should maybe support you, if you're a Democrat, they stop listening to you.LANZA: Yes. I mean, I'm a Californian. I love In-N-Out. I think if the voters of California have to choose between a Democratic Party in In-N-Out, they're going to choose In-N-Out. I think -- you know, I know Eric, myself, having worked against him in several campaigns, I know him to be somewhat reasonable most of the time, but his tactics today are very much a bully, and it's just -- it's just unacceptable. In-N-Out is entitled to have a choice voice in this debate, they've chosen to give the Republicans in the past, they've chosen to give the Democrats. What Eric is trying to do is stifle their voice. This goes back to the left trying to silence voices on the right. What is wrong with free speech?MCDOWELL: The company made equal contributions to both Democratic and Republican political action committees in California in 2018. So, they're playing both sides of the aisle, and that's -- and you know what, that's not why people love them. The food is delicious and I don't even eat meat anymore, and I have fond memories of In-N-Out in California. Again, you're picking a fight where there doesn't need to be one. Thank you, Bryan Lanza, Adrienne Elrod, great to see you both.ELROD: You, too.LANZA: Thank you.MCDOWELL: Coming up, Warren Buffett speaking out. Stuart Varney weighing in, that will be next. Plus, Lululemon shares soaring following better- than-expected earnings. We break down those numbers ahead.GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: I'm Gerri Willis live from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. We've had big earnings misses and gains today. Take a listen, Big Lots, the middle-income retailer missing its numbers, $0.59 a share versus $0.67, the company's chair is poised to open 6.6 percent lower. Flipside of the coin, Lulemon, a big earnings beat. Take a look at this, stock will open at a new high, up 10-1/2, possibly online sales were fueling that beat. It should open at a record high.And a fun story for mom and dad, you're sending those kids to Disneyland on the West Coast to the new Galaxy's Edge next summer. Guess what, you'll be able to get a drink there. That's right, they're opening Oga's Cantina as part of this new "Star Wars" franchise. This hasn't happened in 63 years. The reality is that Walt Disney himself never wanted to have alcohol on the premises. He said it wasn't wholesome, but this is pretty exciting stuff. The Planet Batuu, that's where this thing will be set. Take a look, that's from the movie itself. And as I send it back to you, Dagen, I just want to give you a quote from "Star Wars." See, if you remember this one. You will pay for your lack of vision young Jedi. Yes?(LAUGHTER)WILLIS: Darth Vader, right?MCDOWELL: Gerri, you just --WILLIS: That was Darth Vader. You should -- should I do it again?TIMPF: You should play Darth Vader in the next movie. That was so good.BLOCK: Gerri, happy Labor Day.(LAUGHTER)MCDOWELL: Gerri, you just made my day, you made all of our day. Thank you so much.WILLIS: You're welcome.MCDOWELL: Legendary investor Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett sounding off on the possibility of Apple investing in Tesla in an interview with Fox Business.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WARREN BUFFETT, CEO, BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY: I think -- I think it would be a very poor idea to get into the auto business. It's not an easy business.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Joining me now, the host of "VARNEY & COMPANY," Stuart Varney. Mr. Varney.STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: I guess that puts the kibosh on any idea that Apple might buy Tesla because Warren Buffett has $56 billion worth of Apple stock. He has some input, he's also the most successful investor, I think, in history. So, what he says means something. I guess Apple is not going to be buying Tesla. That had been the speculation, after all, Tesla is in great financial trouble, they need money, they're going to need money in the future, they're looking for a partner maybe looking for a buyout deal, but it's not going to come from Apple even though, Apple has got all this money. So that settles that, I wonder if Tesla can keep at the $300 dollar per share mark with that as the news background. I see Apple going further up, I guess investors didn't want him to buy Tesla in the first place. So, that's the state of play this morning. Actually, Dagen, I was rather hoping that Gerri would imitate a British accent and let's see how that went down, but I don't think that's going to happen.MCDOWELL: You know what, I'm not going to do a British accent.VARNEY: And don't, don't. And I won't do your accent either, OK?MCDOWELL: No, because I sound like -- when you do southern, you sound like John Wayne.VARNEY: Oh, OK, I'll take that. Pilgrim.MCDOWELL: Exactly, Stuart. I can't wait to watch your show coming up. Can I ask you -- can I just spring one on you real quick?VARNEY: Go.MCDOWELL: This In-N-Out Burger controversy, what do you think?VARNEY: I'm going to editorialize on that. I think it's craziness. The story is that In-N-Out Burger gave some money to the Republican Party, and for business groups, the Democrats found out about it and said let's boycott In-N-Out Burger. That is pure nonsense. And the display is the hostility of California Democrats to business. Furthermore In-N-Out burger has bible verses on its packaging. Oh, you can't have that. No, no, I'll boycott that -- oh, the dangers of Christianity, what a laugh. I'm going to editorialize it at 10:00 on that.MCDOWELL: I cannot -- or 10 a.m. Well, you start at 9:00 a.m. and that is almost nine minutes from now. Mr. Varney, thank you. Stuart Varney. Straight out of a sci-fi film, we check out the high-tech device lets you type on the go, next.MCDOWELL: People have been typing the same way for more than 200 years. Typewriters and then to cellphone, the keyboard range supreme is the way to get your words out. Now, one company plans to change the way, well, the keyboard exist. Tap Strap, the wearable keyboard that lets you tap out what you want to write. Joining me now are the founders Dovid Schick and Sabrina Kemeny. Great to see you both. You just got to show us Dovid of how this works.DOVID SCHICK, CO-FOUNDER, TAP STRAP: Great. So, as you said, it's a wearable keyboard, and it allows me to type just by touching anything with my fingers. And unlike any keyboard that you've ever seen, instead of having an regiment of keys that I have to aim for, I can just select which fingers I want to use, and --MCDOWELL: It's getting messages.(LAUGHTER)SCHICK: Yes.(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: No, I'm just kidding.SCHICK: That probably was. All right, so let me -- let me just demonstrate what I mean. So, let's say I want to say tapping is fun and easy. OK? And let's say I wanted to have a special character like this and make that --MCDOWELL: So, is it -- is it like just the way that the gesture -- is it based on the hand gesture.SABRINA KEMENY, CO-FOUNDER, TAP STRAP: All right. So, different finger combinations represent different letters. So, for instance, if I tapped my index finger, I will send an E to any device that's connected via Bluetooth to my Tap Strap. So --(LAUGHTER)KEMENY: While these two fingers tot an N.MCDOWELL: They're watching. That's why they keep texts -- that's what they keep --KEMENY: Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.MCDOWELL: Oh, my goodness. No, that's why they keep texting. Please tell us how much it cost and where it's available guys?SCHICK: So, it's costs $179 U.S. It's available on Amazon and it's available on our Web site which is tapwithus.com.MCDOWELL: And Sabrina, how has sales been so far?KEMENY: They've been really good. It's been -- it's very exciting watching them grow. So --MCDOWELL: That's incredible. When did you found the company?" How long (INAUDIBLE)KEMENY: Well, about three years ago, and it did take us a while to go through quite a few prototypes until we perfected it and that's something that's incredibly accurate and precise. And this one has a built in mouse. So, it's gone through some iterations to come to this -- to this point, so, it's 1995 and --MCDOWELL: We love you guys. Thank you so much, Sabrina and Dovid, thank you so much for being here. Tap will be right back.MCDOWELL: Varney, go!VARNEY: OK.

China Is Going to Outrageous Lengths to Surveil Its Own CitizensAtlantic OnlineAugust 16, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1250 wordsByline: Sigal SamuelBodyChina has reportedly begun deploying flocks of drones disguised as birds to surveil its citizens. The drones have wings that flap so realistically they're difficult to distinguish from actual birds. In fact, animals on the ground often can't make the distinction, and even real birds in the sky sometimes fly alongside the drones. The robotic birds can mimic 90 percent of the movements of their biological counterparts, and they're also very quiet, which helps them avoid detection.The operation's codename is "Dove"-but there's reason to doubt whether these machines come in peace. Yang Wenqing, a member of the team behind Dove, said the technology has "some unique advantages to meet the demand for drones in the military and civilian sectors" and "good potential for large-scale use in the future."Headlines about technologies like these gaining traction in China have been appearing in the news with alarming frequency. Facial-recognition tech is now used for everything from catching criminals in huge crowds to            detecting and shaming jaywalkers to            deciding whether someone can get an extra square of toilet paper in a public bathroom. Some employees have to wear            helmets that scan their brainwaves for rage, depression, anxiety, or fatigue, and that alert their bosses to any perceived problem. Then there's the country's            social credit system, which monitors millions of individuals' behavior (including via social media and online shopping), determines how moral or immoral it is, and raises or lowers their "citizen score" accordingly. Those with a high score are            rewarded, while those with a low score are punished.Even in a country known for its extreme spying on its entire population, the degree of surveillance targeting Muslims in particular is unnerving. An estimated 22 to 25 million Muslims live in China, out of a total population of 1.4 billion. Last year, a            Freedom House study found that extensive surveillance affects many religious groups, with Muslims as well as Protestant Christians and Tibetan Buddhists experiencing an increase in persecution over the previous five years. In an interview this week, Timothy Grose, a China expert at the Rose Hulman Institute of Technology, told me, "Right now, we see a lot of the repression being directed against Muslims."           Chinese tech isn't the enemyThe Dove program's bird-like drones have been flown over five provinces so far, and it's perhaps no coincidence that they've been used extensively in one area in particular: Xinjiang, a northwestern region heavily populated by Uighurs, a largely Muslim ethnic minority. The government has long considered the region a breeding ground for separatism and extremism. Ethnic riots there killed hundreds in 2009, and some Uighurs have perpetrated terror attacks in recent years. The area is now subject to a heightened level of surveillance, with authorities            collecting DNA samples, fingerprints, iris scans, voice samples, and blood types from residents."They're applying a very, very broad attempted solution to what they see as an ideological danger. In Xinjiang, the definition of extremism has expanded so far as to incorporate virtually anything you do as a Muslim," James Millward, a professor of Chinese history at Georgetown University, told me. The amount of surveillance directed at that region's 11 million Uighurs, he added, is "certainly disproportionate" relative to that directed at other groups. "Islam is now effectively being demonized in China."This month, 11,500 Chinese Muslims are heading to Mecca on the annual Hajj pilgrimage. Before leaving the country, some of the pilgrims were given state-issued tracking devices, in the form of            "smart cards" attached to lanyards around their necks. The devices bear GPS trackers and customized personal data. The state-run China Islamic Association says they're intended to ensure the pilgrims' safety. (There is legitimate reason for such concerns: During the 2015 Hajj, a            stampede killed more than 750 pilgrims.) But some human-rights experts say this is one more effort to surveil Muslims. The government's fear, according to a Human Rights Watch            report, is that religious pilgrimages could act as "potential cover for subversive political activity.""I don't use what comes out of human-rights organizations uncritically, but here's one case where I would definitely side with them," Grose said. "The pilgrims are always accompanied by an official guide, essentially a monitor, who represents the Chinese Islamic Association, which represents the state. Their movements are always under supervision. Their schedules are airtight, with very little room for any extracurricular activities. So the use of GPS in an already tightly put-together schedule just seems too redundant [if it's about safety]. To me, it's about: 'Well, what if one of them sneaks away, and we need to find out where he is and if he's talking to someone and bringing back with him an interpretation of Islam that doesn't accord with [what the government] has been promoting?'"           China's new frontiers in dystopian techMuslims are also experiencing larger human-rights violations in China. An estimated 1 million Uighurs are reportedly being held without trial in detention camps, where they're            forced to memorize Communist Party propaganda, criticize their own previous religious behavior, and renounce Islam, including by eating pork and drinking alcohol. China issued a            denial Monday after a United Nations human-rights panel            said last Friday that it's seen many credible reports alleging that a million Uighurs are held in what resembles a "massive internment camp that is shrouded in secrecy." In July, the U.S. State Department expressed deep concern about the            "possibly millions" of Muslims in the camps, and an earlier U.S. commission            called it "the largest mass incarceration of a minority population in the world today."Although China has been mostly targeting Uighurs, it's also detaining Muslim members of other ethnic groups like Kazakhs. If Uighurs and Kazakhs-both Turkic peoples-are taking the brunt of the maltreatment, it's likely because the Chinese authorities see them as a threat to the integrity of the country, with Uighur separatists aspiring to their own national homeland (they refer to Xinjiang as East Turkestan) and Kazakhs maintaining foreign contacts across the border in Kazakhstan."The Chinese government thinks that these Turkic Muslims have incorrect thoughts," Maya Wang, a senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch, wrote in an email, "because they identify more with Turks and Muslims in Turkey and Central Asia. To correct these thoughts, and to make them loyal subjects of the Chinese Communist Party, it needs to reengineer their identities and to tightly control them."For his part, Grose said, "The Chinese Communist Party allows for and even celebrates most ethnic diversity. But when that's animated by religious nationalism, that's what the Party fears-because those are forces that originate outside China, which they can't control."Chinese experiments in surveillance are having an impact elsewhere in the world: Some of the new tech the authorities seem to            try out on Uighur Muslims is later applied more broadly in the country and then exported abroad. "Xinjiang provides a testing ground from which they can then try it in larger places," Grose said. Chinese firms have already sold their surveillance tech to countries like            Malaysia,            Pakistan, and            Zimbabwe, and may soon gain            a foothold in Europe, too.Load-Date: August 17, 2018End of Document

China UnionPay: China Takes the Lead in Piloting Mobile Payment, Delivering Convenience-Enhancing Solutions to Its PopulacePR NewswireJuly 11, 2018 Wednesday 10:00 PM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 819 wordsDateline: BEIJING, July 11, 2018 Body With just a mobile phone in your hand, you can hop on the subway or bus, shop in a supermarket or convenience store, pay for needed supplies while on campus or settle a traffic fine via the mobile Quick Pass function. This is now part and parcel of the daily routine for many people in China.Today, mobile payments have seamlessly penetrated into every person's daily activities and has had a profound effect on their lives. All eyes are on China, as the world's most populous country has rapidly taken the lead into the era of mobile payment.China enters the era of convenient mobile payment ahead of its timeA survey of 18,000 consumers across 23 countries and regions by Ipsos, a leading international market research firm, shows that 77% of all Chinese use mobile payment services, ranking the country first in the world. The penetration rate of mobile payment in the United States and Japan has so far only reached 48 per cent and 27 per cent respectively. Given the size of the Chinese population, the difference is remarkable.Taking the daily movement of its population as an example, dramatic changes have been observed in the way Chinese commuters and travelers pay when they board a bus or subway or drive a car to get where they are going, all of which has been made possible by the popularity of mobile payments. Using UnionPay mobile payment to settle all fees that occur while in transit is now the commonly accepted way to get from point A to point B in more than 400 counties and cities across China, with the highest percentages of the population already doing so located in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Fuzhou and Jinan.To cite Hubei province as just one example, car owners who have added their vehicle information to the UnionPay app and set up their UnionPay payment function as the default payment option can drive through any toll plaza along the highway without stopping, and the system will automatically recognize the license plate and submit the highway toll.A convenient mobile payment service for all payment scenariosWith the goal of improving the quality of life through service enhancements that benefit every person resident in China, a project to evidence the convenience of mobile payments under the aegis of China's central bank named the "Mobile payment convenience demonstration project" targets areas that are most likely to touch on every person's life, including what are referred to as the ten major payment scenarios: travel by bus or subway, food market and other local convenience shopping, restaurant dining, supermarket shopping, use of public services, self-service vending machines, on-campus activities, the college or university cafeteria, healthcare and settlement of traffic fines, among others. Consumers can settle the payment quickly and efficiently as long as they use UnionPay app, UnionPay mobile QuickPass and UnionPay QR code payment.UnionPay's convenience service network for mobile payment is now available in 100 model cities across China ,with the ability to use the payment option to pay for, among other things, clothing, food, accommodations, transportation, entertainment and shopping. The UnionPay app and UnionPay QR code payment is now available at more than 38,000 merchants in over 1,900 shopping malls as well as at 9,000 merchants on 318 college campuses. In terms of paying for public services, the payment option is available in over 300 cities across China for the settlement of more than 1,700 items including water, electricity and gas, while traffic violations in Tianjin and Shanghai can be settled on the spot with a direct payment via the UnionPay app. In the public transportation sector, UnionPay's mobile payment options, including the UnionPay app, has become the ubiquitous way to collect the fare in buses, subways and taxis, to pay for a plane ticket and to collect highway tolls.The "Chinese Convenience Project" promotes the universality of mobile paymentWhy is China rapidly taking the lead in mobile payments?This is mainly due to the Chinese central bank's "Mobile payment convenience demonstration project" as mentioned above and promoted by UnionPay and other major banks. The project is not just a commercial enterprise, but a project for the convenience of Chinese the people, with the mission of benefiting the populace at large under the aegis of the Chinese government and the support of the whole country.For these reasons, it is not surprising that China has taken the lead in the mobile payment era. In the next stage of development for the world's economy, China is ready and willing to step up to the plate and extend these benefits to the people of the world. View original content with multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/china-unionpay-china-takes-the-lead-in-piloting-mobile-payment-delivering-convenience-enhancing-solutions-to-its-populace-300677520.htmlSOURCE China UnionPayCONTACT: Shi Bu, Mob: 86 18600755825, Tel：86 10 64782682-606Load-Date: July 12, 2018End of Document

Tariff war heats up; Tires, tubes included in latest round of U.S.-China trade warTire BusinessSeptember 24, 2018Print VersionCopyright 2018 Crain Communications All Rights ReservedSection: Pg. 1; Vol. 36Length: 1432 wordsByline: Miles MooreDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Trump administration is moving forward with new tariffs on more than 5,700 products imported from China worth an estimated $200 billion, including virtually every type of tire.The tariffs will start at 10 percent beginning Sept. 24, then rise to 25 percent on Jan. 1, 2019.Most business sectors in the U.S., including the auto aftermarket, received the news with dismay, but some - such as the retreading industry - hailed the tariffs as a key protection against an onslaught of unfairly underpriced Chinese imports.The list of goods subject to tariffs compiled by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) totaled 5,745 tariff lines. The original list issued July 10 ran to 205 pages and contained 6,031 tariff lines.The revised list contains hundreds of tire- and rubber-related items, including:- Virtually every type of pneumatic tire, including passenger and light truck tires, truck and bus tires, trailer tires, racing tires, agricultural and forestry tires, construction and mining tires, motorcycle and bicycle tires, retreads and used tires, as well as solid tires and inner tubes;- A long list of rubber chemicals, synthetic rubber and polymers, and grades of natural rubber; and- Rubber auto and industrial parts including V-belts, conveyor belts, tubes, pipes and hoses.In announcing the new tariffs, the USTR said there was no change in Chinese trade policies from the administration's Section 301 investigative report released in March 2018.In that report, the USTR said it discovered that:- China uses joint venture requirements, foreign investment restrictions, administrative reviews and licensing processes to pressure U.S. companies into technology transfers.- China deprives U.S. companies of the ability to set market-based terms in technology-related negotiations.- China directs and facilitates investment in, and acquisition of, U.S. companies and assets to generate large-scale technology transfer.- China conducts and supports hacking into U.S. commercial computer networks to gain unauthorized access to business information.In its statement released Sept. 17, the USTR said setting tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods in July and August did not persuade China to change its unfair acquisition of U.S. intellectual property."Instead, China responded to the United States tariff action by taking further steps to harm U.S. workers and businesses," the agency said."In these circumstances, the president has directed the U.S. Trade Representative to increase the level of trade covered by the additional duties in order to obtain elimination of China's unfair policies," it said.In retaliation, China added $60 billion of U.S. products to its import tariff list."Contrary to views in Washington, China can - and will - dig its heels in," William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said in a statement. "We are not optimistic about the prospect for a resolution in the short term."Comments on the new tariffs were consistent with testimony before the USTR during six days of hearings, Aug. 20-24 and 27, when representatives of various sectors spoke for or against the proposed action.The Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association (MEMA), which testified against the tariffs, said it opposes using tariffs to curb intellectual property theft."The retaliatory tariffs announced on Monday could negate the Trump administration's recent successful work on behalf of American companies, such as tax reform," MEMA said.According to MEMA, the tariffs "will serve as a tax increase on the American public and consumers by increasing the costs of a new car or truck and of maintaining the hundreds of millions of vehicles currently on the roads."Matthew Shay, president and CEO of the National Retail Federation, agreed with MEMA that the tariffs constituted a tax on consumers."It's disappointing that, despite the voices of those impacted, the administration continues to advance harmful tariff policies that threaten to weaken the U.S. economy," Mr. Shay said."Every time this trade war escalates, the risk to U.S. consumers grows," he said.Jay Timmons, president and CEO of the National Association of Manufacturers, said the new tariffs would do more harm than good."Over the last year, manufacturers have delivered for our communities and our people, raising wages, building new plants and creating new jobs thanks to game-changing tax and regulatory reform," Mr. Timmons said. "But more U.S. tariffs and Chinese retaliation risk undoing that progress and moving our economy in the wrong direction."With every day that passes without progress on a rules-based, bilateral trade agreement with China, the potential grows for manufacturers and manufacturing workers to get hurt," he said. "No one wins in a trade war."Mike Ochs, director of government affairs at the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association (RVIA) testified during the hearings that tariffs will severely impact the sales of RVs. He said that is not what the USTR had in mind when it first proposed the tariffs."As USTR itself stated, remedies under this Act are supposed to eliminate the unfair trade practices of the Chinese government related to the forced transfer of U.S. technology and intellectual property," Mr. Ochs testified."The proposal to place a tariff on tires, propane tanks and steel and aluminum wheels from China achieves neither of these goals, while negatively affecting a healthy U.S. manufacturing sector."However, Elizabeth Brotherton- Bunch, digital media director for the Alliance for American Manufacturing, said Mr. Trump's reasoning for issuing tariffs was sound."China has consistently engaged in unfair trade practices and broken trade laws," Ms. Brotherton-Bunch said. "Chinese officials have done little to stop this. Even folks who disagree with some of Trump's trade moves agree that China is a big problem."The Tire Retread & Repair Information Bureau (TRIB) is a wholehearted supporter of the new tariffs. TRIB emailed copies of the USTR press release on the tariffs, as well as a link to its testimony before the USTR Aug. 20, in favor of the tariffs.The U.S. retreading industry offers safe, reliable and high-performing tires to domestic truck fleets, TRIB Managing Director David Stevens said in his testimony. It offers fleets a low-cost alternative to expensive new truck tires while delivering massive environmental benefits by saving natural resources, reducing carbon emissions and preventing scrap tires from being dumped in landfills, he said."However, this industry and its U.S. employees are under severe threat from low-cost, low-quality truck tires being imported from China," Mr. Stevens said.Since 2013, the compound annual growth rate for the replacement commercial truck tire market has been 5.4 percent, whereas the retreaded truck tire market shrunk by 2.1 percent annually during those years, he said.Joining TRIB in its support of the tariffs was Gene Walker of Farmingdale, N.Y.-based Premier Rubber Co., who also testified at the USTR hearings. Premier Rubber collects buffings from retread facilities across the U.S. to make playground surfacing and other recycled rubber goods.Cheap Chinese truck tires endanger Premier Rubber's business as much as they do its retreader suppliers, Mr. Walker stated.Between 2014 and 2017, the amount of buffings collected from retreaders fell roughly 9 percent to 178 million pounds, Mr. Walker said. "That decrease is the equivalent of 400 truckloads of buffings," he said.Mr. Walker also is a supporter of Retread Instead, an organization devoted to promoting and protecting retreads as an alternative to low-quality new truck tires.Retread Instead has conducted a letter-writing campaign to members of the U.S. Senate promoting tariffs against Chinese truck tires, Mr. Walker said.It also is working with members of the Senate Finance Committee to secure confirmation of President Trump's nominees to the International Trade Commission (ITC), he said.The ITC drew the ire of retreaders and allied businesses when in February 2017 it voted not to levy countervailing or antidumping tariffs against Chinese truck and bus tire imports, despite having done so with Chinese passenger, light truck and off-the-road tires.Passenger and light truck tires imported from China already are subject to anti-dumping and countervailing duties, dating back to July 2015. In some cases, the duties amount to more than 100 percent.Specialty trailer tires - a segment where China represents 90 percent or more of the market - were exempted from the duties imposed in 2015.Load-Date: September 27, 2018End of Document

Google employees question company's plans for Chinese search engineUPIAugust 16, 2018 Thursday 11:47 PM ESTCopyright 2018 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 256 wordsByline: RAY DOWNSDateline: Dec. 31 BodyAt least 1,400  employees signed a letter to company leaders demanding more transparency over a project the tech giant is working on that would be accepted by the Chinese government.The project is a search engine designed to comply with the Chinese government's censorship laws and Google employees said they need more information about the project to determine whether it raises any "urgent moral and ethical issues.""Currently we do not have the information required to make ethically-informed decisions about our work, our projects, and our employment," the employees said in the letter.In 2010, Google removed its search engine from the Chinese web over censorship. But in 2016, Google began developing a new search engine -- code-named Dragonfly -- to be more compliant with Chinese government demands."That the decision to build Dragonfly was made in secret, and progressed even with the [Artificial Intelligence] Principles in place makes clear that the Principles alone are not enough," the Google employees stated in their letter. "We urgently need more transparency, a seat at the table, and a commitment to clear and open processes: Google employees need to know what we're building."Although Google appears to be working on a search engine designed to comply with Chinese government censors, it's not yet clear if officials would accept it.In audio of a meeting with employees that was obtained by The New York Times, Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said the company was "not close to launching a search product in China."Load-Date: August 18, 2018End of Document

NETHERLANDS-BASED RIGHTS ACTIVIST AVOIDS REPATRIATION TO CHINAStates News ServiceJuly 5, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 782 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:A Chinese rights activist in exile appears to have won a last-minute reprieve after authorities in the Netherlands were preparing to repatriate him on Thursday , amid concerns that he was being sent back under a private agreement with Beijing.Ma Yongtao's removal process from the Netherlands came after he went suddenly incommunicado at the end of last month, amid reports that the Dutch authorities had rejected his asylum application.He later resurfaced in immigration detention, facing imminent removal from the country. Rights activists said they were concerned at the speed of his repatriation, and called on the international community to intervene."Ma Yongtao has been taken to the airport in preparation for his repatriation flight to China taking off at 5.00 p.m.," Netherlands-based exiled Chinese dissident Lan Zhansheng said via his Twitter account on Thursday .But he added: "Human rights organizations have become involved [in Ma's case] now, but it is still unclear whether he will be allowed to remain."Lan said the tweet would be his last on the case, as he was "withdrawing from involvement in this matter."The China Rights Observer group that Ma formerly worked for said via its Twitter account on Thursday evening that the repatriation would not be going ahead. The tweet said Ma's reprieve was "thanks to the efforts of Dutch human rights officials." Status still unclear However, Ma's ongoing immigration status in the Netherlands has yet to be clarified.Lan had told RFA in an earlier interview that Ma had initially arrived in the Netherlands two years ago, seeking political asylum, but hadn't been approved as a refugee.Ma reapplied the following year, and hadn't expected to be forcibly repatriated after a second rejection, Lan said."I suspect that the Dutch authorities may be in contact with the Chinese police, because the time-scale and procedures for repatriation are very unusual," he told RFA."Normally, people are notified about repatriation, but Ma Yongtao was suddenly taken away and never returned," he said. "Also, lawyers and human rights institutions are on vacation at this time of year."Meanwhile, Liu Xinglian, the Thailand-based secretary-general of the group China Human Rights Observer, issued an open letter urgently calling on the international community to intervene.He said Ma had previously worked closely with veteran jailed democracy activist Qin Yongmin at the organization.Qin, who is currently awaiting trial for "incitement to subvert state power" at the Wuhan No. 2 Detention Center, founded the group. Chinese Communist Party 'shenanigans ' He had been scheduled to stand trial in late December, but the date was postponed at the last minute by the authorities, who cited "procedural" reasons."In my opinion, this totally has a lot to do with shenanigans on the part of the Chinese Communist Party," Liu told RFA. "The Netherlands is basically a country that respects human rights, so it's very disappointing if they are now colluding with the Chinese government and trampling on human rights.""I feel as if we don't have much time, and that we should put pressure on the Dutch immigration authorities to put human rights first, and allow Ma Yongtao to remain in the Netherlands," he said.Online reports indicate that Ma hails from Langfang city in the northern province of Hebei, and served as the head of a village for eight years, where he began helping local residents to defend their rights.A former participant in the New Citizens' Movement founded by jailed dissident Xu Zhiyong, Ma also served as vice-chairman of Qin's China Rights Observer in 2012.He fled the country in 2016, and led a number of protests against Beijing's human rights record from the Netherlands.In a brief interview with RFA last year after a protest outside the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Ma accused the Chinese government of egregious human rights violations in its targeting of human rights attorneys and associated activists in a nationwide police operation targeting more than 300 people starting on July 9 , 2015."Two years ago, the Chinese Communist Party launched a crazed round of persecution of human rights lawyers and activists, and many people were sentenced on charges of subversion of state power, or incitement to subvert state power," Ma said at the time."Many of them remain behind bars to this day, and have been tortured, so we have gathered here ... to protest the Chinese authorities' oppression of prisoners of conscience," Ma said.

Chinese official: Beijing should target goods needed by USAssociated Press InternationalSeptember 17, 2018 Monday 9:39 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 584 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - One of China's most prominent figures in global finance says Beijing should press Washington to end their tariff battle by clamping down on exports of goods needed by American companies, according to news reports Monday.The comments by Lou Jiwei, a former finance minister and chairman of China's sovereign wealth fund, follow reports regulators are squeezing American companies by slowing down customs approvals and stepping up environmental and other inspections.Also Monday, an official newspaper called for more aggressive measures to "make American pain worse" following tariff hikes by both sides on $50 billion of each other's goods.Beijing is considering Washington's invitation last week to revive talks on their fight over Chinese technology policy and plans for state-led development of global champions in robotics and other fields. American officials say those violate Beijing's market-opening commitments and worry they might erode U.S. industrial leadership.Speaking Sunday at an economics forum, Lou said Beijing should disrupt supply chains of American companies that rely on China's vast manufacturing industries, the website Sina.com reported.China's "counterattack strategy needs to restrict exports to the United States as well as (imports of) U.S. goods," Lou was paraphrased as saying."Only knowing the pain of fighting will stop the war and cause (the United States) to negotiate seriously," said Lou.Lou was finance minister through 2016 and serves as chairman of China's 1.9 trillion yuan ($290 billion) National Social Security Fund, which manages assets of government pension plans. He is a former chairman of China's sovereign wealth fund, the China Investment Corp.The Chinese government said last week it welcomed Washington's proposal for more talks, though neither side has given any indication it is willing to compromise. Communist leaders see their industry plans as a path to prosperity and global influence.China wants talks based on "mutual trust," said a foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang. He didn't answer directly when asked whether Beijing would back out if U.S. President Donald Trump goes ahead with a proposed tariff hike on $200 billion of Chinese goods.If an increase goes ahead, "China will have to take necessary countermeasures," said Geng at a regular daily briefing.Chinese authorities have yet to confirm what steps aside from retaliatory tariffs they might take. But they have threatened "comprehensive measures" as Beijing runs out of imports for penalties due to its lopsided trade balance with the United States.Other commentators have suggested Beijing use its holdings of U.S. government debt or target American companies in China.The Global Times, published by the ruling Communist Party, warned that China sees the technology conflict as a long battle."China will choose the most favorable and powerful way to counterattack," said the newspaper, which is known for its nationalist and confrontational tone. "We are looking forward to a more beautiful counterattack that will make American pain worse."Sina and other outlets did not indicate whether Lou suggested specific products or industries Beijing might target.Last week, the American Chambers of Commerce in China and in Shanghai reported 52.1 percent of more than 430 companies that responded to a survey said Chinese authorities are subjecting them to "qualitative measures" including slower customs clearance and increased inspections and bureaucratic procedures.Load-Date: September 18, 2018End of Document

Baidu CEO Says Company Can And Will Beat Google In ChinaStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeAugust 11, 2018 SaturdayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: HI-TECH; Pg. 1Length: 414 wordsByline: Sandy MccarthyBodyGoogle is rumoured to be working on an Android search app for the Chinese market. Now, we know a little more about how Google intends to do that.Baidu shares [NASDAQ: BIDU] slid 8 percent on the news, which coincided with a second-quarter performance report that smashed expectations as net income rose 45 percent to CNY6.4 billion (USD938 million).The website is a Chinese-language web directory, that also provides updates on news, financial markets, cheap flights and hotels.Supposedly, Google has been collecting info about the search queries which redirect to Baidu, just to check if they would indeed, be censored. But, Google has access to the terms users search for on 265.com which is now hosted on its servers. Reports surfaced last week that Google is planning a censored search engine project for China via The Information. Some of the blacklisted searches include topics like Tiananmen Square massacre, freedom of speech, and so on. The Great Firewall restricts any content that is unfavourable to China's ruling communist party.Both Baidu and Google are search engine giants which also offer Cloud services while making huge investments in Artificial Intelligence for their growth.Whitmer Wins Democratic Primary In Governor's RaceEven before all the polls had closed in Northern Michigan, news outlets were calling it for the state Attorney General. Libertarian candidates were also on the primary ballot for the first time in MI history.However, Chinese tech firm Baidu said that if Google does re-enter the Chinese internet market, the USA business will not be number one.In an opinion piece and on social media posts on Monday, Chinese state media welcomed Google back to the country, so long as it follows the law, according to the South China Morning Post.San Francisco: As Google is trying to make a comeback in China with censored apps, its biggest rival in the country, Baidu, said it was prepared to take on the USA tech giant and defeat it, the media reported.Moreover, internet and human right activists aren't too pleased with Google's decision to toe the Chinese government's line on internet censorship. They reckon Google is "putting profits before human rights" and "setting a chilling precedent".While Google has drawn opposition for reportedly choosing to once again do business in authoritarian China, there are some people who are enthusiastic about the venture: leaders of the Chinese government. Baidu dominates the domestic search engine space now.Load-Date: August 12, 2018End of Document

The American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp is here. And the Brewer Group CEO, former NFL Star, Jack Brewer. Good morning.JACK BREWER, CEO, THE BREWER GROUP: Good to be here. Yes.BARTIROMO: Good to see you.MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION: Good to be here.BARTIROMO: Thanks for joining us.SCHLAPP: Of course.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Glad to be back. I miss you always.BARTIROMO: I missed you a lot this week.MCDOWELL: Well with this Google story, I'm glad I'm not sitting at home watching you screaming at the television at the top of my lungs like a lunatic.BARTIROMO: There was really upset. So much upset after the election at Google and, you know, it's amazing the emotion that came out. Crying and upset that, you know, things have changed so much and they don't know what's going to happen with the world -- with the world and the U.S. now. What's your take on it?SCHLAPP: Well my take was, you know, believe it or not there are republicans and democrats in America, I felt like that for eight years. And nobody gave me a puppy dog, nobody gave me something to draw.BARTIROMO: You didn't get a hug.SCHLAPP: They said -- they said, "Suck it up buttercup," right? And I don't understand why they can't just do the thing. Sometimes you lose.MCDOWELL: And since when did cuddling become part of corporate policy? Get over yourself.BARTIROMO: Get to work.MCDOWELL: Get to work. You're here for all Americans.BARTIROMO: It's really incredible. So we will -- we got that coming up.

House Financial Services Committee Chairman, Congressman Jeb Hensarling of Texas is here as well. And Coastal Carolina Head Football Coach Joe Moglia joins us as well giving us a sense of what's going on there with the hurricane slamming down.First though our top story this hour and that is the hurricane bracing for impact, Hurricane Florence set to slam into the Carolinas as a potentially catastrophic category two storm. That is downgraded overnight to category two. Kristina Partsinevelos is live this morning on the ground in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina with the very latest. Kristina, good morning to you.KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Yes. It's -- good morning Maria. You've said that it's been downgraded, so that means winds possibly up to a hundred and ten miles per hour. But that does not mean that this hurricane is going to cause massive damage.We're expecting slower storm and that's going to be the major part of it. You're going to see flooding, you're going to see a storm surge, so the waves climbing higher, pushing inwards, you're getting hit twice with water from that way.And the difference with this hurricane is that it's expected to move much slower across the coast. So that means possibly torrential rains on Saturday well into Sunday adding to that flooding. We -- when we arrived yesterday in the airport, everything was already shutdown, all the restaurants.We tried to look for food and get gas, everything was boarded up, only a few spots are still open. Officials here in the town order businesses to close up shops at 5:00p.m. Eastern Time yesterday. Some have decided to stay open tomorrow as -- well actually today because now we're heading into the morning.But late last night there was one Chinese shop around here still open, there are several people, there are several people, they're still opting to stay in town. Officials are saying only 60 percent of the population just within this area have evacuated.We met some people on the beach, there were some people swimming, you're seeing some palm trees behind me but it's going to get very dangerous in the next 24 hours with winds picking up as well as rain throughout the next few days. Throw it back to you.BARTIROMO: All right Kristina, thanks so much. Kristina Partsinevelos this morning. Joining us now on the phone is Myrtle Beach, South Carolina Mayor, Brenda Bethune. Mayor Bethune, thanks very much for calling in.What's your characterization of what's happening right now, should we be reading much into the fact that the storm was downgraded and tell us about the precautions you're taking to prepare for this storm?MAYOR BRENDA BETHUNE, MYRTLE BEACH, SOUTH CAROLINA (via telephone): We should absolutely not look at the fact that the storm is now categorized as a two. This is a massive hurricane with substantial winds, rains that could potentially last for days on end, as well a the storm surge. So, I really am concerned about people not taking this seriously.BARTIROMO: So what are you doing to prepare mayor?BETHUNE: We are as prepared as we can be at this point. The mandatory evacuation has been in place for days now and today it really is too late. If people are going to leave town, it really has to be this morning because after early afternoon we are going to start feeling the effects of tropical storm forced winds and rain and that it isn't safe to be driving under those condition.MCDOWELL: Mayor, it's Dagen McDowell. Do you have a sense of how many people, what percent of your residents did not evacuate? I heard you I think yesterday talking about that, have more people gotten in their cars and left Myrtle Beach?BETHUNE: Not a lot. And I say that because the traffic that -- has not been on the major road leaving town to prove it. So I think unfortunately we do have a lot of people who chose to try to ride this storm out and that is very concerning.SCHLAPP: Mayor, Matt Schlapp. Let me ask you this question, as you prepare for these storms it's the local officials that have the lead. Is there anything you need that you haven't gotten?BETHUNE: No. And everyone has just been incredible. I've had other cities reach out to us. The mayor of New Orleans called me yesterday, our Governor, Henry McMaster has been incredible just keeping in touch with just letting us know that he's there for us, all up to Vice President Pence and President Trump.So we are getting the support and I feel very confident and peaceful in the fact that we will also have the help to rebuild when we need it.BARTIROMO: Jack Brewer, you've done so much work in terms of recovery with your foundation regarding hurricanes, what's your question?BREWER: Yes. Ms. Mayor, your elderly population, it's always a big concern. I've been in several disaster areas and, you know, whenever these type of disasters come across, the elderly are usually the ones that get caught, you know, the most difficult to actually get to. Do you have any measures in place right now as you prepare to protect some of your senior population?BETHUNE: Yes, we did. We have been working all this week actually and one of the messages that we pushed is for people to take care of their neighbors especially their elderly neighbors.We have evacuated our medical facilities including nursing homes. So they are really one of the first group of people that we've thought to protect because in a lot of those cases they don't have people to take care of them.BARTIROMO: Right. And all Myrtle Beach businesses were required to shut down operations by 5:00 p.m. last night, right? I mean, did that occur? And how is the city helping those companies prepare for the fallout at this point?BETHUNE: Well, that actually was a little false news. They were not required to close by 5:00.BARTIROMO: OK.BETHUNE: We really don't know how that got started but it did. However, there have been --BARTIROMO: Have you encouraged them to -- have you encouraged them to shutdown operations? What have you told businesses?BETHUNE: At this point, I believe everything is shut down. This town is like a ghost town right now. Everything is boarded up, closed down. I really do think that the businesses this time took the storm seriously.BARTIROMO: And you're expecting landfall tomorrow, correct?BETHUNE: Starting tonight. The (INAUDIBLE) later this evening and last through tomorrow.BARTIROMO: OK. We'll be watching. Our thoughts with you, stay safe. Thanks very much Mayor Bethune.BETHUNE: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Appreciate your time this morning. OK, we'll check back.Coming up after the short break, playing defense, Facebook says it's better prepared to fight election meddling. What Mark Zuckerberg is now saying in a blog post about those efforts.Then a revealing reaction, watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RUTH PORAT, EXECUTIVE, GOOGLE: It is massive like kick in the gut that we are going to lose. What we all need right now is a hug.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: New video of Google executives at their meeting after the election responding to Donald Trump's victory. It is renewing calls of political bias this morning, that's coming up.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A gunman killing five people including his wife. Cheryl Casone has headlines now, Cheryl.CASONE: That's right Maria. Well the man first shot three people including his wife at a trucking company in Bakersfield, California. Then he went to a home and he killed two more.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONNY YOUNGBLOOD, SOUTH CALIFORNIA SHERIFF: Obviously, these are not random shooters. I'm pretty confident there will be a connection between all these players.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Later, the gunman killed himself when a deputy confronted him on a highway.Well, it is primary day here in New York and Governor Andrew Cuomo's campaign is still answering questions about a controversial flyer that was sent out about his opponent Cynthia Nixon. Official say a campaign worker created a mailer questioning Nixon's support for Jewish people.Well Nixon has two Jewish children and called the mailer sleazy demanding an apology from Cuomo. Cuomo has denied knowing about the mailer.And speaking of elections, Facebook says it is better prepared to protect the company's site from foreign interference. CEO Mark Zuckerberg publishing a post outlining what Facebook has done to prevent the kind of meddling that we saw in the 2016 presidential election.Russia being blamed for buying hundreds of Facebook ads as part of a campaign to sway American voters. Taking a look at shares of Facebook, higher in the premarket more than a quarter percent.And then finally there's this, a leaked video to Breitbart News shows Google executives consoling their colleagues after Donald Trump won the presidency in 2016.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SERGEY BERIN, FOUNDER, GOOGLE: I certainly find the selection deeply offensive and I know many of you do too.PORAT: It did feel like a ton of bricks dropped on my chest and what we all need right now is a hug.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Can I move to Canada?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is there anything positive you see from this election result?BERIN: Boy, that's a really tough one right now.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Well, President Trump has previously slammed Google for not displaying more positive news about him in its search result.The Google issued statements about this to Fox News saying, "At a regular scheduled all hands meeting, some Google employees and executives expressed their own personal views in the aftermath of a long and divisive election season for over 20 years. Everyone at Google has been able to freely express their opinions at these meetings.""Nothing was said at that meeting or any other meetings to suggest that any political bias ever influences the way we build or operate our products. To the contrary, our products are built for everyone, and we design them with extraordinary care to be a trustworthy source of information for everyone without regard to political viewpoint." And then they hugged it out Maria, back to you.BARTIROMO: Yes. That was an incredible video. Throughout the whole video I was just like, "Wow" watching this. Your thoughts on this video Matt?SCHLAPP: Well first of all, Breitbart deserves a lot of credit because the video is shocking Maria. But this comes on top of other reporting where a senior executive at Google is talking about how they use their search terms to try to increase turnout for Hillary Clinton in areas of the country where she was strong. So it's not just the fact that they're emotionalizing an election, they actually took steps to tip the scales.BARTIROMO: Yes. And they could because they're that big in terms of their outreach. They actually could.SCHLAPP: Uh-hmm.MCDOWELL: Stop acting like the cameras were in your home. This is a private conversation but instead they're having it in front of the entire company and I didn't hear anybody say and even being remotely reasonable or rational about President Trump and whatever policies he ran on that he has put in place to create a more stable economy in this country.This is hand wringing and sobbing and frankly even got the head of people saying that she's moving to Canada? It's just appalling. And by the way, don't act like this has -- don't act like we didn't watch the video and hear what you doggone said.BARTIROMO: Yes. And not only that but that last question saying anything good out of this. I don't know, let's look back. How about economic policies that generated two straight quarters of four percent plus economic growth?How about the fact that we're seeing increased in people's household income? Or perhaps some optimism about denuclearization across the world, I mean, it's pretty incredible.BREWER: Policy. Policy just does not matter to some of these people. I mean --BARTIROMO: They just didn't like him.BREWER: Yes. Can you imagine being the employee at Google who actually voted for President Trump? And all they do, they continue to raise bait, they continue to bring up whether it's gender and all these other social issues and it's ridiculous.I was just at the barber shop yesterday and I swear I listen to six different campaign ads and it was all race-baiting. It was all -- actually it was all democrats which really pisses me off because I'm a black man and it's just -- at some point we got to get past that. I'm just -- I'm sick and tired of it honestly.BARTIROMO: By the way, you mentioned any conservative that might work at Google or couple of months after that video, James Damore was fired.BREWER: Yes.MCDOWELL: Right. Again, they believe in free speech as long as that speech is in line with that they believe and think. It's not free, it's manufactured and it's managed speech.SCHLAPP: Yes. It's not an algorithm. That's the key.BARTIROMO: Well, humans create algorithms.SCHLAPP: That's right.BARTIROMO: The algorithm doesn't just come out of air. It was --SCHLAPP: And they would seem to like to manipulate them in some ways to help their friends and hurt their folks.BARTIROMO: Well you can't just say, "Oh yes, the algorithm did it." That's not --MCDOWELL: If you want -- if you want to whine and sob, keep it at home.BARTIROMO: By the way, there's a bigger, bigger issue here and that is this violence that is going on across the country.And why it is OK for Maxine Waters to come out and say, "Yes, I don't threat -- I didn't threaten that day, Trump supporters but I normally do threaten Trump supporters. And if you see anybody that support Trump, make sure to throw them out of the restaurant or tell them they're not -- they're not wanted." I mean, you're actually seeing this take place with actual violence.SCHLAPP: Well this is hard. Of course, my wife works for the president and we don't have a water's edge where you can have a political disagreement anymore. Back to your point, it's always the fact that you're a hater, you're a racist, you're evil.And I think that's a very dangerous thing for democracy. This is not really American, Americans are better than what the democrats are portraying us to be. And I think have to call this out because it will result to violence Maria and we're going to watch it happen. And so I think your comments are really need to be made.BARTIROMO: It's happening.SCHLAPP: Yes.BARTIROMO: We saw a Congressman get stabbed --SCHLAPP: That's right.BARTIROMO: -- this week. All right. We're going to take a short break, we got a lot coming up. Tell us what you think about that. Send us a tweet.Coming up, second chances, the White House offering China a new chance to talk. As American businesses feel the pinch of American tensions.Then more turmoil a Tesla's study about the electric carmaker's global finance head hitting the road as Elon Musk apologizes. We breakdown all the events at Tesla with a stock down one and a quarter of percent this morning, stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We are tracking Hurricane Florence this morning as it nears landfall. Fox News Senior Meteorologist, Janice Dean in the weather center right now. Janice, good morning to you.JANICE DEAN, FOX NEWS SENIOR METEOROLOGIST: Hi Maria. Yes. Category two but just a mild shy of being a major hurricane. The result of the storm remain the same yesterday when it was a cat four and that is catastrophic landfall of rain and wind and storm surge, all right?So let's take a look at it, this is the storm right now, advisory coming out at 8:00a.m. Were starting to see the outer band moving across the outer banks. Right now there's the radar and you could see the eye very we'll across the radar presentation.There's our future radar. So we were thinking that that were was a chance for the storm to stall. That's still a potential result. But this computer model shows a landfall sometime tomorrow morning and then lingering along the coast and that's why we have rainfall total in exes of 24, 36 inches of rain.And on top of that, we could see the potential of up to 13 feet of storm surge once the storm come to shore. But as we go through time, a little bit of disagreement there, the treat for stalling out, and flash flooding will the legacy of Florence. Doesn't matter what the category Back to you.BARTIROMO: That's a good point. All right. Thanks very much we'll be watching, we'll check back. Meanwhile potential trade opening, the Trump administration is issue an invitation to Chinese officials for another round of trade talks.National Economic Counselor Larry Kudlwo commenting on the potential break through yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNSELOR: There are some discussions and information that we receive that the Chinese government, the top of the Chinese government wished to pursue talks.And so we secretary Mnuchin who is the team leader at cam has apparently issued an invitation. I always believe in most cases, talking is better than no talking, so I regard this as a plus.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: And, of course, a survey by the American Chambers of Commerce in China and Shanghai found that two-thirds of American companies in say they have been hurt but the currently trade war.Joining us right now is ETF Trend CEO Tom Lydon. Tom, it's good to see you.TOM LYDON, CEO, ETF TREND: Great seeing you Maria.BARTIROMO: Has this impacted investor's sentiment?LYDON: Well it has. You know, everything's been pro-U.S., people have been moving away from investing overseas especially emerging markets, areas like China. However, Trump's done a good job as far as working out trade talks in Europe, in Mexico, in Canada.They're making some progress there but the Holy Grail is China. And with discussions of Hank Paulson, Jaime Dimon may be getting involved, increased confidence. We can see this move a little bit faster. We're seeing it in the markets. Chinese markets are up again today and after a 20 percent correction, that's pretty positive.BARTIROMO: So tell us what you see in the flows right now, how are people investing?LYDON: Yes. We've seen mostly pro-growth in the U.S. and that's been really, really important. However, factor investing has been come -- become more important than pure bait investing like buying the S&P500 at a very, very low expense ratio.So what happens now, some of the smart money, they're starting to shift into areas like value that's been underrated, areas like low volatility because anticipation of maybe the market returning to normal times volatility, normal market corrections, people are not wanting to exit the market but they want to be in in areas that maybe aren't as aggressive.SCHLAPP: Back on China, you know, it doesn't surprise me that the president has pushed through new NAFTA negotiations and as you said doing a good job with Europe. He's resetting that balance.But China's unique, it's the one country that the president believes is not just an economic threat, he believes they're national security threat, they use five different paths to try to out compete this unfairly on trade. Doesn't that make it awfully hard to get to a resolution like with these other partners?LYDON: It does. It's a lot tougher. However, when it comes to the markets, people look at the headlines and they want to look for positive news. Positive news equates to higher stock prices in those areas.And when you look at areas like China and other emerging markets, that's been the weakest area around the world this year. However, the values are there. You look at P ratios around 11 versus 18 here in the U.S.There's great value there and I think a lot of investors, there's a lot of smart money that's coming in where people are saying, "You know what, I think there's enough momentum where we're actually going to see some progress. And if we do, these undervalued stocks are going to take off."So we've seen $20 billion go into just a couple emerging market ETFs recently that's given us some confidence that they're going to work it out.MCDOWELL: Would you avoid manufacturers here? Reading into the Beige Book yesterday going by distribution, there's a lot of good news in there. But on prices, tariffs were reported to be contributing to rising input cause mainly for manufacturers.These are manufacturers here in the United States. Their input cause have been rising more rapidly than selling prices although they've increased efforts that manufacturers have to pass along cost hikes to customers. That is not good news for, number one, profits and manufacturing businesses or ultimately the consumers (INAUDIBLE)BARTIROMO: And it's an important question because the earnings backdrop has been what's driving this market. So you're seeing 25 percent profit growth, that's what's behind the stock market rally.BREWER: Yes.BARTIROMO: Does the profit story get impacted by the tariff issue?LYDON: Yes. So it's a great point. So look to midcap and small cap stocks that aren't as affected by tariffs, don't have as much of their business that's overseas.So there's some growth Invesco, midcap growth momentum ETF. PXMG is a great opportunity where it's up 28 percent so far this year and there's much -- not as much concern because most of the business is within the U.S., not as much affected by tariffs.So, when you're looking at your portfolio, you're concerned about tariffs, you're concerned about trade, and you don't have much allocated to midcap, small caps, make sure you're the first to buy in those areas.BARTIROMO: All right. So there's really a rotation that you see is coming. Tom, thank you.LYDON: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Tom Lydon joining us there. Coming up, breaking for impact, Hurricane Florence takes aim at the East Coast this morning. What you need to know about the potentially life-threatening storm coming up next.Then more changes at CBS to report, the head of the network's flagship 60 Minutes program is now out. We've got the details there, coming up.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Thursday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, September 13th, your top stories right now, 6:32 a.m. on the East Coast.Florence's fury, the Category 2 hurricane now, closing in on the Carolina coast, the hurricane downgraded last night, but FEMA is warning residents to be aware of just how dangerous this storm still is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEFF BYARD, ASSOCIATE ADMINISTRATOR, FEMA: It's a dangerous storm. We ask you to heed the warnings. Today is the day. This is going to be, you know, a Mike Tyson punch to the Carolina coast.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: We will have a live update from Atlantic Beach, North Carolina, this morning, coming up.Back to the table, China's commerce ministry, welcoming an offer to renew trade talks with the Trump administration, a Chinese spokesman saying that the escalation of trade conflicts does not benefit either side's interests.Markets, this morning, are fractionally higher. As you can see, Dow Industrials up 28 points right now, S&P 500 is up two and three quarters, and the NASDAQ is up 14, ahead of the open. This after the major indices eked out modest gains, yesterday. It was a fractional move across the board. Dow Industrials up 28 points, but the NASDAQ down 18, last night.In Europe this morning, take a look at the indices, they are mixed, with the FT 100 down a third of a percent, 26 points lower, but the DAX Index in Germany, up almost a half of a percent, 52 points higher. Reports out this morning that the Bank of England is expected to keep interest rates at 0.75 percent, most likely until Britain leaves the European Union, that's expected in 2019.Meanwhile, the European Central Bank is set to cut back on its bond-buying program, all of the details out of the central bank action this morning, coming up.Easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, so the Asian markets, all up overnight, Hong Kong, the best performer of 2-1/2 percent, as you can see.Another black eye for CBS, 60 Minutes Executive Producer, Jeff Fager, pushed out of the company, leaving after a damning text messages sent from him to a reporter. That text was made public, details coming up this morning, on that.And more troubles for Tesla, the automaker losing another key executive, plus, the moves the company is making to try to turn a profit, this quarter.All those stories coming up, but first this, Hurricane Florence is hurling towards the United States coast right now. It has been downgraded to a Category 2 from 4, but a potentially life-threatening storm surge still remains. FOX News Correspondent, Griff Jenkins, is live this morning at Atlantic Beach, North Carolina, with the very latest, Griff, good morning to you.GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria, we are on the bridge to Atlantic Beach. You can see behind us, it's a ghost town, at 7:00 a.m., this bridge closes. And look, there's no one on here. Interestingly enough, there's actually no police stopping folks.But, you know, even though this is downgraded for the folks here, in north eastern Carolina, it is unbelievably still dangerous because the storm surge is still the same, 9 to 13 feet, the water under this bridge is less than 13 feet, easily, by anybody's measure, and it could be flooded even in a good rain, this floods here.And, of course, the excessive rainfall, they are expecting some 30 to 40- inches. The inland is absolutely expected to flood for days, if not weeks. They are going to lose power, and power lines are going to be down. And we talked to one resident, a life-long resident of Atlantic Beach, named Tim Bowen, he said because of that flooding threat, he's actually going to stay on the island, take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TIM BOWEN, RESIDENT OF ATLANTIC BEACH, NORTH CAROLINA: Well, you got to be concerned, you know, I mean, but my issue was, if I go inland, it's still going to be flooding. I feel like I've got a better place to go here on the second floor than I did, inland. So, I just made that decision. But if it had still been a 4 this morning, I was going to go bug out.(END VIDEO CLIP)JENKINS: Little bit of context, Maria, two years ago, Hurricane Matthew came on as a Cat 1 but the excessive flooding, 28 lives were lost during Hurricane Matthew, and their worried about what's coming here. The law enforcement folks here, the chief of the fire chief, we talked to earlier, he told us, he said, look, at this point, if you get in trouble, no one is coming for you. Maria?BARTIROMO: All right, Griff, thanks very much, Griff Jenkins, this morning, in Atlantic Beach. Joining us now to discuss what's being done to help residents before and after the storm hits, Cuthbert Langley is the Director of Communications for the American Red Cross, Palmetto, South Carolina region.Thanks very much for joining us. What are you seeing in terms of preparedness and what people need right now?CUTHBERT LANGLEY, DIRECTOR OF COMMUNICATIONS FOR THE AMERICAN RED CROSS: Good morning. Right now, we know folks are heeding the evacuation orders, especially here, in South Carolina. Last night, more than 1,300 people spent the night in about 30 evacuation shelters throughout South Carolina.We have got crews that are continuing to come in to Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina as well. About 1,500 disaster workers are either on their way or here on the ground in South Carolina and really up to Virginia.So the Red Cross really is working around the clock, right now, to mobilize those supplies, to get food and water into those shelters and work with folks who are evacuating.BREWER: Cuthbert, this is Jack Brewer here, is your bigger -- biggest issue right now, going to be the loss of power? You know, we just -- we've been looking at so many people trying to evacuate and it sounds like a lot of those folks have stayed in their homes.What do you have planned on doing to try to, you know, compensate for the loss of power, as the storm surges come through?LANGLEY: Absolutely. Well, for the last several days, and really throughout hurricane season, we've really been preaching preparedness and this storm is showing why that's so important. We want people to get those disaster kits ready so (INAUDIBLE) so we want them to heed those evacuation orders.But if they stay, they're going to want to get those non-perishable foods, they're going to want to get water, want to get a battery-operated NOAA radio, all of those important documents in your home as well that you may need, those are so important.So, we really are urging people to heed the evacuation order. We hope folks are preparing and they can also do that by downloading the Red Cross emergency app, this really is everything that you need to know to prepare for any, sort of, natural disaster right there on your cell phone.So we are urging people to follow the orders and hoping that they are preparing as well.MCDOWELL: Just one thing I wanted to point out, so people can understand, why some people or many people might not evacuate. I'm not talking about people right on the ocean or right on the intercostal waterway, but these are people who are not rich folks, they can't afford and get in their car and be gone for weeks on end, staying in a motel or --BARTIROMO: Yes, where are they going?MCDOWELL: -- hotel somewhere, number one. Number two, and it is very confusing but the way that these storm tracks are reported. You tell people to just drive west, I heard that from the mayor of New Bern, North Carolina earlier today, but west, where?Because the track of the storm changes and then you basically put people in harm's way because they are in an area inland that gets flooded. And they have to worry about getting back to their homes. They can't get back while their home gets looted.So, I'm just trying to put in perspective, knowing this part of the country, so well, growing up near there. That there is -- that people aren't irrational, that they make these decisions quite rationally, in some instances.LANGLEY: Sure. The Red Cross is going to be here to support folks who need it. We've got those evacuation shelters that are set up throughout the state. We're staying in really close partnership with different agencies around the state and federally, as well.So, again, we have more than 30 evacuation shelters opened here in South Carolina. And the bottom line, the Red Cross is going to be here. We, too, are keeping a very close eye on the storm and we are going to keep bringing in supplies to people and be on the ground for as long as we are needed, even after the storm for whatever folks are going to need.BARTIROMO: So, what's your capacity? How much can you handle?LANGLEY: We have an awesome network of volunteers, 64,000 disasters is the number that we respond to every year, so we are continuing to stay in very close contact with our volunteers. I have seen folks coming in here from South Carolina -- to South Carolina from Los Angeles, across the country.So we are pulling in our volunteers, we have supplies and items. And if folks want to help us out in this effort, they can text the word, Florence, to 90999, that'll be a $10.00 donation, really, financial donations are the best way to help the Red Cross right now, as we continue to see what Hurricane Florence brings to North Carolina and South Carolina.BARTIROMO: Because we just -- Matt, you asked some important question during the break. We really don't know where this goes, yes, it's been downgraded, but it can also gain steam, right? It can be upgraded at some point too. We don't know.LANGLEY: We're keeping -- yes, we are keeping a very close eye on the storm, you know, I grew up here in Charleston, I was 16 weeks old when Hurricane Hugo hits, sleeping in my parents' laundry room. And we were out of power for several weeks.So you really don't know what a hurricane is going to do, which is why it's why it's so important that people are preparing their homes and preparing their families for whatever comes their way.BARTIROMO: All right, thanks very much. Cuthbert Langley --LANGLEY: Thank you.BARTIROMO: for joining us, we'll be watching, thank you.Coming up, more changes at CBS, the head of the network's flagship program, 60 Minutes, now on his way out, we've got the details there.And then more turmoil at Tesla, the electric carmaker's global finance head, hits the road as well, Elon Musk is apologizing. We've got the very latest after this break, stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Another executive ousted at CBS, Cheryl Casone with details now and headlines, Cheryl.CASONE: Maria, Jeff Fager, the Executive Producer of "60 Minutes" and one- time Chairman of CBS News has been fired, according to CBS News President David Rhodes. The (INAUDIBLE) CBS employee says that Fager's contract was terminated for reasons not directly related to recent allegations of sexual misconduct. Fager said that he was let go for sending a harsh text message to a CBS reporter investigating those claims. The text reportedly said: "Be careful, there are people who lost their jobs trying to harm me and if you pass on these damaging claims without your own reporting to back them up, that will become a serious problem." Well, Fager's departure comes after CBS CEO Les Moonves resigned of over more than a dozen allegations of sexual misconduct. Let's take a look at the stocks. Shares of CBS actually down six percent, so far, this year. A lot of issues with the corporation itself as well.Well, Verizon is preplacing its media and advertising chief, you know him, Tim Armstrong, the COO of Verizon is going to assume that CEO role next month. Armstrong is the former CEO of AOL and he was overseeing Verizon's ad business but that business remains one of the company's least profitable division right now. Shares of Verizon are up three percent so far this year.All right. Now, to Tesla. Losing another top executive, Justin McAnear, the company's Vice President of Worldwide Finance and Operations, stepping down to taking CFO role at another company. This departure coming just days after Tesla's chief accounting officer quit with less than one month on of job -- head of H.R. also quit. Meanwhile, CEO Elon Musk failing to respond more quickly to address customer's needs. He said it's going to be a new priority, some Model 3 buyers say they are frustrated by lack of communication from Tesla when it comes to the delivery delay that they're saying. Tesla shares are lower ahead of opening bell; down more than 1-1/4 percent right now.Meanwhile, Musk's Boring Company has received the go ahead to build a revolutionary new garage. The Hawthorne California City Council has given approval to connect passenger cars to the entrepreneur's underground hyperloop. According the Mercury News, the company recently bought a private home next to the one-mile underground tunnel that's already built. This is all near the SpaceX campus, we should add. The garage at the home would connect to the tunnel. Musk tweeted about this: "Boring Company will transport your car all the way into your garage. First Boring Brick store opening in about two months. Only $0.10 a brick. Rated for California seismic loads. Bricks will be free if used for affordable housing projects." No word on the garage is going to be built, Maria, and also not one. Back to you.BARTIROMO: Yes. Interesting stuff.CASONE: Yes.BARTIROMO: Continues to innovate despite the issues that Elon Musk is having.(LAUGHTER)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's creative, I will give him that.BARTIROMO: Yes, he sure is.MCDOWELL: If he sold that stock or stop working for that company just because he smoked marijuana on camera, then you've been sleeping -- basically, sleeping in the basement in the last two years.BREWER: That's where I came up with all these great ideas.(LAUGHTER)MCDOWELL: I mean, if you thought, oh, that was the exclamation point to say -- oh, he's really erratic, come on!(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: Yes.BREWER: I mean, think about it, to come up with that, I mean, that's --BARTIROMO: That's a great idea.(LAUGHTER)MCDOWELL: Well, he's doing too much, he's trying to do too much. And that's been a chronic problem --UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And sometimes, you don't want the erratic, creative guy running the company. You know, there's a different role for that.BARTIROMO: Yes, we'll see if that role changes soon. All right, we'll take a break. When we come back, Apple is unveiling its biggest and priciest iPhone ever; more on the new models, coming up right after this break.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Apple revealing a new stunning new watch that has your health in mind. The new device equipped with an FDA approved EKG -- the heart monitor that will communicate with your doctor.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If your heart is beating in a normal rhythm, the app will classify the measurement as sinus rhythm, and the app will also classify atriul fibrillation. All ECG recordings, their classifications, the noted symptoms, they're all stored right in the health app in a PDF. You can share it with your doctor. So, now, your doctor has a detailed picture of your heart rhythm, similar to a (INAUDIBLE) ECG that is usually only obtained in a clinic.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is End Point Technologies Associate Founder, Roger Kay. Roger, good to see you, thanks so much for joining us.ROGER KAY, ASSOCIATE FOUNDER, END POINT TECHNOLOGIES: Good morning, Maria.BARTIROMO: So, one of the many upgrades to this new Apple watch. Obviously, Apple and a number of technology companies are going knee-deep into health care, your thoughts on what this kind of new revenue could generate and what it means for Apple?KAY: Well, yes, Maria, I think of the various announcement that the watch was the most interesting one. I think they framed it that way as well. Apple liked to have one real marquee even in its announcements where people go oh, awe, I didn't know, something like that could happen. And the difference here is that, they have the FDA approval, so it's sort of a hardened application. It's ready for field use and it's very likely to expand the popularity of the watch beyond its initial usage is kind of an interesting thing to keep track of various things instead of your phone. And now it will be -- it will be an actual medical device, so they can start talking to a whole group of seniors, hopefully not me yet, you know, but a number of other people who may now use that watch.BARTIROMO: So, what was your take away of the whole new reveal? I mean, a whole new line of iPhones, larger screens, longer battery life?KAY: Yes. Well, it's very much in line with what Apple has done before, so the phones are a bit more expensive, they have greater capability, they're larger. OK. So, one of my favorite quotes of all time from when I was working with the Wall Street Journal, I talked to Don Clark, because (INAUDIBLE), I said nobody wants to hold a ham sandwich up to the side of his head, which is, I really like that.But it turned out that wasn't true, that was like, at least a decade ago. It turned out that small phones have actually gotten big and everybody actually does likes to hold a whole huge thing up to the side of their heads sometimes, or they just talk into it, when it's in front of them. So, that wasn't really a problem.Frankly, I think one of the most interesting things about this is what's under the hood, the seven-nanometer processor is actually quite interesting, because no one else yet has a seven-nanometer phone out there. So, I think that's quite something, that's one of the ways that they get the extended battery life and higher performance, so you don't see that necessarily except that it just works better.MCDOWELL: Maria, just wanted to point out one thing which is something a thread that you cover every day, every time you talk to a technology executive is the world is wide open in terms of medical technology. And I'm -- I don't have the vision to see into the future with what might do with this technology that this -- your watch becomes medical device that can track a lot more than just an EKG or your heart beat. Again, that opens up a whole new world not just in terms of seniors, but in terms of the medical community and really turning this into a life-saving device potentially. Plus, it's right in the wheel house of their push toward services, the current revenue stream.BARTIROMO: Yes, and that's been the trend for technology now for a couple of years. Google is also going very, very deep into health care right now. And it's all good, I mean, it's really important.BREWER: Roger, this is Jack Brewer. As you see Apple continue to evolve in their technologies, obviously, you know, there's a lot of various patents and patent infringement, you know, really hazards for Apple, what do you see in that regard?BARTIROMO: Real quick, Roger?KAY: Right. OK. So, right, so they're in a world-wide battle Qualcomm. I think one of the issues for Apple is that they may miss the boat on 5G, which is the generation of cell technology because Qualcomm is all over that, and they're currently locked in battle with that in various environment.BARTIROMO: All right. Roger, great to see you. Thanks so much. Roger Kay. We'll be right back. Hurricane Florence is taking aim at the East Coast. We've got what you need to know about the potentially life- threatening storm, next hour right here in MORNINGS WITH MARIA.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thank so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. It is Thursday, September 13th. Your top stories right now, 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast. Florence is taking aim today.

Strategic approaches to negotiation with ChinaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 16, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 843 wordsBody China does not adapt to the times but leads them. Negotiating with China leads to a permanent challenge, given the cultural and consumer differences between both countries. On July 9, the negotiations rounds of the Free Trade Agreement with China began, a scenario in which both countries agree reciprocal concessions of tariff preferences and reduction of non-tariff barriers to trade in goods and services, which will facilitate the relevant insertion in the economic future of the country.  President Xi Jinping will make his fourth trip to Latin America in November, including Panama, revealing the importance that Chinese diplomacy attaches to its regional positioning. China develops a strategy of rapprochement in the region through the signing of FTAs ??with Chile, Peru and Costa Rica and it is possible that it will advance with Colombia and Ecuador. Chinese foreign policy is defined in a mixture of gradualism and rapidity, since its millenary culture conditions its special bond with time, for that reason Chinese leaders have a long-term patient look.  To date there are 23 agreements between Panama and China, backed by a Mixed Commission revealing the intention of a strategic partnership between countries that share a common history of more than 160 years ago, because the traditional exchange, not only as the second user of the Canal but as a supplier of the Colon Free Zone. A strategic client of Panamanian ports in the logistics field. To such an extent that without diplomatic relations, Panama was listed as China&#39;s fifth commercial partner in the region.  For China, the geographical location of Panama is determined by its connectivity with an expanded Canal between large oceans, a strategic position in the region that is the gateway to and from the Atlantic. But after a year of diplomatic relations, the Panamanian government initiates trade negotiations inspired by the potential of services convinced to play in the major leagues of international trade.  The Chinese Government values ??the logistic conditions of Panama, last year, the country imported Chinese goods and services for $ 1,344 million, from high technology to food products, while exporting products worth $ 42.6 million in scrap, crustaceans, wood and coffee, among others, so an FTA should open opportunities for the export of pineapple, melon, meat and chicken, among others.  Trade negotiations with China is not a race of speed but of resistance, with a dose of patience it will be possible to achieve profitable results for the country. Let&#39;s not forget that Chile took four years of NAFTA negotiations with China. Innovation and openness go hand in hand, these negotiations will open opportunities, but caution must be exercised without immediacy, since it requires safeguards to national agriculture, agreements on services, investments, competition policies, rules of origin, financial services, telecommunications , intellectual property, technical cooperation, tourism, electronic commerce, labor issues, environmental provisions, defensive mechanisms and dispute resolution.  It is important to note that the Chinese Foreign Ministry now has technicians trained in the United States and Europe, with extensive negotiating experience and a high degree of specialization in each of the matters negotiated in an FTA. As we know China does not negotiate by ideology, nor by sympathy, but with pragmatism and in function of its strategic interests. China ponders interpersonal relationships because they generate trust and empathy, because mutual knowledge and links offer long-term opportunities.  The Panamanian negotiating team must resort to the expertise of trade diplomacy where negotiators arm themselves with patience andfirmness. While the Panamanian Government will have to align the institutional vision by agreeing objectives with the private sector to define negotiation points; even to know about the experience of Costa Rica regarding the negotiation as implementation of the FTA.  The learning of the Chinese market is not easy and the Panamanian businessmen will need to adopt better practices to do business, because the FTA with China implies an aggressive program that implies the development of competitiveness oriented to develop capacities to bring very competitive products with high added value. Therefore, it will have to be handled with prudence given the asymmetries that exist between Panama and China.  We should not be overwhelmed by China&#39;s vertiginous global expansion in Latin America, but it is necessary to balance the costs and benefits of the FTA with the second world economy, not only because of the low tariffs that Panamanian products could receive, but also that it will be necessary to determine what would be the areas in which Panama can make concessions. It will be important to acquire a favorable relationship to the transfer of technology as an increase in the flow of investments, to such an extent that Panama can advantageously enter the 21st century.  ATTORNEY AND INTERNATIONAL ANALYST Load-Date: July 17, 2018End of Document

PRESS: China Changes Mind About Letting In Facebook, Revoking ApprovalLive Briefs PRO Global MarketsJuly 26, 2018 Thursday 5:14 AM ESTCopyright 2018 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 271 wordsBody Hours after Facebook Inc announced plans to open an "innovation hub" in China on Wednesday, the government has reportedly withdrawn its approval of the social network.Earlier this week, a Chinese business-registration website showed that Facebook - which has been blocked in China for a decade - had registered a subsidiary in the eastern city of Hangzhou.A Facebook spokeswoman said Tuesday the company was planning to open an innovation hub for Chinese developers and startups, similar to projects in Brazil, France, India and South Korea.The same day, however, Facebook's registration of its USD30 million Hangzhou subsidiary was taken down from the central government website. State media reports about the innovation hub appear to have been censored.A person familiar with the matter told the New York Times on Wednesday the Chinese government decided to withdraw Facebook's registration due to disagreements between local officials and the national internet watchdog, the Cyberspace Administration of China.The world's largest social network has been blocked in China since 2009. Beijing also bans many other international websites including Google, Twitter, YouTube, news websites such as the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal as well as human rights websites documenting issues deemed sensitive by the Chinese government.Google has more recently made inroads into the Chinese market by opening an artificial intelligence centre and launching a game. Facebook also launched a photo-sharing app called Colorful Balloons in China last year, which was apparently not government-approved and was eventually taken down.Load-Date: July 27, 2018End of Document

Chinese state pushes back against widespread outrage over vaccine crisisCNN.comJuly 24, 2018 Tuesday 9:19 AM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: ASIALength: 990 wordsByline: By Ben Westcott and Serenitie Wang, CNNBodyThe Chinese government is turning to censorship and appeals for calm, amid mounting public anger following revelations earlier this week that one of the country's largest vaccine makers had violated safety standards.Furor about the faulty vaccines, an estimated 250,000 of which may have been administrated to children, has continued to dominate Chinese social media, further eroding public trust in essential services.There are also suggestions the scandal could affect China's standing overseas as the country tries to position itself as a major player in the global pharmaceutical industry.On Tuesday, the chairperson of the company at the center of the scandal, Gao Junfang of Changchun Changsheng Biotechnology, was detained, along with 14 other people involved in the case, according to an official police statement.The swift actions of the police have so far done little to quell the outcry. Outside the Capital Institute of Pediatrics in Beijing, one of the country's premier children's hospitals, one parent told CNN the company had "no conscience" and the government needed to regulate more strictly.Another parent, Peng Yubin, said he was considering using foreign vaccines for his child. "Even though they are more expensive, they are better," he said.Several days on from the initial news, there is still no official information regarding how many children may have been injected with the questionable vaccines or what effect they may have.In an article published Tuesday, state-owned China Daily quoted experts calling for "a rational attitude" towards immunization, saying the faulty diphtheria and tetanus vaccines (DPT) "won't harm people's health." Similarly, the official newspaper of the Communist Party, the People's Daily, ran an interview with an expert alleging the vaccines were "safe," just ineffective.

Chinese state pushes back against widespread outrage over vaccine crisisCNN WireJuly 25, 2018 Wednesday 10:07 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1005 wordsByline: By Ben Westcott and Serenitie Wang, CNNDateline: (CNN) Body (CNN) --  The Chinese government is turning to censorship and appeals for calm, amid mounting public anger following revelations earlier this week that one of the country's largest vaccine makers had violated safety standards.Furor about the faulty vaccines, an estimated 250,000 of which may have been administrated to children, has continued to dominate Chinese social media, further eroding public trust in essential services.There are also suggestions the scandal could affect China's standing overseas as the country tries to position itself as major player in the global pharmaceutical industry.On Tuesday, the chairperson of the company at the center of the scandal, Gao Junfang of Changchun Changsheng Biotechnology, was detained, along with 14 other people involved in the case, according to an official police statement.The swift actions of the police have so far done little to quell the outcry. Outside the Capital Institute of Pediatrics in Beijing, one of the country's premier children's hospitals, one parent told CNN the company had "no conscience" and the government needed to regulate more strictly.Another parent, Peng Yubin, said he was considering using foreign vaccines for his child. "Even though they are more expensive, they are better," he said.Several days on from the initial news, there is still no official information regarding how many children may have been injected with the questionable vaccines or what effect they may have.In an article, state-owned China Daily quoted experts calling for "a rational attitude" towards immunization, saying the faulty diphtheria and tetanus vaccines (DPT) "won't harm people's health," while the official newspaper of the Communist Party, the People's Daily, ran an interview with an expert alleging the vaccines were "safe," just ineffective. Evidence in support of these claims has yet to be provided by authorities.State Drug Administration Deputy Director Xu Jinghe was interviewed on state-owned CCTV in an attempt to calm public concerns, but the footage provoked scorn, with social media users mocking Xu's expensive, blue Burberry polo shirt and stilted answers.One Weibo user reprimanded Xu for his choice of clothes: "Improper dressing for such an occasion."

Global Antimony Market Analysis & Forecast to 2023 by Product Type, Application, End-Use Industry and Region - Environmental & Health Concerns Restricting GrowthPR NewswireJuly 11, 2018 Wednesday 8:15 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1244 wordsDateline: DUBLIN, July 11, 2018 BodyThe"Antimony Market by Product Type (Trioxides, Alloys), Application (Flame Retardants, Plastic Additives. Lead-Acid Batteries, Glass & Ceramics), End-Use Industry (Chemical, Automotive, Electrical & Electronics), and Region - Global Forecast to 2023"report has been added toResearchAndMarkets.com'soffering.The antimony market size is projected to reach USD 2.37 billion by 2023, at a CAGR of 6% between 2018 and 2023.The growth of the antimony market can be attributed to the increasing use of antimony in the chemical industry. In the chemical industry, antimony is prominently used in flame synergist, catalyst, and stabilizer. The automotive industry is the second-largest end-use industry of antimony. Antimony is used in lead acid batteries in the automotive sector.The antimony market has been segmented on the basis of type, application, end-use industry, and region. Based on type, the antimony market has been classified into antimony trioxide (ATO), alloys, and others. The others segment includes antimony sulfides, sodium antimonite acetate, and ignots. Antimony trioxide is estimated to dominate the overall antimony market between 2018 and 2023. Antimony trioxide is the most common and important form of the antimony compounds and is primarily used in flame retardant applications. It is also used as catalyst and stabilizer in PET and polyvinylchloride (PVC) production, respectively.Based on application, the antimony market has been classified into flame retardants, lead acid batteries, plastic additives, refining agent, and others. Flame retardant and plastic additives applications together account for 81%, in terms of volume, share of the overall market in 2017. However, the use of antimony in automotive lead acid batteries is declining owing to the shift towards maintenance-free batteries in developed economies. The other applications include pigment, bearing metal, solders, ammunition, cable covering, medicines, and semiconductors.Based on end-use industry, the antimony market has been segmented into chemical, automotive, electrical & electronics, and others. The chemical industry dominates the overall antimony market. In the chemical industry, antimony is prominently used as flame synergist, catalyst, and stabilizer. It is used as a flame retardant in halogenated and non-halogenated polymers and also in paints and coatings. Antimony is also used as a catalyst in the production of polyester resins for fibers and film and in the esterification of high-molecular-weight PET resins and fibers.APAC is the largest market for antimony. The market in the region is driven by the high demand in flame retardant, plastic additives, and automotive lead acid batteries applications. In APAC, China, Australia, Tajikistan, and Myanmar are the major producers of antimony. The largest reserves of antimony are found in China. Around 70% of antimony is produced by China. The Chinese government is continuously tightening environmental regulations and beefing up its monitoring capabilities regarding antimony production, import, and export.AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group (Netherland), Mandalay Resources (Canada), United States Antimony Corporation (USAC) (US), Korea Zinc (South Korea), Recyclex (France), Nihon Seiko (Japan), Umicore (France), and Hunan ZhongNan Antimony & Tungsten Trading Co., Ltd. (China) are the key players operating in the antimony market. These players offer a wide range of antimony to strengthen their competitive position and cater to the growing demand for antimony from various end-use industries.United States Antimony Corporation (US) is one of the major players in the antimony market. The company is focused on expanding its market share by expanding its production capacity to gain a competitive edge over other players in the antimony market.Key Topics Covered1 Introduction1.1 Objectives of the Study1.2 Market Definition1.3 Market Scope1.3.1 Years Considered for the Study1.4 Currency1.5 Stakeholders2 Research Methodology2.1 Research Data2.1.1 Secondary Data2.1.1.1 Key Data From Secondary Sources2.1.2 Primary Data2.1.2.1 Key Data From Primary Sources2.1.2.2 Key Industry Insights2.1.2.3 Breakdown of Primary Interviews2.2 Market Size Estimation2.2.1 Bottom-Up Approach2.2.2 Top-Down Approach2.3 Data Triangulation2.4 Research Assumptions2.5 Limitations3 Executive Summary4 Premium Insights4.1 Attractive Opportunities in the Antimony Market4.2 Antimony Market, By Application4.3 Antimony, By End-Use Industry and Region4.4 Antimony Market, By Product Type4.5 Antimony Market, By Country5 Market Overview5.1 Introduction5.2 Market Dynamics5.2.1 Drivers5.2.1.1 Increasing Fire Safety Regulations5.2.1.2 Growing Use in Plastic Additive Application5.2.2 Restraints5.2.2.1 Environmental and Health Concerns Restricting the Growth of Antimony Market5.2.2.2 High Prices of Antimony5.2.2.3 Declining Use of Antimonial Lead5.2.2.4 Reduced Production in China5.2.3 Opportunities5.2.3.1 Exploration of Newly Discovered Antimony Reserves5.2.3.2 Recycling of Antimony5.2.4 Challenges5.2.4.1 Overcoming Geopolitical Tensions5.3 Porter's Five Forces Analysis5.3.1 Bargaining Power of Suppliers5.3.2 Bargaining Power of Buyers5.3.3 Threat of New Entrants5.3.4 Threat of Substitutes5.3.5 Intensity of Competitive Rivalry6 Antimony Market, By Product Type6.1 Introduction6.2 Trioxides6.3 Alloys6.4 Others7 Antimony Market, By Application7.1 Introduction7.2 Flame Retardants7.3 Lead-Acid Batteries7.4 Plastic Additives7.4.1 Stabilizers7.4.2 Catalysts7.5 Glass & Ceramics7.6 Others8 Antimony Market, By End-Use Industry8.1 Introduction8.2 Chemical8.3 Automotive8.4 Electrical & Electronics8.5 Others9 Antimony Market, By Region9.1 Introduction9.2 North America9.2.1 US9.2.2 Canada9.2.3 Mexico9.3 Europe9.3.1 Belgium9.3.2 France9.3.3 Russia9.3.4 Turkey9.3.5 Rest of Europe9.4 Asia Pacific9.4.1 China9.4.2 Japan9.4.3 South Korea9.4.4 Rest of APAC9.5 South America9.5.1 Brazil9.5.2 Peru9.5.3 Argentina9.5.4 Rest of South America9.6 Middle East & Africa9.6.1 South Africa9.6.2 UAE9.6.3 Saudi Arabia9.6.4 Rest of Mea10 Company Profiles10.1 AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group10.2 Mandalay Resources Ltd10.3 United States Antimony Corporation10.4 Korea Zinc10.5 Recyclex10.6 Nihon Seiko Co., Ltd.10.7 Umicore10.8 Hunan Chenzhou Mining Group Co., Ltd10.9 Huachang Antimony Industry10.10 Geopromining, Ltd.10.11 Consolidated Murchison Mine10.12 Belmont Metals10.13 American Elements10.14 Tri-Star Resources PLC10.15 Amspec Chemical Corporation10.16 Lanxess10.17 Hsikwangshan Twinkling Star Co.

China struggles to curb its reliance on US buyers, suppliersAssociated Press Financial WireAugust 28, 2018 Tuesday 1:05 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 1121 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - Faced with plunging U.S. orders, surgical glove maker Ren Jiding is hunting for new markets amid Chinese government calls to reduce reliance on the United States. But none can absorb the 60 percent of his sales that went to American customers last year."Other countries import much less than the United States," said Ren, a co-owner of Hongyeshangqin Medical Science and Technology Co., Ltd. in the eastern city of Zibo.From medical products to smartphone chips to soybeans, Beijing is responding to President Donald Trump's tariff hikes by pushing companies to trade more with other countries. But there are few substitutes for the United States as an export market and source of technology for industries including telecom equipment makers Chinese leaders are eager to develop.Beijing has announced tariff cuts and other changes while rejecting U.S. demands to scale back plans such as "Made in China 2025," which calls for state-led creation of Chinese champions in robotics, biotech and other fields. American leaders say those violate Beijing's market-opening promises and might erode U.S. industrial leadership.The response highlights the cost the ruling Communist Party is willing to pay in lost sales and jobs to stick to plans that are fueling conflict with Washington, Europe and other trading partners."China sees its technology and industrial policies as fundamental to its growth," Tianjie He of Oxford Economics said in an email. "It is thus hard to see China's leadership committing to significant changes."Trump has raised duties on a total of $50 billion of Chinese imports including ultrasound scanners and industrial components that Washington says benefit from improper policies. China retaliated with similar penalties.The U.S. is poised to raise duties on $200 billion of imports including the gloves made by Ren's company. Beijing has issued a list of American goods for retaliation.The impact on China is "small and is containable, at least for the time being," said Vincent Chan of Credit Suisse. He said the "worst case" outlook if all threatened U.S. tariff hikes go ahead would cut China's growth by 0.2 percentage points this year and 1.3 percent in 2019.Chinese leaders have tried to cushion the blow to their own economy by targeting American goods its importers can get from other countries - soybeans from Brazil, gas from Russia, cars from Germany and fish from Vietnam.Beijing has promised to use revenue from the higher tariffs to help struggling exporters and has ordered banks to lend more freely to them.The biggest jolt so far came from Beijing's cancellation of orders for soybeans, the biggest American export to China at $21 billion last year. That hammered farm states that voted for Trump in the 2016 election. It also pushed up prices for Chinese farmers that use soybeans for animal feed and food processors that crush them for cooking oil.That could be a windfall for Brazil. But China already is its top market and consumes two-thirds of the global supply. Chinese total imports last year of 95 million metric tons were 50 percent more than the South American giant's entire exports."The Chinese can talk all they want about finding other sources of soybeans," but 80 percent come from the United States, Brazil and Argentina, said Michael Cordonnier, president of Soybean & Corn Advisor, Inc., a U.S. research firm."If you want to import soybeans, it generally must be from one of those three countries," said Cordonnier in an email.Regulators also cut import duties on automobiles on July 1 but raised them on vehicles from the United States. That helps luxury brands that import from Germany and Japan.Replacing markets for Chinese exporters that support tens of millions of jobs will be harder.The United States bought $430 billion of China's exports last year, or 20 percent of the $2.2 trillion total. The No. 2 market was the 28-nation European Union at $370 billion."We can't afford to lose the U.S. market," said David Hu, general manager of Sinohood Bags Factory Ltd. in the southeastern city of Yiwu.Americans bought 40 percent of his canvas tote bags last year, including the most profitable customized versions with Christmas and other designs."What we export to Europe is lower-end products with lower prices," said Hu. "We could explore the Indian, Vietnamese or Philippine markets. But the prices they offer would be too low."Chinese officials point to potential markets in the "Belt and Road," a multibillion-dollar initiative led by President Xi Jinping to boost trade by building ports, railways and other infrastructure across Asia to Europe.That has brought a flood of contracts to Chinese state-owned builders but complaints about costs have hurt its appeal. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia announced this month the cancellation of plans for Chinese-built projects including a $20 billion rail line."There is potential for development in areas such as central Asia, Eastern Europe, Africa and South America. But their problems are development imbalance and economic instability," said Li Yong, a senior fellow at the China Association of International Trade, an industry group.Local officials have met with exporters to exhort them to "diversify markets," according to the state press.Authorities in the central city of Jingzhou visited exporters to help with customs forms, financing and other details, the website China Industry and Commerce News said.Ren, the surgical glove maker, said his 300-employee company was looking at Europe and developing countries but demand was sluggish.Some companies are confident of keeping their U.S. market share. That reflects the possible success of official efforts to develop higher-tech goods instead of competing on price alone.The general manager of Yihua Electronic Equipment Co. in southern China's Guangdong said the tariffs should not affect sales of its digital soldering guns, one fifth of which are sold to the United States."With the 25 percent tariffs, ours still are cheaper than similar German- or Japanese-made products," said the manager, who would give only his surname, Gou. "We are not producing something like shoes and clothing that could be easily replaced."Trump's pressure is likely to backfire by encouraging Beijing to throw even more resources at nurturing its own technology creators.China's search for non-U.S. suppliers could help companies such as Taiwanese chipmaker MediaTek Inc. But redesigning a phone or network gear and then gaining regulatory and customer approval can take a minimum of three to five years."For now," said He of Oxford Economics, "China remains technologically dependent on the U.S."___AP researcher Yu Bing contributed to this report.Load-Date: August 28, 2018End of Document

From Ghost Cities to Land Fever, Researcher Probes the Complex China EconomyTargeted News ServiceSeptember 19, 2018 Wednesday 7:42 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1171 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WORCESTER, Massachusetts BodyClark University issued the following news:As the winner of the 2018 Lincoln Institute China Program International Fellowship, Junfu Zhang, an urban economist at Clark University, is analyzing Chinese government policies that shape the country's rapid economic growth.Despite its economic successes, China recognizes a stark contrast between its inner, remote western provinces and bustling eastern, coastal cities. To build up the western regions, China has approved $550 billion in infrastructure projects since 2012: highways, airports, railways, water diversion facilities, and hydroelectric power stations. But many of the development projects don't attract investors, businesses, or residents, and sit idle as "ghost cities."Meanwhile, huge, dense, coastal cities like Shanghai face exorbitant housing prices and large migrations of workers from rural areas who cannot find affordable places to live. Speculators drive up the prices even more.Undergirding these uneven patterns of growth is a state-controlled quota system for converting rural land to urban development. The central government distributes quotas to provinces, which then allocate them among cities according to unspecified criteria, allowing local governments to acquire land from farmers and lease it to developers and industrial enterprises."You have a big country, the second-largest economy in the world, and you have a very large urban system, with hundreds of very large cities. Which city is growing fast? Which city is growing slowly? It's partly controlled by this land quota system," says Zhang, professor of economics. "There are a lot of observers, including leading economists in China, saying this land quota system is inefficient. The idea is very simple: Certain cities need a lot of land; other cities don't need as much. We're trying to argue that there are better ways to allocate this crucial factor of production."During his fellowship year, Zhang is continuing work on a paper, "Land Conversion and Misallocation Across Cities in China," with his colleagues, Shihe Fu of Xiamen University in China and Xiaocong Xu, a doctoral student in economics at Clark. They developed a computer program to extract 1.5 million land-lease announcements posted to a Chinese government website from 2007 to 2016.Their data analysis sheds light on how much land has been converted for urban use, and how much revenue has been generated from leasing out the land, and compares the land revenue with the localities' tax revenue."We're painting a big picture in terms of what is going on with land conversion," Zhang says. "We offer a lot of evidence that China is not making the best use of its land resources to generate the most economic gains."The quota system encourages cities in western provinces to develop land, even though the payback is small. Meanwhile, booming and bustling cities like Shanghai are constrained by the quota system, which doesn't grant mega-cities enough land to develop."Part of the reason housing prices are so high in Shanghai is that you don't give them enough quota; you don't allow them to build more," Zhang says. "The reason you have ghost cities in some regions in China is because houses were built, but nobody is living there. We argue that there must be a better way to manage urban development."One proposal from the researchers: Cities should be allowed to trade quotas with each other; a western city could sell a quota to Shanghai, for instance."If you worry about equality, then share the quota," Zhang says. "Western cities will gain a lot by selling the quota; the quota will be used by the place where it's most valuable."In researching China's economic policies and practices, Zhang offers the perspective of both an insider and outsider. A native of Northeast China, he has lived in the United States for more than two decades. He has a B.A. in international economics from Renmin University of China in Beijing, an M.A. from Clark, and an M.A. and Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins, and has served as a research fellow for the Brookings Institution and the Public Policy Institute of California.In 2006, he returned to Clark as a faculty member. Recently, he was voted president-elect of the Chinese Economists Society, an academic organization that promotes economic research on China."My research on China also examines rural-urban migration, studying the people, where they go, and how their behavior reveals a preference," Zhang explains. "Are they willing to give up income and bear higher costs to live in larger cities? I look at the human side of urbanization too."Zhang is widely published in peer-reviewed journals, including the Journal of Urban Economics, Journal of Regional Science, Urban Studies, and more.His paper, titled "Measuring the Stringency of Land Use Regulation: The Case of China's Building Height Limits," published last year in MIT's prestigious Review of Economics and Statistics, drew much attention. Zhang and his colleagues presented a framework - new to the field of economics - to measure the stringency of building height restrictions. Their research could help cities across the world figure out the economic impact of height restrictions, he says, and also could be applied to studies of other land-use and environmental regulations.Zhang's earlier research draws upon game theory, a mathematical approach to understanding human behavior in competitive situations, which he has applied to his examination of China's "development zone fever." Over the past three decades, China saw several episodes of surges in local jurisdictions seizing land, building out infrastructure, and establishing development zones to court domestic and foreign investors.Zhang's 2011 paper, "Interjurisdictional Competition for FDI [Foreign Direct Investment]: The Case of China's 'Development Zone Fever,' " published in Regional Science and Urban Economics, proposes a mathematical model to analyze the effectiveness of China's development-zone policies."Journalists and policymakers do not see investors going to some of these development zones and they naturally consider it a waste of resources. In applying game theory, I find it's not necessarily the case," he explains.When coastal cities like Suzhou, near Shanghai, successfully attract investors to their development zones - and towns in inner, rural provinces do not - that does not necessarily hurt the country overall, according to Zhang."The goal is to allow the investors to go to the best place that benefits the country most," he says. "And the process of this interjurisdictional competition will allow the investors to find out which city is best."Zhang's fellowship from the Cambridge, Mass.-based Lincoln Institute of Land Policy runs through February 2019. A nonprofit private operating foundation whose origins date to 1946, the Lincoln Institute researches and recommends creative approaches to land as a solution to economic, social, and environmental challenges.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6451227 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: September 20, 2018End of Document

China Mobile faces US ban over spying fearsCNN WireJuly 3, 2018 Tuesday 7:34 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 645 wordsByline: By Sherisse PhamDateline: HONG KONG (CNNMoney) BodyHONG KONG (CNNMoney) --  The Trump administration has moved to block a state-owned Chinese wireless carrier from linking up with the US market, citing national security concerns.China Mobile wanted to provide cell phone and other communication services between the United States and other countries. It submitted an application for a license to US regulators back in 2011. On Monday, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, a branch of the US Commerce Department, recommended that the Federal Communications Commission deny the request. The move against a high-profile Chinese company could add to the bitter dispute between Washington and Beijing over trade and technology."Because China Mobile is subject to exploitation, influence, and control by the Chinese government, the Executive Branch believes that granting China Mobile's application ... would produce substantial and unacceptable national security and law enforcement risks," the telecommunications agency said in a filing to the FCC. Giving China Mobile access to the US telecommunications market could lead to a spike in Chinese spying, it said. Phone calls or other communications from US government agencies to international destinations could pass through China Mobile's network, even if the agencies are not customers of the operator, according to the filing. China Mobile, which has more than 900 million mobile customers, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday. The company wasn't seeking to offer mobile services directly to US customers, according to the US filing.The FCC wasn't immediately available for comment outside of regular office hours.A US rejection is expected to have little impact on the company's income. The international calling business accounts for only a tiny portion of China Mobile's revenue, according to Ramakrishna Maruvada, an analyst with Daiwa Capital Markets.Heightened tensionsThe recommendation against China Mobile comes at a time of heightened trade and national security tensions between the United States and China. The Trump administration is trying to counter China's ambitions to become a global tech leader, accusing China of pressuring companies and stealing intellectual property to get ahead. Beijing denies the allegations. A series of tech and telecommunications companies have run into difficulties over potential security concerns.The Trump administration in March blocked chipmaker Broadcom's $117 billion bid for rival Qualcomm. One concern it cited was the deal could cause the United States to fall behind on the development of 5G technology and allow China to take the lead.Chinese smartphone and telecommunications company ZTE has been in crisis since April when the US Commerce Department banned American companies from selling it vital components.The Commerce Department said it imposed the ban on ZTE because the company breached a 2017 deal in which it agreed to pay a fine for violating sanctions on Iran and North Korea.The Trump administration struck a new deal with the company earlier this month to end the ban in exchange for an additional fine and a drastic management overhaul. But ZTE still faces an uncertain future, and some members of Congress are seeking to keep the ban in place. The US government has long been wary of Chinese companies having access to American telecommunications networks.

Pakistan election results won't affect bond with ChinaPR NewswireAugust 13, 2018 Monday 10:20 PM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 819 wordsDateline: BEIJING, Aug. 13, 2018 BodyA news report by China.org.cn on the relationship between China and Pakistan after Pakistan's 2018 general election: With the final results in, the Pakistan Tehrik-i-Insaf (PTI), or Pakistan Movement for Justice party, have been announced winners of the country's 2018 general election. In his televised victory address, Pakistan's prime minister in-waiting Imran Khan proposed the dream of "Naya (new) Pakistan," and pledged to learn from China on how to reduce poverty, combat corruption and promote economic development.It is difficult to judge the policies of Pakistan's new administration just from a television broadcast. However, Imran Khan's speech did showcase his unrelenting efforts to achieve his dream of becoming Pakistan's prime minister. The former captain of the national cricket team is considered to have risen above the traditional political influence of the aristocratic families in Pakistan.Contrary to many reports, Imran Khan is actually not a political dark horse. In 1996, Khan entered politics and founded the PTI and was first elected to parliament in 2002. For over two decades, the PTI contested several general elections, until eventually emerging as the largest single party, and acquiring enough seats to form a coalition government in 2018.The long political journey shows that Imran Khan did not win the election by accident.He won a hard-fought victory over the two major political powers of the country. His proposal to fulfil the dream of "Naya (new) Pakistan" reflects not only his personal political pursuit, but also the dream of the majority of Pakistani people, especially tens of millions of young people. The most important thing for Pakistan, with a population of 180 million, is to arouse the passion of the young people and to channel their energy in the right direction, such as poverty reduction, anti-corruption and economic construction.In these respects, China, as Pakistan's all-weather friend for half a century, can and should provide help and support within its capacity.In the past few years, among the cooperative projects between China and Pakistan, the most important one has been the construction of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which has brought new opportunities for Pakistan's employment and industrial development. China needs it, and Pakistan needs it even more.As a Chinese saying goes, "Even brothers keep careful accounts." There may be some differences between the two countries on individual projects of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. However, these kinds of differences are entirely business-like, and it can be only solved through friendly and equal consultations. The China-Pakistan economic corridor involves the common interests of the two countries over the coming decades, and will not be re-oriented by the change of one government. There is no reason to doubt this.With regard to the changes in Pakistan's domestic situation, both the Chinese government and enterprises may need some time to adapt, and the Pakistan government also needs some time to develop its own specific policy thinking and ideas. But in any case, the "iron friendship" between China and Pakistan will remain unchanged.China Mosaichttp://www.china.org.cn/video/node_7230027.htmPakistan election results won't affect bond with China           http://www.china.org.cn/video/2018-08/09/content_58295782.htmAbout China.org.cnFounded in 2000, China Internet Information Center (China.org.cn/China.com.cn) is a key state news website under the auspices of the State Council Information Office, and is managed by China International Publishing Group.

America must address own pollution before blaming ChinaThe Miscellany News: Vassar CollegeSeptember 19, 2018 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: OPINIONS; Pg. 1Length: 1170 wordsBodyWhen you type the word "China" into the Google search engine, the second suggestion that appears is "China air pollution," and the images that pop up are filled with face masks, haze and desolation. The West has consistently criticized China for its detrimental impact on the environment, but surely there is more to the story than China being the big, bad polluter that destroys our planet's environment.In the news, we are constantly bombarded by images of pollution and waste in China, condemning both the leaders and the people of the country for the harm they cause to the environment. While China does contribute a significant amount to the environmental harms that our world is facing, it cannot be considered the sole perpetrator. China does contribute the most CO2 emissions overall, but its emissions per capita are nowhere close to that of the United States.According to a report by the European Commission, China produces 7.7 metric tons of CO2 per capita, whereas the United states produces 16.1-more than double China (EDGAR, "CO2 time series 1990-2015 per capita for world countries," 10.30.2017). Moreover, the nation that produces the most waste in the world is the United States, which generates 4.4 pounds of municipal solid waste per capita every day (EPA, "Municipal Solid Waste Generation, Recycling, and Disposal in the United States," 2012).In order to try and combat the pollution that it is producing, China has implemented policies to reduce environmental impact-the Chinese government has declared a "war on pollution." The government has primarily focused on reducing coal usage and has taken steps toward dismantling coal-fired power plants in order to reduce overall emission that contribute to smog and air pollution. It has also transformed its Ministry for Environmental Protection into a Ministry of Ecology and Environment; this new ministry has broader and clearer goals than the previous system, wherein environmental policies were scattered between different departments (World Economic Forum, "Here's how China is going green," 04.26.2018).The Chinese government has also enforced more stringent regulations by implementing an environmental tax, which targets enterprises and public institutions that discharge air and water pollutants into the environment in order to finance a transition into a greener economy (Xinhua, "China starts collecting environment tax," 01.01.2018). Finally, the country is using its technology giants, such as conglomerates Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent, in order to accelerate the transition to a more environmentally friendly China.For example, Ant Financial, a banking subsidiary of Alibaba, aims to use technology to advance environmental finance; millions of users have signed up for an app called Ant Forest, which transforms carbon footprint tracking into a game-like experience (World Economic Forum, "Here's how China is going green," 04.26.2018). Overall, China is definitely making an effort to rectify its environmental situation, a fact which Western media often underreports.Although it is not necessarily the biggest contributor per capita and does make some positive environmental efforts, China does make a significant negative impact on the environment. As China is a country that focuses on manufacturing goods, it is important to learn from where the demand for such goods comes and how these origins contribute to China's pollution problem.A study investigating the way in which consumer demand in the United States and Western Europe contributes to air pollution in developing countries has shown that demands from these countries for manufactured goods have indirectly contributed to tens of thousands of pollution-correlated deaths.Chinese emissions have been linked to over 64,800 premature deaths in other regions of the world, including more than 3,000 deaths in the United States and Western Europe. However, this is overshadowed by the fact that 108,600 premature deaths in China were linked to goods and services consumed in the United States and in Western Europe (The Guardian, "Thousands of pollution deaths worldwide linked to western consumers - study," 03.29.2017).While the West may be eager to criticize China for the pollution that it creates, the West must stop and question why so much pollution is created in the first place and the extent to which we as consumers are responsible for our indirect environmental footprint.Unlike the United States and most of Western Europe, China is still a developing country according to the International Monetary Fund's World Economic Outlook Database (International Monetary Fund, "World Economic Outlook," 10.2017), which means that it has a less developed industrial base and lower human development index in comparison to other countries. Though this may imply that China has fewer capabilities and less knowledge when it comes to creating environmentally friendly solutions, China's current policies show that it is attempting to reduce its environmental footprint.Despite China's current role as a global economic player, its growth is relatively recent, which may be impacting the country's attitude toward its economy, leading to the country's tendency to favor the economy over environmental costs at times.During The Great Leap Forward (1958-1962), China experienced tens of millions of deaths, as well as poverty and a rapidly shrinking economy. On the other side of the world, the United States experienced great economic growth with a boom in the aerospace industry, leading to an increase in employment and new technologies that improved industrial and agricultural sectors. In the 15 years after World War II, America's foreign investment increased 1000 percent (Bernard Bailyn, "The Great Republic: A History of the American People," 1985). It wasn't even until late 1978, a mere 40 years ago, that China was able to break away from its previous Soviet-style central economy in order to become a more market-oriented economy, similar to that of already developed countries.Therefore, for a country like China, whose economy is so dependent on exporting cheap, manufactured goods, the negative economic impacts may be considered before improving environmental standards. This does not seem like such an absurd solution considering the fact that there are many people alive in China now who can remember times of dire poverty and starvation. It would be no wonder if they did not want themselves or their country to be in the same position again.In an increasingly global world, every nation and every individual has the responsibility to take care of the environment around them. It is important to remember that there is no sole perpetrator of this international issue, and as a result, we must recognise how we contribute to global pollution and how it affects us. Thus, rather than trying to blame and criticize one nation, we should, as a collective, recognise and attempt to rectify our own patterns and behaviors that contribute to the environmental crisis.Load-Date: September 20, 2018End of Document

China just blocked Amazon's streaming service TwitchCNNMoney.comSeptember 21, 2018 Friday 9:30 AM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: TECHNOLOGYLength: 438 wordsByline: James GriffithsBodyThe world's most popular service for live-streaming video games may have just lost a big potential market.Twitch, which is owned by Amazon, is no longer accessible to users inside China. It has also disappeared from Apple's iOS App Store in China.A spokesman for Twitch confirmed Friday that the service, which lets users watch and broadcast video-game playing, had been blocked in China but wouldn't comment further. The country's internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.The move comes after the streaming service became the third most popular free app in the Chinese iOS store, according to analytics firm App Annie.That surge in popularity resulted from Chinese eSports fans using Twitch to watch their country compete in the Asian Games last month, which was the first time the event had featured competitive video gaming. According to Hong Kong-based tech news site Abacus, Chinese fans were annoyed that state-run TV wasn't covering the event and turned to Twitch in droves.The live-streaming service, which Amazon bought in 2014 for almost $1 billion, joins a host of other foreign platforms that are blocked by China's vast censorship apparatus, which is known as the Great Firewall. They include YouTube, Facebook and Twitter.Twitch was likely to have faced problems in China sooner or later.Chinese authorities have repeatedly cracked down on live-streaming services, placing tight restrictions on platforms and popular users.China is notoriously sensitive about foreign companies providing media content in its territory, unless they agree to the type of stringent censorship local firms do. In 2016, Chinese services from Disney and Apple were shut down as the government tightened regulations governing online content such as videos, games and books.The setback to Twitch comes at a time when the Chinese government has started taking a harder line on the gaming industry. Regulators have stopped approving licenses allowing online games to charge customers money.Last month, the government said it planned to limit the number of new online games and put restrictions on the amount of time children and teenagers can spend playing them.The moves wiped tens of billions of dollars off the market value of Chinese internet company Tencent, which has a huge gaming business.China is the world's largest gaming market, accounting for a quarter of global revenue, according to market research firm Newzoo.

The future of Mexico and ChinaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 4, 2018 SaturdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 855 wordsBody There is an old Chinese proverb that says: "Only the one who uses them knows if the shoes are comfortable".  The above comes to mind because with that refrain the Chinese government responded to recent alarmist comments from the United States about the growing Chinese presence in Latin America.  In this sense, The New York Times published a few days ago an extensive report in which revealed the construction in Argentina of a Chinese space station that cost 50 million dollars, supposed proof of the influence of that country in Latin America to undermine the control American in the region.  It is incredible that in the 21st century the consequences of the Monroe Doctrine still survive in the United States, but it is only for us Latin Americans to decide the scope of our relations with other countries.  Sino-Latin American cooperation will be successful insofar as it produces mutual benefits of development and friendship. China is currently the second largest trading partner in Latin America and investments have created 1.8 million jobs in the region, with the exception of Mexico.  The exception with Mexico is understood because our country has concentrated with the United States, while China trades more with Argentina, Brazil and Colombia. In relation to Mexico, China occupies the fourth place, with only 2% of our exports, and the second place of imports with 18%.  In this context, President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador received the Chinese ambassador to Mexico, who invited the transition team to the International Import Exhibition of China (CIIE), on November 5 in Shanghai.  More than 60 business partners from around the world participate in the CIIE. Mexico will be present with a pavilion, organized by ProMéxico, as well as Brazil, Chile, Peru and other Latin American countries.  It is an effort by the Asian country to open its market abroad and counteract international criticism for its mercantilist policy of favoring exports and hindering imports.  Therefore, President Donald Trump demanded that China reduce the trade deficit of 200 billion dollars, while the next foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, declared that the main objective of Mexico will be to level the trade balance, that is, to lower the deficit of 75 thousand dollars. millions of dollars.  But the relationship with China can not be seen only from a commercial perspective. We should look for investment areas in which China is already a leader, such as in the development of solar energy, electronic commerce, the construction of high-speed trains, despite the failed project from Mexico to Querétaro.  We participate in the elaboration of the alternative plan for the nation, adopted by López Obrador, in which it is recognized that Asia is a continent that offers opportunities that have largely not been taken advantage of.  China will be the first world economy in a few years. According to some measurements, it already is. Therefore, this nation represents a great opportunity in our economic and commercial relations, but also a great challenge, being our main competitor in diverse markets.  We will have to recover a relationship of trust and build a framework that gives certainty to a wide range of future interactions. Mexico, for historical reasons, since the existence of the Manila Galleon, was the main reference for China in the Americas.  We must do so again, within the framework of norms agreed upon by international organizations such as the World Trade Organization and the World Intellectual Property Organization and of a growing commercial, investment, educational, tourist and cultural exchange.  Enrique Dussel, coordinator of the Center for China-Mexico Studies of UNAM, proposed in an extensive study to establish an agendaof development for the long term in order to specify the integral strategic partnership of the relationship and nurture it of specific projects.  The commercial exchange between Mexico and China has doubled in the last decade: it went from 26 billion dollars in 2006 to 75 billion in 2016, but Mexican exports have stagnated. Likewise, Mexico has received 600 million dollars of foreign direct investment from China. In turn, Mexico has invested more than 73 million in China.  With the López Obrador government, the time has come to deepen high-level relations with China to achieve diplomatic and economic balances.  With the world's largest population, China is the second largest economy, as well as the second largest importer and consumer.  In the next five years, China will import more than 10 billion dollars in products and services, which will provide a historic opportunity for companies around the world to enter the huge Chinese market.  Mexico should take advantage of its commercial activity in the CIIE not only to penetrate the Chinese market but also to promote the development of economic globalization and contribute to the open destiny of the international community, before the absorption of our northern neighbor.  The important thing is that one feels comfortable shoes, and not what others think.  @AGutierrezCanet  gutierrez.canet@milenio.com Load-Date: August 4, 2018End of Document

Global Music Industry Summit, Tencent Music Connects, Held In Beijing; TMC Provides International Exchange Platform for Chinese Music CommunityPR NewswireJuly 3, 2018 Tuesday 4:22 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 612 wordsDateline: BEIJING, July 3, 2018 BodyTencent Music Connects (TMC), a global music industry summit hosted by China's Tencent Music Entertainment Group (TME), kicked off in Beijing, bringing together top executives, industry leaders and influencers from over 20 countries and regions under the theme of "China is Now" to share their pioneering insights into the trends shaping the future of the industry. It is the first in a series of TMC events that will be held in cities across China and Asia in coming months.Conceived as a forum for understanding the rise of Chinese music in a global context, TMC consisted of a series of sessions focusing on three major topics: "What's happening in China," "The World Turns to China," and "China Trends." A mix of industry leaders and influencers from within China and around the world, represented by top executives from Universal Music Group, Warner Music, Sony Music Entertainment, YG Entertainment, JVR Music, Sony Music Japan, Emperor Group, Beggars Group, Believe Digital, AEG, Live Nation, China Record Group, AMPai Music, Tan Xuan Music Studio, Caotai Music, Stallion Era and the Communication University of China (CUC), engaged in discussions spanning several industry-relevant topics including music distribution, how the influence of Chinese culture is spreading beyond the country's borders, and what current trends portend for the future, facilitating communication between Chinese and international insiders."I am very proud of the positive and steady growth of the Chinese music sector over the past few years," said TME Vice President Andy Ng during his speech at TMC. "It is thanks to both the strong support from the Chinese government and the collective efforts of industry players that the sector has been able to experience such outstanding growth. As the industry expands, forums like TMC are vital for the sharing of ideas and enabling the industry to stay ahead of the latest trends emerging from our growing audiences."Given the rise of China's music market, the focus of the event was highly representative of the hot topics being discussed in music industry circles worldwide. Values embodied in Chinese music culture were part and parcel of what was discussed during the various industry discussions, giving all those in attendance an opportunity to take a hard look at the differences, and potential conflicts, between Eastern and Western thinking as it relates to the music industry. With the success of the Beijing stop, TMC plans to continue the event with presentations of some of the latest Chinese music industry cases and further discussion of the hot topics of the day with stops in other cities both in and outside of China.TMC was held under the aegis of the China Association of Performing Arts (CAPA), the Music Copyright Society of China (MCSC), and the Music Industry Promotion Committee (MIPC) of the China Audio-video and Digital Publishing Association, with China Record Corporation as the strategic sponsor. Distinguished guests attending the event included CAPA Secretary-general Pan Yan, MCSC Vice Secretary-general Liu Ping, MIPC Secretary-general Xu Hongli and China Chief Representative of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) Guo Biao.TMC's next scheduled stops will be in Singapore, Shanghai, Chengdu and Shenzhen, covering different topics, with the aim of taking a deeper look into the next phase of the development of China's music industry via discussions across a wide array of topics. View original content with multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-music-industry-summit-tencent-music-connects-held-in-beijing-300675786.htmlSOURCE Tencent Music Entertainment GroupCONTACT: Sujun Huang, +86-755-13388-27275, sujunhuang@tencent.comLoad-Date: July 4, 2018End of Document

Tradeweb Sees Increased Adoption of Electronic Trading by China Bond InvestorsPR NewswireJuly 9, 2018 Monday 12:28 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 893 wordsDateline: LONDON, July 9, 2018 BodyTradeweb China Bond Activity Tops 697 Billion Yuan on Bond Connect Tradeweb Markets, a leading global marketplace for electronic fixed income, derivatives and ETF trading, announced that Chinese onshore bond trading activity surpassed CNY 697 billion (USD 107 billion) since the launch of Bond Connect on July 3, 2017. More than 6,200 fully electronic CNY cash bond transactions have been executed on Tradeweb, the first trading link to Bond Connect, an initiative aimed at driving the electronification and internationalization of the Chinese bond market.The addition of Chinese debt instruments in global fixed income indices is expected to create even greater demand for efficient, electronic trading in these markets, when global investors' strategies incorporate China bonds in new ways. In preparation for index inclusion, Tradeweb has worked closely with CFETS, Bond Connect Company Limited and asset managers to facilitate pre-allocation of block orders in CNY bonds from mid-July 2018, which will allow investors to complete large transactions without incurring adverse market impact.Tradeweb is also focused on further improving price discovery in Chinese bonds through the introduction of indicative pricing this summer. Moreover, the implementation of Delivery-Versus-Payment settlement, which will reduce counterparty risk for investors, and the clarification of tax collection policies will align China's bond market with its more mature global counterparts, thus spurring its adoption by offshore investors."Tradeweb is well placed to accommodate the anticipated increase in investor demand for Chinese debt given our market-leading infrastructure, long-standing fixed income expertise, and extensive community of more than 2,000 institutions," said Lee Olesky, CEO of Tradeweb Markets. "Our early involvement in the creation and launch of Bond Connect means we are uniquely positioned to deeply understand the specific requirements of Chinese bond market participants, and use our established client network and technology to further enhance their trading experience.""More and more clients are onboarding to Tradeweb to access Bond Connect, and our growth is a representation of the operational efficiencies this innovative program brings to institutional investors," said Li Renn Tsai, Head of Asia at Tradeweb. "We are privileged to be working closely with Bond Connect stakeholders to further streamline investors' electronic access to Chinese bond market liquidity, acting as a catalyst for greater efficiency and transparency.""Accessing the Chinese domestic bond market through Tradeweb will enable us to send a trade inquiry simultaneously to multiple dealers, which has the potential to improve the price discovery process," said Kenneth Topping, managing director, Goldman Sachs Asset Management. "The end-to-end electronic workflow will allow us to achieve greater efficiency as it facilitates pre- and post-trade OMS integration."Since July 2017, the first month of China bond trading on Tradeweb:The monthly average daily trading volume increased nearly fivefold to CNY 6.8 billion.Buying volume represented approximately 70 per cent of the overall CNY activity.The average maturity of CNY bonds more than doubled.The single most active day was June 11, 2018 with nearly CNY 9 billion in notional volume.The number of onshore market makers has increased from 24 to 34.Investors from the U.S., Europe, and Asia Pacific (including Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Japan and Australia) have traded on the platform.Bond Connect was established by the China Foreign Exchange Trade System & National Interbank Funding Centre (CFETS) and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX). Via the Tradeweb link to Bond Connect, investors can leverage disclosed request-for-quote (RFQ) protocol to improve price discovery, submit orders, and execute all 30,000+ bonds tradable in the China Interbank Bond Market (CIBM), including Chinese government bonds, local government bonds, policy bank bonds, financial institution bonds, enterprise bonds, corporate debt instruments and more.About Tradeweb MarketsTradeweb Markets builds and operates many of the world's most efficient financial marketplaces, providing market participants with greater transparency and efficiency in fixed income, derivatives and ETFs.

IS #METOO CHANGING CHINA?States News ServiceSeptember 17, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 833 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:Chinese women have been fighting for equality for a long time. In October 1911, a group of revolutionaries in southern China overthrew the Qing Dynasty, ending the imperial system and founding the Republic of China. Among the revolutionaries was a group of women's rights activists. But when the Provisional Constitution was passed in March 1912, there was no mention of sex or gender. It said, "citizens of the Republic of China shall be equal before the law, without distinction of race, class or religion.""During the armed uprisings women . . . risked both their lives and their properties . . . just like the men. How is it that now the revolution has been achieved but women's interests are not taken into account?" a feminist cried upon learning women would not be granted equal voting rights when the new electoral laws were announced in December 1912.Today's feminists in China know from long experience to be wary of men's claims that they support equal rights, whether they are government officials or liberal intellectuals and activists.The #MeToo movement in China has sent shock waves through progressive circles as some of the men accused of sexual assault and harassment are prominent intellectuals and activists who have long advocated for equal rights. High-profile men accused of abusive behavior include anti-discrimination activist Lei Chuang, environmentalist Feng Yongfeng and journalist Xiong Peiyun. Lei and Feng admitted to the accusations, while Xiong denied them.Zhang Wen, a well-known journalist accused of rape and harassment by several women, attacked his accusers for "being divorced" and "having had many boyfriends." He also threatened to sue those who made allegations against him.Like much of Chinese society, some male intellectuals and activists habitually call their female colleagues "beauties" or "goddesses" and post photos of scantily clad young women on social media. In campaigns to raise money for families of detained activists, organizer Rou Tangseng used photos of women's bare legs to attract donations. I was once called "goddess" by a male activist when I criticized the Chinese government's detention of political dissidents but the same person called me "an ugly woman no man wants" when I raised the issue of gender discrimination in Chinese society.Now something new is emerging from #MeToo: Some liberal intellectual men who in the past have not paid much attention to women's rights issues have called for self-reflection and support of women's rights."I have had many moments of drunk and indecent behavior," wrote the political commentator Mo Zhixu. "If I am exposed, I would understand, this is not only about some moral image issues. My past behavior, in fact, is a great mockery of my pursuit of rights, freedom, equality and democracy. If I cannot face this with honesty, it would only render my pursuit a joke."Writer Zhao Chu explains that as a person who deeply cares about rights, he must support the #MeToo movement: "Even if . . . [it] means I, as a man, must change my behavior and way of thinking, even if this kind of change is very difficult."Feminist writer Li Sipan exclaimed that "a miracle has happened" when she saw on social media many pro-feminism messages posted by those she thought were her "ordinary straight male" friends.This change has been driven by the many Chinese women online often young and educated who bravely speak up, telling their stories, articulating feminist ideas and vigorously debating well-known male intellectuals, all amid pervasive government censorship.Don't expect a similar awakening any time soon among the political elite. After President Xi Jinping formally assumed power in 2013, the government tightened its grip on civil society, including feminists. In March 2015, authorities detained five women's rights activists for a month after they planned to distribute stickers with anti-sexual harassment messages on public buses. This March, Chinese social media platforms Weibo and WeChat permanently suspended the accounts of Feminist Voices, a women's rights publication.In June, Ren Liping, a student at China University of Petroleum, was held for six days in a hotel room by university authorities after she protested against the university and the police for mishandling her allegations of sexual abuse. Ren had accused an ex-boyfriend of raping her on campus."The younger generation of women's rights activists . . . has a stronger sense of independent personhood," said the feminist and literary professor Ai Xiaoming. "Such independent personhood has instilled . . . vigor to the current women's rights movement in China."While the space for civil society activism of any kind is narrowing in China today, feminists have courageously and creatively followed the path of their feminist forbears from over 100 years ago. Their twin targets of an authoritarian state and patriarchal society ignore them at their peril.Load-Date: September 17, 2018End of Document

China's economic growth cools amid trade tensionsAssociated Press Financial WireJuly 16, 2018 Monday 2:42 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 407 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD, Associated PressDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - China's economic growth slowed in the quarter ending in June, adding to challenges for Beijing amid a mounting tariff battle with Washington.The world's second-largest economy expanded by 6.7 percent, down from the previous quarter's 6.8 percent, the government reported Monday.Even before the dispute with Washington erupted, forecasters expected growth to cool after Beijing started tightening controls on bank lending last year to rein in surging debt.Economic activity is expected to decline further as global demand for Chinese exports weakens and lending controls weigh on construction and investment, major contributors to growth.Beijing has responded to previous downturns by flooding the state-dominated economy with credit. But that has swelled debt so high that global rating agencies have cut China's government credit rating.Chinese leaders are in the midst of a marathon effort to encourage self-sustaining growth driven by domestic consumption and reduce reliance on exports and investment.Consumer spending has risen more slowly than planned, leaving economic growth dependent on debt-supported investment.Retail spending in June rose by 9 percent over a year earlier, a half-percentage point higher than in May. The increase was driven by rapid growth in the sales of higher-end consumer goods such as cosmetics and audio-video equipment.Investment in factories, housing and other fixed assets rose 6 percent in the first half of the year over a year earlier, a rate that was 1.5 percentage points slower than the pace set in the first quarter.Trade has shrunk as a share of China's economy but the conflict with Washington threatens to dent growth.President Donald Trump added 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods on July 6 in response to complaints Beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology. Beijing retaliated by imposing the same penalty on a similar amount of American imports.Exporters say American orders started to fall off as early as April as the war of words between Trump and Beijing intensified.Trump responded last week by threatening 10 percent tariffs on a $200 billion list of Chinese goods. He has said he is willing to raise duties on more than $500 billion of imports, or almost everything Americans buy from China.Forecasters say if threatened tariff hikes by both sides are fully carried out, that could cut China's 2019 growth by up to 0.3 percentage points.Load-Date: July 16, 2018End of Document

Why American credit card companies can't break into ChinaCNNMoney.comJuly 26, 2018 Thursday 10:21 AM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: COMPANY NEWSLength: 1084 wordsByline: Julia HorowitzBodyVisa, Mastercard and American Express have been campaigning to enter China for years. After more than a decade of trying, they may have missed their chance.Beijing has repeatedly signaled it will open up foreign access to its credit card market, and in 2017 it opened the door for American card companies to apply for licenses.But those applications are still under government review, and there's scant insight on when, or if, they'll be pushed along, especially amid the broader trade war with the United States.Meanwhile, state-controlled China UnionPay has solidified its hold on the bank card industry. And mobile payments have skyrocketed, dominated by services from rival powerhouses Tencent and Alibaba."Visa and Mastercard might have had a shot if they got in, in a real way, 10 or 15 years ago," Sandler O'Neill analyst Christopher Donat said. "But it feels to me like the window is closing for them."The struggle is emblematic of what many Western companies must contend with when trying to break into the world's second-largest economy. Government regulation is often opaque and the state itself in many cases backs Chinese companies in the same industry.China's card rushWith a booming consumer market and growing middle class, China presents huge opportunities for American card companies, which remain eager to start clearing and settling domestic card transactions in yuan.In 2017, China had nearly 6.7 billion credit and debit cards in circulation, according to the payments team at GlobalData, a research company. The firm predicts that China will overtake the United States as the largest bank card market in the world in 2019."There's tremendous growth there, and Visa and Mastercard are not allowed to be part of it at this time," said David Robertson, publisher of the Nilson Report, a trade publication.Right now, the market is completely dominated by China UnionPay, the state-owned bank card network founded in 2002. China UnionPay controls more than 90% of the market, Robertson said.Visa and Mastercard, meanwhile, can only issue co-branded cards, typically offered in partnership with UnionPay.Such cards run on the UnionPay network when used domestically for yuan payments, and on the foreign company's network when used abroad for dollar payments. With direct market access, Mastercard and Visa could set up their own payment networks in the country and collect fees on far more transactions.When China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, it indicated that it would remove restrictions on foreign payment processors by 2006.But that deadline came and went. In 2010, the United States filed a WTO case against China over its treatment of US card companies.It won the case two years later. Still, China continued to drag its feet.Beijing later said it would permit foreign companies to clear domestic payments, but the application process still wasn't clear when President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met at Mar-a-Lago in the spring of 2017.China reportedly released details on how card companies could start the application process later that year.Waiting gameSince then, Mastercard, Visa and American Express have submitted their petitions and are working their way through the approval process.American Express appears to be furthest along. The company confirmed to CNN that its application was formally accepted by the People's Bank of China, China's central bank, as previously reported by the Wall Street Journal.This move is viewed as an important step on the path to receiving a provisional license.American Express applied for its license as a joint venture with Lianlian Group, a Chinese payment services company.Joint ventures have been criticized by the Trump administration. It claims that China makes companies form joint ventures in certain sectors, then forces them to transfer valuable technology.Mastercard said it's submitted its application to the PBOC, and is "preparing for potential domestic opportunities" in the meantime."Since that submission, we have been engaged with regulators and other stakeholders regarding the steps required to advance it to the next stage," Mastercard spokesman Seth Eisen said in a statement, adding that the company remains "optimistic" about market opportunities in China.Visa also said it has filed an application with the PBOC and is working "closely" with the Chinese government."Our commitment to China is for the long term," a spokesperson told CNN.The People's Bank of China did not respond to a request for comment.'The train has left the station'These companies expected the process to be lengthy.Ling Hai, Mastercard's co-president of Asia Pacific, told investors in September 2017 that the company believes China is a medium- to long- term opportunity, since the licensing process would take at least another 12 to 18 months."It's not being held back by Visa and Mastercard's willingness to invest," said Moshe Orenbuch, an analyst at Credit Suisse. "It's being held back by the regulatory environment."Trump's trade war gives China little incentive to expedite the process. Geopolitical tensions have not been favorable to multinational companies in China; last week, Qualcomm was forced to walk away from its $44 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors as Chinese regulators withheld their approval.Already, there were concerns that China has waited too long to let US card companies into the country, and Visa, Mastercard and American Express can't compete with China UnionPay, Tencent's WeChat Pay and Alibaba's Alipay at this point."Effectively, the train has left the station," Sandler O'Neill's Donat said.Mobile payment transactions in China, led by WeChat Pay and Alipay, totaled roughly $5.5 trillion last year, according to data from Mercator Advisory Group.

Why American credit card companies can't break into ChinaCNN WireAugust 3, 2018 Friday 10:45 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1091 wordsByline: By Julia HorowitzDateline: NEW YORK (CNNMoney) BodyNEW YORK (CNNMoney) --  Visa, Mastercard and American Express have been campaigning to enter China for years. After more than a decade of trying, they may have missed their chance.Beijing has repeatedly signaled it will open up foreign access to its credit card market, and in 2017 it opened the door for American card companies to apply for licenses. But those applications are still under government review, and there's scant insight on when, or if, they'll be pushed along, especially amid the broader trade war with the United States.Meanwhile, state-controlled China UnionPay has solidified its hold on the bank card industry. And mobile payments have skyrocketed, dominated by services from rival powerhouses Tencent and Alibaba."Visa and Mastercard might have had a shot if they got in, in a real way, 10 or 15 years ago," Sandler O'Neill analyst Christopher Donat said. "But it feels to me like the window is closing for them."The struggle is emblematic of what many Western companies must contend with when trying to break into the world's second-largest economy. Government regulation is often opaque and the state itself in many cases backs Chinese companies in the same industry.China's card rushWith a booming consumer market and growing middle class, China presents huge opportunities for American card companies, which remain eager to start clearing and settling domestic card transactions in yuan.In 2017, China had nearly 6.7 billion credit and debit cards in circulation, according to the payments team at GlobalData, a research company. The firm predicts that China will overtake the United States as the largest bank card market in the world in 2019."There's tremendous growth there, and Visa and Mastercard are not allowed to be part of it at this time," said David Robertson, publisher of the Nilson Report, a trade publication.Right now, the market is completely dominated by China UnionPay, the state-owned bank card network founded in 2002. China UnionPay controls more than 90% of the market, Robertson said.Visa and Mastercard, meanwhile, can only issue co-branded cards, typically offered in partnership with UnionPay.Such cards run on the UnionPay network when used domestically for yuan payments, and on the foreign company's network when used abroad for dollar payments. With direct market access, Mastercard and Visa could set up their own payment networks in the country and collect fees on far more transactions.When China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, it indicated that it would remove restrictions on foreign payment processors by 2006.But that deadline came and went. In 2010, the United States filed a WTO case against China over its treatment of US card companies. It won the case two years later. Still, China continued to drag its feet. Beijing later said it would permit foreign companies to clear domestic payments, but the application process still wasn't clear when President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met at Mar-a-Lago in the spring of 2017. China reportedly released details on how card companies could start the application process later that year.Waiting gameSince then, Mastercard, Visa and American Express have submitted their petitions and are working their way through the approval process.American Express appears to be furthest along. The company confirmed to CNN that its application was formally accepted by the People's Bank of China, China's central bank, as previously reported by the Wall Street Journal. This move is viewed as an important step on the path to receiving a provisional license. American Express applied for its license as a joint venture with Lianlian Group, a Chinese payment services company.Joint ventures have been criticized by the Trump administration. It claims that China makes companies form joint ventures in certain sectors, then forces them to transfer valuable technology.Mastercard said it's submitted its application to the PBOC, and is "preparing for potential domestic opportunities" in the meantime."Since that submission, we have been engaged with regulators and other stakeholders regarding the steps required to advance it to the next stage," Mastercard spokesman Seth Eisen said in a statement, adding that the company remains "optimistic" about market opportunities in China.Visa also said it has filed an application with the PBOC and is working "closely" with the Chinese government."Our commitment to China is for the long term," a spokesperson told CNN.'The train has left the station'These companies expected the process to be lengthy.Ling Hai, Mastercard's co-president of Asia Pacific, told investors in September 2017 that the company believes China is a medium- to long- term opportunity, since the licensing process would take at least another 12 to 18 months. "It's not being held back by Visa and Mastercard's willingness to invest," said Moshe Orenbuch, an analyst at Credit Suisse. "It's being held back by the regulatory environment."Trump's trade war gives China little incentive to expedite the process. Geopolitical tensions have not been favorable to multinational companies in China; last week, Qualcomm was forced to walk away from its $44 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors as Chinese regulators withheld their approval.Already, there were concerns that China has waited too long to let US card companies into the country, and Visa, Mastercard and American Express can't compete with China UnionPay, Tencent's WeChat Pay and Alibaba's Alipay at this point."Effectively, the train has left the station," Sandler O'Neill's Donat said.Mobile payment transactions in China, led by WeChat Pay and Alipay, totaled roughly $5.5 trillion last year, according to data from Mercator Advisory Group. That volume is 50 times greater than in the United States.Merchants in China like these mobile payment apps, while rely on QR codes and are easy to accept, according to Mercator Advisory Group analyst Sarah Grotta."For merchants to then change to something where they would have to accept a more traditional magnetic stripe or chip card ... could be a struggle or a significant expense," Grotta said.A small chunk of a huge market is better than nothing, according to Robertson of the Nilson Report. But it's in China's best interest to wait as long as possible, he added."Once UnionPay is firmly established as the national champion, then the People's Bank of China will let Visa and Mastercard in," Robertson said.TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

US and China open fire in commercial warCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 6, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 696 wordsBody The United States and China will apply mutually a tariff increase from this Friday on products imported by 36,000 million dollars in each of both markets, beginning a commercial war between the two main economic powers of the world.  Donald Trump, president of the United States, reported Thursday that he will apply import taxes for another $ 14 billion to Chinese goods in a couple of weeks, to add $ 50 billion.  Additionally, Trump warned that, if China responds with retaliation to the United States, it will set more tariffs on Chinese imported products, first for $ 200 billion and then for another $ 300 billion.  "(Sound) 34 (one billion), then it will have another 16 (billion) in two weeks, then, as you know, we have 200,000 million in suspense, and then, after 200,000 million, we have 300,000 million in suspense. Okay Then we have 50, plus 200, plus almost 300, "Trump said.  Before that, China warned that it will raise equivalent tariffs immediately against the United States, if it raises import taxes to Chinese products worth $ 34,000 from this Friday.  The Chinese customs agency reported Thursday that import duties on US goods will come into effect automatically after US operations begin to operate.  "If the United States implements its tariffs, it will be adding tariffs to companies in all countries, including the Chinese and Americans," said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Gao Feng.  Gao said the tariffs proposed by the administration of President Trump will affect global supply chains, including foreign companies in the second largest global economy.  "If the United States implements its tariffs, it will be adding tariffs to companies in all countries, including the Chinese and Americans," he said.  "US measures are essentially attacking value chains and global supply chains. To put it simply, the United States is opening fire against the whole world, even against itself, "he added. "China will not bend over threats and blackmail and will not give in its determination to defend free trade and the multilateral system."  On August 18, 2017, the US Commercial Representation began an investigation of Section 301 against China, the first use of that resource since 2010. It is the most significant trade case launched by the US government, given the magnitude of Commercial losses stemming from the theft of intellectual property rights in China. A first report describes four methods that the Chinese government uses to unjustly advance its industrial policy objectives: forced transfer of intellectual property or technology; discriminatory licensing restrictions; acquisition of technology and assets coordinated or backed by the State; Likewise, use of cyber intrusions to obtain unauthorized access to confidential corporate information. Warcommercial  Employment and consumption will be beaten by the US: ICC  The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), based in Paris, France, responded to the government of Donald Trump that in the commercial war started by the United States the most affected will be "the soldiers of first line "(workers and consumers), as the increase in tariffs will result in fewer jobs, high prices and fewer product choices.  The body that brings together 45 million companies, led by John WH Denton, through a letter sent to the Department of Commerce of the United States, recognizes that it is necessary to reform the world trade system, however, abandoning the rules of the Organization World Trade (WTO) "would ignore the inclusive growth of the United States and the rest of the world."  He said it would be much more useful for everyone to intensify dialogue and commitment to find innovative ways to reform the WTO system, ensuring world trade works for everyone. "Global growth in the twenty-first century is not a sum of zero".  The business guild employing more than 1,000 million workers globally claimed that an open and stable global trade system is particularly vital to support the growth of micro and small businesses, which is the driving force behind the creation of employment in the economy of the Americans.

JOHNSON AND PERDUE DISCUSS RECENT TRIP TO CHINA AND THE CURRENT STATE OF SINO-AMERICAN RELATIONSStates News ServiceJuly 13, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1663 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Ripon Society:With China growing in power and its relationship with the U.S. being put to the test, The Ripon Society held a breakfast discussion yesterday morning to examine the state of Sino-American relations, and the trade war between the two countries that has erupted this year.Leading the discussion were three Senators who traveled to China as part of a congressional delegation this past March. The Senators included Steve Daines (MT), Ron Johnson (WI), and David Perdue (GA). Daines led the delegation, and kicked off the discussion by talking about the U.S. relationship with China and what the group saw while they were there."I think this is the most important relationship that we have," the Montana lawmaker stated. "Think about where we are going as a world and where China is headed ... The top five banks in the world today are in China. Three of the top six Internet companies in the world are in China. We've got Amazon and Google. They've got Tencent, Alibaba, JD.com."I asked that this delegation visit the technology ecosystem that is developing in China, and that's what we focused our time on. I was thrilled to have David Perdue and Ron Johnson come along. I think we all came away changed. You have one more picture of what's going on in China."Daines spent almost 30 years as a businessman before his election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2012. For five and half of those years, he lived and worked in China as an executive with Procter and Gamble.He has traveled to the country and region numerous times since, including most recently this past May, when he saw further indication of China's future growth."I took another trip back to Shanghai recently," he recalled. "I met with John Bruns, the President and CEO of Boeing. He said the top three airlines right now measured by fleet are American, Delta, and United. By 2035, it'll be China Southern and Air China. They'll displace U.S. airlines and the larger airlines around the world. So this is where it's all headed."Johnson agreed."Let's face it," he said, "the economy is made up of two things human capital and financial capital. China has 1.4 billion people. They have the financial capital now. They have the innovation. They've stolen our secrets, and they're innovating themselves. So from my standpoint, what we need to start doing is, first of all, somewhat turn the tables."Because of their intellectual property theft and because of their mercantilist way of doing business, they've been winning and the rest of the trading world has been losing. And President Trump is absolutely right to walk that line. But I don't believe we're going to have the capability of turning the tables where it's a win-lose situation where we win and they lose."Like Daines, Johnson is also a veteran of the private sector, having spent over three decades running a successful manufacturing company in Wisconsin prior to his election to the Senate in 2010. He noted that the company has been exporting to China for over 20 years. In part as a result of that experience, he understands not only the significance of the Chinese market, but why it's important for America and its allies to stick together not only to make sure the Chinese play by the rules economically, but to make sure they play a productive role with regard to global security."From my standpoint, being in a trade war with everybody is not going to work," he declared. "We ought to be allied with the rest of the trading world against China to insist that they follow the rules. It's the only way this is going to work. One last point our top priority in our relationship with China is that we need to get them to continue to maintain the sanctions against North Korea because that's an incredibly dangerous situation."Perdue concurred, and began his comments with an observation about the Chinese people."I will tell you," the Georgia Republican said. "In my opinion watching this over the last 30 years or so we got it wrong. We all got it wrong. We thought as China became more affluent, developed a middle class, and became a member of the community of nations that they would open up and liberalize ... That just hasn't happened."Perdue then turned his attention to the Chinese government and their leadership of the country in recent years."I think China has overreached," he stated matter-of-factly. "I think they misread what happened over the last decade under Barack Obama. They saw a disengagement with the rest of the world, but I think they misread America ... I think they have gotten to a point where they believe that we either can't or won't stop their march to regain the hegemon position that they had.""President Xi Jinping gave a speech a few weeks ago where he quoted Confucius ... He quoted Confucius as saying, 'Just like there can't be two suns in the sky, there can no longer be two emperors on the earth.' The word for emperor can also be hegemon. So it's very clear China sees its rightful place as the rule maker.""I believe the struggle in the world is going to be between self-determination countries and state-control countries. Today, you have two dominant state-control countries Russia, which has a very, very small economy; and China, which is a growing economy. They see themselves as the largest developing economy. They see us as the largest developed economy. And therein lies the imbalance when you start talking about trade."Perdue is the only Fortune 500 CEO in Congress and has over 40 years of business experience as the former CEO of Reebok and Dollar General stores. Like Daines, he has a first-hand understanding of what it is like to live and work in China as a result of his having served as an executive with the Sara Lee Corporation in Hong Kong in the early 1990s.Since his election to the Senate in 2014, he has also taken an interest in the military side of the U.S.-China relationship as a result of his role on the Senate Armed Services Committee, where, he said, he has gained an even better appreciation for why America's strategic alliances around the globe are so key."The allied relationships we have is what Russia and China do not have today," he observed. "I just went to the Shangri La military conference in Singapore. The number one revelation I got from that meeting was that China is absolutely prying apart the relationships that we have with our Southeast and East Asia partners. And it is devastating. It's amazing how much progress they've made. The propaganda is absolutely stronger than Russia's propaganda in Eastern Europe. I believe that's the struggle for the next 50 years."Daines echoed Perdue's remarks."David brought up a great point about how the West got China wrong," he added. "I was in Beijing interviewing students, recruiting a team for Procter and Gamble, in 1992. These students had been in Tiananmen Square, and it was giving rise to the hope somehow that the liberalization of the economy would liberalize the way the government works. The opposite has happened. It's much more authoritarian."One great way to look at that is to look at the front page of the China Daily in the '03, '08, '13, '18 elections. In '03, they put four pictures in the China Daily on the front page. In '08, it was three pictures. In '13, it was two pictures. In '18, it's one great big picture of now the President for life, Xi Jinping. We got that wrong. They are much more authoritarian. We need to keep one eye clearly on the huge opportunity that China presents for U.S. companies and business. The other eye needs to be clearly on the very real threat that China presents right now to the world order."Following their remarks, the three Senators were asked a number of questions, including one about the President's decision to impose tariffs on China and the trade war that has erupted as a result."We are at an incredibly dangerous point right now," Johnson declared. "Like French President Macron said, it just doesn't work when you're at war with everybody. And currently, we are. So I've certainly been publicly and privately encouraging this President to use this as negotiating leverage. But conclude the negotiations so that we can present a united front the rest of the trading world demanding that China follow the rules."Daines agreed."I think we can't go about this alone," he stated. "I applaud President Trump for putting disruptive forces into this relationship. It needed to be confronted. This does not end well for the United States without confronting the outright theft by China of intellectual property. That had to be confronted. However, I think a multilateral approach will be a better approach both as it relates to our Asian allies in the Asia Pacific, or whether it's NATO and the threat of Russia. I think multilateral needs to be a part of the strategic thinking longer term."Perdue credited the President with shaking up the U.S.-China relationship, but expressed similar sentiments about the need to work with our allies and avoid a go-it-alone approach."President Trump's instincts are right," the Senator and former CEO stated. "I don't like tariffs. But it's disruptive you've got their attention. It was obvious when we were meeting these top leaders from Li Keqiang, premier of China, on down, that we have their attention. I think they misread the eight years of Barack Obama. They saw a disengagement with the rest of the world. This guy Trump comes back in and says, 'Wait a minute, NATO we're going to pull out if you don't start paying your fair share.' It's a $400 billion delta that we've been subsidizing Europe on national defense. We have an uneven playing field with regard to trade. President Trump is disrupting that. The Chinese are nervous about that. They're vulnerable right now. They've got a lot of debt, you can't see it because it's pushed down in the SOE's, it's pushed down into other quasi-companies like that. They need our markets right now."Load-Date: July 13, 2018End of Document

Nigeria Has Benefited Over $5b From China-Africa Cooperation - BuhariThe Will (Nigeria)September 4, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 The Will Newspaper All Rights ReservedLength: 550 wordsBody Nigeria's partnership with China through the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) has resulted in the execution of vital infrastructure projects across the country, valued at over $5 billion in the last three years of the current administration.This was disclosed by President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday in Beijing at the FOCAC Round Table meeting, attended by African leaders and Chinese President Xi Jinping.Highlighting specific projects under FOCAC, the President said through the Chinese support, Nigeria has impressively addressed significant challenges in the areas of infrastructure, human capacity development, power, transport, agriculture and humanitarian assistance.According to him, 'For Nigeria, our partnership with China through the FOCAC platform, has resulted in the construction of the first urban rail system in West Africa. This $500 million project in Abuja was commissioned in July this year.'The President also cited the construction and operation of the first rail system in Africa that uses modern Chinese standards and technology.'This 180km rail line that connects Abuja and Kaduna was commissioned two years ago at a cost of $500 million. Today the rail line is functioning efficiently with no issues - indeed, a sign that Chinese technology is world class,' he noted.President Buhari said that, 'Nigeria is leveraging Chinese funding to execute $3.4 billion worth of projects at various stages of completion. These include the upgrading of airport terminals, the Lagos - Kano rail line, the Zungeru hydroelectric power project and fibre cables for our internet infrastructure.'Furthermore, less than 3 months ago, Nigeria signed an additional $1billion loan from China for additional rolling stock for the newly constructed rail lines as well as road rehabilitation and water supply projects'.The Nigerian leader said that the aforementioned projects had demonstrated the high level of consistency and commitment China has shown in boosting its relations with African countries under the umbrella of FOCAC.'I am optimistic that this Summit will offer new opportunities that would build on these past achievements,' he said, adding that, 'Nigeria will continue to support the FOCAC initiative and also seek to key into the Belt and Road Initiative as an additional Chinese mechanism to build further cooperation in our quest for infrastructural and economic development.'President Buhari dispelled insinuations about the so-called death trap by Chinese government on developing countries, insisting that Nigeria would be able to re-pay the loans.'These vital infrastructure projects synchronize perfectly with our Economic Recovery and Growth Plan. Some of the debts incurred are self-liquidating. Our country is able to re-pay loans as and when due in keeping with our policy of fiscal prudence and sound housekeeping,' he said.While applauding China for its overall commitment to the ideals of FOCAC, the President acknowledged that since the launch of the Forum in 2000, China and Africa had striven to implement the declarations and follow-up action plans for the benefit of both parties.President Buhari also commended President Jinping, his Government and people for successfully hosting the Beijing Summit aimed at further strengthening China-Africa partnership.Load-Date: September 5, 2018End of Document

Sen. Rubio Discusses China's Oppression of Uyghur Muslims in XinjiangTargeted News ServiceAugust 23, 2018 Thursday 8:02 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 732 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: MIAMI, Florida BodyThe office of Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, issued the following news release:U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) appeared on Fox News' Tucker Carlson Tonight to discuss the Chinese government's oppression of Uyghur Muslims in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, including the existence of "political re-education camps' where upwards of 800,000 to 1 million people are arbitrarily detained.Rubio recently wrote an op-ed on China's campaign against these and other Muslim minorities. Last month, Rubio chaired a Congressional-Executive Commission On China hearing on the serious and deteriorating human rights situation faced by Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang. In February, following reports detailing Chinese authorities' data-banking efforts, Rubio raised concerns with Thermo Fisher Scientific, an American company supplying DNA sequencing equipment to Xinjiang police.A rough transcript of Rubio's remarks are transcribed below.VIDEO: RUBIO DISCUSSES CHINA'S OPPRESSION OF UYGHUR MUSLIMS IN XINJIANG (https://youtu.be/ZVsJWCMu5XI)RUBIO: It's absolutely true. In fact, one of the outrages here - pictures from Google Earth show us these camps. And so we read these reports about Google looking to partner up in China again, going back to China, but it's their own pictures that have revealed this reality to the world. They open these places up, they call them re-education camps, where they are basically forcing people to change their names and do all sorts of things. By the way, there's no history of radicalism among this community of Uyghurs, that's the first point. But here's the outrage. Number one: American companies and western companies that have sold surveillance technology that allowed them to sort of put people through this, including an American DNA company - they're collecting the DNA of these individuals by the way as well forcefully, and using potentially American technology to do it. And what about the Arab world, and the Muslim world and all these countries in the Middle East. Not a single one of them. You know they are always the first to stand up and speak when there's a ban on travel and this or that but they've been totally silent on this issue and the answer is money. There is all this Chinese money flowing all over the world, they're bribing governments and in this case buying their silence on these atrocious, outrageous human rights violations that give us insight into the true nature of the regime - President Xi in China....In fact it's not mentioned at all in international forums either. Last week, finally, for the first time they were confronted with it and the Chinese were forced to answer some questions by an international organization. But not by some of these countries, many of whom said very little of anything. And if they've said it, it's been very benign - nothing forceful. In essence, if there were a million people of any religion being rounded up anywhere in the world by a western nation, I assure you you'd be hearing about it and rightfully so. But in this case, because these countries have leaders, many of whom have either taken bribes from the Chinese or there's Chinese investment involved and promises of more money to come, they have been able to buy their silence. Hypocrisy, outrageous and unacceptable, and I'm glad that this Administration is looking into doing something about it....Well I think there's a general lack of awareness. We've talked about this before on your program and I'm glad you're paying so much attention to it. A significant percentage of the American people are starting to wake up to the reality that for the first time since 1991 we have a near-peer competitor in the world, and that's China. They don't seek to compete with us - they seek to overtake us, to replace us in the world. And sadly, we still have American corporations and companies that are so interested in doing business and making money in China that they don't care about it. So you have tech companies that won't partner with the Pentagon on defense projects, but partner with a Chinese university that works for their military and who want us to cave. I call the president at least once a week and just continue to encourage him, because this is the first time any administration has finally stood up to China after years and years of abuse and looking the other way.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6418380 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: August 24, 2018End of Document

China denies arrival of censored Google search engineCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 2, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 462 wordsBody Official Chinese media denied that Google is going to launch a censored browser in China, amid reports in that direction that generated concern among civil rights advocates.  The news portal The Intercept published that Google is designing an Android application that would comply with China's strict censorship. The New York Times confirmed that information from knowledgeable sources of the plans of the state company. We recommend you: Google will launch a censored search engine in China According to these media, the Google app would censor information related to human rights, democracy and religion, topics banned by the so-called Great Wall of the Internet. The application called Dragonfly, was shown to the Chinese government and could be launched in the next few months if approved by Beijing, they said.  However, a Chinese state newspaper denied that information. "It is worth mentioning that since last year there are rumors of the possible return of Google to China," says the China Securities Daily, which belongs to the state security watchdog. "The journalist has just confirmed that Google's return to China is not true," he says.  The Internet giant withdrew from China in 2010 in response to censorship imposed by the Asian government. But recently he made several inroads into the Chinese market, launching a game and opening an artificial intelligence center. China is the largest digital market in the world, with 772 million Internet users.  In a statement, Google explained that it works with several apps in China, such as its translation service Google Translate or Files Go, which works with Chinese developers and invested in Chinese companies such as digital retailer JD.com. "But we do not comment on speculation about future plans," he said.  Human rights groups were concerned about the information. They believe that if Google accepts censorship in Beijing, it would be a serious blow to already scarce freedom of expression in China and would give the government the possibility of accessing user data.  "It will be a black day for freedom on the Internet," said Patrick Poon, Amnesty International researcher. "Send a signal that no one is struggling to face censorship," he added.  China's cybersecurity law requires companies to archive personal information of users in the country and help authorities in their investigations.  "It is alarming that Google appears to be developing this censored version of a search engine in the midst of harsh human rights measures in China," said Maya Wang of Human Rights Watch.  China not only censors Google but also social networks such as Facebook, Twitter or YouTube, the WhatsApp messaging app and media such as The New York Times or The Wall Street Journal.  It may interest you...  RL  ?  ? Load-Date: August 2, 2018End of Document

The Deleted WeChat Post That Fueled China's Vaccine ScandalAtlantic OnlineJuly 25, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 863 wordsByline: Sarah Zhang and Karen YuanBodyA vaccine scandal in China began building slowly and then suddenly, this weekend, it was everywhere at once.The story began back in November, when a large vaccine manufacturer called Changsheng Biotechnology Co. was forced to recall 252,600 ineffective doses of vaccines for DPT (diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus). Then earlier this July, a government investigation caught Changsheng            falsifying data about its rabies vaccine, and a local food and drug administration fined the company 3.44 million yuan, or approximately $500,000, over the faulty DPT vaccines.Over the weekend, an anonymous post recounting all this and more went viral on the Chinese social network WeChat. In addition to the recent developments, it alleged a complex web of corruption that went back decades, involving other vaccines for hepatitis B and chicken pox. The post was deleted the next day.But by then, a full-blown national scandal had erupted. The Chinese government this week scrambled to put out statements assuring a prompt investigation. President Xi Jinping described the situation as "           vile and shocking." Police on Monday announced the swift arrest of            four of the company's executives, including its chairwoman.Changsheng's vaccines have not yet been tied to any deaths or illnesses, but the story caught on because it so perfectly echoed many scandals that have rocked China in recent years. In 2016, for example, a hospital pharmacist sold two million doses of vaccines improperly stored in an "           overheated, dilapidated storeroom." That came after scandals over tainted            milk,            infant formula,            pork,            cooking oil, and            water. The scandals, one after another, have undermined trust in the government's ability to keep the public safe."People in leadership aren't doing their best by the people,"            one user commented on Weibo, a Twitter-like Chinese social network. "It's a series of scandals about fake baby formula, fake vaccines,            child abuse in daycares, sexual assault ... everything we eat, wear, and use endangers us.""My children already drink imported baby formula, now they need to start getting imported vaccines," said            another Weibo user. "Might as well leave the country for all our health needs." Since 2008, when formula tainted with the chemical melamine killed six babies and sickened 300,000 more, Chinese parents have been wary of domestic formula. Those who can go to Hong Kong to            buy infant formula. And since news of the faulty vaccines broke, clinics in Hong Kong have been fielding calls from panicked parents in mainland China. One Hong Kong clinic            told the South China Morning Post that its phone had been ringing nonstop.By Tuesday, Weibo users had viewed hashtags related to the vaccine scandal more than 600 million times,            according to The Guardian. A Weibo post from the state-run newspaper People's Daily            urged calm over the matter. "Don't spread panic and anger. Relevant departments must respond in a timely manner with updates," read the headline.The now-deleted WeChat post-which still lives on in parts of the internet, such as            on the Ethereum blockchain-was not restrained. In a conspiratorial tone, it spins a long, complicated tale of shareholders, eye-popping profits, mistresses, and more. At times, the language is unflinchingly direct: "Experts at the Peking University Health Science Center summarized the act of injecting the ineffective vaccines in people in one word: murder." And it made the story viscerally relevant to readers: "The vaccines they produce are flowing every day into you and your child's bodies."WeChat is ubiquitous in Chinese life, and it has become a major and decentralized source of news in China. (The app is essentially a messaging app, but it has features of Facebook, iMessage, Instagram, Venmo and Skype all rolled into one.) Columbia Journalism Review recently highlighted how the platform has enabled            the rise of independent writers untethered to legacy media outlets. But it has also enabled a type of news that thrives on social media. "Heavy on emotion and light on accuracy, the most-read and shared stories on the WeChat platform are often selective with details,"            writes Mia Shuang Li in CJR. Hoaxes such as stories about foods causing cancer            flourish on the platform. Fake news on WeChat is such a problem that            fact-checking sites have also sprung up.One section of the now-deleted WeChat post recounts the death of several babies after hepatitis B vaccinations in 2013. Those widely publicized deaths set off a panic of their own. A            subsequent government investigation published in The International Journal of Epidemiology concluded that the babies died of unrelated causes-and that one other baby suffered an allergic shock from the vaccine but recovered. "The timeliness of the investigation and its communication may have played an important role in regaining confidence and use of hepatitis B vaccine," the study's authors concluded.The anonymous WeChat post in fact mentions that the investigation cleared the vaccine-and also mentions that it was government investigators who cleared it. For readers in China, trust in the investigation only goes as far as their trust in the government that conducted it.Load-Date: July 26, 2018End of Document

Tour Chinese operators will arrive in PanamaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 12, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 654 wordsBody        With the purpose of knowing the tourist destinations of the country and conducting rounds of negotiations with their Panamanian counterparts, on September 13, about 10 tour operators from Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China, will arrive in the country.  This would be the first official contact with local tour operators, after the authorization of the Chinese government to start commercial relations with the 66 Panamanian A-type companies (tour operators) that meet the requirements established after signing the Memorandum of Understanding to facilitate travel groups from China to Panama between both nations.  The visit of the tour operators is organized by Air China in collaboration with the Tourism Authority of Panama (ATP), which will be responsible for the eight-day fam trip that will include emblematic tourist sites of the capital city and the interior of the country.  Sandra Chan, in charge of the promotion of Panama for the Chinese market, indicated that it is the first time that these internationally recognized Chinese tourism companies visit the country, such as: CTRIP, CYTS and Beijing Universal Travel Service, among others, and that they are interested in doing business, knowing tourist places and the infrastructures in which the tourists that will come from China will lodge.  He stressed that the idea is that both local tour operators and those in China begin to establish commercial relations and, precisely for this purpose, negotiations will be held in the capital city, as well as in Bocas del Toro, Boquete (Chiriquí) and Chitré ( Herrera) where they will also hold meetings with the tourism chambers of these regions.  The official said that the ATP is currently working on the promotion of the country's tourism products in the main social networks of China Weibo and Wechat, which reach more than 768 million users per month. He added that the VisitPanama website in China is already available.  On Friday, September 14, at 8:00 in the morning, the first round of business will be held with the 66 Panamanian companies that will have the opportunity to exhibit their products to attract and capture the Chinese market.  That same day, in the capital city, the representatives of Chinese companies will be accompanied by a tour guide to the Miraflores Visitors Center and the Panama Interoceanic Canal Museum. The tour will also cover the Old Town of the capital city. Then they will meet with the directors of the National Chamber of Tourism of Panama (CAMTUR).  In Bocas del Toro, tour operators will know the spectacular beaches of crystalline waters of Isla Colón and Isla Bastimento, as well as the quality of the lodging service that is offered in both destinations.  In Boquete, Chiriqui, they will participate in the honey tour and walk through farms, where tour operators will taste Panamanian coffee in a tasting, and craft beer.  In the province of Herrera, in Chitré, a tour of towns and hotels was scheduled; In addition, they will know how to make the typical costume of Panamanian women and goldsmiths.  Back in the capital city, on September 19, they will tour the Embera Quera community, where they will learn about their culture and traditional dances and the craftsmen will present their products. Then, in an expedition by boat through Lake Gatún, you will experience the crossing of the boats through the Canal until you reach Mono Island, where you will have that contact with the flora and fauna of the place. The visit of the Chinese tour operators will culminate in the Biomuseo, in Amador.  According to the World Tourism Organization, China is the largest tourist market in the world and is ranked among the five countries with the highest rate of expenditure. The same organization points out that China evidences a sectorTourism boom: trips abroad have increased 270% and it is forecast that by 2020 reach 200 million departures. Load-Date: September 12, 2018End of Document

China hits Amazon&#39;s businessCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 21, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 461 wordsBody        James Griffiths  NEW YORK - The world's most popular service for live video game streaming may have lost a large potential market.  Twitch, owned by Amazon, is no longer accessible to users within China. It also disappeared from Apple's iOS app store in China.  A Twitch spokesman confirmed on Friday that the service, which allows users to watch and broadcast video games, has been blocked in China, but he did not comment further. The country's Internet regulator, China's Cyberspace Administration, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Read: .  The decision comes after the broadcast service became the third most popular free application in the Chinese iOS store, according to analytics firm App Annie.  That increase in popularity was the result of Chinese eSports fans who used Twitch to watch their country compete in the Asian Games last month, the first time the event had video game competitions. According to the Abacus technology news site based in Hong Kong, Chinese fans were upset that state television was not covering the event and turned to Twitch massively.  Read: .  The live streaming service, acquired by Amazon in 2014 for almost $ 1 billion, joins a series of foreign platforms that are blocked by China's vast censorship apparatus known as the Great Firewall. Among the platforms are YouTube, Facebook and Twitter.  It was likely that Twitch faced problems in China sooner or later. Authorities have repeatedly suppressed live streaming services, imposing strict restrictions on popular platforms and users.  Read: .  China is notoriously sensitive about foreign companies that provide media content in their territory, unless they accept the kind of strict censorship that local firms accept. In 2016, the Chinese services of Disney and Apple closed because the government tightened the regulations governing online content, such as videos, games and books.  The reverse of Twitch comes at a time when the Chinese government began to take a harder line towards the gaming industry. Regulators have stopped approving licenses that allow online games to collect money from customers.  Last month, the government said it planned to limit the number of new online games and would put restrictions on the amount of time children and teenagers can spend playing with them.  Read: .  The measures erased tens of billions of dollars from the market value of Chinese Internet company Tencent, which has a huge gaming business.  China is the largest gaming market in the world, accounting for a quarter of the world's revenue, according to market research firm Newzoo. The firm predicts that China's total gaming revenues will reach 38 billion dollars this year.  - Serenitie Wang and Sherisse Pham contributed to this report Load-Date: September 21, 2018End of Document

From president to dictatorThe Oracle: Oral Roberts UniversityJuly 16, 2018 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 391 wordsByline: Caleb SmithBodyOn Sunday, Feb. 25, the Chinese Communist Party announced that it was proposing the removal or term limits inside of a clause in their constitution made in 1982, which limits presidential terms to two five-year periods.There are two main authoritative states inside of the Chinese government: The People's Republic of China and the Chinese Communist Party . The PRC is a state that lies inside of the CCP, which itself is the main authoritative rule in China. The values of both parties appeal to nationalism, patriotism and social stability. The total members of the CCP amount to 6.45 percent of China's population by the most recent 2016 statistic, which in total is around 82 million people.President Xi Jinping was elected Chair of the Military Commission, General Secretary of the Communist Party and President of the People's Republic of China in 2013. He continues to hold office in all these positions today. Both the positions of General Secretary and Chair of the Military do not include term limits, and this most recent proposal will permit full, lifelong rule over all three of these positions after the end of his second term in 2023.Among recent events in China involving Jinping, one of the most impactful is the "Belt and Road Initiative", which is a one-trillion-dollar plan to help globalize China's trade by a massive infrastructure train line spanning more than 60 countries. Additional events include Jinping raising the military budget by eight percent and a heavier focus on domestic security due to greater than expected economic growth.Along with these new events and proposals, the CCP also instituted an internet-wide censorship on key-words and phrases on China's Twitter-like website, "Sina Weibo." The list of these words and phrases includes: "I don't agree," "migration," "emigration," "re-election," "election term," "constitutional amendment," "constitution rules," and "proclaiming oneself an emperor." The name "Winnie the Pooh" is also censored as it's a nickname Chinese social media users give Jinping.Many media outlets perceive China's advancements as a two-in-one globalization movement and internal power-grab.

OPEN LETTER URGES GOOGLE NOT TO CAPITULATE ON HUMAN RIGHTS TO GAIN ACCESS TO CHINAStates News ServiceAugust 28, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 363 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, NY BodyThe following information was released by Amnesty International USA:Google's reported plans to launch a censored search engine app in China would represent an alarming capitulation on human rights, and could have devastating consequences in a country where people are routinely persecuted for expressing their views, Amnesty International and other human rights groups said today.In an open letter to Google's CEO Sundar Pichai, published on Tuesday, Amnesty International and 13 other human rights groups are calling on Google to answer basic questions about an app, known internally as "Project Dragonfly", which would block certain websites and search terms to fit with Chinese state censorship rules. Details of the app were published by The Intercept on 1 August, but Google has so far failed to respond publicly."The Chinese government runs one of the world's most repressive internet censorship and surveillance regimes. It is simply not acceptable for Google's senior executives to keep quiet when the company is reported to be considering actively participating in the violations of the rights to freedom of expression and privacy for millions of people in China," said Anna Bacciarelli, Technology and Human Rights Researcher at Amnesty International."In 2010 Google withdrew from China citing restrictions on freedom of expression. Since then the Chinese government has tightened its stranglehold on internet freedom, but Google seems to have U-turned on its principles. Is Sundar Pichai prepared to reaffirm Google's past commitments not to introduce censored search? Or is he going to capitulate and accommodate human rights abuses in order to gain access to the Chinese market?"In the open letter the NGOs call on Google to:Reaffirm the company's 2010 commitment not to provide censored search engine services in China;Disclose its position on censorship in China and what steps, if any, Google is taking to safeguard against human rights violations linked to Project Dragonfly and its other Chinese mobile app offerings;Guarantee protections for whistle-blowers and other employees speaking out where they see the company is failing its commitments to human rights.Load-Date: August 28, 2018End of Document

CHINA JAILS TWO POLITICAL REFUGEES SENT HOME FROM THAILAND AFTER SECRET TRIALStates News ServiceJuly 25, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 825 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Authorities in the southwestern Chinese mega-city of Chongqing have tried in secret and jailed two rights activists sent home from Thailand as they were awaiting resettlement as political refugees, prompting an international outcry.Dong Guangping and Jiang Yefei fled with their families to Thailand in 2015, and were granted refugee status by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees office in Bangkok.But as they awaited resettlement in a third country, they were handed over to China by the Thai police, in a move that drew strong criticism from the U.N.Dong and Jiang were both found guilty of "incitement to subvert state power" and "illegally crossing a national border" by a court in Chongqing.Jiang received a six-and-a-half-year jail term, while Dong was sentenced to three-and-a-half years, their relatives said, citing phone calls with police and online reports.Jiang's wife Chu Ling and Dong's wife Gu Shuhua and daughter Dong Xuerui flew to Canada from Bangkok for resettlement as political refugees just days after the two men were repatriated.Gu told RFA on Wednesday that she has still received no official notification of her husband's trial or sentence from the authorities.She said she had learned his fate from a July 13 Facebook post by the China News Service."I read that news item online," Gu said. "The [ruling] Chinese Communist Party isn't going to send the families any notification at all. We weren't even notified of his detention or formal arrest." No legal documents or lawyer She added: "None of the legal documents were available ... I heard that the trial was held on July 26 , 2017, but that Dong didn't have a lawyer at that time."The China News Service report said the court found that, "between May 2009 and October 2015 , the defendant Jiang Yefei subverted the power of the Chinese state and sought to overthrow the socialist system, and in Thailand joined several overseas organizations aimed at overthrowing Chinese state."It said Dong Guangping had joined and helped Jiang Yefei to cross the border into neighboring Laos from China's southwestern province of Yunnan, bypassing border inspections, and traveling from there to Bangkok."[Jiang] participated in two occasions on activities aimed at subverting the Chinese government and overthrowing socialism," the report said.According to Gu, the activities referred to in the report were small gatherings that could have had no such effect."I would like to protest in the strongest terms the persecution visited upon Dong Guangping and upon us, his family, by the Chinese Communist Party," she said. "Dong Guangping is innocent.""How could a gathering of the kind [attended by Dong and Jiang] lead to the overthrow of the entire Communist Party state machinery?" she said. "Which government did it subvert?""I call upon the Chinese Communist Party to release Dong Guangping and to drop the charges against him; which I dismiss totally," Gu added. Secret trial Dong's former lawyer, Chang Boyang, said he was denied permission to meet with his client when he showed up at the Chongqing No. 2 Detention Center last July."This trial went against the principle of openness; it was tantamount to a secret trial that the outside world knew nothing about," Chang said. "It is unclear if they had the support of any lawyer.""I filed a complaint at the political and legal affairs committee [about not being given access to Dong] but they didn't give me any information at all," he said. "Everything and everyone was kept totally in the dark.""This kind of trial goes against all the legal rules and regulations, because defendants in a secret trial have no access to a legal defense."Zhengzhou democracy activist Chen Wei said Jiang's sister was only told on Tuesday , after making repeated phone calls to police."They then told her that they weren't obliged to give her any other details," Chen said. "This entire case has been prosecuted behind the scenes ... over a period of three years."He said the men's families had been denied permission to send them money or clothing to meet their daily needs during three years of pretrial detention."The real reason the trial wasn't an open one was that they didn't have any evidence, and that neither of them would 'confess' to their 'crimes'," he said.Dong had been a prominent rights activist before his initial detention in May 2014 , after he participated in memorials for late ousted premier Zhao Ziyang, late reformist premier Hu Yaobang, and the People's Liberation Army (PLA) massacre of civilians that put an end to weeks of student protest on Tiananmen Square in June 1989 .After his release on bail, pending trial, Dong fled China in September 2015, only to be sent back to China with Jiang the following November.

Senate Commerce Subcommittee Issues Testimony From Business RoundtableTargeted News ServiceJuly 31, 2018 Tuesday 5:17 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2673 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation subcommittee on Communications, Technology, Innovation and the Internet issued the following testimony by Denise Zheng, vice president at the Business Roundtable, at a hearing entitled "The Internet and Digital Communications: Examining the Impact of Global Internet Governance":"Chairman Wicker, Ranking Member Schatz, Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify on behalf of Business Roundtable regarding international policies related to the internet and digital platforms - more broadly referred to as "information and communications technology" (ICT) - and their impact on competitiveness, investment, and innovation."Business Roundtable is an association of chief executive officers (CEOs) of the world's largest multinational companies. Collectively, our member companies employ more than 16 million people across all sectors of the economy. It is a commonly held misperception that ICT policies only affect the technology industry. The reality is that few companies can compete and succeed today without making extensive and effective use of data and digital platforms."Recently there has been a rapid increase in the number of complex, conflicting, and uncoordinated ICT public policies from governments around the world. This trend undermines global digital innovation and trade by creating policy and regulatory fragmentation, business uncertainty, overwhelming compliance costs, and other unintended consequences.Trends in Global ICT Policy"Governments have a responsibility to develop ICT policies that provide for national security, protect public safety, and ensure individual privacy. But too often, countries are defining security, privacy, and safety in an overly broad manner, resulting in a wide array of laws and regulations that erect barriers to an interoperable and open global internet. In some cases, nations impose ICT policies for the stated purpose of cybersecurity and privacy, even though the policies are designed primarily to keep U.S. companies out and protect local industries. In other cases, the global patchwork of various cybersecurity and privacy requirements creates a compliance nightmare that is cumbersome and costly for large companies and impossible for small companies and startups."The European Union (EU) and China are currently the most active players in developing and implementing ICT policies. But India, Russia, South Korea, and other Asian and Latin American countries are ramping up efforts to develop and enforce a wide range of cybersecurity, privacy, and data localization policies. Already at least 34 different countries have data localization requirements, while approximately 120 countries have data privacy laws and many more countries are considering legislation in this area.1"The following sections highlight a selection of ICT policies that have a significant impact on Business Roundtable members and other U.S.-based companies.Data Localization"China has the most aggressive data localization laws. China's Cybersecurity Law that went into effect in June 2017 requires all "important information" and "personal information" to be stored in China. Under this regime, "network operators" are prohibited from transferring covered data outside of China without undergoing a government-mandated security assessment. As currently defined, the law could cover any entity that owns or operates a computer network and applies to a vast and ambiguous assortment of different types of data."China is not the only country with data localization requirements: India, Russia, Nigeria, and South Korea all have enacted laws that prohibit the transfer of a range of business and consumer data outside of their respective jurisdictions. In some cases, these laws mandate physical servers be installed in-country as a condition of doing business."This growing number of localization requirements is already proving costly for many industry sectors, including health, retail, finance, insurance, energy, manufacturing, and technology."These mandates are making it increasingly difficult for U.S. companies to do business in key markets such as Asia and Latin America.Cybersecurity"Cybersecurity regulations are expanding globally. For example, China, which has some of the most heavy-handed regulations, requires companies in industries deemed to be "critical" to demonstrate that their technology systems are "secure and controllable." Such companies must undergo inspections and assessments of company networks and are mandated to disclose computer program source code to the Chinese government for review. The European Council recently proposed a new cybersecurity regulation (the EU Cybersecurity Act) that would create a security certification regime for ICT products and services. If the law takes a mandatory, rather than voluntary, approach, it could have the effect of dictating how American firms design, develop, manufacture, and deliver ICT products and services."The financial services sector, in particular, faces an expanding number of international cybersecurity regulations, with more than 40 different international cybersecurity policies already in place,2 ranging from risk assessments to penetration testing to incident reporting. In this environment, companies must reconcile competing and redundant cybersecurity regulations that divert significant resources from truly effective cybersecurity measures toward time-consuming compliance activity, such as certifications and questionnaires.Privacy"In May 2018, the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect and established the most expansive privacy regime in the world. The GDPR covers nearly all types of personal data and affects business-to-consumer as well as business-to-business firms. The GDPR has an extraterritorial application meaning that its scope covers any company, regardless of whether it is based in the EU or not, that meets the law's threshold requirements for processing personal data of individuals in the EU."This means that some companies, such as those that cannot justify spending the resources necessary to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR, are forced to take steps to block EU-based users from using their products and services, including from visiting their websites, to avoid facing steep fines of up to 20 million euros or 4 percent of annual revenue, whichever is higher."The GDPR limits transfers of personal data outside of the EU unless certain adequacy standards are met; it also requires companies to notify EU and national regulators of security breaches of personal data within 72 hours of the incident."The EU is actively promoting the adoption of the GDPR as a model for privacy regulations in other countries. In addition, Brazil and other Latin American countries are proposing or have enacted laws that adopt many aspects of the GDPR."The risk of domestic regulatory fragmentation within the United States for privacy is also high."In addition to several existing sector-specific federal and state privacy regulations, California recently passed a consumer privacy bill that applies broadly across many sectors. Numerous other data privacy legislative proposals are pending in state legislatures that, if passed, would further increase the complexity of privacy regulations across the United States. That is why Business Roundtable is working to develop privacy principles that strengthens protections for consumers but also preserves innovation in the digital economy.Government Access to Data"The growth of digital communications over the past two decades has created new challenges as well as opportunities for law enforcement. For instance, several countries have sought to restrict the use of encryption or imposed data localization mandates to facilitate law enforcement's access to data for investigative purposes or government surveillance."Both China and Russia mandate companies decrypt and localize data for law enforcement and surveillance. In 2016, Russia passed a law that explicitly required internet service providers to provide backdoor access to encrypted data and store all consumer communications for six months. France, the United Kingdom, Brazil, India, and other countries have also enacted laws that regulate the use of encryption in digital communications."Not only do these laws erode security and privacy on the internet, they also have a significant impact on the interoperability of digital platforms across borders and undermine consumer trust in technology.Consequences of Uncoordinated International ICT Policies"The current state of global ICT policy is complex, chaotic, and fragmented and could undermine growth and innovation in the digital economy and emerging technologies.Fragmentation and Legal Uncertainty"As CEOs that run the largest American companies, Business Roundtable members operate in many jurisdictions and serve customers around the globe. The international regulatory environment for ICT policy is forcing companies across all sectors to reconcile overlapping, duplicative, and sometimes conflicting requirements. The legal uncertainty that results from policy and regulatory fragmentation undermines investment, growth, and job creation."Ambiguous requirements and inconsistent enforcement in some countries increases the risk of doing business and can lead companies to reject, defer, or reconsider investments.Compliance Costs"The GDPR alone is estimated to cost Fortune 500 companies a combined $7.8 billion to comply, or about $16 million per firm.3 Another survey found that large organizations of 25,000 or more employees each are budgeting an average of $30 million to comply with the GDPR. Much of the cost is related to "check the box" exercises that demand significant investment from companies regardless of their risk profile. Some companies have decided to discontinue offering products and services in the EU because compliance costs are so high that they can no longer justify being in the market. It is not unusual for those surfing the web in the EU to come across websites from vendors that have nothing more than a note saying that due to GDPR requirements, the site cannot be accessed."Data localization requirements can impose significant compliance burdens that raise the cost of hosting data by 30 to 60 percent for companies that are covered by such requirements.4 A study done by the European Centre for International Political Economy estimates that enacted or proposed data localization mandates in China could cost up to 1.1 percent of its GDP and the cost of data localization requirements in the EU could cost nearly 0.4 percent of its GDP.5Unintended Consequences"A fragmented international ICT policy landscape will likely have the most significant and adverse impact on startups and small- and medium-size companies with limited resources to navigate ambiguous requirements and opaque reviews in countries like China or excessive paperwork associated with complying with EU policies. These compliance costs will make it more difficult for such promising and innovative companies to thrive and expand."Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and blockchain are also hindered by regulatory uncertainty and are the next likely targets for policy and regulatory fragmentation."The data minimization, automated decision-making, and "right to erasure" provisions of the GDPR can create barriers to the commercial development of important emerging technologies which improve and innovate new products and services for consumers. I will give you two specific examples of this: First, the GDPR imposes restrictions at every stage that a company collects, processes, uses, and retains personal data, and the impact of these restrictions on the development of machine learning tools is uncertain. Some companies may decline to integrate machine learning into their business to avoid such hurdles. Second, companies using blockchain and distributed ledger systems, technologies rooted in the notion that information should not be unilaterally amended or deleted from networks, will face difficulty in responding to data subject requests, authorized by the GDPR, to amend and delete their own data.Recommendations"Congress has an important role in creating and fostering a global policy environment for an open, interoperable, and global internet and to promote the continued economic growth of the digital economy. To that end, Business Roundtable recommends the following actions:* Establish Alliances with Like-Minded Countries to Counter Protectionist ICT Policies. The U.S. government should build alliances with like-minded countries to counter technology restrictions, protectionist cybersecurity and data localization requirements, and requirements for businesses to transfer technology and intellectual property as a condition to accessing foreign markets.* Lead in Development of International Norms, Best Practices, and Standards for ICT. The U.S. government and U.S. companies should lead in developing norms, best practices, and standards for the internet and digital platforms. Areas of focus include cybersecurity, privacy, and cross-border data flows. At the same time, emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, blockchain, internet of things, and robotics require serious attention, because rules do not yet exist.* Seek to Align or Harmonize Requirements to Avoid Global Fragmentation. In the face of an already fragmented environment, the U.S. government should play a leadership role to align or harmonize where possible existing ICT policies, regulations, and standards globally, and maintain that same approach for emerging technologies to avoid costly fragmentation. The United States cannot afford to be missing from important international forums on ICT issues, as China and other countries are actively seeking to rewrite the rules of the internet and digital economy that are fundamentally at odds with open markets and democratic values.* Protect Transatlantic Cross-Border Flows. Congress should act to protect the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield by making the Privacy Shield Ombudsperson a permanent position of the U.S. Department of State. It should also act swiftly to confirm the nominees for the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, which plays a critical role in fulfilling the requirements of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield."Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Schatz and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to present Business Roundtable's views on information and communications technology and their impact on competitiveness, investment, and innovation. The global policy environment around ICT represents a serious concern to leaders of these American companies that drive economic growth and job creation in the United States and across the world."* * *Footnotes:1 Pfeifle, S.

Sen. Hassan Presses Google Representative on Reports the Company is Working on a Search Engine for ChinaTargeted News ServiceSeptember 26, 2018 Wednesday 7:50 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 393 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe office of Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-New Hampshire, issued the following news release:Senator Maggie Hassan today pressed a representative from Google on recent reports (https://www.axios.com/google-china-search-engine-protests-1537390068-88bb3ffb-7f5a-467f-9170-a330553d1ad1.html) that Google is working on a search engine for China that would provide compromised results, during a hearing of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee. The Senator emphasized concerns that doing so would not only enable the Chinese government to continue censorship, but also to continue carrying out human rights abuses against its citizens."I am disturbed, though, by reports that Google is currently working on a search engine for China that would conform with the rigid censorship requirements of the Chinese regime," Senator Hassan stated. "The search engine would apparently link user's searches to their personal phone numbers, both making it easier for the Chinese government to track and monitor its citizens, and to develop their so-called social credit scores, where citizens can be denied any number of things, from travel to access to school."Noting that Google has failed to provide specific answers to questions from both Democrats and Republicans in Congress on its plan to implement this search engine, Senator Hassan asked, "How will Google square its stated privacy values, with this flawed Chinese search engine and the very real possibility that it may be used to repress human rights?Keith Enright, Chief Privacy Officer at Google, responded, "My understanding is that we are not, in fact, close to launching a search product in China, and whether we would or could at some point in the future remains unclear. If we were in fact to finalize a plan to launch a search product in China, my team would be actively engaged. Our privacy and security controls would be followed, and any such project or product would follow and be consistent with our values around privacy and data protection, as I've described them here today."Senator Hassan urged Mr. Enright and Google to keep members of Congress updated about what kind of work they are doing with China, particularly if they are "contemplating building a tool that could be used by a totalitarian regime to repress human rights."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6459164 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: September 27, 2018End of Document

Google: Safeguard Rights in ChinaTargeted News ServiceAugust 28, 2018 Tuesday 7:32 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 818 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: SAN FRANCISCO, California BodyHuman Rights Watch issued the following news release:Google should not offer censored search services in China and should protect employee whistleblowers who raise ethical concerns, Human Rights Watch and other organizations and advocates said in a letter released today."Google has promised to respect human rights and only develop technology that benefits society," said Cynthia Wong, senior internet researcher at Human Rights Watch. "Yet Google has failed to explain how it will shield users from the Chinese government's efforts to monitor and suppress dissent."The joint letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai follows media reports on August 1, 2018, that the company is developing a mobile search app as part of a project codenamed Dragonfly that would comply with Chinese censorship and other legal requirements. The letter, signed by over a dozen human rights groups and individuals, calls on Pichai to clarify Google's approach to China and what steps it is taking to safeguard users from the Chinese government's abusive censorship and surveillance regimes.Human Rights Watch previously called on Google to refrain from exchanging user rights for access to China's market. On August 3, six US senators also sent a bipartisan letter to Pichai stating that if reports about Project Dragonfly were true, it is "deeply troubling and risks making Google complicit in human rights abuses related to China's rigorous censorship regime." The letter warned that Google risks "set[ting] a worrying precedent for other companies seeking to do business in China without compromising their core values."Google has declined to respond publicly to questions from the media and rights organizations, stating that it will not "comment on speculation about future plans."Company executives have not been forthcoming with their own employees, according to multiple media reports. Internal employee discussions seen by Buzzfeed News indicate that several team members quit Dragonfly over ethical concerns about the project and the surrounding secrecy.After the project became public, a broader range of employees asked Pichai to address their concerns at a company-wide meeting. According to media reports, Pichai stated that the product is in early stages and not close to launching, but that tech companies can have a positive impact where they do business. According to a Google spokesperson, Pichai also stated that transparency early in a project can "cause issues," but that Google is "more committed to transparency than probably any company in the world."However, Pichai's statements contradict reports citing anonymous Google employees who worked on Project Dragonfly, as well as broader concerns about the lack of transparency. According to internal documents seen by The Intercept, the Dragonfly team was told in July to have the project in "launch-ready state" pending approval from Chinese officials. Internal discussions cited by BuzzFeed indicate that at least some Google employees were concerned that their work was unknowingly contributing to Project Dragonfly. Many more employees did not know that Google was actively pursuing censored search in China until details were disclosed by media reports.In April, Google employees raised similar concerns about Project Maven, a US Department of Defense contract to build artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted drone technology. Following internal and external pressure, Google announced in June that it would end its involvement in Project Maven once the contract expires in 2019. The company also issued its AI Principles, which pledge to ensure Google's AI-driven applications are "socially beneficial" and to not pursue "technologies whose purpose contravenes widely accepted principles of international law and human rights."Following the public disclosure of Project Dragonfly, over 1,400 Google employees signed a letter to management stating that "Dragonfly and Google's return to China raise urgent moral and ethical issues," and expressing concern that the project proceeded in secret and in spite of the AI Principles. They demanded an ethics review structure that includes employee representatives, greater transparency, and an ethical assessment of Dragonfly and Maven.Google is a member of the Global Network Initiative, where it has committed to human rights principles to advance freedom of expression and privacy.In the letter sent to Pichai, human rights groups and advocates also called on Google to protect whistleblowers and other employees who raise concerns about its human rights responsibilities."The disclosures about Projects Dragonfly and Maven have prompted urgent discussions about Google's approach to human rights, and its commitments to socially beneficial AI," said Wong. "Google should commend employees who raise human rights concerns and protect them from retaliation."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6425471 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: August 30, 2018End of Document

Facebook Registers Company In China In Step ForwardLive Briefs PRO Global MarketsJuly 25, 2018 Wednesday 1:46 AM ESTCopyright 2018 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 283 wordsBody After a decade of courting Beijing, Facebook Inc has finally made an official entrance in China by registering a company, according to a government listing.A subsidiary named Facebook Tech has been registered with a USD30 million investment in the eastern city of Hangzhou, which is also home to Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.Nevertheless, the registration was taken down from a central government website on Tuesday, in a sign of possible extra hurdles. But the initial announcement was covered by Chinese state media and still appears on the website of Qixinbao, a private company that collects public information about enterprises in China.Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has tried in a variety of ways to woo the Chinese government, which holds a tight grasp on the internet and bans foreign social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.The Hangzhou-registered subsidiary will operate as an innovation hub for Chinese developers and startups, Facebook spokeswoman Debbie Frost told the New York Times. Facebook has run similar hubs, focused on training and workshops, in Brazil, France, India and South Korea.But launching one of Facebook's flagship products, such as the social media platform or the messaging app, in China is still a long ways away. Beijing would most likely demand some form of self-censorship to open up the social media platform to the 772 million Chinese internet users.Zuckerberg, who has dined with Chinese President Xi Jinping and jogged in the smog-choked Tiananmen Square to promote his business, said in an interview with Recode last week that "there isn't an intersection" between the company's principles and Chinese laws.Load-Date: July 26, 2018End of Document
