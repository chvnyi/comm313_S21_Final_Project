Google goes to DC; Brexit chaos; Spotlight on HuaweiCNN WireDecember 11, 2018 Tuesday 9:47 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 571 wordsByline: By Ivana Kottasová, CNN BusinessDateline: LONDON (CNN Business) BodyLONDON (CNN Business) --  1. Google in DC: Google CEO Sundar Pichai will make his debut testifying before Congress on Tuesday. Pichai will testify before the House Judiciary Committee, where he is likely to face questions from Republicans on whether the search company harbors political bias.Lawmakers could also ask him about plans to re-enter China and the company's data privacy initiatives.Pichai will push back against allegations of political bias, according to written testimony published by the committee ahead his appearance."I lead this company without political bias and work to ensure that our products continue to operate that way. To do otherwise would go against our core principles and our business interests," Pichai will tell the committee.Shares in Alphabet (GOOGL), the parent company of Google, are flat so far in 2018.2. Brexit chaos: The British Parliament was scheduled to vote on Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal on Tuesday. Instead, the vote was called off in the face of overwhelming political opposition.The delay caused the pound to drop sharply on Monday. The currency has since stabilized, but it's difficult to see how May, who will tour European capitals on Tuesday, might secure the votes she needs in parliament."The only thing that's certain is that uncertainty will be prolonged into the New Year," said Kit Juckes, a strategist at Societe Generale. Investors are most worried about a scenario where Britain crashes out of the European Union without a deal. That would snarl supply chains and push the UK economy into recession. 3. Spotlight on Huawei: The bail hearing for Meng Wanzhou, the jailed chief financial officer of Chinese tech company Huawei, continues on Tuesday in Canada. The United States alleges that Meng helped Huawei get around US sanctions on Iran by telling financial institutions that a Huawei subsidiary was a separate company, according to Canadian prosecutors. Meng's arrest has further strained the tense relationship between Washington and Beijing just as the two sides are trying to negotiate an end to their trade war.The Chinese government has started to ramp up the pressure on the United States and Canada over the arrest, demanding Meng's release.4. Markets overview: US stock futures were pointing lower. European markets opened higher, following the trend set in Asia.The Dow staged a huge comeback on Monday after briefly plunging 500 points to below 24,000. It ended up closing 0.1% higher. The S&P 500 added 0.2% and the Nasdaq jumped 0.7%US markets could be in for another wild ride, if the CNN Business Fear and Greed index is any guide. The gauge of market sentiment has swung into "extreme fear."US oil prices tumbled 2.4% to just below $51 a barrel on Tuesday.5. Earnings and economics: DSW (DSW) will release earnings before the open. American Eagle (AEO) and Dave & Busters (PLAY) will follow after the close.The Bureau of Labor Statistics will publish its November Producer Price report at 8:30 a.m. ET. The number has been climbing and is likely to be a consideration at the next Federal Reserve meeting in two weeks. 6. Coming this week: Tuesday --- Google CEO Sundar Pichai testifies in front of House Judiciary Committee; PPI report Wednesday --- CPI report Thursday --- Adobe (ADBE) and Costco (COST) earnings Friday --- US retail sales for NovemberTM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Japanese Market Extends GainsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 28, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 437 wordsBody       The Japanese stock market is extending gains on Wednesday from the previous session, tracking the positive lead overnight from Wall Street and a weaker yen. Investors are looking ahead to a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping later this week.  The benchmark Nikkei 225 Index is adding 186.00 points or 0.85 percent to 22,138.40, after rising to a high of 22,176.98 in early trades. Japanese shares rose notably on Tuesday. The major exporters are higher on a weaker yen. Panasonic is rising almost 2 percent, Canon is advancing almost 1 percent, Mitsubishi Electric is adding 0.6 percent and Sony is up 0.5 percent. Among the other major automakers, Toyota is declining almost 2 percent and Honda is down more than 1 percent. In the banking sector, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial is losing 1 percent and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial is lower by 0.3 percent. In the tech sector, Advantest is adding almost 2 percent and Tokyo Electron is up 0.2 percent.  In the oil space, Inpex is down 0.3 percent and Japan Petroleum is lower by 0.2 percent after crude oil prices rebounded overnight. Among the other major gainers, Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma is gaining more than 13 percent, Taiyo Yuden is rising more than 4 percent and Kao Corp. is higher by almost 4 percent. On the flip side, Suzuki Motor, Kansai Electric Power and Ube Industries are losing almost 3 percent each.  In the currency market, the U.S. dollar is trading in the upper 113 yen-range on Wednesday. On Wall Street, stocks recovered from an initial move to the downside to close higher on Tuesday. The initial pullback on Wall Street reflected renewed skepticism about a trade deal between the U.S. and China following President Donald Trump's comments in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. Comments from top White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow about trade talks with the Chinese government "at all levels" contributed to the subsequent recovery by the markets. The Nasdaq inched up just 0.85 points or less than a tenth of a percent to 7,082.70, while the Dow climbed 108.49 points or 0.4 percent to 24,748.73 and the S&P 500 rose 8.75 points or 0.3 percent to 2,682.20. Meanwhile, the major European markets moved to the downside on Tuesday. While the German DAX Index fell by 0.4 percent, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index and the French CAC 40 Index dipped by 0.3 percent and 0.2 percent, respectively. Crude oil prices edged lower on Tuesday. WTI crude oil futures for January ended down $0.07 or 0.1 percent at $51.61 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, well off the session's low of $50.31.        Load-Date: November 28, 2018End of Document

Even Facebook's shares inched higher in after-hours trading after it reported revenue that was slightly under projections.

Although growth has slowed in the third quarter for most economies, it's not contracting," said Francis Tan, an investment strategist at UOB private bank. "The drop in global equities this month, to the tune of $8 trillion, makes it an irresistible thesis for investors to get back into the action," he said.CHINESE PMI: On Wednesday, China reported that its official manufacturing purchasing managers' index slowed to 50.2 points in October from 50.8 a month earlier. Figures had declined across the board except for production outlook, which was unchanged. Readings above 50 indicate expansion, while lower numbers indicate contraction on the index's 100-point scale. Still, sentiment was supported by an open call from the Chinese government to funds to support the equity markets.BANK OF JAPAN: As expected, Japan's central bank kept its monetary stance intact as it wrapped up its latest policy meeting. The Bank of Japan kept the key interest rate at minus 0.1 percent and its target for long-term bond rates at around zero. The bank also downgraded its GDP forecast for the fiscal year through March, to 1.4 percent from 1.5 percent, with an estimate of 0.8 percent for the following fiscal year.ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude added 23 cents to $66.40 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

However, she feels that communication across disciplines is inadequate. The new student group, HopAI, is supposed to improve this."This is sort of the goal of HopAI: to bring together Hopkins to talk about AI," Zhang said. "It's a very interdisciplinary discussion that needs to happen in order to ensure safe usage."Each speaker came from a different field. The first speaker was Dr. Anirudh Sridharan, a doctor at Johns Hopkins HealthCare who worked with University researcher and Computer Science Assistant Professor Suchi Saria to implement her artificial intelligence-driven solution to identifying cases of sepsis. Saria's program is also used at another community hospital.Before Saria's program, Sridharan's hospital relied upon programs that use hand-coded rules to identify sepsis. However, it was only accurate one in 10 times."You'd imagine that both nurses and docs get very frustrated with a system that's wrong 90 percent of the time," Sridharan said. "When we applied these alerts to the hospital, within a week everyone just started ignoring them because they weren't useful."Sridharan said that the previous system was so intrusive that it inhibited many doctors' workflow. He spent much of his presentation discussing how the hospital administration tried to convince its doctors to use his new program, called a targeted real-time early warning score (TREWScore). This required important decisions about how TREWScore was used."What we tried to do with TREWScore was to try to make [the notifications] more passive but leverage them in places where clinicians were more likely to see them," Sridharan said.Sridharan said that a lot of thinking went into preventing TREWScore from becoming intrusive, like the old system. As a result, usage of TREWScore, even though optional, is above 85 percent in his hospital."We worked to make this a lot more easy for clinicians to see who is sick, who is at risk - without having to stop them in their tracks," Sridharan said. "They can go and do other critical things and then go and see where their patients are along in the sepsis path."According to Sridharan, the new program is currently able to correctly identify sepsis 50 percent of the time at his hospital. The ability of the code to learn allows it to improve as time goes on.Sridharan also explained that each hospital that uses an algorithm trained on their own data to personalize it.The second speaker, senior Aliza Berger, presented about her interactions with artificial intelligence policy while working in the State department as a cyber policy intern."This [presentation] is trying to show that everyone should be thinking about AI, whether it's nation-states, NGOs or the humanities and STEM," Berger said.Berger said that the department suffers from a lack of technological skills.She also noted how very few nations have artificial intelligence frameworks, and that those that do have created them recently: Canada in 2017, Japan and then Singapore were the first nations to establish plans."This isn't necessarily about laws as it is about a nation's strategy," Berger said.According to Berger, many nation-states' frameworks focus on different areas. Some care more about the economic usage of artificial intelligence, whereas others focus on its military applications. Other nations worked on plans that include improving government efficiency. The U.S., however, does not have a coherent cyber policy of its own."You might be surprised to hear this, but we actually do not have a national strategy," Berger said. "Shouldn't this be concerning? China, who we are allegedly in an AI Cold War with, is thinking in the very long term. But here we are, with no strategy. One of the reasons for this is the difference in political ideology."Berger stressed that a result of American capitalism is the belief that technological innovation should come from the private sector. Berger indicated that the Chinese government, in contrast, did not have a problem with directing companies to invest in artificial intelligence."It's a very different conversation here," Berger said. "Whereas in China, with the current political system, the private-public sector relationship is very different. In the United States, we don't have a political strategy, but we do have a task force."According to Berger, the U.S. has by far the greatest number of artificial intelligence specialists in the world. She thinks that to spread this talent, there needs to be a collaborative international framework."My questions is: why can't we do this together?" Berger said. "Why can't we think about an international framework?"The final speaker was Chief of the Intelligent Systems Center at the Applied Physics Lab Ashley J. Llorens. His center focuses on using artificial intelligence to address a wide variety of situations."There are so many different and challenging problems [here at APL]," Llorens said. "Working in AI means that you're actually working at the intersection of many of those problems."Llorens says that he broadly thinks of AI as any agent used to pursue complex goals. Artificial intelligence has many layers: He says that machine learning is a subset of AI, then deep learning is a subset of machine learning. He stressed that the field is much larger than most people believe."Many people think of a convolutional network [a type of deep learning] as everything that AI has to offer, but it's actually much broader," Llorens said. "It involves robotics, theorem-proving and many things that have been around for decades. A lot of recent pursuits in AI are combining the old and the new to create something better."Llorens also talked about several technologies that APL has developed or improved using artificial intelligence. The first was Sally, a robot that investigates whether oil spills have occurred. The second was about Johnny, a wounded warrior who, thanks to the APL, could control an artificial limb that is almost as good as an original."Your hand and forearm have 27 degrees of freedom, and this has 26. It gets you back most of that," Llorens said.Johnny, who was sent home with his artificial limb for a year, has even been learning how to play the piano with his new limb.The next story was about Jan, a quadriplegic who could control an arm using a brain-computer interface."Being a quadriplegic and wanting to feel that capability again, she was willing to be a patient in this experiment. She had a craniotomy, which is having part of your skull removed," Llorens said.The sensor on her brain is connected to a device that has a machine learning algorithm on it to infer motor intent from brain signals.As the very first official event of HopAI, Zheng sees a lot of room to grow."My hope for HopAI is that we'll be able to gather enough resources to support students, undergrads and grad students' ideas about AI solutions to current world issues," Zheng said.Load-Date: December 6, 2018End of Document

Huawei ILab Releases a White Paper to Help Move Medical Images to the CloudTargeted News ServiceOctober 30, 2018 Tuesday 8:50 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 924 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: SHENZHEN, China BodyHuawei Technologies issued the following news:Huawei iLab has officially released its Medical Imaging Cloud Scenario White Paper. Using the current status of the healthcare industry and the service characteristics of medical images as a basis, the White Paper analyzes and identifies five application scenarios that are most closely related to operators, have the most commercial potential, and are most likely to be implemented: cloud image storage, imaging cloud application, cloud-based medical collaboration, cloud-based medical education, and cloud-based health management. This information can then be used by operators to develop the medical imaging cloud market.As medical imaging technologies continue to develop, the amount of image data being generated has grown enormously, a fact that now poses higher requirements on the data storage and processing capabilities of medical IT systems. A traditional picture archiving and communication system (PACS) cannot read or share data sufficiently, and as a result, it is difficult to obtain the full application value of historical medical images. In the interim, China's National Health Commission (NHC) has proposed establishing a medical union and a regional healthcare system that promote collaborating over and sharing medical image data. Platform- and cloud-based medical image data is therefore becoming a trend of the industry. Operators can construct medical imaging clouds and connect them with information systems at medical institutions using cloud computing and Internet technologies, storing and sharing medical images on the cloud.By carrying out in-depth research into the features of medical image services, user experience requirements, and the overall business value, Huawei iLab has been able to identify for operators the most commercial application scenarios.Scenario 1: Cloud image storageIt implements the storage and interaction of large amounts of image data for medical institutions, and helps to achieve multi-level disaster recovery and backup. This in turn ensures that medical institutions can provide services continuously and stably in the event of a natural disaster, hard disk fault, hack, or human damage. This scenario is suitable for operators expanding their B2B cloud storage services.Scenario 2: Imaging cloud applicationThe PACS is cloudified, and image data can be exchanged between multiple medical institutions. Images can also be read on the cloud. Cloud image processing functions, such as image comparison, image fusion display, and 3D reconstruction, help doctors find and diagnose causes of diseases quickly and accurately, improving the overall efficiency of diagnoses. Mobile imaging clouds are also supported, which enables doctors and patients to view images and diagnosis reports anytime and anywhere, and facilitates communication between doctors and patients. This scenario is suitable for operators promoting their B2B cloud-based PACS and mobile image reading services.Scenario 3: Cloud-based medical collaborationBuilding regional imaging cloud centers and remote imaging consultation centers helps to implement the centralized storage and sharing of image data for the medical institutions in a specified region. This also serves to optimize the distribution of healthcare resources and improves the quality and efficiency of healthcare services, thereby facilitating the implementation of a hierarchical diagnosis and treatment system. This scenario is suitable for operators providing remote B2B imaging and consultation services for medical unions.Scenario 4: Cloud-based medical educationBased on the medical imaging cloud platform, this implements functions such as online image lessons, live surgical demonstrations, VR/AR/MR virtual imaging lessons, and online image discussions. These functions are highly interactive. They overcome geographical constraints, make the distribution of quality medical education resources more balanced, and help to economize Chinese Government's investment in medical education. This scenario is suitable for operators providing B2B cloud image lessons and B2C live surgery broadcasts.Scenario 5: Cloud-based health managementThis implements a number of cloud services, including chronic disease and inspection data management. It provides online health consultations, online guidance, scheduled referrals, follow-ups, and extended prescription services. This saves patients' time, reduces pressure on medical institutions, and allows people to consult on and manage their health more quickly and efficiently. This scenario is suitable for operators providing 2C online health consultation services.Huawei iLab believes that with support from government policies and the development of cloud computing and Internet technologies, medical institutions are accelerating the deployment of medical imaging clouds. It also notes that more and more operators are stepping into the field of medical imaging clouds. With good network infrastructure, cloud-based data centers, and powerful O&#38;M support, operators can join forces with ecosystem partners and build a holistic medical imaging cloud solution - one that significantly improves the efficiency and quality of healthcare collaboration and provides better services for doctors, patients, and medical institutions alike. In this regard, Huawei is keen to work with operators on accelerating the cloud transformation of the healthcare industry and expanding the industry's market space.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6497428 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: October 30, 2018End of Document

Tencent earnings; Global slowdown; Oil stabilizesCNN WireNovember 14, 2018 Wednesday 10:29 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 618 wordsByline: By Ivana Kottasová, CNN BusinessDateline: LONDON (CNN Business) BodyLONDON (CNN Business) --  1. Tencent earnings: WeChat owner Tencent (TCEHY) reported an increase in sales on Wednesday despite regulatory headaches in China. The company said revenue jumped 24% in the third quarter compared to the same period last year. Tencent attributed the growth to payment-related services, online advertising, digital content sales and its cloud service.The technology and entertainment conglomerate has had a tough year. Its stock is down about 30% so far in 2018.The company was hit hard by a Chinese government crackdown on gaming. China is the world's biggest gaming market, and Tencent is the world's biggest gaming company.Tencent released 10 new smartphone games this year and said Wednesday it has 15 more ready to go, pending regulatory approval. Smartphone games sales increased 7% over the previous year, while PC gaming revenue declined 15%.2. Global slowdown: Worries about a global slowdown have increased after Japan and Germany said their economies contracted in the third quarter. The problems plaguing the economies are different, but their size means the pain cannot be ignored: Japan boasts the world's third largest economy, while Germany is ranked fourth. The German economy contracted 0.2% in the third quarter compared to the previous three months, its first decline in more than three years. Data showed the slowdown was mainly due to weak exports and a fall in consumer spending.Global trade tensions and new vehicle emissions tests have also hit the country's massive car industry.Japan said its GDP shrunk 0.3% in the third quarter. The country recently enjoyed its longest streak of economic growth in decades, but momentum has stalled this year.Inflation remains below the central bank's target of 2% despite a massive stimulus program and unusual policies like negative interest rates.There were other reasons to worry about Europe: New data showed the eurozone economy grew 0.2% in the third quarter, just half the rate reported for the previous three months. Growth in the wider European Union also slowed.3. Global market overview: US stock futures were pointing lower.European markets opened lower, following a negative session in Asia.Italian banks were under pressure after the country's government refused to cave to pressure from the European Commission to slash its planned budget deficit. The Dow closed 0.4% lower on Tuesday. The S&P 500 dipped 0.2% and the Nasdaq was flat.US crude futures have stabilized after dropping 7% on Tuesday. It was crude's worst day since September 2015 and a record 12th consecutive decline. Oil was trading up 0.8% on Wednesday at $56.00 per barrel. 4. Earnings and economics: Macy's (M) is set to report results before the opening bell. The retailer's stock is up more than 40%, but investors are worried the momentum is slowing. Blue Apron (APRN) said Tuesday it will cut 4% of its workforce in order to become more profitable. The company is shedding customers and reported a $34 million loss in the third quarter. US inflation data for October will be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. The pound was jittery ahead of a crucial meeting of Prime Minister Theresa May's cabinet. The European Union and the United Kingdom have agreed a draft Brexit divorce, but a key test comes later on Wednesday when May will seek her divided cabinet's backing. 5. Coming this week: Wednesday --- Progressive (PGR), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Macy's (M) earnings; Inflation numbers for October Thursday --- Nvidia (NVDA), Nordstrom (JWN), Walmart (WMT), and Manchester United (MANU) earnings; October retail sales Friday --- Williams-Sonoma (WSM) earningsTM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

/C O R R E C T I O N -- Ideanomics/PR NewswireDecember 26, 2018 Wednesday 3:59 PM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1201 wordsDateline: NEW YORK, Dec. 26, 2018 BodyPR NewswireIn the news release, Ideanomics Signs Mandate with NTS for City of Tianjin Bus Conversion Financing, issued 26-Dec-2018 by Ideanomics over PR Newswire, we are advised by the company that the fifth paragraph, first sentence, should read "Alfred Poor, President & COO of Ideanomics, 'We are very grateful to our colleagues in China for their hard work and effort since securing the original agreement with NTS, which has resulted in securing the first mandate under that deal.'" The complete, corrected release follows:Ideanomics Signs Mandate with NTS for City of Tianjin Bus Conversion FinancingNational Transportation Capacity (NTS) recently signed their first regional agreement with the city of Tianjin in an asset-backed re-financing deal valued over 57Billion RMB (approximately $8.25Billion USD). Ideanomics(NASDAQ:IDEX) ("Ideanomics" or the "Company"), a leading global fintech and asset digitization services company is pleased to announce it has entered into an agreement with the National Transportation Capacity Co Ltd (NTS), as a specific financing mandate under the original framework agreement announced by Ideanomics in August 2018. This additional agreement is for the initial tranche of asset-backed financing and comes as a result of NTS finalizing a deal with the city of Tianjin, China's fourth-largest city, to re-finance existing asset-backed financing for electric bus conversion, valued at over 57Billion RMB (approximately $8.25Billion USD). This initial mandate from NTS is the first of several anticipated in the coming months under the 260Billion RMB framework agreement between NTS and Ideanomics.Under the terms of the deal, Ideanomics will provide advisory services to NTS, including working with established financial services' partners to assist with the underwriting, marketing, and sale of the financing. Ideanomics is finalizing terms with those partner firms and anticipates being able to make partner announcements in the near-term. The Company will derive revenues under the deal based on fees of 1% of financing raised. This amount is net of partner fees but will be subject to certain underwriting and marketing costs.The market size for the mandatory replacements and upgrades to achieve fully-electric bus operations in China is estimated at 1Trillion RMB (approx. $145B), with the Chinese government requiring the conversion of public transport vehicles to electric power by 2021. NTS is the largest full-service provider for electric bus operators with sales, lease financing, a charging station network, and real-time data services including media, payments, maps, and facial recognition.The re-financing program Ideanomics has developed is designed to save cities and municipalities 2% or more versus traditional annual interest rates for this type of asset-backed financing. The Company intends to launch a blockchain-based asset registration platform, subject to the city operators' endorsement and systems support, in conjunction with the re-financing program. This registration platform is intended to deliver the highest-level of transparency for the underlying assets provided as the foundation for underwriting the offering and, as a result, elevate asset registration beyond traditional asset monitoring methods.Alfred Poor, President and COO of Ideanomics, "We are very grateful to our colleagues in China for their hard work and effort since securing the original agreement with NTS, which has resulted in securing the first mandate under that deal. We are now focused on working with our institutional banking partners in the region to secure the required re-financing for the city of Tianjin's electric bus conversion project. We anticipate the offering will come to market in Q1 and extend through Q2 and Q3, until the financing mandate is filled. This deal enables us to demonstrate Ideanomics' core strengths of deal origination and enablement, along with the application of new technologies which we believe will form part of the evolution of the financial services industry."About IdeanomicsIdeanomics seeks to become a leading fintech company by combining deal origination and enablement with the application of blockchain and artificial intelligence technologies as part of the next-generation of financial services.The company is headquartered in New York, NY, and has offices in Hong Kong and Beijing, China.

Global Cable Connector Market by Material, End-user Industry and Region - Forecast 2023 - ResearchAndMarkets.comBusiness WireNovember 29, 2018 Thursday 3:42 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Business Wire, Inc.Distribution: Business EditorsLength: 766 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "Global Cable Connector Market - Segmented by Material (Copper, Aluminum, Plastic), End-user Industry (IT and Telecom, Construction, Energy and Utility), and Region - Growth, Trends, and Forecast (2018 - 2023)" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The cable connector market is expected to register a CAGR of 5.67%, during the forecast period (2018-2023).Adoption of wireless technologies, such as Wi-Fi, RF, and Bluetooth, in future, will consume a considerable chunk of the cables and connectors, thus paving the way for this market to increase.Increasing penetration of technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), is expected to aid the increase in demand for high-performance and secure data connectivity and transmission, which in turn, may increase the demand for cable connectors.According to the National Cable and Telecommunications Association, the number of connected devices is expected to reach 50.1 billion, by 2020.Many developments have been undertaken by government organizations in developing countries, such as India, China, and Brazil, to improve network infrastructure. Such initiatives are increasing the demand for high-speed data transmission cables connectors.For instance, the Chinese government proposed that the country should actively promote 5G development and launch the technology by 2020, which in turn, involves the development of communication infrastructure. This is expected to increase the need for better cable connectors and other equipment for its installation purpose.However, issues related to volatile prices of raw materials are estimated to challenge growth in the cable connector market.Oil & Gas Sector is Expected to Aid the Growth of the Cable Connector MarketThe energy and utility segment is expected to expand significantly, over the forecast period, due to the increase in demand for electro-mechanical equipment in this industry.Cable connectors used in this industry have to have a high-performance capability as most of the processes require efficient extraction of natural resources. Thus, the increasing demand for cable connectors, to achieve better control, monitoring, and instrumentation of processes in the oil and gas industry, is driving the use of cable connectors in this market.Major Market Developments• Triton Knoll signed an agreement with a UK firm, J Murphy & Sons Ltd, to work on the design and installation of substation and cable circuits of an 860MW innogy project.Key Topics Covered1.

If the euro slides further, 1.52 is likely seen as its next support level.On the flip side, the euro remained higher at near a 2-month high of 1.6155 against the aussie and a 1-1/2-month high of 1.6986 against the kiwi. The euro ended Thursday's deals at 1.6093 against the aussie and 1.6896 against the kiwi.Although the euro declined to a 2-day low of 1.1291 against the franc, it bounced off to 1.1317 in a short while.

Stories from Slate; A response to Mark Stasenko's short story "Overvalued."Slate MagazineNovember 27, 2018 Tuesday 2:01 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Washingtonpost.Newsweek Interactive Company, LLC. All Rights ReservedSection: FUTURE TENSE; TechnologyLength: 1026 wordsByline: Zachary KarabellHighlight: Human Capital Is Becoming a Security to Sell, Package, and Even ShortBodyAn investor and writer responds to Mark Stasenko's "."During the great financial crisis of 2008-09, millions of people became painfully aware of financial derivatives, which had until then occupied a highly lucrative but obscure corner of finance. Starting in the 1990s and then expanding exponentially in the early 2000s, financial derivatives were supposed to decrease risk by allowing traders to buy and sell not just future movements of stocks but also mortgages, commodity contracts, bonds, and just about anything that could be sold on electronic exchanges. Instead of spreading out risk and making markets less volatile, however, the explosion of derivatives had the opposite effect, turning them into "financial weapons of mass destruction," as Warren Buffett famously called them in 2002. In the worst moments 10 years ago, it seemed as if his warnings would come all too true.Since then, financial derivatives have once again receded from public consciousness, but they certainly haven't gone away. As the number of derivatives has proliferated, so too have software programs that dictate trades. The massive increases in computing power and now artificial intelligence mean that on any given day, algorithms are trading with algorithms more than humans are trading with humans. New electronic exchanges have popped up to facilitate both the volume and speed that these derivatives and algorithms demand.As financial markets have once again been chaotic and roiling in recent weeks, it's perhaps an opportune moment to ask whether the calm of the past few years has lulled us. At the height of the financial crisis and for several years after, many investors and companies paid more attention to how technology might be distorting markets and making them more vulnerable to manipulation. Years of steady gains shunted those questions to the back burner, but it's time to focus on them again. Perhaps the future holds not just more computer-driven flux but new products that will allow people to trade and sell derivatives not just of financial instruments but of various aspects of life as well.That's the specter raised by Mark Stasenko's macabre short story of a not-too-distant future in which the potential of an individual has been turned into a tradeable security via a Prodigy Market in which investors can buy, sell, or short promising people.Elements of the story are already real. Insurance companies have for many years insured vital aspects of individual talent and worth-Lloyd's of London has famously insured Betty Grable's legs and Bruce Springsteen's voice. Enron (remember it?) briefly became a multibillion-dollar company by cornering the energy markets and aggressively trading derivatives while attempting to rig future prices to its advantage. In the past few years, a number of Silicon Valley startups have formed to invest in the loans of promising graduates and undergraduates, including SoFi (which began with the presumption that a Stanford student represents a better credit risk than a general pool of students and so should have a higher credit rating and a different risk profile and price) and Upstart (which privileges students from better schools with better credit scores). A slew of other startups have attempted similar forms of financing, pooling assets to invest in select baskets of individuals by school and/or career. Most have failed, but if the past is any prologue, these will be harbingers of things to come.And so the conceit behind "Overvalued" is hardly science fiction. If anything, we are closer than we think to a world where human capital becomes a security to sell, package, and even short. Already, sports betting odds adjust dynamically to prospective new recruits and to those prospects then getting injured. It would hardly be a great leap to extend that principle to promising law students or nascent MBAs. Kickstarter already allows individuals to invest in other people and their dreams, so how much of a leap will it be to invest in someone's future earning potential and then be able to "price" people in real time based on their grades or test scores or performance evaluations?Stasenko's dystopian vision of a Prodigy Market is, in fact, akin to what the Chinese government is currently attempting to institute on a mass scale, with every citizen assigned a "social score" that will determine everything from credit lines to job interviews to travel privileges. The metrics the state might use to ensure conformity and continued control may be somewhat different from those used by a hedge fund to determine profitability, but they have more in common than not. They also are now made possible by the vast amounts of data each of us leave of our daily lives on social media or as a byproduct of electronic transactions ranging from banking to Amazon purchases to booking travel and paying bills. We-all of us who have smartphones and bank accounts-leave a data trail that easily translates into a score that could be used for a range of purchases from the benign (points and perks) to the alarming (having our scores bought and sold and driven lower by financial intermediaries).But while we are closer than we might think, we are still further than we fear. For one, social norms are not there yet. We might be willing to slice and dice all sorts of financial instruments and drive businesses to failure in order to make a buck by betting against them. But we are not there yet with human lives, at least not explicitly. China's social score is getting lots of attention, but there remains a considerable gap between what the government might dream of imposing and what it can actually do as of now. Those gaps, between what is possible and desirable, between what is acceptable and as yet not, matter more than the technologies that shrink them.The fear today is that technology is soon to dehumanize us and rob us of agency. That has been the fear of new technologies for generations, and this time, it may finally come true. Yet until it has, it hasn't, and for now and for a considerable time ahead, there are apparently some lines that most humans will not cross even if they can.Load-Date: November 27, 2018End of Document

TSX Ends Lower For 2nd Straight DayCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 20, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 734 wordsBody       After opening slightly higher, led by gains in materials shares, the Canadian stock market turned weak and ended on a highly negative note on Thursday, amid rising concerns about global growth.  Markets in Asia and Europe tumbled and the U.S. market declined as well, with investors choosing to exit counters, reacting to the Federal Reserve's statement on Wednesday. The Fed, which raised its interest rate by 25 basis points, reiterated its commitment to tighten monetary policy, despite rising risks to growth. It forecast a couple of rate hikes in the first half of 2019. Crude oil's sharp plunge, rising concerns about U.S.-China trade talks after the Justice Department announced the criminal indictment of two computer hackers associated with the Chinese government and weak economic data out of Europe, all contributed to Canadian market's  decline. The benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index ended with a loss of 122.29 points, or 0.86%, at 14,141.77. The index scaled a low of 14,075.95 and a high of 14,341.72 in the session. On Wednesday, the index closed down by 152.83 points, or 1.06%, at 14,264.06. Information technology, energy, healthcare and industrial shares were among the most prominent losers. Consumer discretionary, financial and consumer staples stocks too ended mostly lower.  Among the stocks in the Energy index, Suncor Energy (SU.TO), Cenovus Energy (CVE.TO), Encana Corporation (ECA.TO) and Crescent Point Energy Corp. (CPG.TO) lost 2 to 4%. Among bank stocks, Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS.TO) gained about 1% and National Bank of Canada (NA.TO) added 1.5%. Royal Bank of Canada (RY.TO), Bank of Montreal (BMO.TO), Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD.TO) and Canaian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CD.TO) lost 0.5 - 0.8%. Among the stocks in healthcare space, Bausch Health Companies Inc.

(WPM.TO), Goldcorp Inc. (G.TO), First Quantum Minerals (FM. TO) and Kirkland Lake Gold (KIRK.L.TO) gained 1 to 5%. In economic news, Statistics Canada reported that wholesale sales rose 1% to $63.8 billion in October, more than offsetting the 0.7% decline in September.  Average weekly earnings of non-farm payroll employees were $1,009 in October, up 0.6% from the previous month. Compared with 12 months earlier, earnings increased by 2.5%. U.S .  shares declined sharply with global growth concerns and increased risk of a partial government shutdown triggering a sell-off. The Dow plummeted 2%, while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 both shed about 1.6%. In U.S. economic news, initial jobless claims rose to 214,000, an increase of 8,000 from the previous week's unrevised level of 206,000. A report from Philadelphia Federal Reserve said manufacturing activity in the Philadelphia region continued to grow but remained subdued in the month of December. Meanwhile, the Conference Board released a report shortly after the start of trading showing an unexpected increase in leading U.S. economic indicators in the month of November. The Conference Board said its leading economic index rose by 0.2 percent in November after falling by a revised 0.3 percent in October. European markets drifted lower on growth worries. Bank of England policymakers unanimously left the key interest rate and asset purchase targets unchanged on Thursday, as expected. Brexit uncertainties have intensified considerably since the previous policy session and they are weighing on UK financial markets and on the near-term growth outlook, the bank said. Asian  markets ended mostly lower. In commodities, Crude oil futures for February ended down $2.29, or 4.8%, at $45.88 a barrel, the lowest settlement in seventeen months. Gold futures for February Gold futures for February ended up $11.50, or 0.9%, at $1,267.90, the highest settlement since June 25, 2018. Silver futures for March settled at $14.869 an ounce, up $0.051 from previous close of $14.818 an ounce.        Load-Date: December 20, 2018End of Document

Foreign Bad Actors Hacked MarriottNews Release WireDecember 18, 2018 Tuesday Copyright 2018 Broadcast Interview Source, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 541 wordsBodyYou have probably heard about the latest major data breach, right? The Starwood hotel chain, which is owned by Marriott, was hacked. More than 500 million people were affected by it, and now, we have learned that a hostile, foreign intelligence service is likely behind it.Most of the data that was compromised is unsurprising, such as emails and names, but other information that was accessed is a bit puzzling. This includes passport information and where people traveled. A U.S. intelligence official, who does not want to be identified, has said that this breach fits the mold of China being behind it.Though there is nothing specific to point the finger at China, the techniques, tools and procedures that were used are commonly being used by hackers who work for the Chinese government. However, it is important to keep in mind that other hackers would also have access to these tools.For now, the investigation is continuing into the data breach, and nothing official has been released. The FBI continues to remain on the case, and Marriott has said that it has no idea who or what is behind this hack. At this point, they are choosing not to speculate. The hotel chain has both internal and external teams working on exposing the hackers, and the main clue they are focusing on is the type of data that was accessed, such as passport numbers and the times and dates that people checked in and checked out of the hotel. This information could be very valuable to foreign countries, including China, who might want to create counterfeit passports. The State Department, however, has told NBC News that a new passport could not be made by using passport numbers alone.This hack is part of a series of hacks that have plagued businesses over the past few years and recent months. In fact, this hack went on for four years before Starwood even realized that it was getting hacked! This is a pretty long time when you consider that the average hack goes on for 101 days before its discovered. Whats even more disturbing is the fact that the company knew about this hack since September, but it didnt announce it until the beginning of December.Marriott has responded to this. It says that it is improving the way it deals with cyber security, and, in addition to working out what happened in this hack, it is analyzing how it can improve the way it deals with customer data.About: ROBERT SICILIANO Identity Theft Expert, Author and Television News Correspondent and CEO of IDTheftSecurity.com.

Gemalto Boosts Highly Efficient IoT Connectivity With Secure NB-IoT PlatformTargeted News ServiceNovember 7, 2018 Wednesday 8:00 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 681 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: AMSTERDAM, Netherlands BodyGemalto issued the following news release:Gemalto, the global leader in digital security, is expanding highly efficient IoT connectivity with the launch of its Cinterion(R) Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) wireless module platform. The new solution builds on the success of Gemalto's NB-IoT product in China, delivering power efficient future 5G connectivity to APAC and Europe. A unique combination of several optional security features ensures trust in the comprehensive IoT ecosystem. The solution is ideal for the growing mass of industrial solutions that require extreme efficiency, expanded coverage and long life such as utility meters and smart city solutions.LPWA NB-IoT drives massive IoT growth leading to increased security concernsThe IoT is accelerating at dizzying speed with China leading the way and the European market following with more than 415 million connections expected in the next five years[1]. The majority of these connections are emerging in the industrial IoT (IIoT) sector where highly efficient, Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technologies such as NB-IoT are driving massive expansion. A recent report by Custom Market Insights predicts the NB-IoT market will grow at a CAGR of 90% between now and 2025[2]. As the number of connections continues to raise, so do cyberattacks making digital security an urgent concern.Gemalto security "double play" ensures trust in NB-IoTLeveraging Gemalto's strong capability in securely managing billions of digital credentials, the Cinterion NB-IoT platform will offer an integrated eSIM in selected platform products. Gemalto eSIMs authenticate IoT devices, encrypt data and securely manage connections to cellular networks. Soldered to the IoT module, eSIMs reduce the size and cost of solutions while strengthening security and reliability. Pre-installed certificates simplify secure onboarding to cloud services by authenticating leading cloud platform providers.Extended efficiency, long life battery, expanded coverage rangeThe new Gemalto Cinterion ENS22 NB-IoT wireless module gives developers a single mode NB-IoT connectivity solution designed to meet the highest standards and requirements of the European and APAC regions. Gemalto's advanced power management system significantly boosts energy performance extending battery life for up to 10 years. The module is ideal for stationary IoT applications that send data only at intermittent intervals. Gemalto's evolution strategy enables easy forward migration within Cinterion product families while allowing a single device design for any technology standard or geographical area where it is used.Incremental updates protect NB-IoT devices for long lifeTo better manage devices in the field over long life cycles, the Cinterion NB-IoT module enables incremental firmware updates over-the-air (FOTA), a mandatory feature for cost savings and device lifecycle management. These updates allow revision of only the portion of code that needs updating. This significantly reduces transmission time, power draw and throughput, which are all essential in preserving the investment in NB-IoT technology."Gemalto debuted its Cinterion NB-IoT Platform early in China, a market that is driving global expansion of NB-IoT for IIoT connectivity," said Dan Shey, ABI Research. "With Gemalto's successful pilot product and the Chinese government's aggressive NB-IoT goal of achieving 600 million connections in the coming years, Gemalto is well positioned to be a global leader in the NB-IoT category.""Gemalto's Cinterion NB-IoT platform delivers a proven, high quality connectivity solution at the market's most cost competitive price while delivering an industry unique security feature set," said Andreas Haegele, SVP IoT Products, Gemalto. "The Gemalto NB-IoT solution strengthens the business case for cellular IoT technology and expands feasibility to use cases that were formerly cost prohibitive."Contact: Tauri Cox, 512/257-3916, tauri.cox@gemalto.com; Sophie Dombres, +33 4 42 36 57 38, sophie.dombres@gemalto.comCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6510343 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: November 8, 2018End of Document

Senate Commerce Committee Issues Testimony From Californians for Consumer PrivacyTargeted News ServiceOctober 10, 2018 Wednesday 9:00 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 3418 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee issued the following testimony by Alastair Mactaggart, board chair of the Californians for Consumer Privacy, at a hearing entitled "Consumer Data Privacy: Examining Lessons From the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act":"Chairman Thune, Ranking Member Nelson, and distinguished members of the Committee: Thank you for the opportunity to testify about the background, rationale and intent of the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA") of 2018, passed on June 28, 2018.CCPA Principles:Transparency"Our initial conviction was that for consumers to properly control their own data, they first need to understand what information is being collected about them. The right to find out what data a company has collected about you is the first step in understanding the scope of the issue--once you know what companies have collected about you, you can decide whether their data collection and sharing practices present a problem. Our approach was guided by Justice Brandeis' famous quote, in that making clear what is now completely opaque, seemed worthwhile: any unsavory practices would not survive the cleansing light of day.Control"It seemed to us that knowledge would inevitably lead to a desire on the part of consumers, to be able to control the information they uncovered. This conviction led to the "Right to Say No," the right for a consumer to tell a corporation not to sell or share his or her personal information. It's one thing to do business with a company intentionally, but we heard from many advocates and consumers that the most objectionable part of this new, data-driven economy, was that their daily interactions ended up in the hands of hundreds of corporations they'd never heard of."The right to control who could obtain your personal information, seemed fundamental to any law designed to increase consumer privacy.Accountability"The final component of our approach, was the piece designed to address data security. Of all the areas we surveyed around personal information, the one that most concerned Californians (and frankly enraged them), was the repeated instances of companies collecting their sensitive information, and not protecting it adequately from theft. Data breaches have become daily news events, and Californians--and, we venture to guess, all Americans--are tired of giant corporations being careless with their sensitive personal information.CCPA Background:"In settling on our approach, we met with dozens of legal and technical experts around the country, with businesses and privacy advocates. Essentially the 18 months starting January 2016 was spent on research, which allowed us to settle upon the three pillars outlined above of Transparency, Control and Accountability."Once we had settled on this architecture, we began drafting the actual bill in the summer of 2017, and submitted a version to the California Attorney General in September 2017."The California initiative process includes an opportunity for any interested party to meet with the Legislative Analyst's Office to give feedback on a proposed initiative, and many groups from businesses to privacy advocates took advantage of this opportunity to give comments to the LAO."Subsequently, we met with the LAO to review this response, and were so impressed by their suggestions that in mid-October 2017 we refiled a second version of the initiative, because we felt that would allow us to improve certain aspects of the law."That second version received its Title &#38; Summary from the Attorney General's office in mid-December, 2017.From Initiative to Legislation"Once we received the Title &#38; Summary, we began the necessary steps to enable us to put the measure on the 2018 ballot. From January to May of this year, we obtained the signatures of 629,000 Californians in support of our measure. This was greatly in excess of the legal minimum of 366,000 signatures, and the measure qualified for the November ballot."California has a relatively new provision in the initiative statute, which allows a proponent to withdraw a measure which has qualified for the ballot. We had been in contact with members of the California Legislature, notably Senator Robert Hertzberg and Assemblymember Ed Chau, and in June of 2018 reached a compromise with those two members on language that we felt would achieve substantially all of our initiative's goals. Assembly Bill 375 was subsequently voted out of both houses unanimously, and signed into law by Governor Brown, on June 28, 2018. (I should note that without the herculean efforts of Mr. Chau and Mr. Hertzberg, or the support of both Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon's and Senate Pro Tem Toni Atkins' offices, the bill would never have become law, and much credit must go to that group of legislators for recognizing the importance of this issue, and the opportunity for California to become a leader in this field.) Additionally, Common Sense Media supported and co-sponsored the bill.Differences between the Initiative and the Law"The 'deal' that allowed the initiative to become law revolved around three main components:1) Increased consumer rights:a. Right to see your actual data. The initiative only gave consumers the right to see what categories of data had been collected about them, so this was a major, pro-consumer step forward.b. Right to delete the information you have posted. Not as comprehensive as the European "Right to Erasure," but still, more than the initiative had.c. Right to know the purposes for which a company is collecting your information. The initiative did not have this requirement.d. Increased age from 13 to 16, prior to which companies must obtain 'opt-in' permission from the consumer before selling their data.2) Altered prohibition on not charging different prices if a consumer selects a privacy option.a. The initiative had a total prohibition on any differential pricing - i.e. charging users for requesting that a company not share or sell their information.b. The bill provides some flexibility on this point. Companies can charge consumers more if a consumer chooses not to have their data shared or sold, but:i. Companies can only charge a differential that is 'directly related' to the value of the consumer's data.1ii. Companies must inform consumers and get opt-in consent to such a 'financial incentive' program (i.e. if they 'pay' a consumer to allow his or her information to be sold).iii. Any such financial incentives cannot be unjust, unreasonable, coercive or usurious. We think this requirement is critical in order to ensure a fair market solution.c. In conclusion, CCPA as written provides flexibility to companies, but with transparency that will allow consumers to make informed decisions about which companies to do business with.3) Limited Private Right of Actiona. The initiative had enforcement by both the Attorney General, and a broad private right of action covering essentially all violations.b. The law limits the private right of action to data breach violations, with penalties of from $100 - $750 per violation.c. The rest of the law is subject to Attorney General enforcement, at up to $2,500 per violation."As proponent, it was my belief that the above compromise was the right one to make. The June passage of CCPA obtained many more consumer rights; it clarified a section with respect to pricing differently based on privacy choices; and it lessened the Private Right of Action, but kept substantial and meaningful penalties in place to ensure compliance.GDPR vs CCPA: some major differences"Some have compared CCPA to the recently passed European General Data Protection Regulation. While there are conceptual similarities, the CCPA is significantly different."The most obvious difference is in who is a covered entity: in Europe, all entities of any size are subject to GDPR, whereas CCPA only covers businesses with over $25M in revenue, and data brokers selling large amounts of personal information."The second big difference is in the European approach of requiring user consent before any processing can take place."Specifically, under GDPR, a corporation must obtain a consumer's approval before collecting and processing his or her data. The fact of notice and required consent prior to collection, is indeed a step towards greater respect for privacy, but we were concerned that given the massive pull and market share for some of the largest consumer-facing brands--think Google, or Facebook, or Amazon--the choice facing consumers to consent or not, was actually a false one, since most consumers would simply click "I agree" to the request for consent. [As it turns out, subsequent to GDPR's introduction, this concern has been validated2]."Additionally, and very importantly, we are concerned that this provision may hurt new entrants to the marketplace, since consumers may be unlikely to agree to the collection and sale of their information by a new entrant--so how does the next Google or Facebook even get off the ground?"As an alternative, if a consumer could restrict the sale of their information by any company he or she was doing business with, that felt like giving the consumer a more useful toolCurrent Status"At this point, the law is scheduled to go into effect on July 1, 2020. A "clean-up" bill, SB 1121, passed the legislature in August 2018, and despite efforts by the technology industry to substantially weaken key components of CCPA, our coalition was able to persuade the legislators to hold the line, and the law has remained substantially as intended when we agreed to a deal in June."There will certainly be a battle in the coming years, either in the California Legislature or in Congress, as companies seek to return to a world free of any limitations on what they can do with consumers' personal information."However, Californians for Consumer Privacy remains committed to ensuring that any bill passed in Sacramento or in Washington, contains at least the same protections for Californians, that they have so recently won.Motivation Behind CCPA:"We live in a world where giant companies, the largest companies the world has ever known, are tracking us continually. We live in a world of commercial surveillance. During our research I became aware of the scale and scope of this surveillance, and include below some recent examples that have appeared in the press:"Google has a patent on using in-home3 devices to track whether alcohol is being consumed; whether (and presumably, what kind of) smoking is taking place; whether teeth are being brushed, and for how long, and whether the water is being left running during the teeth-brushing. The patent extends to determining whether 'mischief' is occurring in the home, to determining the emotional state of the home's occupants (based on voice and facial expression), and to tracking whether foul language is being used."Advertisers can erect "geofences"4 around any physical location or building5, which are essentially just lines with latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates, and can tag smartphones6 crossing such a fence, in order to send advertisements to that device. As a result, through no overt action of a consumer, the companies know who is in rehab, who goes to AA, who just got an abortion7, what your religion is, and whether you have a drug problem. If you're in rehab, or in jail, or go to an HIV clinic regularly, that information can be sold, and resold, simply because you have a mobile phone. This is the new reality--if the company can track your phone, they can track you."Wearable activity monitors (think Fitbit) collect your most intimate data, and none of it is covered by HIPAA until it reaches a doctor8, hospital, or other covered entity--as a result much of it is available for sharing or sale with third parties9."Employers can obtain information about their workforce from benefits managers10, who use sophisticated tools to figure out which employees might be trying to get pregnant, or be pre-diabetic; and in a small company with say only 20 women working, it is likely that if 10% of the workforce is trying to get pregnant, the manager knows who those two women are. Then, if the economy slows, and the manager needs to lay someone off...it might be easier to decide on the person who might be pregnant next year."5 low-resolution images of your face are enough11 12 for an algorithm to determine your sexual orientation (91% confidence for men, 83% for women). And remember, there are 10 countries in the world where to be gay is a crime punishable by death13."300 likes on Facebook are enough for an algorithm14 to predict your answers to a well-established personality profile, better than even your spouse, and much better than your co-workers. If we're all looking for someone to truly understand us, what does it say when that person is...the algorithm?"Amazon has a patent to use photos taken in the home15 to determine whether consumers are wearing certain images on their clothing (think a musician) and then using that to offer the consumer similar items for purchase."China is monitoring consumers' behavior--who they associate with, what they search for, whether they jaywalk16--to produce the famed 'Social Credit' score1718. Combined with a comprehensive facial recognition system, this takes societal tracking and control to a new level--and yet, in what way does the Chinese government know less about its citizens, than the big search engines or social media companies know about Americans?"Anyone can purchase a list of people taking certain medications19 or police officers' home addresses20. Employers can easily advertise to only younger potential employees on Facebook21, and do. Racists can specifically target certain ethnic groups in order to exclude them from renting an apartment22, or to try to get them to join a hate group23."The majority of the world's websites have a Google2425, Facebook or Twitter tracker--so that your information is being sent back to those companies, and you are being tracked over the internet, wherever you go, using whatever device you're on."And not just you: your children are being evaluated and tracked, often in direct contravention of laws like the Child Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), as was recently highlighted in a study showing almost 6,000 of the most popular children's Android26 apps were potentially in violation of COPPA."And not just online: in the physical world, Google recently was in the news, and is now facing multiple lawsuits, because it continued to track users up to 300 times a day27, even when the user had turned off his or her "location history," and seen this message in response "You can turn off Location History at any time. With Location History off, the places you go are no longer stored." However, despite the obvious implications of this message, Google continued to track users--and seemed to make it intentionally very difficult for even tech-savvy users trying to stop from being tracked, to turn off this constant location surveillance."Consumers do not also generally understand that in many cases these businesses and apps allow partners to install a small piece of software or code on the user's smartphone, which allows that third party to track the user and collect all the information pertaining to his or her use of that app; and furthermore not just information about that user's interactions with the original app, but what other apps the user might have installed, or have open."Weather apps are prime examples of this28, and many are in fact owned by data brokers, since consumers do not tend to turn off their location services for such apps, given it's more work to type in a zip code or a city, than to have the app simply display the weather forecast. But in so doing, they give the app real-time access to the consumer's exact location."We call this whole suite of issues, the 'expectation gap,' i.e. between what a user expects (that the app or company with which the consumer originally interacts, the "first party," will collect and process his/her data), and what actually happens (i.e. that tens or hundreds of "third parties" the consumer has never heard of, suddenly get access to his or her interactions on their smartphone, and that his or her location is sold and resold)."A major part of the rationale behind CCPA, was to give consumers tools to deal with this 'expectation gap.'"CCPA is not anti-business. It was, on the contrary, written and proposed by businesspeople concerned that regulations were needed; that as in so many previous situations, whether of the giant trusts of a century and more ago, or of the telephone and related wiretapping concerns, or cigarettes and health, or autos and safety, this latest technology too, has outpaced society's ability to fully comprehend it yet, or its impact on all of us."CCPA represents one step towards damming the flow of this river of information, from consumer towards giant, multinational corporation, and thence out to an entire ocean of companies the consumer has never heard of, and would never choose to do business with."CCPA puts the focus on giving choice back to the consumer, a choice which is sorely needed."* * *Footnotes:1 Note that when the bill emerged from the Legislative Counsel's office, a typo was made, which both industry and privacy groups have committed to fixing in 2019. The existing language reads "A business may also offer a different price, rate, level, or quality of goods or services to the consumer if that price or difference is directly related to the value provided to the consumer by the consumer's data." In reality, it should read "...provided to the business by the consumer's data."2 (Kostov, May 31 2018) Google Emerges as Early Winner From Europe's New Data Privacy Law.

TrendForce Announces Top 10 Trends in Information and Communication Technology Industry for 2019Business WireOctober 8, 2018 Monday 10:00 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Business Wire, Inc.Distribution: Business Editors; Technology EditorsLength: 1687 wordsDateline: TAIPEI, Taiwan BodyIn this release, TrendForce provides predictions of the information and communication technology industry for 2019, focusing on 10 key themes. Some of these themes continue from last year but will show significant evolution in the upcoming year.The memory industry will show acceleration and evolution, driven by next-generation products and advanced die-stacking technologyFor the semiconductor industry, the migration to each new process node is becoming much more difficult due to the physical limitations. The industry has been exploring advancements following the Moore's Law, while increasing the productivity through next-generation products and advanced die-stacking technology like 3D packaging. Manufacturers have applied through-silicon via (TSV) techniques for chip stacking, and launched High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) in order to increase the throughput within a single package, overcoming the limits of bandwidth. Looking forward to 2019, they will continue to invest in the R&D of advanced solutions. In addition to saving space in the package, next-generation products are also intended to meet the demand from edge computing applications, which require shorter reaction time and different structures. Compared with existing DRAM products, next-generation solutions may fit into different architectures, for example, in the embedded systems, memory products are closer to CPU. The solutions may also offer significant performance improvements, such as power saving resulted from the non-volatility of memory.Commercial 5G to rollout in 2019Deployment of optical communication infrastructure, the foundation of 5G network, has been ongoing in the past years. The 5G architecture has been gradually expanded from backbone network to metropolitan area network and access network, providing 5G-compatible bandwidth at a low cost. Commercialization of 5G is expected to roll out in 2019, with 5G telecom services to be launched in United States, South Korea, Japan, and China. Smartphones and other devices supporting 5G technology are also expected to be available some time in 2019. The major advances in 5G mobile wireless solutions will support higher bandwidth and faster connection, enriching the telecom ecosystems. The arrival of 5G may also generate demand for a wider range of technology-based services, including high resolution (4K/8K) of video, mobile AR/VR gaming and immersive multimedia applications, industrial automation, telesurgery robots, massive Internet of Things, and automated control of vehicles, etc.Smartphone specs to be upgraded, foldable and 5G smartphones to be launched in 2019The global smartphone market expects specs upgrades in the coming year, with more models featuring all-screen design, narrower borders, a smaller notch, and subsequent smaller front-facing camera modules to fit the smaller notch. Moreover, the smartphone market will expect increasing penetration of biometric recognition, with triple cameras emerging. The advanced solutions for flexible AMOLED may allow brands to launch single-screen foldable smartphones next year, while 5G smartphones are also expected to be launched in 2019. Brands are now planning for the 5G-fueled market, expecting commercial 5G to open up more opportunities and growth momentum. Offerings combining 5G and foldable screen may also see great potential and would make a splash in the smartphone market.Under-display fingerprint sensor to be embedded in mid and high-end smartphonesWith increasing demand from smartphone vendors, design houses have invested heavily to increase the yield rates of fingerprint sensors and seek more cost-effective solutions. Optical under-display fingerprint sensors are normally found in flagship smartphones currently, but are expected to be embedded in mid and high-end Android models in the coming year. Ultrasonic in-display fingerprint sensors also have a chance to be adopted by Android phone vendors. TrendForce estimates that ultrasonic and optical under-display fingerprint sensors will account for 13% of all fingerprint sensor technologies in 2019, significantly up from 3% in 2018. Particularly, some design houses also consider moving the fingerprint sensors to the very edge of the screen, trying to break through the bottlenecks of technology and yield rates. The edge solutions may change the landscape of industry if they manage to hit the market in the next few years. However, the target market and acceptance of products remain to be seen.Mini LED making its way into displays of consumer electronicsWith advantages in brightness and contrast, Mini LED has a chance to compete with OLED in segments of cinema display and home theater display. Compared with self-emitting RGB LED digital display (video wall), Mini LED-based backlight units use blue LED as the basic light source, making it more cost-effective, so Mini LED has higher potential to make its way into the blue ocean of displays of consumer electronics, including smartphone, tablets, desktops, TVs, and automotive displays. The next two years (2019-2020) will likely see acceleration in the development of Mini LED, which may record a market value of US$1699 million in 2022.More applications to enable voice interaction, opening up new opportunitiesSmart speakers remain in the spotlight of the market in 2018, drawing attention to applications enabling voice interaction, such as vehicles, smart TVs, and smart headsets. Looking forward to 2019, increasing number of applications will enable voice interaction, including virtual assistant, voice recognition, voice shopping, etc. Companies will continue to develop new voice-activated applications to explore the market potential.eSIM to provide added value to smartwatches, driving the market growthDriven by major companies like Apple, Huawei, and Qualcomm, eSIM has been introduced into the market, making smart devices more independent from smartphones and driving the growth of smartwatches at a pace faster than smart bracelets. The eSIM has been already embedded in smartwatches and always connected PCs to allow Internet connection, and more applications will adopt eSIM in 2019 to enable functions like streaming music, making calls, sending messages, and virtual assistant, etc.A key year for IoT with intensified competitionThis year has witnessed a rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, with the commercial use of low power wide area networks (LPWAN) becoming popular worldwide. Edge computing and AI have been integrated to IoT architectures, enabling transformation in vertical industries. With technology movements and global deployments in the following years, IoT is expected to come strong in operation of enterprises, making 2019 a key year for them to evaluate the outcome of adopting IoT in their businesses. Meanwhile, however, the competition is also intensified, thus enterprises are poised to consider whether investments in IoT operation are cost effective enough to enhance their profitability in the longer run.New technologies to change the landscape of healthcare industryFollowing the 21st Century Cures Act, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announces new regulations on next-generation sequencing (NGS) and digital medicine this year. The new technologies may change the landscape of biotechnology industry and attach increasing importance to software in the healthcare industry. Particularly, digital therapeutics has evolved, integrating ICT, software and drugs in treatment. Moreover, surgical robots and surgical navigation systems (SNS) are expected to integrate various medical imaging technologies including hybrid imaging, molecular imaging, AR and MR to optimize minimally invasive surgery. In terms of gene sequencing, NGS has been adopted in clinical application. FDA has been building genetic databases ClinVar and ClinGen, as well as PrecisionFDA that verifies the algorithms of sequencing. Gene sequencing data analysis and gene variants application will become the focus of the future NGS clinical market. In conjunction with new treatments, NGS will help achieve precision medicine in the future.Smart grid, energy management and energy storage system to be keys of global photovoltaic marketThis year witnessed constant expansion of installed PV supply capacity in China, but the policy updates by the Chinese government have led to oversupply in the market, resulting in global module price declines and cost pressures in the supply chain. Therefore, the global PV industry may expect a changing landscape in the upcoming year. On the other hand, the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of PV projects have seen significant decline, and grid-parity has been observed in the global PV market. With the constant decrease in PV feed-in tariff (FiT), smart grid, energy management and energy storage systems will become the key considerations for PV system developers. They will need to achieve effective energy storage to balance loads of power plants and stabilize the overall power quality in connection with grids and power plants.For the further details of the press release, please visit: https://press.trendforce.com/press/20181008-3166.htmlAbout TrendForce ( www.trendforce.com )TrendForce is a global provider of market intelligence on the technology industries.

Néstor García Canclini: We live in a world with a lot of indignation and little capacity for rebellionCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 23, 2018 SundayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 2217 wordsBody The social sciences assume the branch of science fiction in False Tracks , a novelistic debut in which the renowned anthropologist Néstor García Canclini (La Plata, 1939) allows himself to speculate about the present and future of the human race without the rigorous weight of research . Even so, or precisely because of that, in the story about a Chinese archaeologist who explores various Western countries in 2029, synthetic visions of the near future are filtered with flashes of the crisis of the parties, the ecological catastrophe, the biological wars, the internet, the algorithms, "techno-social" networks, the advance of neofascism, corporatism, precarious employment, tourism of experiences or the alliance between the State and the mafias. Ballardiana in his rarefied intellectualism, False Tracks supposes a twilight as nervous novel of ideas, the liberating negative of a humanism in crisis.  "There was a desire to write fiction for many years, I wanted to risk a novel in which there could be echoes of the investigation of topics that I have covered in recent years with the subordination to an imaginary future," says Canclini by telephone from Mexico, Where he lives-. I know that in some cases they are predictions difficult to verify, they may not happen, others do. For example, Palestine becomes a free State, and it is narrated the exasperation for intercultural frictions that we are experiencing, conflicts that governments can not or do not want to face ".  And complete: "I cared that everything was said from personal experiences, conversations of love relationships or friends, so that the multiplicity of perspectives that coexist in the novel is similar to what we try in anthropology, work not only with statistics or hard data, but with the plurality of voices that exist in any society ". -To what extent are we already in 2029? Did the world change in a short time? -It is enough to look at what has happened this century with technologies, historical acceleration, trials that changed social relations such as Second Life, mentioned in the novel, or Facebook, big companies that have achieved political effects with twisted methods. We are living a dynamism, a transformation that makes it necessary or valuable to play with these oscillations of time to have a less rigid perception. We do not have a global story, less a scientific theory or paradigm that allows us to explain how globalization is decomposing and is becoming more of a deglobalization. But we can make approximations to how characters, social groups and movements are searching for meaning. -In the novel he opposes Hitler to Goya. What models do these figures represent? - They are two ways to position themselves before decompositions or times. Goya has always amazed me by his insight to discover the contradictions of modernity in its beginnings. He describes how in the popular sectors there is also cruelty and at the same time makes magnificent ridicule to the powerful. Somehow that is related to the question that a character asks the other about whether Hitler is now in society or if there is a risk that new leaders appear with that omnipotence. It is a relevant debate to avoid the ease of the word populism, which I do not like. Within that name, Berlusconi, Trump, Cristina Kirchner, a, Maduro, heterogeneous characters in different societies and with different political histories are included. The word means nothing. In any case, the question is how to imagine another society and not just a different government. - Why a Chinese protagonist? In the book, China looks hostile and exciting. -The source is a trip I made to Chinain 2009 and that really impacted me. I had read about the transformations of their culture and their art, but the confrontation with their complex, enormously unequal development, their mixture of capitalism and authoritarianism and a certain way of community organization, seemed attractive to me. From there comes the protagonist, annoyed by the activities to which they commit as an archaeologist dependent on official policies. That's why we come to Latin America, first to Argentina, then to Mexico, to contemplate that our societies are also breaking down, that produces dissatisfaction but attraction at the same time. It is the reverse of the fascination that China brought to me, the intercultural confrontation with abysmal differences in the ways of making art or history. We are already living that confrontation as a secret, it is not given enough importance. We know of the spectacular growth of Chinese investments in Latin America, throughout the West, the purchase of strategic places, but they are investigating us much more with their institutes of studies on Latin America than we do with them. The essay of the novel is to put tension in China and the West, to confront this stage of unstoppable globalization where we entrench ourselves or believe that we can subtract part of our life from the tingling of the economy, that way of seizing other cultures and societies that are already happening. -At the same time the text seems to demystify Latin America as a promising area. -It is a tension that we live all the time the Latin American countries, diverse situations like the one that today is lived in Argentina, with economic, political failures, having to take the main football confrontation to Madrid. This disorder of our daily life and institutions shows that we are not a totally hopeful place. At the same time in Mexico we lived the first days of a government that provokes expectations and contradictions, a tembladeral that gives rise to talk about issues, conflicts, tears and deaths that had been hidden by the last six years. The situation is not easy, in any case this oscillation between what is happening in most Latin American countries in relation to the transformation expectations of the past decade makes us see the diversity of situations with which we have to deal with, that They are stimulating and it is good not to hide them. We must take care of questions as old as what we have done with the Mapuches in Argentina or how we have neglected education. One of the motivations for writing a fiction is being able to speak with more freedom. New papers- "False tracks" warns of the vertiginous advance of marketing over universities and humanities. What is the future of the practice? -There has been a weakening of public universities and their social presence in Latin American countries. And there has been a growth of private universities that sometimes fulfill important public functions and have the capacity to form critically, and in others they are simple businesses. There is a rethinking for now restricted of the new roles assumed by universities. What most immediately concerns us is what will happen to our graduates in societies that do not create new jobs, which have almost all chosen to depend on large transnational capitals, which assign subordinate roles of maquiladoras, both of the ordinary products of the industry as of knowledge. And there is still a scientific production, even theoretical in Latin America, one of the places of resistance where it is not seen that neoliberalism has left fatal mechanical consequences. There is a responsibility to rethink how to modify ouruniversities, generate relevant paideias for biotechnological transformations, new knowledge that social sciences must produce instead of repeating models of the 20th century. -The protagonist writes by hand. What is the place for writing and reading? - Write by hand and also letters. Cultivate with your friends and your partner the recovery of the value of the letter as a place of non-instantaneous message, which does not seek easy impact, where poetry can also have a place to rename and disconcert us. I am still interested in what is happening with the tweets, with Facebook, I am working on this topic in relation to the de-citizenization of Latin American countries at this time and in other areas of the world, together with the emergence of new actors such as yellow vests in France , the student movements in Chile or the extraordinary marches of human rights in Argentina with their lobbying and ways of intervening in favor of gender rights, which have made surprising advances in a country still so tied to Catholicism. But all this is about thinking about writing, what we do when we write not only fiction as a novelist, or poetry, but writing in social sciences, how to find a way out of intra-academic communication, other ways of communicating with the media, networks, creating more reflective public spheres, of debate and not only of attack, of experimentation with language, because if we do not change the way of naming, we can not change imperfections in society either. - What possibility of real transformation today fits such movements? - They are movements of high intensity and of short duration. In many cases they appear as sectoral manifestations, as if we lived in a world with a lot of indignation and little capacity to join rebellions. There is a question of political theory, social theory and political practice itself. Emerging in recent feminism concerns not only for the claim that remains indispensable, but to understand, behind the fact that women earn less than men for the same tasks, what logic of capitalism is conditioning that, which is not only a gender logic but it is intertwined with other strategies of inequality. Something that has happened internationally and that had its origin in the United States is that the struggles have taken place in a fragmented form and by oppressed fringes, the indigenous on the one hand, the African-Americans on the other, the women on the other, the gays on the other. That was successful as a hegemonic policy, fragmentation and isolationism between movements have not allowed to build opposition alternatives. In the United States, Democrats and Republicans are largely accomplices. Perhaps in Latin America for greater social flexibility and the ability to coexist with the different, not always, there are opportunities to rehearse how to coordinate these dissidences with the systemic that has failed, with the globalization that excludes us, with the neoliberal regimes that are indifferent to social pain. Uncertain landscape -How do you think the current technological transformation affects the human being?  -The discussion about the anthropocene and the biotechnological limits of the definition of what it is to be human opens us an uncertain and sometimes alarming, disturbing, unbearable landscape of vertigo. This is a task not only of the social and biological sciences, but of art, of communication, in the need to organize forms of social participation in which we can understand these challenges cooperatively. That is also why interculturality, coexistence with distant cultures. It is no longer about seeing if we adopt yoga or certain Asian foods,because we are all the time oscillating between multiple belongings although we have been born in a society and we have not migrated. For that reason, for me the great object of anthropology today is no longer culture, but interculturality. -Menciona to several Argentine writers. What interests you in literature? -Many of the great Argentine authors have been characterized by eclecticism, Borges the eldest, that ability to relate very different sources to the contrary of European letters, where the French only speak of the French or Germans of the Germans. We nurture ourselves very differently when we migrate, now when we travel, we study in other countries, especially the younger ones have a fluid interconnection, they speak more than one language and that versatility is enhanced. There is no predominant tendency in the narrative or literature in Latin America now. There are, as insinuated in the novel, some forms of writing, of being dissident. The innovation of other eras has tired, hence the distance suggested by Cortázar's novels, not the stories. Side roads emerge. You do not want to reach conclusions or draw directives about literature or the social sciences. I highlight the plurality of authors who are inconclusive or inconclusive. Samanta Schweblin, for example, or Fogwill, Marcelo Cohen, seem to me fortunate examples of how in the Argentine case work is being done on this plurality of experimentations. -The Danish political series "Borgen" is named in the book. How do you see the phenomenon? -The displacement that there is at the moment of the movie theaters without ceasing to exist, since in Mexico we have more than six thousand, five times more than 30 years ago, towards Netflix and other platforms makes us aware that there is other ways to see on many screens. I'm surprised how many people watch movies on their cell phones. I mention Borgen because it is one of the most fortunate series, but there are many. I am not a cultivator of series, yes of much cinema on television, and of shows, concerts that I have no other way of seeing them because they have happened or are made in very distant cities. It is a wonderful opportunity to be more interconnected, to open up to the unforeseen, and to ask more pertinent questions than before about how all this can coexist in us.  Advertising       Load-Date: December 23, 2018End of Document

AMNESTY WELCOMES REPORTS OF AN END TO DRAGONFLYStates News ServiceDecember 18, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 210 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, NY BodyThe following information was released by Amnesty International USA:Responding to media reports that Google will shut down Dragonfly, its censored search app for China, Amnesty International's Secretary General Kumi Naidoo said:"Media reports that Google is shelving Dragonfly follow intense criticism of the project from human rights groups and Google's own staff. We would welcome a decision by Google to drop Dragonfly and abandon its plans to cooperate in large-scale censorship and surveillance by the Chinese government. Going ahead with Project Dragonfly would represent a massive capitulation on human rights by one of the world's most powerful companies."It's worrying that these reports suggest that Project Dragonfly has been shelved due to discrepancies over internal process, rather than over human rights concerns. As Amnesty International and others set out in a letter to Sundar Pichai last week, threats to the rights to freedom of expression and privacy for millions of people in China should have never seen this project come into being.We once again call on Google's CEO Sundar Pichai to clear up any speculation and publicly state that his company will refrain from developing censored search products and drop Dragonfly with immediate effect."Load-Date: December 20, 2018End of Document

Honeywell to Equip VCOM With Turboprop EnginesTargeted News ServiceNovember 6, 2018 Tuesday 8:11 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 512 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: ZHUHAI, China BodyHoneywell Aerospace, a division of Honeywell International, issued the following news release:Honeywell (NYSE: HON) has signed an agreement with VCOM Technologies Limited to purchase 11 of its TPE331-12UAN turboprop engines in order to start upgrading its Y5BG aircraft and offer the upgrade for production. The updated engines will improve hot and high-altitude performance, decrease fuel and maintenance costs and improve reliability. In addition, the TPE331 allows for extended overhaul intervals to 7000 hours, demonstrating Honeywell's commitment to operator satisfaction over the entire product lifecycle."Pilots flying with a TPE331-powered engine enjoy exceptional horsepower response and outstanding fuel economy," said Amit Kaul, Leader of Business and General Aviation, Asian Pacific, Honeywell Aerospace. "Honeywell's propulsion engine design and development have led the way in performance, reliability and efficiency, and we continue to develop new technologies and improve design to meet the ever-changing needs of our customers."Honeywell has obtained a Validation Type Certificate from the Civil Aviation Administration of China for the TPE331-12UAN engine, which ensures the technology meets the safety and security standards of the Chinese government. With over 50 years of dedicated service, the engine has proven its success in the commercial industry with its single-shaft design, which provides better fuel efficiency, better power response and a lower cost of ownership. The engine has a built-in torque and temperature limiting system allowing the flight crew to make power applications that will not result in an over temperature or over torque condition thus eliminating unnecessary operation costs."Better cruise speeds and shorter landings equate to fuel savings along with longer intervals between maintenance to reduce overall operating costs," said, Mr. Liu Hai Dong, President, VCOM. "With the TPE331 engine, the Y5BG aircraft can travel at higher altitudes with more payload for a longer period of time. VCOM has a rigorous selection process when it comes to engines, and we are confident that the engine will deliver excellent performance while enhancing our aircraft capabilities."Honeywell's TPE331 turboprop engine was originally certified for commercial use in 1965. The engine has since branched out to include more than 18 engine models and 106 configurations for use by regional airlines, the agriculture industry and general aviation. With more than 1,650 shaft horsepower in TPE331 engine family, it is a very cost-effective and powerful engine in its class with the much lower cost of ownership. In the last several years the TPE engine has ranked number one according to the AIN Survey.Customers throughout the industry have relied on its performance and efficiency as proven by more than 13,800 TPE331 engine deliveries and 129 million hours of flight time. The TPE331 engine has also surpassed notable performance and adoption milestones in the unmanned aircraft segment.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6508413 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: November 7, 2018End of Document

Trump can overthrow the empire erected by Huawei's presidentCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 16, 2018 SundayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 590 wordsBody       Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei, considered a legend in China's business world, was a soldier of the People's Liberation Army and made billions with technology.  At Huawei Technologies' huge headquarters in Shenzhen, the walls of the cafeteria are decorated with phrases of founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei. The research lab is reminiscent of the White House in Washington. In the place, there is a lake where three black swans live.  Ren was a soldier of the People's Liberation Army and won billions with technology. For Ren, birds serve to remind us that we must combat complacency and prepare for unexpected crises. And that's what happened at Huawei. Financial director Meng Wanzhou, Ren's daughter, is being held in Canada and may be extradited to the United States after allegations of conspiring to deceive banks and violate sanctions on Iran.  Meng's arrest has put Huawei in the crossfire of China-US technology rivalry. The US government sees the Chinese company - a major global supplier of mobile phone equipment - as a potential national security risk. In President Donald Trump's team, some are particularly keen to prevent Huawei from providing equipment for the migration of US mobile operators to 5G technology, which promises to accelerate the adoption of stand-alone cars and Internet-connected devices.  Ren is a legend in China's business world. It survived as millions starved as a result of economic policies implemented by Mao Tse Tung and succeeded in erecting a technology company that invoiced $ 92 billion. Huawei is the largest smartphone maker in China and the second largest in the world, surpassing Apple, according to consultancy firm IDC. While receiving less attention than the Chinese internet giants, Huawei's revenues last year were larger than the sum of Alibaba Group Holding's revenue, Tencent Holdings and Baidu. Half of the sales are made overseas, mainly in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  For years, authorities around the world have expressed concern about the company's global expansion. In 2008, the US Foreign Investment Committee prevented it from completing an acquisition. Most recently, Australia, New Zealand and the USA vetoed or limited the use of Huawei equipment. Mobile phone operators in Japan also plan to ban some of the company's components, according to a report from Kyodo News.  The arrest and prosecution of Meng in the United States is at the heart of a US-China dispute over technology dominance in the coming decades - with potentially severe consequences for Huawei.  Ren declined Bloomberg News's interview request.  "This gives Trump a bargaining chip," said economist George Magnus of the Center for China at Oxford University in the United Kingdom. "She is the president's daughter, Ren Zhengfei, a former Army officer, and the alleged interactions between Huawei and Iran are just the latest concern among many."  If the situation gets to such a point, a ban on the purchase of US technology and components would be a blow to Huawei. The Trump government imposed this penalty onChinese ZTE, but stepped back.  A full US trade veto would not apply only to components, but also to software and patents from US companies, analysts Edison Lee and Timothy Chau of Jefferies Securities warned. "If Huawei can not license Google's Android or Qualcomm's patents on 4G and 5G radio access technology, it will not be able to manufacture smartphones or 4G / 5G base stations," they wrote in a report.  (Original text: Huawei's CEO Built an Empire.

Wall Street ends higher with help from tech and health careAssociated Press InternationalDecember 12, 2018 Wednesday 9:35 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; Financial MarketsLength: 909 wordsByline: By MARLEY JAY, AP Markets WriterDateline: NEW YORK BodyNEW YORK (AP) - U.S. stocks couldn't hang on to a big gain Wednesday, but they still finished broadly higher as technology and health care companies rose. That helped reverse some of the market's big losses from the week before.Stocks initially rallied after the Wall Street Journal reported that China's government could make changes to its "Made in China 2025" economic development plan. That could be one step toward easing dispute between the world's two largest economies. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged as much as 458 points in morning trading, but gave later back much of that gain."Any time you get some semblance of good news on trade, you've had this tendency to see a pretty sharp rally," said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist for Charles Schwab.After taking steep losses at the end of last week, stocks have gyrated this week: on Monday they rallied to erase a big early loss, while on Tuesday a big morning gain turned into a small decline.On Wednesday, most of the day's gains evaporated in the afternoon. The hour-to-hour changes reflect investors' nervousness about the health of the global economy: economic growth is expected to slow in 2019 and the U.S.-China trade dispute and rising interest rates could both make that slowdown more painful. Sonders said investors overlooked those threats for a time, but can't ignore them anymore."Some of these intraday reversals have been quite extraordinary," said Sonders. "You have to go back to the financial crisis era to see ... such a big swing on consecutive days."The S&P 500 index rose 14.29 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,651.07. The Dow gained 157.03 points, or 0.6 percent, to 24,527.27. The Nasdaq composite jumped 66.48 points, or 0.9 percent, to 7,098.31. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks added 15.19 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,455.32.Among technology companies, chipmaker Broadcom gained 3.3 percent to $254.98. Amazon gained 1.2 percent to $1,663.54 to lead retailers, and Netflix jumped 3.6 percent to $274.88 as internet and media companies joined in the gains.Among industrials, machinery maker Caterpillar climbed 1.7 percent to $125.37 and equipment rental company United Rentals surged 6.3 percent to $108.30 after it gave strong forecasts for 2019 and said it will start buying back stock this month.Through the "Made in China 2025" initiative, Beijing aims to create leading companies in fields like artificial intelligence, electric cars and robotics. The Trump administration says the government is unfairly subsidizing Chinese companies and discriminating against foreign rivals. Along with disputes over China's handling of intellectual property, it's a significant piece of the trade tensions between the countries.Despite Wednesday's gains, almost half of the 500 stocks that make up the S&P 500 have fallen into a "bear market," meaning they have dropped at least 20 percent from their most recent peaks. The S&P 500 itself is down 9.5 percent from its record high in late September. The last bear market for the index ended in March 2009.British legislators forced a no-confidence vote in Prime Minister Theresa May, threatening an end to her tenure. She won the vote, which was revealed after the close of U.S. trading. Lawmakers within May's Conservative Party have expressed frustrations over her negotiations of Britain's departure from the European Union, and many of them want a cleaner break from the trading bloc. Opposition lawmakers don't want Britain to leave the EU.The uncertainty has knocked the British pound sharply lower in recent days, but it rose Wednesday to $1.2634 from $1.2527. The FTSE 100 stock index added 1.1 percent.Deutsche Bank jumped after Bloomberg News reported that the German government might take steps to make it easier for the struggling bank to combine with competitor Commerzbank. U.S.-traded shares of Deutsche Bank gained 8.4 percent to $9.03, but they're still down 52.5 percent this year and have fallen almost 80 percent over the past five years as the company reels from weak results and investments in Greek and Italian bonds that went bad.Commerzbank stock added 5.6 percent in Frankfurt.Bond prices slipped. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.91 percent from 2.88 percent.Tencent Music Entertainment, the largest music streaming service in China, climbed 7.7 percent in its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The company's IPO of 82 million shares priced at $13 a share and closed at $14 a share. Slightly more than half are being sold by the company and the rest are being sold by shareholders.The CAC 40 in France surged 2.1 percent and Germany's DAX rose 1.4 percent. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 jumped 2.2 percent and South Korea's Kospi rose 1.4 percent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong added 1.6 percent.Benchmark U.S. crude oil fell 1 percent to $52.15 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 0.1 percent to $60.15 per barrel in London.Wholesale gasoline dipped 1.3 percent to $1.42 a gallon and heating oil was unchanged at $1.85 a gallon. Natural gas dropped 6.1 percent to $4.14 per 1,000 cubic feet.The dollar dipped to 113.22 yen from 113.40 yen. The euro rose to $1.1367 from $1.1325.The price of gold rose 0.2 percent to $1,250 an ounce, silver rose 1.5 percent to $14.85 an ounce and copper edged up 0.1 percent to $2.77 a pound.____AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAPLoad-Date: December 13, 2018End of Document

Apple Stays Busy With Two Product Launch Events Ahead Of Earnings And Holiday SeasonBenzinga.comOctober 31, 2018 Wednesday 1:35 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Accretive Capital LLC d/b/a Benzinga All Rights ReservedLength: 1145 wordsByline: JJ KinahanBodyApple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) reports fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after the closing bell on Thursday, Nov. 1. Even with the recent pullback, shares are still up 23.8 percent year to date, handily beating the Nasdaq 100 s (NDX) 4.59 percent increase and the S&P 500 s (SPX) 0.49 percent decline. With the stock not too far from all-time high, AAPL has gotten two upgrades in the past two weeks alone. And earlier in September, analysts at Bank of America and Morgan Stanley maintained buy/overweight ratings as well. With a series of upgrades, no sell ratings and hold ratings dropping steadily since the last report, AAPL has a lot of positive sentiment to live up to tomorrow.  For fiscal Q4, AAPL is expected to report adjusted EPS of $2.78 on revenue of $61.57 billion, according to third-party consensus analyst estimates. In the same quarter last year, it reported adjusted EPS of $2.07 on revenue of $52.58 billion. AAPL s own guidance calls for revenue of $60 billion to $62 billion, gross margin of 38 to 38.5 percent, and operating expenses of roughly $8 billion. Per usual, management is likely to provide an update on share buybacks and dividend payments. During fiscal Q3, they said the company had paid out $3.7 billion in dividends and repurchased $20 billion worth of shares, bringing its buyback authorization to $90 billion at the end of the last quarter. Another area that might come up on tomorrow s call is China, as some of the company s products have been impacted by tariffs. A growing number of analysts have also expressed concerns that Chinese government crackdowns on gaming, as well as signs of weakening consumer demand, pose potential short-term risks. New Products and the HolidaysWhen AAPL last reported, the iPhone still made up a little over 50 percent of the company s sales and remains its largest division by far. In fiscal Q3, AAPL sold 41.3 million iPhones, which generated $29.9 billion in revenue, a 20 percent year-over-year increase. Unit volumes were up 1 percent and average selling price (ASP) increased 20 percent to $724, which AAPL attributed to strong sales of higher-priced iPhone X and iPhone 8. Analyst consensus is for ASP to come in around $749 this quarter. Earlier in the month, AAPL unveiled its newest lineup of iPhones. The two flagship models, the iPhone XS and XS Max went on sale Sept. 21, so a brief portion of their initial sales will be included in tomorrow s results. While those models started at $1000 and topped out at $1449, the lower-priced iPhone XR wasn t released until the end of October, putting any of its sales in the next report. As is usually the case, many analysts have indicated they re more focused on what guidance AAPL provides for the fiscal first quarter, parsing for clues about how many new iPhones management expects to sell during the holiday season. Currently, analyst consensus is expecting 100 million iPhones to be sold during the holiday quarter.In addition to new iPhones, AAPL announced new Macs, MacBooks and iPad Pros at its Oct. 30 product launch event. Results from Macs and iPads have been mixed in recent quarters. In fiscal Q3, AAPL reported that Mac sales declined 13 percent year over year on a unit basis and 5 percent on a revenue basis; iPad sales increased 1 percent on a unit basis, but revenue dropped 5 percent. The Other Products category, which includes the Apple Watch, Air Pods, Apple TV and more, has garnered more interest from analysts and investors as it has been the company s fastest-growing division. Other Products  revenue increased 37 percent year over year in fiscal Q3 to $3.74 billion. Apple ServicesAAPL s Services business, which includes segments like the App Store and iCloud, has grown to become its second largest division by revenue. In its last report, Services revenue grew 31 percent year over year to $9.55 billion. Management s stated goal is to get Services revenue to $51 billion per year by 2020.Apple Services. AAPL s Services business has grown to become the company s second largest division behind the iPhone. In fiscal Q3, AAPL reported that Services generated $9.55 billion out of $53.27 billion in revenue.

Earlier this week, Jefferies  analysts said they expect Services to comprise 25 percent of AAPL s revenue and 40 percent of its gross profit by fiscal 2020, and think that portion of the business could be valued between $111 and $177 per share by then.Apple Options Trading ActivityOptions traders have priced in a 4.5 percent stock move in either direction around the earnings report, according to the Market Maker Move indicator on the thinkorswim® platform. Implied volatility is on the high, sitting at the 94th percentile as of this morning.Apple 2018 Stock Chart. Even with the recent pullback, AAPL is still up 23.82 percent year to date heading into tomorrow s report. After outperforming by a wide margin since 2017, the tech sector has been leading some of the recent declines as volatility picks up. AAPL s earnings could be another factor that will play into market sentiment over the next few days. Chart source:            thinkorswim® by TD Ameritrade.  Not a recommendation.

On the put side, trading has been concentrated at the 210 strike price, a small amount above $206, where the stock has seen some support.  Looking at the Nov. 16 monthly expiration, again the 215 and 220 strike prices on the call side have been active in recent trading. For puts, the 205 and 215 strike prices have been active, with the highest open interest at the 205 strike. Note: Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time.

Dictionary.com chooses 'misinformation' as word of the yearAssociated Press InternationalNovember 26, 2018 Monday 1:24 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: DOMESTIC NEWSLength: 944 wordsByline: By LEANNE ITALIE, Associated PressDateline: NEW YORK BodyNEW YORK (AP) - Misinformation, as opposed to disinformation, was chosen Monday as Dictionary.com's word of the year on the tattered coattails of "toxic," picked earlier this month for the same honor by Oxford Dictionaries in these tumultuous times.Jane Solomon, a linguist-in-residence at Dictionary, said in a recent interview that her site's choice of "mis" over "dis" was deliberate, intended to serve as a "call to action" to be vigilant in the battle against fake news, flat earthers and anti-vaxxers, among other conduits.It's the idea of intent, whether to inadvertently mislead or to do it on purpose, that the Oakland, California-based company wanted to highlight. The company decided it would go high when others have spent much of 2018 going low."The rampant spread of misinformation is really providing new challenges for navigating life in 2018," Solomon told The Associated Press ahead of the word of the year announcement. "Misinformation has been around for a long time, but over the last decade or so the rise of social media has really, really changed how information is shared. We believe that understanding the concept of misinformation is vital to identifying misinformation as we encounter it in the wild, and that could ultimately help curb its impact."In studying lookups on the site that trended this year, Dictionary noticed "our relationship with truth is something that came up again and again," she said.For example, the word "mainstream" popped up a lot, spiking in January as the term "mainstream media," or MSM, grew to gargantuan proportions, wielded as an insult by some on the political right. Other words swirling around the same problem included a lookup surge in February for "white lie" after Hope Hicks, then White House communications director, admitted to telling a few for President Donald Trump.The word "Orwellian" surfaced in heavy lookups in May, after a statement attributed to White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders accused the Chinese government of "Orwellian nonsense" in trying to impose its views on American citizens and private companies when it declared that United Airlines, American Airlines and other foreign carriers should refer to Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau as part of China in public-facing materials, such as their websites.Misinformation, Solomon said, "frames what we've all been through in the last 12 months." In that vein, the site with 90 million monthly users has busied itself adding new word entries for "filter bubble," ''fake news," ''post-fact," ''post-truth" and "homophily," among others. Other word entries on the site have been freshened to reflect timely new meanings, including "echo chamber."The company's runners-up for the top honor include "representation," driven by the popularity of the movies "Black Panther" and "Crazy Rich Asians," along with wins during the U.S. midterm elections for Muslim women, Native Americans and LGBTQ candidates.But the rise of misinformation, Solomon said, stretches well beyond U.S. borders and Facebook's role in disseminating fake news and propaganda in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The use of Facebook and other social media to incite violence and conflict was documented around the globe in 2018, she said."Hate speech and rumors posted to Facebook facilitated violence against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, riots started in Sri Lanka after false news set the country's Buddhist majority against Muslims, and false rumors about child kidnappers on WhatsApp led to mob violence in India," Solomon said.Is disinformation or misinformation at play in terms of the year's most prominent conspiracy theories? Solomon noted proliferation on social media over students in the Parkland school shooting being crisis actors instead of victims of violence, and over a group of migrants from Honduras who are making their way north being funded by "rich liberals."Elsewhere in the culture, countless podcasts and videos have spread the absurd notion of a global cover-up that the Earth is flat rather than round. The idea of "misinfodemics" has surfaced in the last several years to identify the anti-vaccination movement and other beliefs that lead to real-world health crises, Solomon said.There are distinctions between misinformation and disinformation to be emphasized."Disinformation would have also been a really, really interesting word of the year this year, but our choice of misinformation was very intentional," she said. "Disinformation is a word that kind of looks externally to examine the behavior of others. It's sort of like pointing at behavior and saying, 'THIS is disinformation.' With misinformation, there is still some of that pointing, but also it can look more internally to help us evaluate our own behavior, which is really, really important in the fight against misinformation. It's a word of self-reflection, and in that it can be a call to action. You can still be a good person with no nefarious agenda and still spread misinformation."She pointed to "Poe's law" in slicing and dicing "misinfo" and "disinfo." The term, dating to 2005, has become an internet shorthand to sum up how easy it is to spread satire as truth online when an author's intent isn't clearly indicated.The phrase is based on a comment one Nathan Poe posted on a Christian forum during a discussion over creationism, in which he commented: "Without a winking smiley or other blatant display of humor, it is uttrerly (sic) impossible to parody a Creationist in such a way that someone (italics used) won't mistake for the genuine article."Dictionary.com chose "complicit" as last year's word of the year. In 2016, it was "xenophobia."Load-Date: November 27, 2018End of Document

Forget the oil companies. Google is the new target of activistsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 23, 2018 SundayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 499 wordsBody       When she started working at Google, Vanessa Harris had no idea that the company might someday see protests by human rights defenders. But eight years later, that's exactly what happened.  Google, which adopted the motto "do not be evil", entered a corporate club previously restricted to oil companies, mining giants and gun makers.  Last week, more than 60 human rights organizations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, demanded that Google end the initiative to launch a censored search engine in China, saying that the decision could make the company "an accomplice of human rights violations ".  "Well, Google has united human rights organizations," Harris wrote on Twitter.  More than a week earlier, Amnesty had accused Google of helping the Chinese government spy on its citizens and posted a fake job advertisement on Twitter to help the company replace employees who may have resigned because of the project "Dragonfly."  "When I joined Google, I never imagined that we would ever be targeted for an attack in the form of an Amnesty International announcement," Harris replied on Twitter, adding an emoji with a sad face to the tweet. "The Google that I entered (apparently" falsely "really advocated much more than raising advertising revenue," he added in another tweet on 30 November.  Harris, a leading product manager for the company, did not respond to requests for comments. But their social media advertising signals a more widespread nuisance among some Google employees.  "Google employees care very, very much about ethics," said Yana Calou, training manager for the defense group Coworker.org, which works with some activists from the Google team. "There was a certain breach of confidence."  Other technology giants have also been targeted, and Google has been criticized by privacy experts and fined by European competition regulators. But the internet giant, which creates products loved by billions of people, was until recently viewed by many as an anomaly: a company that had heart. Now, as the company expands its already broad reach into new markets to keep revenue growing, the reality that Google is very much like any other big company is consolidating itself - inside and outside of company.  "The reason for all this shock is that people went to work at Google with a certain sense that they were building technologies that benefit society," said Joe Westby, an Amnesty International researcher. Google chose not to comment.  Initiatives like Dragonfly, coupled with Google's enormous size and power, have undermined this image. It is one of the most valuable companies in the world, which controls how a significant part of the world's information flows on the internet. Google is also developing an artificial intelligence technology that has the potential to make other important decisions. This kind of power demands greater scrutiny, according to Westby.  (Original text: Forget Big Oil. Google Is the New Target for Activists) Load-Date: December 23, 2018End of Document

North Korean Cyber Attacks Complement Its Nuclear Capabilities: FDD StudyTargeted News ServiceOctober 3, 2018 Wednesday 7:33 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 499 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Foundation for Defense of Democracies issued the following news release:While North Korea's cyber capabilities cannot match those of China or Russia, Pyongyang's operatives are making significant improvements and pose a threat to U.S. economic and national security, according to a new report issued today by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD).Mathew Ha and David Maxwell write in "Kim Jong Un's 'All-Purpose Sword': North Korean Cyber-Enabled Economic Warfare," that even as Kim Jong Un's nuclear and ballistic missile arsenals present the most pressing threat, cyber campaigns complement North Korea's conventional and unconventional military capabilities and broaden the regime's toolkit for threatening the military and economic assets of the United States and its South Korean ally.Whether or not Pyongyang decides to limit its nuclear weapons program, the regime is likely to use malicious cyber activity to engage in provocative behavior below the threshold of war to win political and economic concessions that ensure the Kim family regime's survival."Showcasing and testing nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles was the cornerstone of this strategy," the authors explain. Today, cyber-enabled economic warfare operations provide a potential low-cost, alternative tool to extort concessions by threatening U.S. and South Korean critical infrastructure and industries."Fifteen or even 10 years ago, when analyzing potential blowback to U.S. sanctions on North Korea or U.S.-South Korean military exercises, there was never a consideration of the Kim regime's ability to target the U.S. economy," said Samantha Ravich, senior advisor and Principal Investigator of FDD's cyber-enabled economic warfare (CEEW) project. "Now, North Korea has one of the most capable and aggressive cyber operations. Facing intense U.S. economic sanctions, Pyongyang may consider using its cyber capabilities to attack the U.S. economy."Ha, an FDD research associate, and Maxwell, a Senior Fellow specializing in North Korea, conclude that while the majority of North Korea's malicious cyber activity today is "focused on making - or stealing - money for the regime or on collecting data, the technical capabilities that the regime is perfecting could be leveraged in cyber-enabled economic warfare operations." This assessment aligns with current trends in the cyber threat landscape: as most malign cyber actors are focused on revenue generation, many increasingly have the capabilities and inclinations to engage in destructive attacks.The authors propose six policy recommendations the U.S. government should consider when addressing the specific cyber threats from North Korea.This report is the third in a series of studies on the capabilities and strategies of U.S. adversaries to engage in CEEW against America and its allies. The previous reports examined the strategies of the Russian government and the Chinese Communist Party.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6469256 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: October 4, 2018End of Document

Coalition for a Prosperous America Op-ed: The Trouble With a Trump-Xi Deal at the G20 in ArgentinaTargeted News ServiceDecember 2, 2018 Sunday 7:30 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 834 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: SOUTHWICK, Massachusetts BodyThe Coalition for a Prosperous America issued the following news release:President Donald Trump's tariffs on China will be a major topic at the G20 meeting in Argentina this week. Pundits have been quick to criticize the president for launching a trade war -- and have called for compromise.Op-ed by Michael Stumo, CEO of CPA, originally appeared in LifeZette on November 30, 2018Trump and China's President Xi Jinping are scheduled to meet this weekend. But China has refused to admit any wrongdoing or to change the commercial espionage practices that caused the tariffs to be implemented in the first place.The president's critics should consider that the goal of getting China to become a market-oriented economy with an open political system has failed. That failure is causing unprecedented and continuing harm for American-based production and workers. Rather than worrying about hurting Beijing's feelings, commentators and free-trade economists should focus more on a troubling decline in America's technological, economic, and military edge.In June, and after a lengthy investigation into China's cyber-espionage and hacking of U.S. companies, President Trump imposed Section 301 tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods.A detailed government report had documented years of state-sponsored practices, including theft of high-tech property, hacked networks, and forced technology transfer. Rather than change course in the face of the tariffs, however, Beijing has doubled down on its predatory behavior -- prompting tariffs on an additional $200 billion of Chinese products.The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative recently provided an updated report on China's practices in advance of the G20 summit. This is reasonable, since it informs the president as to whether or not Beijing is changing its behavior and whether a compromise would be in the U.S. national interest.However, the report notes that "China has not fundamentally altered its unfair, unreasonable, and market-distorting practices that were the subject of the March 2018 report on our Section 301 investigation."Translation: China is still hacking U.S. companies, forcing transfer of critical technologies, and engaging in weaponized foreign investment strategies.All of this matters greatly since, as even a school kid knows, the digital world holds the key to 21st century prosperity. But America is now falling behind when it comes to advanced technologies, thanks in large part to China's heavy subsidization of its high-tech sector.The numbers paint a gloomy picture. In 2000, the U.S. ran a $5 billion trade surplus in advanced technology products. By last year, however, that figure had shifted to a stunning $110 billion deficit -- almost entirely with China.China repeatedly steals critical advanced technologies from U.S. companies -- and uses such hacking to keep moving ahead in the global arena. Amazingly, all of the longstanding intrusions of U.S. networks, and the hacking of proprietary high-tech secrets, have simply been tolerated for years.The results have been significant, though. Chinese companies have stolen U.S. technology for nuclear power generators, solar cells, and both internet software and hardware. And it's estimated that 20 percent of the wind turbines deployed in China today contain stolen software.For all those who say that President Trump is being too aggressive with Beijing, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer's new report offers a hard dose of reality. U.S. trade delegations have repeatedly attempted to find compromise and constructive engagement with Beijing. But Lighthizer says that after multiple meetings this year, "China did not respond constructively and failed to take any substantive actions to address U.S. concerns."Instead, Beijing issued a 71-page report denying that it violated any rules and accusing the United States of "trade bullyism."It's somewhat astounding that, although China continues to deny any hacking, its intrusions into U.S. networks continue unabated. But all of this follows Beijing's ongoing aim of "becoming a global leader in a wide range of technologies, especially advanced technologies."Beijing, in fact, remains on course to achieve its "Made in China 2025" plan of global dominance in "aerospace, information and communications technology, robotics, industrial machinery, new materials, and automobiles."Last year, President Xi told attendees at the Communist Party Congress that "the Communist Party of China is a great party; it has the fight and mettle to win."Any deal to relax tariffs at the G20 would further embolden President Xi and ratify his strategy to deny, defend and double down on technology theft -- and China's bid to hamstring America's global leadership.Michael Stumo is CEO of the Coalition for a Prosperous America (CPA), a nonprofit organization working at the intersection of trade, jobs, tax and economic growth (https://www.prosperousamerica.org/).Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6535765 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: December 3, 2018End of Document

Trump: NYTimes Story On His Cellphone Use "Just More Made Up Fake News."The FrontrunnerOctober 26, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: WASHINGTON NEWSLength: 680 wordsBodyPresident Trump tweeted yesterday, "The so-called experts on Trump over at the New York Times wrote a long and boring article on my cellphone usage that is so incorrect I do not have time here to correct it. I only use Government Phones, and have only one seldom used government cell phone. Story is soooo wrong!" Trump later tweeted, "The New York Times has a new Fake Story that now the Russians and Chinese (glad they finally added China) are listening to all of my calls on cellphones. Except that I rarely use a cellphone, & when I do it's government authorized. I like Hard Lines. Just more made up Fake News!" Business Insider reports, "While this is hardly the first time Trump has been critical of The New York Times' reporting about him, eagle-eyed Twitter users quickly noticed something about the tweet itself: It was sent from an iPhone."NBC Nightly News (10/25, story 7, 2:10, Mitchell, 7.65M) asked, "Could foreign spies be listening in? US officials tell NBC News they have been concerned for months that...Trump is discussing sensitive information on his non-secure iPhone with people like Sean Hannity of Fox News," and "now the New York Times reports the Chinese and Russians are routinely eavesdropping" - though "NBC News has not confirmed aspects of the report." The Washington Post (10/25, Wagner, 12.5M) says "the Times report...prompted fresh calls from Democrats to investigate the president's cellphone usage."Politico (10/25, Oprysko, 4.03M) reports Trump "has resisted calls in the past from his advisers to practice better phone security, telling aides that it would be 'too inconvenient,'" and the New York Times (10/25, Rosenberg, 16.73M) that "officials said the president has two official iPhones that have been altered by the National Security Agency to limit their abilities - and vulnerabilities - and a third personal phone that is no different from hundreds of millions of iPhones in use around the world." The Times adds "aides and people who know Mr. Trump said that it was only late last year that he finally began to regularly use his government-issued cellphone instead of his personal cellphone," but "Trump kept his personal phone because he did not have any numbers stored on the government phone, they said."Chinese Official Calls Story "Fake News," Quips That Trump Should Use Huawei Phone.The New York Times (10/25, Myers, 16.73M) reports "China on Thursday ridiculed but did not exactly deny an article in The New York Times detailing how Chinese intelligence agents eavesdropped on cellphone conversations...Trump had with friends in hopes of gaining insights into the administration's policies." The Times adds "a spokeswoman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Hua Chunying, suggested that 'some people in the United States' were competing for 'the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay,' and even used a familiar Trump trope, warning the newspaper that it risked being called 'fake news.'" Hu "even offered a plug for a Chinese competitor of the iPhones that Mr. Trump favors - to the apparent dismay of his security advisers," saying, "If they are very worried about iPhones being tapped, they can use Huawei."Scaramucci: Trump An "Intentional Liar" Who Uses "Methodology Of Mistruth."The Washington Post (10/25, Wagner, 12.5M) reports former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci, who "made headlines" Wednesday when he called President Trump "a liar" during a CNN interview, "sought to backpedal" on Thursday. Appearing on Fox News, Scaramucci said of his remarks on CNN, "They asked me if the President tells mistruths or lies. I said he does intentionally lie to create a dog whistle and create some atmospherics ... So they go and put a little tagline, 'Scaramucci calls President a liar.' That's not what I was doing." He added, "I didn't really say the President was a liar. I said the President is using a methodology of mistruth to create that level of tension and anxiety. He's like pushing the mainstream media and the left, and he's trying to galvanize his base, and it's a media device."Load-Date: October 26, 2018End of Document

Brookfield Interactive (HK)'s successful history of executing its digital technology strategy in China via long term trusted and proven relationships with Chinese provincial lottery centers, government regulated departments and major Chinese portals, provides a well-established starting point for GFH, which will be strengthened by the execution capabilities of the merged companies. MICT, a Nasdaq listed company, through its majority owned subsidiary Micronet Ltd., currently provides rugged mobile devices for the growing commercial Mobile Resource Management (MRM) market. MICT develops, manufactures and provides mobile computing platforms for the mobile logistics management market in the U.S., Europe and Israel. American manufactured systems are designed for outdoor and challenging work environments in trucking, distribution, logistics, public safety and construction. As noted below, MICT's interest in Micronet Ltd. is contemplated to be spun off in connection with the transactions contemplated by the acquisition agreement.We believe combining these entities will create a company with a strong business-to-business (B2B) technology platform and operational expertise that will enable GFH to present a leading global multifaceted platform for trading in digital assets. The combination of these entities is expected to allow GFH to capitalize on ParagonEx's technology and Brookfield Interactive (HK)'s market relationships and technology, via a public market vehicle with access to the capital markets, to become a leading technology provider for the lottery, sports content and other gaming verticals with a strong position in the Asian markets. The strengths and competencies of GFH are expected to include:a premier trading platform in digital assets, offered as a Platform as a Service ("PaaS"), that is product agnostic and can be scaled into many different verticals; access to the Chinese market through Brookfield Interactive (HK) to monetize the lotto, sports, gaming and other markets using GFH's technology solutions; and potential to capitalize on its access to the financial markets to acquire revenues of smaller players at attractive and accretive acquisition multiples to address industry consolidation driven by regulatory changes.Key Terms of the TransactionGFH successfully raised $23.5 million at $1.65 per share to fund the transaction (the "Financing"). BNN Technology PLC, a 15% stockholder in MICT and majority stockholder of Brookfield Interactive (HK), will commence a tender offer to purchase up to 20% of the issued and outstanding shares of MICT's common stock, not already owned by it within 15 business days at a price of $1.65 per share, in order to increase its ownership percentage of MICT to a maximum of 35% (assuming full participation in the tender offer). MICT and GFH will complete a merger whereby MICT will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of GFH. Brookfield Interactive (HK) shareholders will transfer to GFH all of the issued and outstanding shares of Brookfield Interactive (HK), resulting in Brookfield Interactive (HK) becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of GFH. ParagonEx's shareholders will transfer all of the issued and outstanding shares of ParagonEx to GFH, resulting in ParagonEx becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of GFH. At or within sixty (60) days of the applicable record date, GFH will spin off MICT's interest in Micronet Ltd., a partially owned subsidiary traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange under the ticker MCRNL, to its shareholders who retain shares of MICT after the tender offer.In connection with the Acquisitions, at Closing, the parties will receive the following approximate consideration:Investors in the GFH Financing (assuming a $25 million raise) - 15,151,515 ordinary shares of GFH, representing approximately 8.83% of GFH MICT Shareholders (other than BNN's current ownership, and assuming that no shares of MICT are sold in the tender offer) - 9,048,077 ordinary shares of GFH, representing approximately, 5.27% of GFH Brookfield Interactive (HK) Shareholders - 58,898,810 ordinary shares of GFH, representing approximately 34.37% of GFH ParagonEx Shareholders - (a) $25 million in cash, (b) a senior unsecured note in the principal amount of $10 million and (c) 86,382,373 ordinary shares of GFH, representing approximately 50.36% of GFH ParagonEx Founders - 2,000,000 ordinary shares of GFH, representing approximately, 1.17% of GFHAll of the shares to be issued by GFH are valued at $1.65 per share, representing a GFH equity valuation of approximately $283 million.The Business of GFHThe merger is intended to create a strong B2B technology platform with operational expertise that will enable GFH to present a leading global multifaceted platform for trading in digital assets. ParagonEx's and Brookfield Interactive (HK)'s assets and technology are highly complementary and are expected to enable GFH to monetize BNN's opportunities within China as well as expedite the growth plan of ParagonEx globally. GFH believes future growth can be driven by the combination and penetration of existing products and platforms into new and emerging markets while capitalizing on revenue acquisition opportunities in a consolidating market.GFH's enhanced access to the financial markets, supported by a NASDAQ listing, is anticipated to facilitate the acquisition, at attractive and accretive acquisition multiples, of revenues streams of smaller companies dependent on third party software providers, as regulatory changes drive industry consolidation. These potential acquisitions offer significant opportunities for operational cost savings as a result of ParagonEx's highly scalable and robust PaaS capability.ParagonEx and Brookfield Interactive (HK) are already developing new "play for fun" products to create new revenue streams for GFH. These online games are expected to appeal to a different, yet larger, segment of end users who are not financial traders, but who wish to enjoy playing online financial trading games.GFH intends to establish its base of operations in Hong Kong and believes that this will enable a rapid rollout of its operations to service the South East Asia market. GFH intends to obtain all licenses necessary to conduct the business and support the operation of the group from Hong Kong.Commenting on the proposed transaction, Darren Mercer, Chief Executive Officer of Brookfield Interactive (HK), said: "We are extremely excited to have agreed on a combination of these highly complementary companies. Together they provide an underlying business that can be very profitable, boasting a world class technology platform with big data analytical capability, a management team with decades of experience building highly profitable technology companies and an opportunity to monetize a number of significant commercial relationships in Asia. The blend of these companies enables the combined entity to benefit from the specialisms in which each element excels and allows us to view the future with considerable confidence. I am particularly pleased to see this echoed by the support of investors in the Financing which has raised $23.5 million."David Lucatz, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of MICT, added:"This transaction marks a significant milestone in the evolution of MICT. The merged company will develop a much more substantial and diverse revenue stream than has been possible during our solid progress over the last 10 years. It is a game changer for us, providing the opportunity to generate significant value for our shareholders, who will be encouraged by the support for the financing at $1.65 per share.  Looking ahead, this compelling merger of our three companies positions GFH well to leverage its proprietary technology, capital raising ability and Asian experience in addressing a number of fast-growing business segments."Simon Duggan, CEO of ParagonEx, said:"We are delighted to take part in an exciting combination that accelerates our expansion. For more than 10 years our team has delivered linear year-on-year profits growth. This performance has been supported by strong technology in which more than $45 million has been re-invested to date. This transaction will support our new revenue acquisition program, and the deployment  of our platform in new directions, commencing with the execution of key BNN commercial relationships in China. I strongly believe that combining with MICT's capital markets experience in the US and BNN's access to Chinese consumer and business markets is an exciting opportunity to fast-track further adoption of ParagonEx's technology in the global market."Transaction AdvisorsMaxim Group LLC acted as sole financial advisor to Brookfield Interactive (HK ) and BNN Technology PLC in connection with the proposed Merger.Herzog Fox & Neeman are acting as legal counsel to ParagonEx Ltd in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.CoView Capital, a Manhattan-based investment bank focused on mergers and acquisitions, rendered the Fairness Opinion to the Board of MICT.  Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky, and Popeo, P.C. and Naschitz, Brandes, Amir & Co. are acting as legal counsel to MICT in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Official filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission relating to this transaction may be found athttp://www.sec.govFor further information, please contact:Brookfield Interactive (HK) info@bnntechnology.com +44(0) 1565 872 990MICT, Inc.info@mict-inc.com+1 (201) 225-0190Additional Information and Where to Find ItIn connection with the proposed transactions described herein, MICT, Global Fintech Holdings, ParagonEx and Brookfield Interactive (HK) will prepare a proxy statement/prospectus for MICT's stockholders and a registration statement on Form F-4 to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  MICT's proxy statement/prospectus will be mailed to MICT's stockholders that do not opt to receive the document electronically.

SCHWARZMAN CLASS OF 2020 INCLUDES FOUR STANFORD STUDENTSStates News ServiceDecember 3, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 929 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: STANFORD, Calif. BodyThe following information was released by Stanford University:by Kathleen Sullivan Four Stanford students have won 2020 Schwarzman Scholarships for graduate study at Tsinghua University in Beijing, one of China's most prestigious universities.They are among the 147 scholars from 38 countries who were named 2020 Schwarzman Scholars. The scholars will begin master's degree programs in August 2019.The scholarship program was designed to prepare future global leaders to meet the geopolitical challenges of the 21st century. The vision of Schwarzman Scholars is to bring together young scholars to explore and understand the economic, political and cultural factors that have contributed to China's increasing importance as a global power, and to make them more effective as links between China and the rest of the world.Each Schwarzman Scholar earns a one-year master's degree in global affairs with a concentration in one of three disciplines: public policy, economics and business, or international studies.Philip ClarkThe 2020 Schwarzman Scholars from Stanford are:PHILIP CLARK, 21, of New York City, is a senior majoring in management science and engineering. Clark is an honors student in international security studies and is writing an honors thesis examining the national security implications of foreign investment in American technology companies.He is also minoring in computer science and economics. As a Schwarzman Scholar, Clark hopes to explore how innovation will reshape international relations.Clark, who visited China as a student member of the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations the summer before his first year at Stanford, said the trip inspired him to embark on a course of study at the nexus of macroeconomics, geopolitics and technology policy.His Stanford studies included coursework in Chinese diplomatic history and modern British politics at the University of Oxford in England, through the Bing Overseas Studies Program. He is a research assistant at the Stanford Center for International Security and Cooperation and has served as a teaching assistant for the Department of Economics. He was editor-in-chief of The Stanford Review, a student political magazine, from 2016 to 2017.Neil JainNEIL JAIN, 21, of Medina, Washington, is a senior majoring in science, technology and society. As a Schwarzman Scholar, Jain plans to study business and economics with the goal of better understanding the Chinese entrepreneurial ecosystem.During his first year at Stanford, Jain became a fellow of the Kairos Society, a global community of students who are passionate about using entrepreneurship to solve the world's biggest problems. As the U.S. director of the society, a position Jain has held since his sophomore year, he launched 17 new regional chapters that added 350 new Fellows to the society. He now manages regional chapters at 40 sites across the country.Kiran SridharKIRAN SRIDHAR, 21, of Woodside, California, a senior and an honors student in economics, is currently writing his honors thesis, "Hacking for Good: Leveraging Hacker One Data to Develop an Economic Model of Bug Bounties." As a Schwarzman Scholar, Sridhar hopes to use the curriculum, as well as exposure to Chinese technology companies and government officials, to better understand the country's perspective on cybersecurity.At Stanford, Sridhar was a student member of the Committee on Globalization of the Stanford Board of Trustees from September 2017 to June 2018. He served as a course designer and teaching assistant for the 2016 online course, "Living at the Nuclear Brink: Yesterday and Today," taught by former U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry, the Michael and Barbara Berberian Professor, Emeritus.Sridhar is the founder and executive director of Waste No Food, which enables farms, restaurants, cafeterias and grocery stores to post excess food on their websites, where it can be secured by local aid groups that pick up the food and deliver it to hungry people.Christopher YehCHRISTOPHER YEH, 22, of Cypress, California, is a co-terminal student earning bachelor's and master's degrees in computer science. As a Schwarzman Scholar, Yeh plans to study environmental economics and learn how to work with government and industry leaders to leverage artificial intelligence for solving sustainability challenges.At Stanford, Yeh is a research assistant in the Sustainability and Artificial Intelligence Lab, where he developed improved computer vision algorithms to create high-resolution "heat maps" of poverty in sub-Saharan Africa by merging daytime and nighttime satellite imagery. He is a co-author of a paper, "Poverty Prediction with Public Landsat 7 Satellite Imagery and Machine Learning," which was presented at the 2017 Workshop on Neural Information Processing Systems. He said his Sophomore College course in Southeast Alaska inspired him to pursue research in sustainability.Yeh has been a member serving as a team leader and as president of Stanford Code the Change, a student group that partners with nonprofits to work on year-long software projects for social good. He played cello with the Stanford Symphony Orchestra from 2016-17, including a summer performance tour of Mexico and Cuba.International scholarshipsStanford students interested in overseas scholarships and Stanford faculty interested in nominating students for such awards should contact Diane Murk, manager of the Overseas Resource Center, at dmurk@stanford.edu, or John Pearson, director emeritus of the Bechtel International Center, at john.pearson@stanford.eduLoad-Date: December 4, 2018End of Document
