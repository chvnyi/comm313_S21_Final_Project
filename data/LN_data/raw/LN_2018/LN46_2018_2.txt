China's president offers US possible trade concessionsAssociated Press Financial WireApril 10, 2018 Tuesday 9:28 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 1130 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD and GILLIAN WONG, Associated PressDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - President Xi Jinping promised Tuesday to cut China's auto tariffs and improve intellectual property protection in possible concessions aimed at defusing a worsening dispute with Washington over trade and technology that investors worry could set back the global economic recovery.Speaking at a business conference, Xi made no direct mention of his American counterpart, Donald Trump, or the dispute. He promised progress on areas that are U.S. priorities including opening China's banking industry and boosting imports but didn't address key irritants for Washington such as a requirement for foreign companies to work through joint ventures that require them to give technology to potential local competitors.Private sector analysts saw Xi's speech as an overture to help end the biggest trade dispute since World War II. It has fueled fears the global economic recovery might be set back if other governments are prompted to raise their own import barriers.Xi tried to position China as a defender of free trade and cooperation, despite its status as the most-closed major economy, in response to Trump's "America first" calls for import restrictions and trade deals that are more favorable to the United States."China's door of opening up will not be closed and will only open wider," said Xi at the Boao Forum for Asia on the southern island of Hainan.Xi said Beijing will "significantly lower" tariffs on auto imports this year and ease restrictions on foreign ownership in the auto industry "as soon as possible."Trump has threatened to raise tariffs on Chinese goods worth $50 billion in response to complaints Beijing pressures foreign companies to hand over technology in violation of its World Trade Organization market-opening commitments. Beijing fired back with its own $50 billion list of U.S. goods for possible retaliation.The Chinese leader promised to encourage "normal technological exchange" and to "protect the lawful ownership rights of foreign enterprises.""President Xi's speech could create a very good platform to launch U.S.-China dialogue at the WTO to find a deal on intellectual property rights," said economist Rajiv Biswas of IHS Markit in a report. "This would be a victory for the world trading system and an important step away from the abyss of rising global protectionism."The dispute is likely to end "with a concession from China," said Larry Hu of Macquarie Group in a report.Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, speaking at the Boao event, welcomed Xi's promises on finance, investment, intellectual property and auto imports."We look forward to seeing these strategies elaborated, implemented and bearing fruit," said Lee, according to a transcript issued by his office.Also Tuesday, China filed a WTO challenge against Trump's earlier tariff hike on steel and aluminum in a separate dispute.Beijing, which has issued a $3 billion list of U.S. goods including pork and apples for possible retaliation, requested 60 days of consultations as a first step. If that fails, the Chinese government can ask for a ruling from a WTO panel of experts.Chinese officials deny foreign companies are compelled to hand over technology, but business groups say joint venture and licensing rules make that unavoidable. The United States filed a WTO complaint last month accusing Beijing of violating its trade pledges by imposing unfair contract terms and allowing companies to use foreign-owned technology after licensing periods expire.Foreign companies complain Beijing is squeezing them out of promising parts of the state-dominated economy to promote the ruling Communist Party's plans to create Chinese global competitors in fields including robotics, electric cars and pharmaceuticals.Xi gave no details on how those conditions might change, leaving it unclear whether that might mollify Washington.Easing rules that limit global automakers to owning no more than 50 percent of a joint venture with a Chinese partner might help to address Trump's complaints about technology as well as giving them more flexibility in their biggest global market.Jake Parker, the vice president for China of the U.S.-China Business Council, which represents companies that deal with China, welcomed Xi's announcement but expressed hope for additional steps such as ending requirements for joint ventures and technology licensing."Ultimately, U.S. industry will be looking for implementation of long-stalled economic reforms, but actions to date have greatly undermined the optimism of the U.S. business community," Parker said in an email.Xi repeated pledges to open China's finance industries to foreign investors but gave no additional details.Chinese regulators announced that intention in November, just after Trump ended a high-profile visit to Beijing, but gave no timeline or details. Business groups welcomed the commitment but said breaking into China's state-dominated financial industries would be hard for new competitors and Beijing might impose restrictions that would make such an effort unprofitable.The biggest beneficiaries of a cut in China's 25 percent tariff on most auto imports will be the small number of automakers such as electric car brand Tesla that have no factory in China. Other automakers such as General Motors and Volkswagen that assemble vehicles in China with local partners could offer additional models.More broadly, Xi repeated official promises to expand imports and to narrow China's trade surplus, another irritant for Washington. China reported a global trade surplus of $423 billion last year - about two-thirds of that with the United States."China does not seek a trade surplus," said Xi to an audience of Chinese and foreign businesspeople. "We have a genuine desire to increase imports and achieve a greater balance of international payments."The president promised to make faster progress toward joining the WTO's Government Procurement Agreement, which extends the WTO's free-trading principles to purchases by governments. That can make a significant difference in developing countries, where the government often accounts for most sales of computer software, medical equipment and other high-value goods.The bulk of Xi's 40-minute speech was devoted to China's vision for economic development and its global role following a ruling party congress in October that confirmed him as the most dominant Chinese leader since at least the 1980s.Xi sounded a conciliatory note toward neighbors with which Beijing has territorial disputes, saying China wants to pursue peaceful cooperative development."We will not bully our neighbors," the president said."Cold war thinking and zero-sum games are increasingly obsolete," he said. "Arrogance or self-righteousness can only bump into walls at every turn."Load-Date: April 11, 2018End of Document

Hikvision, Dahua and Hytera target of government technology banSecurityInfoWatch.comMay 29, 2018 Tuesday 4:09 PM ESTCopyright 2018 Cygnus Business Media All Rights ReservedLength: 1460 wordsHighlight: U.S. House passes bill to remove Chinese-manufactured cameras from government facilities; now moves to SenateBodyIn a move that seeks to allay cybersecurity concerns surrounding the government's use of technologies manufactured by Chinese companies, the U.S. House of Representatives last week passed a bill that prohibits federal agencies from purchasing video surveillance equipment from several China-based firms, including Hikvision, Dahua and Hytera Communications.In a statement provided to SecurityInfoWatch.com, Jeffrey He, president of Hikvision USA Inc., and Hikvision Canada Inc., said their products "adhere to global cybersecurity standards" and that they would "vigorously defend" the company against "unproven accusations." Dahua also pushed back against the proposed ban on Tuesday, saying in a statement on its website that they are a company with a "high level of business integrity" and that they are committed to complying with "all applicable laws and regulations" of the countries in which they operate.The ban would not only impact branded products from the companies named but also any other manufacturers that use Hikvision, Dahua and Hytera OEM solutions. According to the bill: "By not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, each agency shall develop a plan...(that) shall include, but not be limited to, how the agency plans to deal with the impact of white label technology on its supply chain whereby the original manufacturer of technology is not readily apparent to a purchaser or user."The ban was included as part of an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act proposed by Rep. Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.) that had originally only been limited to the government's use of technologies and services from Chinese telecom giants Huawei and ZTE. Earlier this month, the Pentagon announced that it was banning the sale of Huawei and ZTE phones on U.S. military bases around the globe over security concerns. The heads of the U.S intelligence and law enforcement community had previously warned consumers against the use of devices manufactured by these companies in February."We must face the reality that the Chinese-government is using every avenue at its disposal to target the United States, including expanding the role of Chinese companies in the U.S. domestic communications and public safety sectors," Hartzler said in a statement. "Video surveillance and security equipment sold by Chinese companies exposes the U.S. government to significant vulnerabilities, and my amendment will ensure that China cannot create a video surveillance network within federal agencies."For its part, Hikvision is not ducking away from the issue - both for public and private-sector deployments. "We are actively working to assure our North American stakeholders that Hikvision strictly abides by the laws and regulations of each country in which it operates," He said in the statement. "We also reaffirm the fact that we hold our products to the industry's global cybersecurity standards, including North America."He's statement continues: "As we continue to monitor and further deploy the necessary resources to address this matter over the coming weeks and months, please know that we will vigorously defend Hikvision from dangerous and unproven accusations about the cybersecurity of our products and solutions. We remain fully focused on providing quality service to our valued partners...we invite you to contact your Hikvision sales representative, who would be happy to answer any of your inquiries."Dahua, whose products were recently certified by T\x9CV Rheinland as meeting the T\x9CV Rheinland 2PfG 2624/06.17 standard, which was derived from GDPR, said that it devotes 10 percent of its revenue annually to R&D efforts and that they are positioning the company as a "cybersecurity leader" in the industry. "Dahua takes cybersecurity seriously and has designated it as a top priority," the company's statement reads. "The Company takes a comprehensive and systemic approach to cybersecurity, with complementary and redundant safeguards built into its technology, services and organizational practices."The bill will now move to the Senate for further consideration. As of press time Tuesday, representatives for Hytera could not be reached for comment.Hikvision, Dahua Taking Steps to Reassure StakeholdersThe cybersecurity of Hikvision and Dahua products were also brought up during a hearing held earlier this year by the House Committee on Small Business focused on combating foreign cyber threats with discussion centered on the Small Business Advanced Cybersecurity Enhancements Act of 2017.Before opening the floor for questioning by other House committee members, committee chairman Steve Chabot (R-Ohio) set the tone for the hearing's examination of network vulnerabilities by citing separate incidents attributed to the companies in 2014.Late in 2014, technology researchers detected three major buffer overflow vulnerabilities in Hikvision DVRs; this after finding that those same DVRs contained bitcoin mining malware in April 2014. That same year, researchers found Dahua cameras and DVRs contained backdoors. Both companies were quick to address these issues."As I have mentioned before, many cyber threats towards small businesses come at the hands of bad actors, sometimes foreign governments in an attempt to undermine the country's national security and economy," Chabot said in his Congressional testimony. "Hikvision, one of the top five largest manufacturers of security cameras worldwide, is 42-percent owned by the Chinese government, and in 2017, the Department of Homeland Security learned that many of its cameras were able to be hacked and remotely controlled."Hikvison has since worked with DHS to fix that flaw; and in fact, cybersecurity reassurance of Hikvision products for both public and private sector users and channel partners has been one of the company's primary messages for nearly a year. In addition to its publishing of an extensive "cybersecurity center" on its website that includes advice for best practices, as well as patches, firmware updates and security notices, the company has launched a "cybersecurity hotline" as well as a cybersecurity roadshow for its channel partners and hired cybersecurity expert Chuck Davis as its Director of Cybersecurity. In addition, Hikvision opened a Source Code Transparency Center to provide an opportunity for government agencies in both the United States and Canada to review the source code of a number of IP cameras, NVRs and other products sold by the company.As for Dahua, it has also responded quickly and publicly to cybersecurity concerns regarding its products. The company outlined its cybersecurity initiatives in a release published at the ASIS Conference last year, and responded quickly to fix a critical vulnerability in the firmware of Dahua IP cameras in November. In an interview following the firmware vulnerability's discovery and fix, Janet Fenner, the company's director of business development, issued the following statement to SecurityInfoWatch:"We are taking cybersecurity seriously and putting in significant resources. Dahua is committed to ensuring the cybersecurity of our related products and solutions. We are also getting support from experts in this field. Dahua is taking a proactive approach of consulting with esteemed authoritative partners such as Synopsys Technology and DBAPP Security to learn from the experience of other industries to speed up our maturity. Additionally, we are taking action to improve support to customers in terms of security vulnerability reporting, announcements/notices and cybersecurity knowledge sharing. Customers can reach local Dahua technical support teams and/or the DHCC for support at cybersecurity@dahuatech.com"SecurityInfoWatch could not find any similar cybersecurity-related news, releases or sections on the Hytera website.Industry ImpactJim McHale, director of UK-based research firm Memoori, does not think that sales of Hikvision and Dahua products in the U.S. will be greatly impacted by this bill if it does become law; however, the same cannot be said of manufacturers who white label devices from these companies."In the short term, I don't think it will have too much impact on the direct trade of Hikvision and Dahua cameras in the USA. However this ruling could have a significant impact on indirect sales through OEM products sold by (U.S.-based manufacturers)," McHale said. "These operations are major U.S-owned companies and loss of esteem by dealing with companies banned by the U.S. government could have wider implications for them."About the Author:Joel Griffin is the Editor-in-Chief of SecurityInfoWatch.com and a veteran security journalist.

China tries to defuse trade pressure, says world benefitsAssociated Press Financial WireJune 28, 2018 Thursday 1:48 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 578 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - China's government defended its trade record as a benefit to the world in a new effort Thursday to defuse U.S. and European pressure over market access and technology policy.A Cabinet report repeated promises to cut tariffs and open more industries to investment. But it didn't address complaints about plans to create Chinese global technology competitors that are at the heart of a spiraling trade dispute with U.S. President Donald Trump.China's growth "has brought great opportunities to trading partners all over the world," a deputy commerce minister, Wang Shouwen, said at a news conference.The report highlights the clash between Beijing's insistence it has honored market-opening promises made when it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001 and arguments by Washington, Europe and others that Beijing improperly hampers access to emerging industries and steals or pressures foreign companies to hand over technology.Trump's threat of tariff hikes on up to $450 billion of Chinese products reflects fears Beijing's plans are a threat to American technological leadership and prosperity. China has tried to recruit Europe as an ally in the dispute but faces complaints by Germany and other governments that it bars purchases of Chinese assets while its own companies are on a global acquisition spree.Asked about possible U.S. plans to restrict Chinese investment in technology industries, Wang said, "We hope countries concerned can do the right thing and adopt policies that support free trade and investment."Thursday's report was the latest effort by President Xi Jinping's government to deflect pressure to change development tactics by highlighting the benefits of trade with the world's second-largest economy.The United States and other trading partners say China's emergence as a competitor in smartphones, solar panels and other fields means it no longer qualifies for the protections it was granted as a developing country when it joined the WTO.Beijing has offered to narrow its multibillion-dollar trade surplus with the United States but has resisted pressure to roll back a state-led industry strategy seen by Communist leaders as a path to prosperity and global influence.Thursday's report emphasized changes since China joined the WTO including cuts in import duties and improved protection of foreign patents and copyrights.Foreign business groups say while Beijing has made legal changes promised when it joined the WTO, regulators have thrown up new barriers by imposing licensing and other requirements.The dispute with Trump has allowed China, the most closed major economy, to position itself as a defender of free trade.This week, Beijing and the European Union announced they will form a group to work on modernizing WTO rules to keep pace with developments in the global economy. An EU vice president said Europe wants to focus on technology policy, subsidies and the status of state companies - all issues on which Beijing has disputes with other governments.Chinese officials have tried to appeal to Europe by promising to buy more of its farm goods and saying its companies are welcome to invest.They repeated that message during visits by German Chancellor Angela Merkel in May and French Premier Edouard Philippe this week, though they did not address complains about market and investment barriers.Merkel and other European officials are frustrated by Trump's tactics but say they are not allying with Beijing.Load-Date: June 29, 2018End of Document

China has tried to recruit Europe as an ally in the dispute but faces complaints by Germany and other governments that it bars purchases of Chinese assets while its own companies are on a global acquisition spree.Asked about possible U.S. plans to restrict Chinese investment in technology industries, Wang said, "We hope countries concerned can do the right thing and adopt policies that support free trade and investment."Thursday's report was the latest effort by President Xi Jinping's government to deflect pressure to change development tactics by highlighting the benefits of trade with the world's second-largest economy.The United States and other trading partners say China's emergence as a competitor in smartphones, solar panels and other fields means it no longer qualifies for the protections it was granted as a developing country when it joined the WTO.Beijing has offered to narrow its multibillion-dollar trade surplus with the United States but has resisted pressure to roll back a state-led industry strategy seen by Communist leaders as a path to prosperity and global influence.Thursday's report emphasized changes since China joined the WTO including cuts in import duties and improved protection of foreign patents and copyrights.Foreign business groups say while Beijing has made legal changes promised when it joined the WTO, regulators have thrown up new barriers by imposing licensing and other requirements.The dispute with Trump has allowed China, the most closed major economy, to position itself as a defender of free trade.This week, Beijing and the European Union announced they will form a group to work on modernizing WTO rules to keep pace with developments in the global economy. An EU vice president said Europe wants to focus on technology policy, subsidies and the status of state companies - all issues on which Beijing has disputes with other governments.Chinese officials have tried to appeal to Europe by promising to buy more of its farm goods and saying its companies are welcome to invest.They repeated that message during visits by German Chancellor Angela Merkel in May and French Premier Edouard Philippe this week, though they did not address complains about market and investment barriers.Merkel and other European officials are frustrated by Trump's tactics but say they are not allying with Beijing.Load-Date: June 29, 2018End of Document

The Forum will stimulate a frank conversation about the shifts in the global economy and the risks and opportunities created by a world in transition that is increasingly led by China and India, as well as the rising powers in Africa, the Middle East and Latin America. Hosted byMichael R. Bloomberg, Founder of Bloomberg LP and Bloomberg Philanthropies, and Three-Term Mayor of New York City, in partnership with CCIEE, the Forum will bring together a group of 400 preeminent world and business leaders and experts. Advisory Board members include former U.S. Secretary of State and National Security AdvisorDr. Henry A. Kissinger, who serves as Honorary Chair, along with former U.S. Treasury Secretary and Paulson Institute ChairmanHenry M. Paulson, Jr. andZeng Peiyan,Former Vice Premier of the State Council, PRC, and Chairman of CCIEE, as co-Chairs."The global economy stands at a historic turning point. New economic powers like China, India, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America are increasingly playing a more important role in shaping global affairs," said Michael R. Bloomberg.  "Now more than ever, we need a new convening platform to bring world leaders across the public and private sectors together to assess the risks and opportunities created by the emerging global order. The New Economy Forum will promote collaboration among participants to address the greatest challenges facing the planet, among them climate change, inequality and social disruption created by new technologies."Zeng Peiyan said, "At present, signs of a global economic recovery are becoming increasingly apparent. International trade and investment are emerging from decline, the growth rates of emerging markets and economies are accelerating, and a new round of scientific and technological revolution represented by a new generation of digital information technology is poised to take off. The world economy is entering a new growth cycle. This critical period is just the right time for political and business leaders from around the world to gather at the New Economy Forum, to take part in in-depth exchange, form consensus and propose innovative ideas.""One of the fundamental challenges in the world today is for China and the United States to understand the direction in which the other is going, and to make this compatible with each other's objectives," said Dr. Henry Kissinger. "An understanding between China and the United States can provide a framework of peace and progress, whereas a failure of that relationship will divide the world. That's one of the reasons I'm supporting my good friend Mike Bloomberg in this effort to create a forum to talk to each other in a way that will bring our different interests in harmony with one another.""The world needs to ramp up its transition to a more resilient and sustainable global economy that rises to today's challenges, from trade and climate change to technology and urbanization. Doing so requires the kind of high-level discourse among global leaders that the New Economy Forum will provide. I'm pleased to be a part of this important gathering, which will give China, in particular, the opportunity to highlight its efforts to scale green financing innovations that can serve as models for the rest of the world," said Henry M. Paulson, Jr. The New Economy Forum was established with the support of eleven Founding Partners and their leaders.

The Forum's goal is to produce actionable solutions to important global issues, while incorporating fresh perspectives from the new players in the global economy. Topics for discussion include trade and investment, technology, urbanization, climate change, capital markets and inclusion.Designed as an institution for a new era, the New Economy Forum builds on the success of Bloomberg's inaugural Global Business Forum held last Fall, which convened more than 300 world leaders in New York City on the occasion of the 72nd United Nations General Assembly.Penny Pritzker stated, "The nature of work is changing at a rapid scale. The massive forces of globalization combined with technological advances such as automation and artificial intelligence are impacting all of the world's economies. I am looking forward to joining the New Economy Forum in China, as solutions to challenges of this magnitude only emerge through serious dialogue between public and private leaders committed to shaping a better and more inclusive future.""The future of the new global economy is being rewritten by China, India, and other emerging geographies. It's critical that Mike Bloomberg is picking up this mantle with the New Economy Forum and I'm delighted to be a part of it," said Ian Bremmer, President and Founder, Eurasia Group, and member of the New Economy Forum Steering Committee."3M is a global company with 116 years of experience helping our customers grow and succeed around the world. Today's dynamic worldwide economy is creating both challenges and opportunities - from clean air and water, to safety and sustainability, trade, diversity and inclusion," said Inge G.

China and other Asian markets are the future for our business," said Dangote Industries President and CEO Aliko Dangote. "Chinese companies have collaborated with Dangote Industries on several multi-billion dollar joint ventures across Africa, and we are focused on China for new opportunities and partnerships. The forum in Beijing is a bold initiative that will give us a chance to tell our story, and will allow us to begin new relationships with key stakeholders from China and other emerging countries in the new economy.""This forum will bring business and governments from across the globe together to discuss how we shape and navigate the next global economic era. A critical issue this group will address is how to meet the world's growing energy needs. Affordable energy will be necessary for economies to expand. Providing affordable energy while mitigating the risk of climate change is a dual challenge that will require innovative solutions. ExxonMobil looks forward to the discussion," said Darren W. Woods, chairman and chief executive officer of ExxonMobil."HSBC is delighted to join Mike Bloomberg and the other founding partners at the first New Economy Forum in Beijing," said John Flint, Group Chief Executive of HSBC. "As the world's leading trade bank and the leading international bank in Greater China and Asia, our role has always been to connect customers to opportunities, enable businesses and individuals to thrive and economies to prosper.  Dialogue is required to help resolve the challenges confronting the global economy and business must play its part and join this important conversation.""The current dynamic global economy is challenging and impacts everyone. We are at adecisive point in history and we have the opportunity to create a new, strong economic era and a brighter future for all mankind. I look forward to joining global industry leaders in China, a nation becoming the center of economic reform, to discuss how we ensure sustainable and long lasting future prosperity," said Euisun Chung, Vice Chairman of Hyundai Motor Company."Technology is having a dramatic impact on our daily lives, from how governments govern to how people and businesses interact. Success in this increasingly digital world will require new conversations and connections to ensure the participation of both new and existing players. That's why we've joined with Mike and the other partners - to spark new ways of thinking and acting to ensure the economy of tomorrow is more open and more inclusive. It's through efforts like this that we'll bridge the gap between today's reality and the world's potential and prosperity," said Ajay Banga, President and CEO, Mastercard."The world's economy is being dramatically transformed by digital technology and the cloud. At Microsoft, we believe this represents a tremendous opportunity to benefit society but also comes with a responsibility to ensure technology's benefits reach  people more broadly," said Satya Nadella, CEO, Microsoft. "That's why we're looking forward to participating in the New Economy Forum and exploring with fellow government and business leaders solutions to the most pressing challenges facing this new world."H.E. Yasir Al Rumayyan, Managing Director of the Public Investment Fund, said, "One of the major aims of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund is to play a global role in driving forward the development of future industries, so we are excited to work together with Bloomberg and the other founding partners and leaders from around the world to unlock this potential. We recently hosted around 4,000 of the world's key decision makers in Riyadh, to explore the key future investment themes and drivers and to showcase Saudi Arabia's potential as an economic bridge between three continents. I believe that structure and strategy around this initiative is extremely complementary, and will help to continue to build relationships, share different viewpoints and deliver long-term, necessary change.""I believe that it is only a matter of time before we see the arrival of Singularity, a world where machines surpass human intelligence, and as a result societies and industries that are radically redefined. SoftBank is pleased to support the New Economy Forum as a platform to explore how we can all utilize technology and innovations to address important issues and find new opportunities," said Masayoshi Son, Chairman and CEO of SoftBank Group Corp.Additional details about the Forum, including the agenda and delegates, will be announced at a future date.

The New Economy Forum will promote collaboration among participants to address the greatest challenges facing the planet, among them climate change, inequality and social disruption created by new technologies."Zeng Peiyan said, "At present, signs of a global economic recovery are becoming increasingly apparent. International trade and investment are emerging from decline, the growth rates of emerging markets and economies are accelerating, and a new round of scientific and technological revolution represented by a new generation of digital information technology is poised to take off. The world economy is entering a new growth cycle. This critical period is just the right time for political and business leaders from around the world to gather at the New Economy Forum, to take part in in-depth exchange, form consensus and propose innovative ideas.""One of the fundamental challenges in the world today is for China and the United States to understand the direction in which the other is going, and to make this compatible with each other's objectives," said Dr. Henry Kissinger. "An understanding between China and the United States can provide a framework of peace and progress, whereas a failure of that relationship will divide the world. That's one of the reasons I'm supporting my good friend Mike Bloomberg in this effort to create a forum to talk to each other in a way that will bring our different interests in harmony with one another.""The world needs to ramp up its transition to a more resilient and sustainable global economy that rises to today's challenges, from trade and climate change to technology and urbanization. Doing so requires the kind of high-level discourse among global leaders that the New Economy Forum will provide. I'm pleased to be a part of this important gathering, which will give China, in particular, the opportunity to highlight its efforts to scale green financing innovations that can serve as models for the rest of the world," said Henry M. Paulson, Jr. The New Economy Forum was established with the support of eleven Founding Partners and their leaders. Participating in key conversations at the Forum will be Members of the Founding Partners' leadership, including Chairman of the Board, President and CEO 3M CompanyInge G.

The Forum's goal is to produce actionable solutions to important global issues, while incorporating fresh perspectives from the new players in the global economy. Topics for discussion include trade and investment, technology, urbanization, climate change, capital markets and inclusion.Designed as an institution for a new era, the New Economy Forum builds on the success of Bloomberg's inaugural Global Business Forum held last Fall, which convened more than 300 world leaders in New York City on the occasion of the 72nd United Nations General Assembly.Penny Pritzker stated, "The nature of work is changing at a rapid scale. The massive forces of globalization combined with technological advances such as automation and artificial intelligence are impacting all of the world's economies. I am looking forward to joining the New Economy Forum in China, as solutions to challenges of this magnitude only emerge through serious dialogue between public and private leaders committed to shaping a better and more inclusive future.""The future of the new global economy is being rewritten by China, India, and other emerging geographies. It's critical that Mike Bloomberg is picking up this mantle with the New Economy Forum and I'm delighted to be a part of it," said Ian Bremmer, President and Founder, Eurasia Group, and member of the New Economy Forum Steering Committee."3M is a global company with 116 years of experience helping our customers grow and succeed around the world. Today's dynamic worldwide economy is creating both challenges and opportunities - from clean air and water, to safety and sustainability, trade, diversity and inclusion," said Inge G. Thulin, 3M Company Chairman of the Board, President and CEO.  "Building a stronger and more prosperous economy for all people requires collaboration, and the business community can and must play a leading role. This forum provides a fresh approach and diverse perspectives in a fast-moving business climate.""I am happy to join Mike Bloomberg as a founding partner of the New Economy Forum. China and other Asian markets are the future for our business," said Dangote Industries President and CEO Aliko Dangote. "Chinese companies have collaborated with Dangote Industries on several multi-billion dollar joint ventures across Africa, and we are focused on China for new opportunities and partnerships. The forum in Beijing is a bold initiative that will give us a chance to tell our story, and will allow us to begin new relationships with key stakeholders from China and other emerging countries in the new economy.""This forum will bring business and governments from across the globe together to discuss how we shape and navigate the next global economic era. A critical issue this group will address is how to meet the world's growing energy needs. Affordable energy will be necessary for economies to expand. Providing affordable energy while mitigating the risk of climate change is a dual challenge that will require innovative solutions. ExxonMobil looks forward to the discussion," said Darren W. Woods, chairman and chief executive officer of ExxonMobil."HSBC is delighted to join Mike Bloomberg and the other founding partners at the first New Economy Forum in Beijing," said John Flint, Group Chief Executive of HSBC. "As the world's leading trade bank and the leading international bank in Greater China and Asia, our role has always been to connect customers to opportunities, enable businesses and individuals to thrive and economies to prosper.  Dialogue is required to help resolve the challenges confronting the global economy and business must play its part and join this important conversation.""The current dynamic global economy is challenging and impacts everyone. We are at adecisive point in history and we have the opportunity to create a new, strong economic era and a brighter future for all mankind. I look forward to joining global industry leaders in China, a nation becoming the center of economic reform, to discuss how we ensure sustainable and long lasting future prosperity," said Euisun Chung, Vice Chairman of Hyundai Motor Company."Technology is having a dramatic impact on our daily lives, from how governments govern to how people and businesses interact. Success in this increasingly digital world will require new conversations and connections to ensure the participation of both new and existing players. That's why we've joined with Mike and the other partners - to spark new ways of thinking and acting to ensure the economy of tomorrow is more open and more inclusive. It's through efforts like this that we'll bridge the gap between today's reality and the world's potential and prosperity," said Ajay Banga, President and CEO, Mastercard."The world's economy is being dramatically transformed by digital technology and the cloud. At Microsoft, we believe this represents a tremendous opportunity to benefit society but also comes with a responsibility to ensure technology's benefits reach  people more broadly," said Satya Nadella, CEO, Microsoft. "That's why we're looking forward to participating in the New Economy Forum and exploring with fellow government and business leaders solutions to the most pressing challenges facing this new world."H.E. Yasir Al Rumayyan, Managing Director of the Public Investment Fund, said, "One of the major aims of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund is to play a global role in driving forward the development of future industries, so we are excited to work together with Bloomberg and the other founding partners and leaders from around the world to unlock this potential. We recently hosted around 4,000 of the world's key decision makers in Riyadh, to explore the key future investment themes and drivers and to showcase Saudi Arabia's potential as an economic bridge between three continents. I believe that structure and strategy around this initiative is extremely complementary, and will help to continue to build relationships, share different viewpoints and deliver long-term, necessary change.""I believe that it is only a matter of time before we see the arrival of Singularity, a world where machines surpass human intelligence, and as a result societies and industries that are radically redefined. SoftBank is pleased to support the New Economy Forum as a platform to explore how we can all utilize technology and innovations to address important issues and find new opportunities," said Masayoshi Son, Chairman and CEO of SoftBank Group Corp.Additional details about the Forum, including the agenda and delegates, will be announced at a future date.

China and the US have engaged in a full-fledged trade warCE Noticias Financieras EnglishApril 4, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 550 wordsBody Beijing, April 4 (Notimex) .- The two largest economies in the world have exchanged the imposition of tariff rates in a step that predicts greater concerns on a global scale of a full-fledged trade war between China and the United States.  China announced the imposition of 25 percent tariffs on 106 US products such as soybeans, automobiles and chemicals, in response to measures taken by the United States, according to a decision of the State Council.  The Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council, the Chinese cabinet, decided to impose additional taxes of 25 percent on 106 goods of 14 categories of products, according to a statement released by the Ministry of Finance on its website.  Beijing adopts this measure less than 24 hours after US President Donald Trump announced a list of 1,300 Chinese products to which it plans to impose tariffs, something the Chinese government calls unfair trade practice.  These tariffs will cost 50 billion dollars, equivalent to the tariffs that the Trump administration plans to apply to 1,300 Chinese products.  As reported by Chinese public television on Wednesday, the Ministry of Commerce of the Asian giant will later confirm the date of entry into force of these new tariffs.  The decision was made after the US government announced a proposed list of products to which tariffs would apply an additional 25 percent, which includes Chinese exports of 50 billion dollars.  The list of tariffs to Chinese products presented yesterday by Trump includes medicines, as well as goods from various industries, such as aerospace, robotics, mechanical engineering and information and communication technologies.  The implementation date will depend on when the administration of President Trump readjusts taxes on Chinese products, the ministry said.  The Ministry of Commerce indicated in a statement that the US measure was "a clear violation of the corresponding rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO)."  The note adds that it "seriously violates the legitimate rights and interests of Beijing in accordance with WTO rules and threatens the interests and economic security of China."  However, China's deputy finance minister Zhu Guanyao said at a press conference on Wednesday that the Chinese government does not want a trade war, as it would be detrimental to both the United States and China.  He also stressed that cooperation is the only viable option for both countries.  President Trump signed on March 8 a regulation that imposes tariffs of 25 percent on imports of steel and 10 percent on aluminum, to "protect the national security" of his country.  Later, on March 22, he issued a memorandum on the fight against "the economic aggression of China" that will allow to impose tariffs on imports from that Asian country.  The trade showdown between Washington and Beijing has shaken investors and fueled market fears that the dispute could soon turn into a full-fledged trade war.  When asked if world markets were now officially observing a total trade war, Goldman Sachs' top global equity strategist, Peter Oppenheimer, told the financial channel CNBC News: "I think it's clearly a commercial battle at least."  "I think the anxiety that the market is reflecting is that it could escalate to a generalized (commercial) war," he added. Load-Date: April 4, 2018End of Document

What Did You Do in the Trade War, Daddy?Atlantic OnlineApril 10, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1936 wordsByline: James FallowsBodyWhile Donald Trump has diverted his attention to other matters, here are some questions and answers to bear in mind, when he is back to talking about winning a trade war.Q. Is there a "China problem" to be dealt with?A. Yes. This was the theme of a piece I did just before the 2016 election: "China's Great Leap Backward." Its argument was that through the decades since the beginning of China's post-Mao reform movement, in the late 1970s under Deng Xiaoping, two assumptions had guided U.S. policy toward China-but that China's recent behavior was calling both of them into question. One assumption was that, over time, China would not necessarily become more "Americanized"  or even "democratic"-neither of which anyone who'd ever lived in China could reasonably think. Instead the assumption was that China would become steadily less of an outlier to the international system, more aligned with international standards in realms ranging from financial and banking standards to environmental protection. Its people would become steadily more exposed to educational systems, pop culture, tourism, everyday liberties in the rest of the world.As China prospered, it would not necessarily become a liberal democracy-even though all the other rich countries in the world, from Europe to North America to Northeast Asia, happened to function that way. But it would become more rather than less integrated into the world order for which those liberal democracies had set most of the rules. And this would apply in areas from economics to strategic and military interactions.The other assumption was that, despite the certainty of economic frictions and the larger dislocations that came with China's emergence as a great power, the businesses relationship between the U.S. and China could be more complementary, and win-win, than it was an inevitable Darwinian fight to the death. And this, in turn, was because the structures of the U.S. and Chinese economies were so different, offering the potential for at least as many constructive relationships as mutually destructive ones.The contrast with Japan was instructive. Japan had already become a world industrial power by the 1930s. Its rebuilding effort after World War II was, like Germany's, mainly a matter of re-establishing a world-class business, technological, and educational establishment that had helped power the fascist war effort, was destroyed, and then was redirected into non-military competition.By the 1980s, Japan had large, technically sophisticated companies with their own research centers and internationally recognized brands. They competed head-to-head with their U.S. counterparts: Toyota versus GM, Toshiba versus IBM, Hitachi versus Intel and Texas Instruments, and on down a long list. In the years since then, despite its political and demographic challenges and supposed economic collapse, Japan has grown steadily richer-its GDP per capitais up 35 percent in the past 20 years, versus about 25 percent for the United States- and it has retained or increased its market share in most of the advanced-technology areas its policy focuses on. Japan's population was less than half as large as that of the United States (and a tenth as large as China's), and it was nothing like an all-fronts rival or competitor. But for its biggest firms and their American counterparts, it was a genuine head-to-head, win-or-lose type of showdown in those days.China had never gone through the industrial and corporate revolution that Japan pulled off in the late 1800s. As it began its interaction with the United States 40 years ago, it was a mainly peasant country striving to get into the age of low-end, low-wage manufacturing. Over the next two decades, that is mainly what it did. (This is a story that I told in my book China Airborne.)China is vastly richer now than it was a generation ago. Its population now includes hundreds of millions of industrial and service-sector workers, instead of nearly a billion peasants, as it did before. But it still is far short of Japan and South Korea, Western Europe, or North America in "commanding heights" corporations with international brand-name power and technology leadership. The gap is closing-but still there is no Chinese brand name on the world market comparable to Mercedes or Apple, to Samsung or GE, to Oxford or Harvard, to BBC or the New York Times. The Chinese aerospace ministry is trying its best, but it is many years behind either Airbus or Boeing.Exactly how, when, and whether China closes that gap, and what rules it works by in trying to do so, is (or should be) the heart of the trade friction now. Over the past half dozen years, complaints from Western companies and governments have mounted about the tools the Chinese government is using toward this end: selective regulations, "buy Chinese" policies, industrial espionage carried out either through high-tech hacking means or through contracts that obliged Western companies to "share" technology if they want to enter the Chinese market. This has coincided with Xi Jinping's tightening grip on China's political system and parts of civic life in the country.Are these real problems? Yes. Which leads us to ...Q. Are tariffs a good way to deal with this?A. No. Or at least not in the way they're being discussed right now.Q. Why not? Aren't you just being anti-Trump?A. Here's the problem. What the U.S. is doing now won't work.A rhetorically escalating threat-and-counter-threat between the U.S. and China may be emotionally satisfying to those who believe, as Trump has said constantly over the decades, that China is "cheating" and "robbing" the United States.But if the goal is to get the Chinese government to change its behavior, there is very little reason to think that public threats, lectures, and showdowns will do the trick.You could go through lots of game-theory reasoning to get to this point-for instance, that while the Chinese economy is in principle more exposed to the pain of a trade war than the U.S. is (because China is poorer, and more dependent on exports), in reality its government faces no mid-term elections, or presidential re-election runs, or public elections at all. Also, it can more easily offset an economic downtown in the short run just by ramping up the infrastructure machine- building another new high-speed rail line someplace in China, building ports and railways through the rest of the world via its "One Belt One Road" program, or in other ways turning on the job spigot for long enough to last out a trade showdown.And, as Paul Krugman has spelled out            in The New York Times, even though manufacturers would adjust in the long run to a shift in international prices (from tariffs and other factors), right at the moment, factories to produce much of what's made in China don't exist in the United States. Companies could decide to build them-but that's a matter of years of planning and construction, and billions of dollars, reliant on the idea that Trump-era tariffs would last.I have no idea whether the strains and contradictions affecting the Chinese system of government will prove unsustainable within the next few years (as Minxin Pei            has argued forcefully) or whether it will veer and manage its way through the next set of crises as it has so many before. But when it comes to withstanding short-term domestic pressures of a trade slowdown-a drop in growth rate in China, versus pressures on farmers, aircraft manufacturers, and ordinary shoppers in America-I'll bet on the Chinese any time.Also, if yelling at and threatening a Chinese government were a shrewd way of changing its behavior, presumably it would have worked at some previous time in history. I'm not aware of such examples.Q. So what does work?A. Ah, you would ask.There's a reason certain problems are considered "hard" problems. Holding down health-care costs. Reducing gun violence, in a country that already has hundreds of millions of firearms and where people have radically different views about gun "rights." Reducing the influence of misleading information and phony news.Establishing the right long-term relationship with China is a genuinely hard problem. That was the point of the article I wrote late in 2016: Whoever led the U.S. government, with whatever set of policies on other issues, would have to deal with a China that was too big to ignore, too strong to insult, too valuable a potential partner (on issues ranging from climate change to North Korea) and too threatening a potential adversary to approach with anything other than a well thought-out plan.The core of such a plan, I said, was trying to shape reality in ways that encouraged and discouraged various forms of Chinese behavior. The much-loathed Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, was one of those possible shaping tools. The TPP was the rare policy that Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, and Bernie Sanders all opposed, but its idea was to ally the United States with enough other Pacific Rim trading nations to create a rule-based economic reality too great and influential for China to ignore. Long-term industrial strategies, like the one the Clinton administration applied (successfully) in the early 1990s to revive the U.S. info-tech industry relative to Japan, also can have effect-and can include precisely thought-through tariffs as part of their power. Different times and different details require ever-shifting strategies, but they have nothing in common with tweeted-out demands and threats.It's been 18 months since I wrote this passage, but I'd say more or less the same thing now:Lectures and public scolding of China have no record of ever changing its government's behavior; if anything, they make it worse.What may work, however, is a strategy one former Western-country ambassador to China described as "shaping reality in a way that makes it unattractive for China to maintain its present course." The clearest recent example involves the Chinese military's hacking of U.S. corporate secrets.A year ago [in 2015], when Xi Jinping visited Washington (just after Pope Francis, who drew more press and crowds), President Obama is widely believed to have informed him that the United States had had enough on this front. Government-on-government spying and hacking? Sure, that's normal. But governmental spying on foreign companies, to help their domestic rivals, was different.And if it didn't stop, the U. S. government would find ways to make life more difficult for Chinese companies. Through use of America's own formidable tools for cybermeddling? Through impediments to investments? Through shifts in visa policies for influential Chinese families and officials? Obama could leave the means to Xi's imagination. It wasn't specific, it wasn't directly threatening, and it wasn't public, but Obama's talk was apparently effective. By most accounts, Chinese military hacking of U.S. corporations has decreased.The hacking decreased then. (Last fall Wired ran            a fascinating account of what changed, and what didn't.) Public shouting and desk-pounding played absolutely no role in a quiet, coordinated, decisive plan to shape the reality within which the Chinese government made its choices.If Chinese writers were putting this principle into a traditional chengyu, the four-character phrases that are popular vehicles for homilies and wisdom, they'd presumably work with the four characters meaning voice small, force great. Or, in turn-of-the-20th century American parlance, "speak softly, and carry a big stick."The tariff policy so far has been voice big, power small.  Yell loudly, armed with a twig.Load-Date: April 11, 2018End of Document

IN CHINA, ANGELA MERKEL MEETS WIFE OF DETAINED HUMAN RIGHTS LAWYERStates News ServiceMay 25, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 722 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:German chancellor Angela Merkel has met with the wife of a Chinese rights lawyer detained incommunicado for several months, during her trip to China.Merkel met with Xu Yan, wife of rights attorney Yu Wensheng, who was initially placed under criminal detention on Jan. 19, on suspicion of "obstructing public servants in the course of their duties," Xu and rights activists said via social media."The two sides exchanged views on the #HumanRights situation in China," Amnesty International research William Nee translated one tweet as saying.After his detention, Yu was transferred from Beijing to Jiangsu's Xuzhou city with the addition of the more serious charge of "incitement to subvert state power," and has been held since with no access to a defense lawyer, or family visits.Yu has been identified by London based rights group Amnesty International as being "at risk of torture" while he remains in incommunicado detention.Repeated calls to Xu's phone rang unanswered on Friday .Beijing-based rights activist Ni Yulan, a friend and supporter of Xu's, said she may be keeping a low profile while Merkel, who is leading a large business delegation on this visit, remains in the country."Xu Yan posted this photograph online, but then she didn't give any other details, such as the time of the meeting, or under what circumstances," Ni told RFA."I think it's a very positive development that Merkel is visiting China right now, because she and other German officials are very concerned about the human rights situation in China," she said. "They always meet with human rights workers and lawyers when they come to China, to try to understand the situation better."Fellow rights attorney Tan Yongpei was less sure, however."There is no likelihood that the Chinese government will accede to Merkel's demands, so it's possible that this is going to be counterproductive, especially in the case of Yu Wensheng," Tan told RFA."There is no way that the Chinese government is going to let lawyers speak the truth; you will be safe only if you keep your head down," he said.Concerns about Liu XiaWhen Merkel met with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Thursday , she also raised concerns about Liu Xia, widow of late Nobel peace laureate and political prisoner Liu Xiaobo.Although she has never been accused of any crime, Liu Xia has been held under house arrest or close surveillance since her husband's award was announced in October 2010 , and suffers from severe depression.She has repeatedly requested permission to leave China to seek medical treatment, but the authorities appear to be reluctant to allow this to happen.In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Lu Wei said Liu Xia's case isn't a diplomatic matter."She is a Chinese citizen and the relevant authorities of the Chinese government will protect her legal rights according to our own laws and properly handle the relevant matters," Lu told a regular news briefing.The meeting with Merkel comes after Xu received notification from authorities in Xuzhou that they wouldn't make any changes to her husband's status following repeated bail applications from his family and supporters."On May 22 , I recevied notification of no changes to coercive measures," Xu told RFA earlier this week. "The defense lawyer was expecting this, but it's still very disappointing from the point of view of his family members.""This means he will not be allowed to go home," she said.China's embattled legal profession has been targeted with more than 300 detentions, summons, travel bans, and restrictions imposed on rights lawyers, activists and law firm staff since July 2015 .Rights lawyers who accept politically "sensitive" cases, or who are publicly outspoken on behalf of vulnerable groups, have also been prevented from practicing law because their business licenses are being revoked during a newly instituted annual review process.Lawyers who try to defend clients held on suspicion of crimes ostensibly linked to "state security" concerns are also denied permission to meet with their clients, or are replaced by government appointed lawyers amid threats and pressure on the people who hired them.Reported by Wen Yuqing for RFA's Cantonese Service, and by Gao Feng for the Mandarin Service.

China Papermaking Market 2018-2022PR NewswireMay 11, 2018 Friday 5:45 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1268 wordsDateline: DUBLIN, May 11, 2018 BodyThe"Research Report on Papermaking Industry of China, 2018-2022"report has been added toResearchAndMarkets.com'soffering.The report predicates that, with the development of Chinese economy and the rising living standards, the demand for household paper is growing. The development of e-commerce has promoted the increase in the express delivery, further driving the demand for packaging paper. It is expected that from 2018 to 2022, the overall demand for paper products in the Chinese market will maintain an annual growth rate of 3% or more, and the papermaking industry, to a certain degree, can bring about some investment opportunities.Currently, the export volume of paper and paperboard only accounts for less than 5% of the total output. In order to protect environment as well as satisfy domestic demands, the Chinese government does not encourage the export of paper and paperboard. Therefore, governments at all levels rarely publish supportive policies for the papermaking industry.Chinese papermaking enterprises lack their own forestry property and mainly import raw materials for papermaking. The short supply of raw materials greatly affects the development of the papermaking industry as it rapidly grows. Also, the government policies and other extrinsic factors impact the import of raw materials.In terms of the approval of quotas for waste paper imports, many batches of small amount are adopted. Large enterprises like Panlong Paper, Liwen Paper, and Shanying Paper gain greater advantages to secure the quotas. In 2017, the top 5 papermaking enterprises obtained 62.6% of the quota. In 2018, the quota of large enterprises is expected to increase. Due to the decrease in imported waste paper, the price in the Chinese market will be lifted, which consequently drives up the cost of papermaking.The report also indicates that Chinese papermaking enterprises are in great quantities in low market concentration. By the end of 2017, there were about 2,700 enterprises making papers and paper products with more than CNY 20 million in annual sales. The average annual capacity of those enterprises was less than 50,000 tons, far lagging behind the international level. In 2017, the number of enterprises which made paper of more than 1 million tons was less than 30.Selling points:Policy environment of the papermaking in ChinaSupply and demand in papermaking

China, Vietnam Use Tourism to Spar over Maritime SovereigntyASEAN TribuneMay 21, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 ASEAN Tribune All Rights ReservedLength: 801 wordsBody 21 May 2018 (VOA) A series of incidents involving Chinese tourists in Vietnam is keeping a deep maritime sovereignty dispute in focus despite official efforts to improve relations.Last week 14 Chinese tourists wearing the same red-on-white T-shirts bearing a map of their county's claim passed through immigration in the central Vietnamese province of Khanh Hoa.Immigration agents confiscated the shirts as Vietnamese voiced outrage online toward the tourists. The backs of the shirts showed the nine-dash line that demarcates Beijing's claim to the contested South China Sea, lopping off waters that Vietnam says are its own.This incident is at least the fourth involving Chinese tourists over the past two years. These flaps mean China is using its soft power to remind Vietnam of the dispute and that Vietnam remains as angry now as ever, experts say.'If we look at the broader picture, we can see that the Chinese government might increasingly use civilians as a way to spread their sovereignty claims in the South China Sea, from militia fishermen to uber-nationalist southbound tourists,' said Trung Nguyen, international relations dean at Ho Chi Minh University of Social Sciences and Humanities.String of incidentsChina and Vietnam, already distrustful after a border war in the 1970s, dispute tracts of the 3.5 million-square-kilometer South China Sea that's rich in fisheries, oil and gas. China commands the more powerful armed forces and has militarized islets in the contested tracts of sea.In 2016, the tourist city of Da Nang suspended the business license of a travel agency because it offered travel services to Chinese visitors who burned Vietnamese currency, the VnExpress International news website said.Also that year, China asked Vietnam to investigate whether immigration agents had penned profanity into the passport of a Chinese visitor to Ho Chi Minh City.Chinese tour guides have also entered Vietnam to spread anti-Vietnamese information about history to tour groups, the news website said in 2016. The Immigration Administration vowed then to deport any it finds.Communist parties in Vietnam and China encourage a sense of patriotism that provokes angry responses when offended, raising the odds of these incidents and strong follow-up reactions, scholars say.'Because people in these various countries, they have been educated according to their various nationalist traditions, thereby of course they would think that those disputed territories unquestionably belong to them and therefore all others are sort of occupiers and should be gotten rid of as soon as possible,' said Oh Ei Sun, international studies instructor at Singapore Nanyang University.Propaganda battlegroundChina has historically encouraged citizens to promote official foreign policy when overseas and particularly 'correct world mis-impressions' of China, said Alan Chong, associate professor at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.'All kinds of private activities coming out of China are seen as propaganda,' Chong said. 'It's all in their history.'Vietnam took the T-shirt incident in this spirit. The chairman of the Government Office in Vietnam called it 'an organized act, prepared and arranged with bad intentions instead of a random, spontaneous act by the individual tourists,' VnExpress International said.Chinese tourists to Vietnam numbered about 4 million last year, up 49 percent over 2016, China's Xinhua News Agency said.Calm at the official levelOfficials from the two neighboring countries are trying to get along even as tourists bring out the unresolved maritime dispute.China and Vietnam have held defense talks, exchanged state visits and met at the party-to-party level regularly since 2014. That year the two sides rammed each other's boats as China allowed an oil firm to position a rig in a disputed tract of the sea. Common Vietnamese rioted then against China.Deadly naval clashes erupted between the two sides in 1974 and 1988 over maritime claims.Officials in Beijing see Vietnam as a key economic link to Southeast Asia, said Adam McCarty, chief economist with Mekong Economics in Hanoi. The link would be part of China's five-year-old, 65-country Belt-and-Road initiative aimed at building infrastructure to foster trade routes.Vietnam looks to China as a top trading partner and Chinese tourism supports its service sector.'I think the Vietnamese don't want to antagonize for no purpose the Chinese,' McCarty said. 'There will still be some on both sides who are overtly nationalistic and trying to push issues with these silly T-shirts. I think the Vietnamese government (is) not going to be provoked by that.'The Vietnamese government is trying to 'compartmentalize" the T-shirt issue to avoid undermining two-way relations as a whole, Nguyen said.Load-Date: May 27, 2018End of Document

Trump, China, ZTE and the art of the dealCNN.comMay 14, 2018 Monday 1:23 AM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICSLength: 1246 wordsByline: Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNNBodyFor President Donald Trump, foreign policy is all about the deals that are ripe to be done and the powerful men who make them.So while it seems illogical that someone who won power accusing China of stealing American jobs now wants to save US-sanctioned technology firm ZTE to rescue Chinese jobs, the move is perfectly compatible with his character.ZTE's fate is evolving into a multi-layered drama that encapsulates tense trade posturing between two economic superpowers that are also locked in high-stakes geopolitical maneuvering over the future of a nuclear North Korea.It offers fresh insight into Trump's way of doing business, his willingness to flout the norms of presidential governance and his own impulsive behavior -- all of which proved so attractive to voters soured on establishment politics in 2016.RELATED: Trump throws ZTE curveball as big week for US-China trade beginsTrump has repeatedly stressed the warmth of his friendship with Xi Jinping since he welcomed the Chinese leader to his Mar-a-Lago resort last year and was honored with lavish hospitality during his return visit to Beijing.The President appears to be betting big that the personal connection can pay off despite the widening gulf between China and the US on trade."I think there's a bit of a bromance between President Trump and Xi," said Larry Kudlow, who runs the President's National Economic Council, at an event hosted by Axios on Tuesday, adding that the friendship might even lead to a trade deal."Bromances are always a good idea."But to Trump's critics, the tussle over ZTE offers yet more evidence that he's prone to placing his personal political gain over the national interest, takes profound decisions without regard for the risks and is guilty of hypocrisy.It's also raising questions about whether Trump's hard line on trade is softening ahead of talks with Chinese negotiators in Washington this week."This is quite unprecedented," Michael Hirson, a former US Treasury trade representative to Beijing, told CNN's Richard Quest on Monday, arguing that the President's gambit could mean he is on a different page from his most hawkish advisers on the China trade dispute.The Trump administration last month banned ZTE, which makes smartphones running Google's Android operating system, from using US technology after accusing it of violating a deal in which it agreed to pay $1.2 billion for evading US sanctions on North Korea and Iran.Yet on Sunday, out of nowhere, Trump tweeted that "President Xi of China, and I, are working together to give massive Chinese phone company, ZTE, a way to get back into business, fast. Too many jobs in China lost. Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done!"Trump posted a follow-up tweet on Monday that was just as staggering, possibly influenced by hours of news coverage about motivation in offering to do the deal:"ZTE, the large Chinese phone company, buys a big percentage of individual parts from U.S. companies. This is also reflective of the larger trade deal we are negotiating with China and my personal relationship with President Xi."Why save ZTE?The case for saving ZTE is that doing so could yield significant concessions in return -- and the United States should use every bargaining chip it has to secure a win in the deepening trade confrontation with Beijing.Trump also needs China's cooperation, and continued pressure, on North Korea as he prepares for his summit with the isolated state's leader, Kim Jong Un, in Singapore on June 12.There is also the argument that ZTE is emblematic of the entwined US-China economic relationship, given that thousands of jobs in both countries depend on its survival farther down the high-tech supply chain.But Trump's intervention on ZTE surprised trade experts because it rejected the principle that trade enforcement decisions should not be used and potentially waived for political reasons -- a bridge other presidents have hesitated to cross.Avoiding that linkage spares presidents from requests from every foreign leader they meet to intervene in niggling trade disputes.Politicizing enforcement action also weakens US arguments to foreign governments that the rule of law and good governance are crucial to healthy political systems and regulated interaction between governments.Further, Trump's hint of concessions on ZTE played into critics' concerns that the President cedes leverage before securing substantial concessions in return -- despite his claim to be the world's best deal-maker.Characteristically, the President's order seemed to take his own government by surprise. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who last month accused ZTE of "egregious" violations, was singing a different tune Monday."The question is: Are there additional remedies to the one we had originally put forward?" he said at the National Press Club. "That's the area we will be exploring very, very promptly."Ross also said he wouldn't be surprised if the issue came up in talks with Chinese Vice Premier Lui He in Washington this week.Looming trade warThe Trump administration is locked in a confrontation with China over alleged intellectual property theft, market access and the size of the Chinese trade surplus with the US, which prompted Trump to threaten $150 billion in import duties on Chinese goods.But his critics worry that his positioning on ZTE is a first sign of a broader shift."He is backing off, and his policy is now designed to achieve one goal: Make China great again," said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, of New York. "The toughest thing we could do, the thing that will move China the most, is taking tough action against actors like ZTE."Trump's tweets also exposed him to accusations of inconsistency, since the administration on Sunday warned of possible sanctions against European firms that do business with Tehran after pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal last week."The hypocrisy here is staggering," former State Department spokesman John Kirby told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Monday."He has got his new ambassador to Germany out there last week saying German companies that do business with Iran -- we are going to slam ya -- and now we are going to go ahead and just forget the billion dollars of fines that we assigned to that company for selling that technology to both Iran and North Korea."The ZTE situation could also expose Trump politically ahead of midterm elections in November.CNN's Cristina Alesci reported on Monday that the administration was seeking concessions from the Chinese government in exchange for easing restrictions on ZTE. A deal could see China remove proposed agricultural tariffs, a Commerce Department official familiar with the discussions said.Those tariffs, apparently targeted direct at Trump country in Midwestern states, were threatened in response to the President's vow to tax China's imports to narrow the US trade deficit with Beijing.If agricultural penalties are waived in quid pro quo with ZTE, the White House could face accusations of prioritizing Trump's political fortunes over national security.Already, some Republicans are accusing the White House of ignoring the concerns of US intelligence agencies that ZTE could be used by Chinese spy agencies to conduct cyber-espionage in the United States."Problem with ZTE isn't jobs & trade, it's national security & espionage," tweeted Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican. "We are crazy to allow them to operate in U.S. without tighter restrictions."Load-Date: May 16, 2018End of Document

AMBASSADOR BAI TIAN CALLS ON MINISTER AZMIN ALIStates News ServiceJune 29, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 272 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: BEIJING, China BodyThe following information was released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China:From Chinese Embassy in MalaysiaOn June 28, H.E. Bai Tian, the Chinese ambassador to Malaysia, called on Dato' Seri Azmin Ali, Minister of Economic Affairs of Malaysia. They exchanged views on development of China-Malaysia relations and economic cooperation between the two countries.Ambassador Bai briefed the latter on the status quo of China-Malaysia relations and general picture of China's overseas economic cooperation. Bai said that China-Malaysia cooperation enjoys solid foundation, great potential and broad prospects. The Chinese government is willing to work closely with Malaysia's new government to push the bilateral cooperation to a new level. The Chinese side looks forward to cooperating with Minister Azmin Ali to fully tap the potential of the bilateral economic cooperation to achieve common development. He invited the Minister to pay a visit to China at mutual convenience.Dato' Seri Azmin Ali said that Malaysia and China enjoy traditional friendship. Hundreds of years ago, Admiral Zheng Ho's fleet brought peace, friendship and trade to Malaysia. The current Malaysian government attaches great importance to its relations with China and wants the sound momentum of cooperation between the two countries to be remained and strengthened. Malaysia and China could enhance cooperation in areas such as digital economy and tourism industry. Malaysia welcomes more investment from China, which could bring technology transfer and high-income jobs to Malaysia as well as create more value to local players.Load-Date: July 3, 2018End of Document

I`m Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It`s Wednesday, May 16th.Your top stories at 7:00 a.m. Eastern.Markets on edge -- futures hovering near the flat line this morning. We`re eking out a little bit of a gain here -- 10-point gain on the Dow futures after the Dow snapped that eight-day winning streak yesterday. Negative for the year now, losing 193 points because people were also selling bonds.Treasury yields jumping big-time yesterday; the yield on the 10-year hitting its highest level in nearly seven years. It`s holding steady this morning. The yield is down just a little bit but it`s still above that 3 percent mark.Checking global market action -- we have some muted trading going on in Europe but we have gains across the board at the moment.And in Asia overnight it was mostly lower. The only market there gaining ever so slightly was the Kospi in South Korea.Those gains despite a new threat from North Korea -- Pyongyang warning that it will pull out of the meeting with President Trump if the U.S. only focuses on denuclearization. Lawmakers are taking a cautious tone ahead of the June summit.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. ROB PORTMAN (R), OHIO: I don`t think we should trust them. On the other hand, I think it`s good we`re having a direct dialogue.REP. MARTHA MCSALLY (R), RHODE ISLAND: It`s history (INAUDIBLE), right. And so in this case, you know, you talk about trust but verify -- it`s distrust and deeply verify. And we have a diplomatic opening that`s historic, certainly haven`t seen in 65 years, thanks to the maximum pressure campaign by the Trump administration. But the hard work is in front of us.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: The latest on the uncertainty ahead.Plus targeting trade -- round two of China negotiations getting under way. The President`s goal of rewriting NAFTA this year facing a setback -- a closer look straight ahead.Tesla hitting another roadblock -- production of the Model 3 reportedly halted again.And an NFL legend deposed -- John Elway facing questions in Colin Kaepernick`s collusion case against the NFL. We have more details on that.And the cast of "Hamilton" not giving up its shot for a presidential performance -- they performed in Houston for President George H.W. Bush. This will make you cry -- I can promise you that.All of that and so much more coming up this morning. CFRA investment strategist Lindsey Bell; "Wall Street Journal" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman; and Tematica Research chief macro strategist, "Cocktail Investing" co-author Lenore Hawkins. Welcome one and all.I just love to see when the politics falls away and you have the cast of "Hamilton" performing in front of President Bush 41.JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, "WALL STREET JOURNAL": That is nice. I`m also hoping to learn more about cocktail investing.LENORE HAWKINS, CHIEF MACROS STRATEGIST, TEMATICA RESEARCH: Following -- following some gin. I think that`s quite topical because it is all about distilling everyday (INAUDIBLE) into investable signals.MCDOWELL: Just to be clear, I did not drink any of the gin. If I stumble on my words it`s because I get up at 2:00 in the morning. Nat, our stage manager actually spilled gin on his hands. And he`s walking around going, "I didn`t drink. I didn`t drink. I know I smell like -- I know I smell like gin, but I`m not drinking."But first let`s get serious. North Korea fighting words -- the Hermit Kingdom threatening to abandon plans to meet with President Trump saying it has no interest in one-sided talks to denuclearize.Kevin Corke joining us, live report from the White House with more details. Good morning -- Kevin.KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning -- Dagen.A lot of people talking about the North`s decision now to possibly pull out of the talks because of the planned exercises that took place between the U.S. and South Korea.But let me be honest here. Anyone who didn`t think that the U.S. and South Korea`s previously planned exercises wouldn`t possibly imperil the talks themselves that are set for June -- well, they`re either dishonest or they`re not very bright.Here`s how the White House and the Pentagon see it. They went ahead with the exercises because it`s the responsible thing to do. The North reacted predictable, calling them a provocative military ruckus. Now the North is threatening to pull out of the planned summit set for June in Singapore.Just yesterday, in fact, they canceled a meeting at the Peace House with leaders from South Korea. Still given the progress of the planning and the North`s recent decision to release three American captives, the U.S. remains hopeful the talks will happen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HEATHER NAUERT, STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON: We have not heard anything from that government or the government of South Korea to indicate that we would not continue conducting these exercises or that we would not continue planning for our meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong-un next month.(END VIDEO CLIP)CORKE: Former colleague, Heather Nauert there over at the State Department. Don`t forget -- very busy day here at the White House. We have the President of Uzbekistan coming. We expect to hear from the President, a one-and-one press conference. And there`s a roundtable discussion, Dagen, about the sanctuary state controversy, most notably involving California.But for now, back to you.MCDOWELL: Kevin -- thank you for that. Kevin Corke -- always terrific to see you joining us from the White House.CORKE: Thank you.MCDOWELL: Here with us now, former policy director for Mitt Romney, senior advisor to Marco Rubio and research fellow at the Hoover Institution, Lanhee Chen.Lanhee -- do you think that President Trump`s summit with Kim Jong-un is in jeopardy or is this just gamesmanship that we should expect?LANHEE CHEN, RESEARCH FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION: Well Dagen -- I think this is frankly the kind of gamesmanship we should have expected although one thing has become abundantly clear. The North Koreans are an unstable partner to be having these discussions with.And I`m not saying we shouldn`t have the discussion was them. But fundamentally anybody who thought that Kim Jong-un was going to be predictable or trustworthy, they need to take a second look because this is a guy who over the years has made promises and not kept them.So I think we have to be totally aware. We have to be eyes wide open. But I do think that the discussions are ongoing and I think June 12th in Singapore is still likely to happen. But he`s trying to regain the upper hand here. This is a negotiation tactic -- Dagen.FREEMAN: Lanhee -- James Freeman here at the "Journal". I wanted to get your take on trade. I don`t see a lot of reason for optimism. You look at the Chinese negotiations, I`m not seeing us get any improvement in the way they treat our technology companies.I`m looking at NAFTA and it`s a lot of talk about the government telling companies where they can build stuff and how much they can pay. Is there any hope here that these various negotiations actually lead to more open markets?CHEN: Well, James, I mean that`s the question, right. We cannot have this negotiation with China for the goal of a short-term resolution of trade deficit issues. This has got to be a longer term discussion about what the Chinese have to do to open up their economy and fundamentally to have a different model.Look, if we don`t address the piracy of U.S. intellectual property as part of the deal, this is a big problem. This negotiation cannot be about the short-term.We`ve got in Washington this week Liu He who is one of the top Chinese economic officials. He`s here to continue negotiation with the Trump administration. I hope that they continue to press for systemic reform as opposed to a short-term sugar-high when it comes to our trade situation with China.LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA: Lanhee -- it`s Lindsey Bell here.I have a question on the ZTE transaction. Do you think that that`s really a fair trade? We`re, you know, letting them get back into business here, bringing their business back into the U.S. but in exchange for agricultural relief. Is that fair?CHEN: Well, the big issue with ZTE -- and this is something that Marco Rubio has spoken about a lot. Look, ZTE is a company that does business in China. The problem really is that they have technology that could potentially be very problematic for the U.S.If they are allowed to get their technology here into the United States, they`re going to be able to potentially infiltrate infrastructure here in the U.S., infiltrate national security concerns. So ZTE is more than about just dealing with a company as part of this trade negotiation -- it`s bigger than that. They really do pose a national security risk.I think we have to be careful when we talk about ZTE and when we talk about concessions just to help the Chinese out. That I find very worrisome.MCDOWELL: Lanhee -- it just looks -- everybody I talk to it just looks like such a national security risk, this handout to ZTE. It`s owned by the Chinese government. It`s owned by a group of companies -- some are defense companies, that it opens up the door.We`re talking -- there are words used like espionage related to ZTE. And even Huawei, they`re not -- those phones aren`t even sold on military bases.And General Jack Keane was on with Maria yesterday and he said that he was stunned to hear this. It just seems like such a bad idea. What do we get in return for it?We literally go back to where we were, the status quo on agricultural tariffs by China from where we were even in February. So whose cockamamie idea is this?CHEN: Well, you know, Dagen -- this is the thing. The suggestion that we would benefit from this I do think is highly problematic because the issue with ZTE, you know look, there was a hearing recently on Capitol Hill where all of the intelligence chiefs were there and Senator Tom Cotton, my old friend, asked this question. He said would any of you ever purchase or own a ZTE product? And nobody raised their hand because ZTE is in the business fundamentally of espionage.And so I think we have to be very careful here. And you make a good point which is that the concessions we get on agriculture aren`t even that great potentially. So we`ve got to take a good look in the mirror here and say what is our goal coming out of these negotiations with the Chinese?The goal needs to be let`s get them to behave in a different way. Let`s get them to join -- if they want to be open markets folks, if they really want to have this discussion, great. But they need to be committed to protecting U.S. intellectual property and not conducting economic espionage.MCDOWELL: James -- you mentioned that President Trump, like no other president in recent history, has really stepped up and honored his campaign promises. Most recently -- it was announced last year but moving the embassy to Jerusalem.FREEMAN: Yes. That`s what makes me so nervous on trade and immigration. I don`t see the upside here. I thought the administration was moving toward focusing on Chinese intellectual property theft, opening their market to our companies, not making our companies share our technology or trade secrets, do joint ventures.But Lanhee, I`m not seeing that anywhere in these negotiations. Now, you know, maybe I guess these meetings with Liu He this week will change things. But to far, that seems to be completely unaddressed from what I can tell.CHEN: Right. And unless this is one of those things where there are discussions going on, we don`t know about them, I do think James -- at this stage it is a little bit early for us to judge where these things are headed in the final analysis.I`m hopeful that there are people in this administration who understand the need for us to have real reform if we`re going to have this discussion with China. I do think there are people in this administration who are committed to that point of view.But what we cannot have is we cannot have short-termism in this discussion just for the purpose of improving the trade deficit potentially with China in the short run.MCDOWELL: Fair enough. This is part of the negotiation -- Lanhee. I lost my mind over some of the stupid ideas that were floated about the tax reform. And I would come on this program and just rant and rave about it and most of them didn`t wind up in the final tax law. So I will concede that.Lenore -- do you have a question?HAWKINS: Yes. Lanhee -- this is Lenore Hawkins. And one of the things I`m looking at when we`re dealing with China, I`m very concerned that we don`t end up just costing consumers more, that we don`t end up opening these markets and that all we end up doing is putting more and more upward price pressure on the things that we import, which just makes consumers have to pay more out of their pocket. How do we avoid doing that?Now I know that Trump is very good at throwing these threats out there but how do we end up not harming ourselves?CHEN: Well, Lenore -- I think that`s a great question because this has always been the reason why I`ve been a free trader, why I think open markets are the right answer for a growing and prosperous economy here in America. Because fundamentally, the reason why we engage in free trade is because it helps us to acquire the goods we need and want at a price point that our consumers can afford.Now, there is an argument to be made that domestic markets should be protected to a certain degree. But we`ve got to be careful about that because if you take it too far, you are you going to see upward price pressure. And I think consumers are going to demand change in that situation.The question is how much more are we willing to pay -- that`s the question.MCDOWELL: But Lanhee -- free trade, vote for Trump was not his slogan.CHEN: I know. I know.MCDOWELL: I`m just saying. That`s not why he won.Meantime Chuck Schumer is drawing a line in the sand. The Democratic New York Senator taking aim at GOP health care plans to roll back the individual mandate, writing "Like other states Oregon`s rates do not need to be this high but Republicans choose to systematically dismantle the American health care system instead of working with Democrats to improve it. Now, Middle class families are feeling the pinch."Chuck Schumer and his ilk are setting the Republicans up because again we find out about premium increases in October, right before those midterms.CHEN: Yes. Well, you know, I hope the Democrats decide to run on Obamacare. I really do. Because it`s not an issue I think that they have the upper hand on.Look, the reason why premiums are going up has a lot less to do with Republicans and a lot more to do with the fact that this law as crafted was headed for this destination whether Democrats were willing to admit it or not. They designed a law fundamentally where premiums would go up because what`s happening is that the healthy are subsidizing costs for the sick. That`s always been the plan. That`s where we`re headed.MCDOWELL: Lanhee -- good to see you. And Trump care just doesn`t have the same ring to it.CHEN: I know.MCDOWELL: Thank you. Lanhee Chen -- great to see you.CHEN: Good to see you.MCDOWELL: Coming up, Tesla pressing pause, said to be planning to suspend the Model 3 production for six days at the end of the month.

Cheryl Casone has more -- Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Dagen -- this is interesting. "The Wall Street Journal" is reporting this morning that Disney executives are looking at allowing the animation guru to come back to the company. He would have a new position that would reduce his role as a manager but still give him creative control.He`s been on a six-month leave following claims of inappropriate hugging and toughing. He`s apologized for any unwanted hugs or other gestures. Taking a look at shares of Walt Disney, the stock is actually higher by more than a quarter percent in the premarket.Well, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo lifting the department`s hiring freeze. The Secretary says, quote, "This will give our domestic bureaus and missions overseas the flexibility to fill positions that are essential to promoting the Department`s mission." You may remember his predecessor Rex Tillerson introduced the hiring freeze to cut the department`s budget and staffing. Secretary Pompeo holding a town hall meeting for his department`s employees. That`s going to be later this morning we should say.Well, more trouble at Tesla. Reuters is reporting the company is shutting down Model 3 production for six days at the end of this month to fix problems on the assembly line. This is the third time this year that production has been suspended. Tesla`s been working to eliminate bottlenecks on the line as its trying to boost output to 6,000 vehicles a week by the end of June. That`s the promise anyway.Meanwhile George Soros still believes in Tesla. According to a regulatory filing, the billionaire`s investment firm bought $35 million worth of Tesla bonds in the first quarter of this year. Shares of Tesla are lower ahead of -- well, they were lower -- it`s actually just went higher, up more than a quarter percent in the premarket. So, we`ll see what happens with Tesla.All right. And then there`s this. Former President George H.W. Bush treated to a private performance by the cast of the musical "Hamilton". The 93-year-old shared these photos of himself with the cast and crew when they paid him a visit in Texas yesterday.The former president tweeted his appreciation, saying quote, "A complete joy to welcome the Ham Fam -- the cast and crew of `Hamilton` to our Houston office for a special performance I will never forget. History never sounded so powerful."George H.W. Bush had hoped to see "Hamilton" with his wife, Barbara. Of course they never got the chance. She passed away just a few weeks ago. He was released from the hospital earlier this month. After her death he was treated for a blood infection but it looks like he`s feeling better -- Dagen from this pictures so. And he`s on Twitter. So we like that.MCDOWELL: I love it.CASONE: We wish him well.MCDOWELL: Don`t you love that -- James?FREEMAN: It`s a lovely gesture. Maybe they`ll continue this nonpartisanship and give Vice President Pence a show at the White House. How about that?MCDOWELL: It was a lovely nonpartisan gesture.FREEMAN: Yes.MCDOWELL: And I do like the good news out there.

How the DOJ is responding to lawmakers` request for information on the person who leaked details of former FBI director Comey`s memos to the media.

That`s next.MCDOWELL: Your dream home will cost you just as much as you think it will. New findings from Christie`s International Real Estate show that robust growth in the luxury home market, as of May 2018, 36 $100 million and higher trophy homes are offered for sale.Joining me now from an exclusive is Christie`s International Real Estate CEO Dan Conn. Can -- what can you tell us about the strength of the luxury market based on this report you guys did?DAN CONN, CEO, CHRISTIE`S INTERNATIONAL: Yes. Well, I can say that there`s been massive acceleration this year in the luxury end of the market, which is a function of a couple of things.One, 2016 into `17 was a big pause year as a lot of uncertainty -- Brexit, elections, basically all over the free world. And so really the people hit the pause button.And now you come through that and what has evolved is you`ve got basically a match maker`s paradise. You`ve got sellers who were on the sidelines for long enough that they started to embrace the new reality and dropped their prices. At the same time, the buyers were buoyed by high asset values across effectively every asset class.So they`re ready to buy. Sellers are ready to transact in pretty much every market. Then you`ve got a recipe for strong growth across all of the markets.MCDOWELL: What are the most sought after cities for luxury housing?CONN: Well, the hottest markets, if you think about velocity, are not the ones that you think of traditionally as the most luxurious. Victoria, B.C. which is driven by a number of different demand drivers, D.C. and Paris -- the areas south of L.A., which became hot just because L.A. is not so approachable; San Diego, Orange County.The most luxurious markets still are the ones you would expect -- Hong Kong which, you know, peak prices consistently. New York eclipsed London this year so we`re the number two market. But London is still strong, right. You know, notwithstanding they still have some uncertainty. It`s a great market for luxury.FREEMAN: Ok. So we`re seeing this vibrant market at the top end. Home builders seem very optimistic. But they`re still not building that many homes. Is this just kind of a hangover from the crisis -- people are more careful? What`s going on there?CONN: Yes, I think it depends a little bit on the market. You know, when you`re in the city you feel like there are a lot of homes being built because we do a lot of super-tall here, right. In markets where the super- tall isn`t a phenomenon, it`s difficult to actually create the inventory. And I do think -- this is an issue that you see.The inventory is low in just about every market with the exception of a couple of notables -- Miami, New York. And you would say, yes, the builders are probably a bit cautious going in there, but I think truthfully when you look at the way that we`re approaching it kind of as a country and worldwide, there is not enough focus on driving supply.The big conversation is really how do you get supply to people who are just trying to get on the property ladder? And I don`t think enough is really being done there.MCDOWELL: Is that impossible here in New York City? Again, you talk about -- what about the inventory here in New York City? Last time you were on, I think the last time we spoke we were talking about 432 Park which is that giant -- excuse me -- hideous tower. I think A-Rod and J Lo --FREEMAN: That`s not very nice.MCDOWELL: -- have bought a -- it`s taller than the Empire State Building. People who come to New York will be able to see it. But what about the inventory that`s coming on line particularly for the billionaire market -- and I`m not joking.CONN: Well, there`s -- you know, there`s a decent supply, right. Again, if you look at New York and you look at Miami there`s -- I would describe it as a bit of a glut. 432 Park actually did really well. And it did well because when you`re on the inside of that and you`re looking out you understand why it`s an iconic tower. It has the best views arguably in the world, right.Same thing if you look down Billionaires` Road. There is though a lot of supply at the high end. And this is the area of the market where sellers are having -- whether they`re the developer or somebody who`s bought into the unit -- they`re having to be more realistic. So 157 which is a fabulous building, you`re already seeing slight declines in pricing in the secondary market.MCDOWELL: That`s on Park, 157 Park. But these are apartments that are like $10 million and higher?CONN: Yes. Yes.BELL: What do you see for demand though for the luxury market going into next year as interest rates are going to continue to rise? Do you think 2018 is going to be a great year and then 2019 is going to, you know, soften up?CONN: Well, we`re seeing it already in 2018. The challenge is inventory, you know. It just doesn`t exist in every market. But there is significant demand. And you would expect it, right. The equity values are -- they`re not at their all-time highs but they`re pretty close.Everybody`s buoyant -- consumer confidence is there. The economy is stable, right. It`s growing at a reasonable clip so people feel like they can buy. The challenge in a market like New York is you`ve got a lot of inventory so sellers still have to be realistic about pricing to transact.I think that`s going to a theme in 2018. Buyers will still be buying. You need, you know, it`s matchmaking. You have to have willing seller, willing buyer to come together on pricing.And I don`t -- 2019, there`s no evidence at this point that 2019 is going to be softer. And nobody can really, you know, I don`t have a crystal ball but I just don`t see the dynamics changing.MCDOWELL: Dan -- good to see you. Thank you so much --CONN: Good to see you.MCDOWELL: -- for covering so much.Dan Conn of Christie`s International.CONN: Thanks for having me.MCDOWELL: Coming up Guatemala opening its embassy to Jerusalem following in the footsteps of the Trump administration.

The DOJ says it is responding to lawmakers` request for information on Dan Richman, the friend of former FBI Director James Comey, who leaked details of Comey`s memos to the media. Comey gave that information to Richman but denied it was a leak to Bret Baier last month.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: You call him a good friend and professor. You didn`t reveal you hired him at a special government employee for the FBI to work on special projects. Why?COMEY: Because it wasn`t relevant. He was FBI special government employee until February of 2017.BAIER: Did you have other special? Did you leak other things to Mr. Richman?COMEY: Yes. Like, I really shouldn`t be smiling. I don`t consider what I did with Mr. Richman a leak. I told him about an unclassified conversation with the president.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: FOX News is reporting that the House Oversight Committee hasn`t received anything yet but does expect to get documents by tomorrow. Joining me now is FOX News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano. How does this fit into the broad picture of what the Justice Department has been sitting on and withholding from congress?NAPOLITANO: Well, we`ll know that when we see the documents because sometimes the Justice Department holds things back because they`re embarrassing to the Justice Department, not because they contain classified material. But I will tell you, it is highly unusual for the DOJ or for a local federal prosecutor to release anything to either of the other branches of government, the courts or the congress, during a criminal investigation.And the Mueller investigation is still going on, so this obviously goes to Comey`s credibility and to the credibility of the professor, former assistant U.S. Attorney Richman. But we don`t know what`s -- we don`t know what`s there. We don`t know the circumstance under which he was hired. We don`t know exactly what Jim Comey gave him. We don`t know exactly what he did with it. But Comey`s version is there was nothing classified and what he read out loud to reporters without sharing the documents from which he was reading was not classified. It was Comey`s memorialization of what he and the president discussed. It remains to be seen if there is more there.MCDOWELL: Judge, I think that the growing sense among some Americans is we need to prosecute the leakers and the liars.NAPOLITANO: That is a growing sense.MCDOWELL: So, and -- because you hear about one lie after another, one leak after another, across the whole spectrum of issues.NAPOLITANO: But remember, not all lies are criminal and not all leaks are criminalMCDOWELL: You`re right.NAPOLITANO: And the DOJ -- first of all, DOJ is not going to prosecute somebody that`s also its witness. They may want to prosecute Jim Comey if he appears not to have told the truth under oath. After he`s a witness for Bob Mueller, they`re not going to do it now because that would diminish his effectiveness as a -- as a witness.MCDOWELL: But why is it important that these House Committees get this information? Because, again, congress don`t have the power to prosecute.NAPOLITANO: Correct.MCDOWELL: They have the power to expose.NAPOLITANO: Correct. They do not have the power to prosecute. They do not have the power to exonerate. There`s an actual clause in the constitution where the bill of the tinder clause which prevents the congress from declaring somebody as a matter of law guilty. The reason that`s in there is because parliament used to do that. Parliament declared Thomas Jefferson guilty of treason. Of course, observed under our system there`s got to be a trial. So, when they wrote the constitution, they put that in there. But there`s a little bit of tension here and I think tension is good. Because it prevents one side from getting a little too strong.And the tension is this, that congress controls the budget and the DOJ answers to these various committees. So, congress has got its thumb on the DOJ. On the other hand, the DOJ can`t expose too much mid-stream because that will cause some witnesses to flee or some defendants to flee. Which is why you rarely see documents come out in the midst of an ongoing criminal investigation. And there`s a federal rule of criminal procedure that would permit prosecutors to withhold from anybody, even judges, documents that are in the midst of an ongoing criminal investigation if the revelation of those documents would harm the investigation.MCDOWELL: In terms of Jim Comey, what you are starting to see is this book promotion that he`s been doing, where he gave an interview to everybody, it could get him into trouble because Chuck Grassley revealed new evidence just recently on May 12th, I think, that Comey told congress a different story last year about the truthfulness of former White House National Security Advisor Michael Flynn than he was telling the public.NAPOLITANO: You and Maria and the panel and I have discussed this before.MCDOWELL: Right.NAPOLITANO: And I`ll repeat what I said. And I am stunned that Bob Mueller permitted Jim Comey to go on the two week book tour, as smart as Comey is, he shot himself in the foot or as we say in this business, stepped on his own tongue by contradicting himself a couple of times. Now, what he says on television can be a lie. But if he says something on television to sell a book, that`s different than what he told a committee in secret or a committee under oath in public. There`s going to be an issue there. So, Senator Grassley is quite right, quite correct to want to examine this.MCDOWELL: I love it. Let`s -- I want to turn to Colin Kaepernick. Colin Kaepernick collusion case against the NFL, Denver Broncos general manager John Elway reportedly the latest to be deposed. Kaepernick alleges that the league worked on a plan to keep him off of a team roster over his anthem protest. But the Broncos were one of the few teams that expressed interest in signing him, but a deal never came through. Judge, your reaction?NAPOLITANO: All right, well, I don`t know what the facts will show. But I do know that the collective bargaining agreement between the NFL and its players prohibits discrimination on the basis of political viewpoint and I do know that many of the states in which the NFL plays, New Jersey is an example, Texas is not an example, protects the expression of view point in the workplace. You may not consider the football field a workplace but it is for these guys. If Kaepernick can show an agreement among owners to keep him off the field because of his controversial politics, he scores big.MCDOWELL: Very tough to show.NAPOLITANO: Right, why is he interrogating Elway? Because Elway offered him a job. He turned it down. But Elway, the former superstar quarterback, now the general manager of the Broncos, offered Kaepernick a job before he started to take the knee. Kaepernick turns him down. And then after that, nobody offers him a job.BELL: Yes, but he`s allowed to -- like any employers allowed to renege and offer if they find reason, correct?NAPOLITANO: But it -- except that it would violate the -- yes, generally. But it would violate the collective bargaining agreement if that reason is the politics of the employee. And then there`s the added protection of certain states like New Jersey which affirmatively protects the right to express a political viewpoint in the workplace, even a viewpoint that is defied by your employer.FREEMAN: Judge, I just -- getting back to Comey and the classified claim, when he walks out of a meeting with the president, can he -- is he allowed to determine himself what part of their discussion was classified?NAPOLITANO: That is a superb question. And I`ll tell you why. And I can`t give you a yes or no answer. Generally, the preparer of the document decides if it`s classified and if so, what level. Confidential, secret, top secret. There`s five different versions of top secret. But Comey wrote a note in the margin -- the document is printed on his printer. In the margin he writes should this be classified, if so, what level, not sure. Check with so and so. So and so, is the person in the DOJ is the expert on is it classified and if so in which category. So, we don`t know until we see the unredacted documents and until Comey`s under oath and is interrogated. Generally, a conversation with the president would not be top secret, unless they discussed secrets.MCDOWELL: There you go. Judge, I love when you`re here.NAPOLITANO: Pleasure (INAUDIBLE)MCDOWELL: Because it is -- it is a morass of information.NAPOLITANO: You know, tomorrow is the anniversary of the appointment of Mueller. I think the president is going to blast it and Rudy Giuliani is going to blast it. It`s still with us. It`s going to be here for another year, we`re waiting for judge to rule on whether or not Mueller can prosecute Manafort in Virginia. The judge yesterday ruled that he can be prosecuted for bank fraud going back to 2005 in Washington D.C. That trial starts the week of the 4th of July.MCDOWELL: Again, a special council can basically go anywhere, anywhere.NAPOLITANO: Justice Scalia warned us about that in his dissent on the case upholding special counsels there, very dangerous. And they`re alien under the constitution. Read the constitution a hundred of times, there`s nothing about a special council independent.MCDOWELL: God bless Justice Scalia -- God bless Justice Scalia.

Cheryl Casone has the details, Cheryl.CASONE: That`s right Dagen. Guatemala has officially moved its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and that`s today. Following in the footsteps of the U.S. Guatemalan president Jimmy Morales and Israel`s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu marked the move in a ceremony despite condemnation from the Palestinians. Next up is Paraguay, the country said it`s going to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem by the end of this month.Well, Southwest Airlines is having a 96-hour sale. They`re dropping prices on some domestic flights to below $50.00. The summertime slash in prices is for flights from early June into the fall. They depend on the distance. Longer flights are $79.00, $99.00 or $149. Still though, that`s a big discount. Southwest has acknowledged though that sales have slowed since the incident in April that resulted in the death of a passenger. The airline has ramped up marketing efforts to try to boost bookings on its website. Shares of southwest Airlines are down 20 percent so far this year.Well, Microsoft taking the wraps off an updated version of the Digital Whiteboard. The Surface Hub 2 can be used for presentations and remote conferences among some other things but Microsoft is also hoping the Whiteboards going to help employees work together as a team. The Surface Hub 2 has a multi-touch display, it`s more than 50 inches wide. It`s pretty big, expected to launch sometime next year. Microsoft shares have rallied 14 percent this year. They`re stocks has little changed in the premarket.And then there`s this. Two Amazon customers reporting outrageous shipping charges. A Georgia resident says that she placed an order for three boxes of toilet paper and the shipping charge was more than $7,400. Amazon later saying that she was refunded. Then, a Tennessee resident says she was charged more than $1,000 for expedited shipping after she bought paper plates.Her credit card company, not Amazon, says she`s going to be refunded. Amazon dismissed the seller following the incident. The seller shares of Amazon are up 37 percent so far this year. I can`t decide what I like more here, the fact they`re getting overcharged and that`s interesting or that people are buying paper plates and toilet paper on Amazon? Because God forbid you have to go to the grocery store. Back to you.MCDOWELL: Cheryl, people buy -- what are you saying? I buy paper towels and T.P. It`s the pantry. Again, it seems like this is the marketplace where it`s a seller that`s basically hitting somebody with this shipping charge.HAWKINS: Amazon just needs to do a little bit of a better job of overseeing it. But what has me really excited is that Microsoft, the big Whiteboard, I have fantasies of having like my whole house covered with whiteboards. It`s great for brain storming, but this, it`s great to see Microsoft coming up with some really great creative technologies. Because for the longest time they were not leading anymore, they were just relying on what they had done in the past and kind of the monopoly that they had. So, it`s nice to see them coming up with great new technologies.BELL: Yes, I think the Whiteboard`s a great idea. Especially for us that are hard at seeing. That you can use it at your home and the office. It could be, you know, the new iPad.MCDOWELL: I know Sandra Smith uses a Whiteboard to basically put up her kids` schedule every day. So, I think that, again, Microsoft is -- people might joke about it, but the stock is up 14 percent this year and also it hasn`t lost the touch with no pun intended with the customers and the consumer.BELL: Yes, and the valuation isn`t out of control either.HAWKINS: You know, you were talking earlier about the most crowded trade. I was looking at that, most people don`t realize this, since 2014 there have been just seven stocks that have accounted for about 60 percent of the rise in the S&P and Microsoft is one of them.MCDOWELL: We`ll talk about that next. Coming up, a war of words going viral, the internet`s reaction to Marcus Morris yelling at Tristan Thompson during game two of the Eastern Conference Finals, next.MCDOWELL: Lebron James taking a foul to the face but he insists it was not a concussion. Here`s Jared Max with more on King James` loss in the Playoffs.JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS REPORTER: Yes, King James said he was OK. His coach thought maybe not so. Lebron James last night, even with 42 points, the Cavs still got blown out by Boston. Now two loses away from summer vacation. First quarter, Cavs score 27 points. 21 for Lebron, yes, 21 Black Jack. But if we`re thinking terms of poker, Lebron now has a straight in his hand, 42 points last night, he also has games of 43, 44, 45 and 46. But boy, the Celtics too much. They`re back court outscored Cleveland 41 to three, came back to win last night by 107-94, 2-0 Celtics lead.Now, second quarter, Lebron took a shot from the Celtics Jayson Tatum right to the face, to the jaw. Lebron had to go to the locker room he said to recalibrate. Now the head coach thought his energy dropped off after that, Lebron said he`s OK. Turned out it`s a strained neck. Looked pretty painful.Interesting notes last night on the internet, showing a shouting match between Tristan Thompson and Marcus Morris of the Celtics. They were having fun with the memes on this one. Now take a look at some of these shots making fun of the Tristan Thompson, the father of Khloe Kardashian`s daughter, so, yes, they`re going at it. The memes were having fun.Not such a fun story next, the wife of 2009 U.S. Open golf champion Lucas Glover, Krista Glover was arrested Saturday night after Lucas and his 62 year old mother allegedly became victims of domestic battery. After Lucas shot a 78 Saturday, the players championship. Krista said to have verbally assaulted him in front of their two under aged children because he played poorly and at their apartment, according to a police report obtained by the Daily Mail, Krista caused lacerations to her husband`s arm and her mother- in-law`s arm. She tried to intervene. Lucas, who said his wife have been drinking all day, told deputies when he plays a bad round of golf, Krista proceeds to start an altercation with him, tell him how he`s a loser, how he`s better win or her and the kids would leave him, and he would never see the kids again.Seattle Mariners second baseman Robinson Cano may not be a first star hall of famer after all, suspended 80 games without pay. Violated baseball`s drug program tested positive for a banned substance before the season.Carolina Panthers they`re going to be sold by Jerry Richardson to billionaire hedge fund manager David Tepper. Sale price reported to be $2.2 billion, that matches the record price for the sports team paid for the Houston Rockets. And (INAUDIBLE) the 1.4 billion at the Buffalo Bills were sold for four years ago. Congratulations, David Teper.MCDOWELL: Yes, David you used to live in New Jersey. And then said, so long, Garden State, I`m moving to Florida because of the tax treatment now, I`m sure he owns a home in Charlotte. Thank you, Jared. Good to see you. Jared Max, the community down there. Thanks to (INAUDIBLE) it will be a great honor.

CHINESE VISITORS COULD SOON 'TAP IN' TO HONG KONG USING WECHATStates News ServiceJune 7, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 897 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:The ruling Chinese Communist Party is mulling a proposal that could allow its citizens to "tap in" to Hong Kong and Macau with their smartphones instead of a travel permit, using the ubiquitous social media app WeChat.WeChat's parent company Tencent is currently looking at ways to make the current Exit-Entry Permit for Travel to and from Hong Kong and Macau into a digital pass system through a plugin within the app, local media reported.The aim is to streamline travel for Chinese passport-holders to the cities, which run separate immigration borders under the terms of their handover from the U.K. and Portugal in 1997 and 1999, respectively.Tencent has also said it wants Chinese citizens to be able to use their national ID cards, required for access to many everyday services in China, in electronic form, using the app.The company recently said in a statement that its digital ID card had been approved by the Ministry of Public Security.The digital entry pass is part of China's new plan for a "Greater Bay Area" linking the Pearl River Delta cities of Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Macau, Shenzhen, and Zhuhai with streamlined infrastructure that will extend China's national high-speed rail network to a terminus in Hong Kong, including the 31-mile (50 kilometer Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge scheduled to open in July.But there are concerns in Hong Kong that rapid integration with mainland China could lead to an effective erosion of the city's status as a separate jurisdiction, promised under the terms of its handover agreement.Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor director Law Yuk Kai said it is unclear whether the move will result in a bypassing of immigration checks, and the city's right to refuse entry to Chinese citizens."If anyone holding a document issued by the mainland Chinese authorities will be allowed to enter Hong Kong without hindrance, then this would be a matter of concern, if that power to regulate our environment were lost," Law told RFA."If mainland China alone can decide who comes in to Hong Kong, that that would constitute a failure to respect the separate jurisdictions," he said.He said there would be concerns over a loss of control of the city's borders, partly because of a possible increase in population, and partly because Hong Kong residents could lose political influence to an influx of mainland Chinese.Delaying legislationPro-democracy lawmakers in Hong Kong's Legislative Council (LegCo) are currently trying to stall a controversial piece of legislation that would allow the law of mainland China to be enforced within Hong Kong city limits at the high-speed rail terminus in West Kowloon.The pan-democratic camp, which is banned from filibustering after a crucial rule-change, is using "limited tools" linked to quorum rules to try to delay the bill, as well as tabling dozens of potential amendments.Council Front lawmaker Au Nok-hin said their action is justified because the bill has scant support among the general public."What we can do is to try to use the limited tools in order to express to the public that we do not support the current arrangement," Au told government broadcaster RTHK. "I think that we have our obligation to try to express that there are still a lot of problems with the co-location arrangement."Hong Kong political commentator Liu Ruishao said many in Hong Kong are also concerned about potential invasions of privacy as Chinese-government apps like WeChat morph from social media apps to essential tools for everyday life."Actually the use of digitization and electronic technology is very advanced in mainland China right now," Liu told RFA. "But it is also very dangerous.""One the one hand, it's extremely convenient to use ... smartphones in this way, but on the other, there are no protections for individual privacy," he said.In January, Tencent expanded its user base to Hong Kong residents, who can now use WeChat's highly popular cashless payments system without needing a mainland Chinese bank account.Hong Kong residents can now activate their WeChat Pay accounts using international credit cards, including MasterCard, Visa and JCB, and use the app to pay for online shopping, ride-sharing, tickets, bike-shares, food delivery and hotel bookings.The payments system has also expanded to include residents of Macau and Taiwan, a democratic island that has never been ruled by the Chinese Communist Party.Beijing's rubber-stamp parliament, the National People's Congress (NPC), announced last December that it would extend Beijing's authority to the high-speed rail terminus to enable a streamlined process for passengers boarding the trains in Hong Kong, despite of the city's status as a separate immigration, policing, and customs jurisdiction.The "co-location" arrangement has already been criticized as unconstitutional as a violation of Hong Kong's mini-constitution, the Basic Law, with the city's Bar Association (HKBA) putting forward a detailed criticism of the ruling.Articles in the Basic Law allowing Hong Kong to make certain arrangements to enable cross-border trade and economic links "do not authorize" the city's government to act inconsistently with the rest of the law, the HKBA said.Reported by Jia Ao for RFA's Mandarin Service and by Lam Kwok-lap for the Cantonese Service.

Solar Polysilicon Industry in China 2018, Forecast to 2022: Competition, Supply & Demand, Import & Exports Levels, Price Trends and Key ManufacturersPR NewswireJune 27, 2018 Wednesday 12:15 PM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1545 wordsDateline: DUBLIN, June 27, 2018 BodyThe"Research Report on China's Solar Polysilicon Industry, 2018-2022"report has been added toResearchAndMarkets.com'soffering.The production volume of China's polysilicon reached 242,000 tons in 2017, representing a CAGR of 70% from 2007 to 2017. The newly installed photovoltaic bases in China reached 53 GW in 2017, ranking first in the world for five consecutive years. Also, the total installed capacity amounted to 130 GW, taking the first place for three consecutive years. Production scale of every link in the domestic industry chain all took over 50% of the global total and continued to be leading in the world.The export value of photovoltaic products, including wafer, cell, module and inverter, totalled USD 15.777 billion in 2017, increasing by 5.3% YOY. The export value of wafer, cell, module and photovoltaic inverter was respectively USD 2.968 billion, USD 0.797 billion, USD 10.61 billion and USD 1.402 billion, with a respective YOY increase of 14.4%, 17.39%, -1.2% and 46.3%. In addition, the export volume respectively reached 4.404 billion, 3.36 GW, 30 GW and 15.92 million units.According to research, solar grade polysilicon is the main raw material for crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells. On top of this, there were 22 polysilicon enterprises in normal production by 2017, with the effective capacity totalling 280,000 tons, up by 70,000 tons over 2016. Among them, major manufacturers include GCL Silicon Technology Holdings Inc., TBEA Co., Ltd., Daqo New Energy Corp., etc. Also, by the end of 2017, the aggregate capacity of 10 enterprises, each of which exceeded 10,000 tons, accounted for more than 70% of the country's total.Since 2011, the Ministry of Commerce of the PRC has made a series of anti-dumping investigations on imported polysilicon, thereby restraining the imports to some extent and promoting the local polysilicon industry. In 2017, the production volume of polysilicon in the world amounted to 436,000 tons, of which China made up about 55.5%. However, China still imported 159,000 tons of polysilicon, with an import dependency of 39.8%. With the continuous expansion of the domestic polysilicon production capacity, the proportion of imports is expected to decline gradually.With the advancement of technology in recent years, both the utilization efficiency of polysilicon and the photoelectric conversion efficiency have risen continuously. Relevant statistics show that in 2017, to produce 224 W silicon wafer needed 1 kg silicon materials. As technology develops in 2018 (especially with the progress of slicing technology) and monocrystalline silicon is more widely applied in the photovoltaic industry, 1 kg silicon materials can produce 280 W silicon wafer.In 2017, the production volume of silicon wafer equivalent to the capacity of modules was 87.6 GW; while in 2018, the production volume of polysilicon is projected to reach 400,000 tons, and that of silicon wafer equivalent to the capacity of modules will amount to 112 GW. It is predicted that the total demand for photovoltaic modules in the global market will be 110 GW in 2018, and the capacity of China's polysilicon will even surpass the global demand.Based on this analysis, the main driving force for the growth of China's polysilicon market in the next few years is still the demand from the photovoltaic industry, where the increase in domestic demand and exports is equally important. It is estimated that the emerging photovoltaic market will grow rapidly in the next few years. Among them, the installation demand mainly comes from Asia and America, and the market is also opening in Middle East and Africa.It is predicted that the demand for polysilicon in the Chinese market still has large room to increase. Although the production of polysilicon can gradually meet the domestic demand, monocrystalline silicon has been popular since 2016, which needs to be made of high-quality polysilicon raw materials. Concerned about the quality of domestic polysilicon, Chinese manufacturers of single wafer still import high-purity one from Germany and South Korea. It is forecasted that China will import over 100,000 tons of polysilicon a year from 2018 to 2022.Key HighlightsEconomy and Policy Environment Faced by China's Polysilicon IndustryDevelopment Status of Photovoltaic IndustryAnti-dumping Measures of Chinese Government against Imported PolysiliconSupply and Demand of Polysilicon in ChinaPolysilicon Import and Export Levels in China, 2013-2017Market Competition of Polysilicon in ChinaPrice Trends of Polysilicon in ChinaMajor Polysilicon Manufacturers in ChinaDriving Forces and Market Opportunities in the Polysilicon IndustryRisks and Challenges Faced by the Polysilicon IndustryDevelopment Trends of China's Polysilicon IndustryCompanies MentionedAsia Silicon (Qinghai) Co.

In relation to steel, China has continued to expand its steel capacity, bringing the global steel overcapacity to around 600 million metric tons. China has been dumping steel on the global market, creating a surge in global supply and driving down prices. American steel companies and their steelworkers have suffered as a result.

In relation to steel, China has continued to expand its steel capacity, bringing the global steel overcapacity to around 600 million metric tons. China has been dumping steel on the global market, creating a surge in global supply and driving down prices. American steel companies and their steelworkers have suffered as a result. We must do all we can to ensure China knows that we will enforce all of our trade laws.I am disturbed that the Administration has hesitated to implement these tariffs. For years, China has made promises to reduce their steel overcapacity and combat other unfair trade practices, and no such action has been taken. China does not play by our market-based rules, and the time for action is now.In the Section 301 investigation and subsequent report, it was determined that the Chinese government uses opaque and illicit mechanisms to intervene in U.S. companies' operations in China and require the transfer of innovative technology. As you know, the Chinese government does not use market-based licensing agreements the same way as other U.S. trading partners and involves itself in industrial development plans, negating the benefits of fair global trade. Further, the report concluded that China conducts and supports unauthorized intrusions into computer networks of U.S. companies to access their confidential product information.Our trade laws are being violated, and the United States government has a responsibility to take action against violators. American workers, regardless of their industry or specialization, are the most innovative in the world and, if given a fair chance, can compete with anyone. They cannot do so if they must compete with the Chinese government and its unfair policies involving trade and investment.I would note that as a result of judicial processes at the International Trade Commission, 223 duty orders or tariffs have been placed on various imported steel products. China alone accounts for approximately one-fourth of these duty orders on foreign steel products. While other countries are investing and trading fairly, China is stealing innovation and tipping the scales of our global economic system in their favor. Your affirmative action is needed to begin to responsibly address the illegal activities of China.Thank you again for your serious work to investigate trade and investment practices around the world and for allowing me to voice my support for the proposed list of tariffs on Chinese products. I will continue to support actions, such as these proposed tariffs, that seek to level the playing field for domestic manufacturing companies and their workers, promote fair international trade and investment, and protect good-paying jobs.Section 301 PJV Official Letter to USTR.pdfLoad-Date: May 21, 2018End of Document

Why they censored Peppa Pig in ChinaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 2, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 480 wordsBodyThe popular video platform Douyin eliminated the episodes of the famous animated cartoon on the grounds that it became a "subversive icon". The round, pink and tender face of the Peppa piglet has won the hearts of children all over the world. Every day there are more infants who spend hours in front of the television watching the episodes of the famous British cartoon. But in China, apparently, they do not like the idea because they consider the character to have become a "subversive icon" of an "idle and antisocial" youth.  This was announced by the Chinese newspaper Global Times, akin to the positions of the ruling Communist Party, reporting that the popular video platform Douyin withdrew at least 30 thousand episodes of the popular pig and that the tag #PeppaPig was banned.  According to the Chinese media, Peppa is part of a list of contents censored by the platform in which men dressed as women, excessive nudes and "erotic behaviors" also appear.  The episodes of Peppa Pig are broadcast in China since 2015 on the channel for children of the state-owned CCTV network and have become very popular. With stories centered on friendship and cooperation, the cartoon seems to promote the ideals and socialist values ??of the Chinese government. However, some state media have criticized the addiction that the character has created in children.  The People's Daily, also akin to the Chinese government, has reported on the negative effects of the "commercialization" of Peppa Pig, to which Internet users are tired. "Many schoolchildren try to differentiate themselves by competing with their Peppa Pig watches and accessories, for the benefit of counterfeit manufacturers," the newspaper said.  Another negative side of the success of the pig, according to Global Times, is the spread of fake episodes, memes and parodies of black humor or with pornographic and / or violent content (see box). This has made the character the target of the Chinese government's constant drive to control social networks and clean up cyberspace. Negative inspiration for society The growing popularity of Peppa Pig has also penetrated the imaginary of Chinese adults, through incorrect manifestations for the government. Images of tattoos (permanent and temporary) with the face of the pig associated with illicit acts (drug trafficking, robbery, money, etc.), as well as toys, food, clothing and other items have become viral in Chinese society. According to the Global Times, Peppa Pig has become an expression linked to the people of the underworld, "who go against the current, generally have a poor education and do not have a stable job. They are unruly lazy people who are roaming around and the antithesis of the young generations that the Communist Party tries to cultivate, "he said.  & nbsp;  & nbsp;  The entry Why they censored Peppa Pig in China appears first in La Hora. Load-Date: May 2, 2018End of Document

'Beautiful girls are needed.' Chinese tech firms under fire for sexist job adsCNN WireApril 23, 2018 Monday 10:17 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 876 wordsByline: By Michelle Toh and Jethro MullenDateline: HONG KONG (CNNMoney) BodyHONG KONG (CNNMoney) --  China's biggest tech companies are promising to make changes after being named in a report detailing discrimination against women in job advertising in the country.Titled "Only Men Need Apply," the report published Monday by Human Rights Watch says that discrimination in hiring by Chinese government authorities and private companies is contributing to a widening gender gap in the world's second largest economy."Nearly one in five job ads for China's 2018 national civil service called for 'men only' or 'men preferred,' while major companies like Alibaba have published recruitment ads promising applicants 'beautiful girls' as co-workers," said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch.The group said it analyzed more than 36,000 jobs ads. Besides Alibaba, the report highlights sexist ads from other top Chinese tech firms, including Baidu, Huawei and Tencent.AlibabaHuman Rights Watch said that its review of Alibaba's job ads found "a troubling pattern of gender discrimination, including ads that openly state a preference for male applicants, use female employees' appearances to attract male applicants, or highlight only males as examples of high-performing employees."Alibaba, China's biggest e-commerce company, said that its recruitment policies "have clear and well-defined guidelines on providing equal opportunity regardless of gender" and that it "will conduct stricter reviews of the recruiting advertisements to ensure compliance with our policy."The company argued that it "exemplifies one of the best practices in our industry when it comes to gender equality," noting that women account for one-third of its management positions.TencentHuman Rights Watch also called attention to posts by Tencent, which runs China's biggest messaging app. It cited an October 2016 social media post by Tencent promoting the company's recruitment fairs in the United States in which an employee was quoted as saying, "The reason I joined Tencent originated from a primal impulse. It was mainly because the ladies at human resources and that interviewed me were very pretty."A Tencent spokesperson said the cases highlighted by Human Rights Watch "clearly do not reflect our values.""We have investigated these incidents and are making immediate changes," the spokesperson said. "We are sorry they occurred and we will take swift action to ensure they do not happen again."BaiduBaidu, which runs China's biggest search engine, was criticized for several ads. They include a video posted on an official Baidu social media account in September 2016 in which a male company employee said that one of the reasons that he was "so happy every day" was because he could "go to work with beautiful girls."The report also mentioned a March 2017 job ad for content reviewers at Baidu that said applicants should be "men" and have "strong ability to work under pressure, able to work on weekends, holidays and night shifts."A Baidu spokesperson said, "We value the important work that our female employees do across the organization, and deeply regret the instances where our job postings did not align with Baidu's values."The company identified and removed the offending job postings before the release of the Human Rights Watch report, the spokesperson said, describing them as "isolated instances that in no way reflect our company's dedication to workplace equality."Baidu said that 45% of its employees are women and that the ratio "is also reflected in mid and senior positions."HuaweiAccording to the report, Huawei posted a message on social media promoting a job fair in 2015 that asked, "Do you want your wages to increase at a rate faster than housing prices, and to marry a fair-skinned, rich, and beautiful [woman] and enter the peak of your life?"A December 2013 post encouraging prospective applicants to tour the company's campus said, "No matter how beautiful the scenery [on Huawei's campus] is, beautiful girls are needed."Huawei, one of the world's biggest smartphone makers, said that it "respects gender equality and it is a company policy." "We will review the allegations brought to our attention in the report and also work to ensure that in all recruitment publicity material is fully sensitive of gender equality," a spokesperson said.Call for changeHuman Rights Watch said the current legal framework in China isn't up to the job of dealing with sexist ads."Although Chinese laws ban gender discrimination in hiring and gender discriminatory content in advertising, the laws lack a clear definition of what constitutes gender discrimination, and provide few effective enforcement mechanisms," the report said. "As a result, the level of enforcement is low and Chinese authorities rarely proactively investigate companies that repeatedly violate relevant laws."Human Rights Watch is calling for the Chinese government to carry out a series of changes to improve the situation, including a new comprehensive employment anti-discrimination law. It's also urging companies to "adopt and enforce company policies prohibiting all forms of gender-based discriminatory job ads."-- Serenitie Wang contributed to this report.TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Acclaimed Writers, Artists Call on China to Free Poet, Artist Liu XiaTargeted News ServiceMay 16, 2018 Wednesday 7:33 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 676 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK BodyPEN America issued the following news release:Dozens of celebrated writers, poets, and artists have called for the lifting of all restrictions on Chinese poet and artist Liu Xia, held under illegal house arrest without charge since October 2010.This show of literary solidarity comes following revelations about Liu Xia's declining health, which she revealed in April during a harrowing phone conversation with friend and exiled writer Liao Yiwu.Rita Dove, Paul Auster, JM Coetzee, Khaled Hosseini, Hu Ping, and Michael Chabon are among the group of writers who have read excerpts of Liu Xia's poetry as part of a video campaign advocating for her freedom.Khaled Hosseini, author of the Kite Runner, said: [I support this campaign for Liu Xia] as artists who are free to speak must do so on behalf of other artists whose voices are being stifled."The excerpts celebrate some of Liu Xia's most powerful works while calling on the Chinese government to end their cruel campaign of retaliation against her for her late husband Liu Xiaobo's calls for democratic reform.During the phone call with writer and friend Liao Yiwu released on 2 May Liu Xia, who suffers from depression, said she was "prepared to die" under house arrest.Suzanne Nossel, PEN America Chief Executive Officer, said: "Liu Xia's cry for freedom resonates around the world and rebukes the Chinese government's hollow claim that she is free."As efforts to allow Liu Xia to travel abroad for medical treatment stall, literary and human rights communities renew and amplify their call to release a poet who has been accused of no crime."We are proud to stand with Liu Xia's literary peers to celebrate her work, and challenge the Chinese government's relentless campaign to erase her voice."Lisa Tassi, East Asia Campaigns Director at Amnesty International, said: "The Chinese government's efforts to silence Liu Xia are despicably cruel. Liu Xia's poetry inspires so many who are now united in calling for her to be free."Liu Xia has been under illegal house arrest since Liu Xiaobo was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010.?She is still closely monitored by state security agents and can only be reached by her closest friends by phone in limited circumstances.She has also been moved from her home in Beijing and held incommunicado for periods of time following the death of Liu Xiaobo in July 2017, with unverified clips appearing periodically on YouTube showing her in various locations in Beijing and Yunnan province.Liu Xia is known to be in poor health, and suffers from severe depression, but has been prevented from travelling abroad to seek treatment.The videos can be found here (https://pen.org/she-is-still-not-free-writers-read-liu-xia-poetry-call-for-her-freedom/).Full list of participating artists:Alec Soth, PhotographerAlice Sebold, Author of Lovely BonesAyelet Waldman, American novelistChang-Rae Lee, Korean-American novelistDaniel York, British theatre actorJason Ng, Hong Kong authorJennifer Lim, Singaporean-British actressJM Coetzee, Nobel Laureate in LiteratureKhaled Hosseini, Author of Kite RunnerMa Thida, Myanmar writerMichael Chabon, 2001 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction/2008 Hugo Award for Best NovelNaomi Christie, Chinese-British actressNicholas Wong, Hong Kong poetPaul Auster, American novelist/ Man Booker shortlistPhilip Gourevitch, American writer and journalistRebecca Boey, British writer and actressRita Dove, American poetRobert Pinsky, American poetSiri Hustvedt, American Novelist/longlisted for the 2014 Man Booker Prize and won the 2015 Los Angeles Times Book Prize for FictionSiu Hun Li, Chinese-Scottish ActorTammy Ho, Hong Kong poetTina Chang, American poetXu Xi, Hong Kong-Indonesian novelistXu Youyu, Chinese writer in the USHu Ping, Chinese writer in the USMa Jian, Chinese-born British writerChang Chuan-fen, Taiwanese writer, scholar and activistYen Hung-ya (Hung Hung), Taiwanese poet and artistContact: Anoosh Gasparian, external relations coordinator, 646/981-0685, agasparian@pen.orgCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6293844 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: May 17, 2018End of Document

Recovering from one child: China's growing fertility problemCNN WireMay 7, 2018 Monday 9:01 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1351 wordsByline: By Serenitie Wang, CNNDateline: BEIJING (CNN) BodyBEIJING (CNN) --  Xi Xiaoxin, 35, never thought that she would have trouble conceiving three years ago.Back then, all she wanted was to enjoy traveling the world with her husband, whom she married in 2012. But when she came around to the idea of starting a family three years later, the road to conception turned out to be rough."Not until recent years did I realize that it could be so difficult getting a baby," she said. Xi is one of hundreds of thousands of largely urban Chinese women struggling with infertility. Like elsewhere in the world, delaying motherhood has become more common in China, with high costs of living, long working hours, unfriendly maternity policies and high child care costs. Some specialists also suggest that environmental factors such as pollution could also be a factor, particularly for male infertility. But it's not just a personal struggle; it's a national one. China's total fertility rate, at an estimated 1.6 children per woman in 2017, is similar to Canada's but below those of the United States and UK. This rate is below the 2.1 rate needed to keep the population steady, according to the CIA World Factbook. Chinese authorities want to boost the birth rate, but its population pyramid is upside down: There's a shrinking number of workers to support an aging population. To turn the tide, the Chinese government is making drastic changes to its population policies, which had long focused on keeping the birth rate low. In 2015, it scrapped the decades-long one-child policy, and this year, it abolished its long-feared Family Planning Commission, which enforced the draconian one-child policy. But this decision to allow married couples to have two children is now behind a surge in demand for fertility treatment among older women.Xi and her husband didn't think about parenthood at all when they were younger. "Until these years ... whenever I see my aging parents, there's worry that they could be very lonely in the future with no grandchildren."Official data on infertility in China are hard to come by. A report six years ago by the China Population Association suggested that it affected 40 million women and men. Infertility is perceived to be much less of a problem in rural areas, where people get married much younger. Struggles shrouded in silence Phoebe Pan runs a help group for women struggling with infertility on social media platform WeChat."I know so many Chinese women who are overwhelmed by so-called infertility and sterility problems," said Pan, who blogs about her experience on polycystic ovary syndrome, a hormone problem that can lead to female infertility. She thinks age is the major cause of infertility problems among women.Adding to the problem is the stigma surrounding infertility in Chinese society. Many of the women Pan has spoke to are ashamed to talk about it with families and friends, and this in turn causes a lack of awareness among young Chinese women. Xi has undergone three years of various infertility treatments, including taking a bitter herbal medicine for three months, three rounds of ovulation induction therapy and one laparoscopic surgery to restore displaced tissues in her uterus. This year, she decided to try IVF treatment in a state-run infertility clinic. It costs $4,700 -- equivalent to about four months' salary in rich cities like Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou and a fee that's not covered by state medical insurance, Xi said. She found the experience in the state-run hospitals generally unpleasant. Xi and her husband have to get up early and visit the clinic every week and spend four hours there, mostly waiting in lines. "The real consultation time lasts only five minutes," said Xi, who also worries about the cost. Reality TV showInfertility is the subject of a new reality TV show, "The UFO Fertility Show," which is set in a future when aliens have traveled back to Earth via UFO to explore why the human race is perishing.The show began streaming online in China this year and was launched by physician Dr. Wei Siang Yu, who created the similar "Dr. Love's Super Baby Making Show" in Singapore. In the first episode, Yu's team visits a couple in Shanghai and gives them advice on how to conceive. The tips include diet changes, tai chi-style exercises, rearranging the bedroom furniture and preventing noise. The host particularly frowned upon the pungent and sugary food found in the couple's fridge. The first two episodes of his show have attracted 46 million views altogether online, the company said. "The government-run fertility clinics are far from enough," Yu said. The rise in demand for IVF today highlights the dream many parents once had but were forbidden from making a reality for more than 30 years.As of 2016, there were only 451 clinics nationwide offering IVF licensed by the government, which means there are only 3.3 licensed fertility centers for every 10 million people in China, according to a report by Qianzhan Industry Research Institute. The report estimates that there are 800,000 men and women unable to access quality fertility treatment. It also suggested that fertility clinics in China weren't as successful as their counterparts elsewhere because of dated technology.With a 30% to 40% conception rate, China falls behind countries like the United States, Thailand and Malaysia that have a 60% to 65% conception rate, the report said. This has sent many Chinese abroad to pursue fertility treatment, with the US and Thailand the top choices. Dr. Hal Danzer, a fertility specialist in Los Angeles, has a large Chinese clientele. He says people having babies later isn't the only factor. "I see a lot of Chinese businessmen who work 12 hours a day, six days (a week), and they don't have a good diet. They are overweight. They smoke and drink a lot of alcohol. Their sperm don't look good."Resorting to traditional and modern measuresBusinesses sense opportunity in tackling the problem, with a renewal of interest in traditional Chinese medicine approaches towards infertility as well as the use of modern technology like apps and social media groups. Fang, a physician working in a government-run hospital in East China's Zhejiang province, who didn't want to give his full name, runs one of many online stores selling so-called fertility aids on Taobao, China's biggest e-commerce platform. He said that he sells tens of thousands of homemade packs of foot soak herbs every month and that demand has been growing in recent years, far exceeding his expectation. Though Fang admitted that the foot soaking is not magic, he thinks it improves his customers' overall health and makes it more ideal for pregnancy. In traditional Chinese medicine, the foot is considered crucial to maintaining health, he saidIn contrast, people are also increasingly embracing cutting-edge technology to solve such problems. Pan said ovulation tracker apps are "very popular" among groups who receive fertility treatment.One application that tops the app store list in China is Fengkuangzaoren, or "Crazy for making babies." With a pink icon featuring sperm on a clock, the application provides an array of trackers such as basal body temperature, ovulation and menstruation to advise the best days to try to conceive. Its core feature, the company said, is an algorithm-powered IVF assisting tool that predicts total cost and success rate and brokers clients with local and overseas clinics.The company said the app has accumulated 8 million users and has helped 70,000 families successfully conceive over the past four years. With the spirit of trial and error, women like Xi are not giving up hope. She is an active user of the app and a member of seven WeChat groups in which people share experiences of IVF treatment. Xi is just starting her first round, so there could be a long road ahead of her."Although the process has been frustrating both mentally and physically, I believe, as long as there's a ray of hope, we will persist on the road. We will have a child eventually," she said. TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved.Load-Date: May 8, 2018End of Document

He said that he sells tens of thousands of homemade packs of foot soak herbs every month and that demand has been growing in recent years, far exceeding his expectation.Though Fang admitted that the foot soaking is not magic, he thinks it improves his customers' overall health and makes it more ideal for pregnancy.In traditional Chinese medicine, the foot is considered crucial to maintaining health, he saidIn contrast, people are also increasingly embracing cutting-edge technology to solve such problems. Pan said ovulation tracker apps are "very popular" among groups who receive fertility treatment.One application that tops the app store list in China is Fengkuangzaoren, or "Crazy for making babies." With a pink icon featuring sperm on a clock, the application provides an array of trackers such as basal body temperature, ovulation and menstruation to advise the best days to try to conceive. Its core feature, the company said, is an algorithm-powered IVF assisting tool that predicts total cost and success rate and brokers clients with local and overseas clinics.The company said the app has accumulated 8 million users and has helped 70,000 families successfully conceive over the past four years.With the spirit of trial and error, women like Xi are not giving up hope. She is an active user of the app and a member of seven WeChat groups in which people share experiences of IVF treatment.Xi is just starting her first round, so there could be a long road ahead of her."Although the process has been frustrating both mentally and physically, I believe, as long as there's a ray of hope, we will persist on the road. We will have a child eventually," she said.Load-Date: May 8, 2018End of Document

Trump, China, ZTE and the art of the dealCNN WireMay 15, 2018 Tuesday 5:23 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1257 wordsByline: Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNNDateline: (CNN) Body (CNN) --  For President Donald Trump, foreign policy is all about the deals that are ripe to be done and the powerful men who make them.So while it seems illogical that someone who won power accusing China of stealing American jobs now wants to save US-sanctioned technology firm ZTE to rescue Chinese jobs, the move is perfectly compatible with his character.ZTE's fate is evolving into a multi-layered drama that encapsulates tense trade posturing between two economic superpowers that are also locked in high-stakes geopolitical maneuvering over the future of a nuclear North Korea.It offers fresh insight into Trump's way of doing business, his willingness to flout the norms of presidential governance and his own impulsive behavior -- all of which proved so attractive to voters soured on establishment politics in 2016.Trump has repeatedly stressed the warmth of his friendship with Xi Jinping since he welcomed the Chinese leader to his Mar-a-Lago resort last year and was honored with lavish hospitality during his return visit to Beijing.The President appears to be betting big that the personal connection can pay off despite the widening gulf between China and the US on trade."I think there's a bit of a bromance between President Trump and Xi," said Larry Kudlow, who runs the President's National Economic Council, at an event hosted by Axios on Tuesday, adding that the friendship might even lead to a trade deal."Bromances are always a good idea."But to Trump's critics, the tussle over ZTE offers yet more evidence that he's prone to placing his personal political gain over the national interest, takes profound decisions without regard for the risks and is guilty of hypocrisy.It's also raising questions about whether Trump's hard line on trade is softening ahead of talks with Chinese negotiators in Washington this week."This is quite unprecedented," Michael Hirson, a former US Treasury trade representative to Beijing, told CNN's Richard Quest on Monday, arguing that the President's gambit could mean he is on a different page from his most hawkish advisers on the China trade dispute.The Trump administration last month banned ZTE, which makes smartphones running Google's Android operating system, from using US technology after accusing it of violating a deal in which it agreed to pay $1.2 billion for evading US sanctions on North Korea and Iran.Yet on Sunday, out of nowhere, Trump tweeted that "President Xi of China, and I, are working together to give massive Chinese phone company, ZTE, a way to get back into business, fast. Too many jobs in China lost. Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done!"Trump posted a follow-up tweet on Monday that was just as staggering, possibly influenced by hours of news coverage about motivation in offering to do the deal:"ZTE, the large Chinese phone company, buys a big percentage of individual parts from U.S. companies. This is also reflective of the larger trade deal we are negotiating with China and my personal relationship with President Xi."Why save ZTE? The case for saving ZTE is that doing so could yield significant concessions in return -- and the United States should use every bargaining chip it has to secure a win in the deepening trade confrontation with Beijing.Trump also needs China's cooperation, and continued pressure, on North Korea as he prepares for his summit with the isolated state's leader, Kim Jong Un, in Singapore on June 12.There is also the argument that ZTE is emblematic of the entwined US-China economic relationship, given that thousands of jobs in both countries depend on its survival farther down the high-tech supply chain.But Trump's intervention on ZTE surprised trade experts because it rejected the principle that trade enforcement decisions should not be used and potentially waived for political reasons -- a bridge other presidents have hesitated to cross.Avoiding that linkage spares presidents from requests from every foreign leader they meet to intervene in niggling trade disputes.Politicizing enforcement action also weakens US arguments to foreign governments that the rule of law and good governance are crucial to healthy political systems and regulated interaction between governments.Further, Trump's hint of concessions on ZTE played into critics' concerns that the President cedes leverage before securing substantial concessions in return -- despite his claim to be the world's best deal-maker.Characteristically, the President's order seemed to take his own government by surprise. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who last month accused ZTE of "egregious" violations, was singing a different tune Monday."The question is: Are there additional remedies to the one we had originally put forward?" he said at the National Press Club. "That's the area we will be exploring very, very promptly."Ross also said he wouldn't be surprised if the issue came up in talks with Chinese Vice Premier Lui He in Washington this week.Looming trade war The Trump administration is locked in a confrontation with China over alleged intellectual property theft, market access and the size of the Chinese trade surplus with the US, which prompted Trump to threaten $150 billion in import duties on Chinese goods.But his critics worry that his positioning on ZTE is a first sign of a broader shift."He is backing off, and his policy is now designed to achieve one goal: Make China great again," said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, of New York. "The toughest thing we could do, the thing that will move China the most, is taking tough action against actors like ZTE."Trump's tweets also exposed him to accusations of inconsistency, since the administration on Sunday warned of possible sanctions against European firms that do business with Tehran after pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal last week."The hypocrisy here is staggering," former State Department spokesman John Kirby told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Monday."He has got his new ambassador to Germany out there last week saying German companies that do business with Iran -- we are going to slam ya -- and now we are going to go ahead and just forget the billion dollars of fines that we assigned to that company for selling that technology to both Iran and North Korea."The ZTE situation could also expose Trump politically ahead of midterm elections in November.CNN's Cristina Alesci reported on Monday that the administration was seeking concessions from the Chinese government in exchange for easing restrictions on ZTE. A deal could see China remove proposed agricultural tariffs, a Commerce Department official familiar with the discussions said.Those tariffs, apparently targeted direct at Trump country in Midwestern states, were threatened in response to the President's vow to tax China's imports to narrow the US trade deficit with Beijing.If agricultural penalties are waived in quid pro quo with ZTE, the White House could face accusations of prioritizing Trump's political fortunes over national security.Already, some Republicans are accusing the White House of ignoring the concerns of US intelligence agencies that ZTE could be used by Chinese spy agencies to conduct cyber-espionage in the United States."Problem with ZTE isn't jobs & trade, it's national security & espionage," tweeted Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican. "We are crazy to allow them to operate in U.S. without tighter restrictions."CNN's Amanda Golden contributed to this storyTM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Chinese Uyghurs forced to welcome Communist Party into their homesCNN WireMay 14, 2018 Monday 12:50 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 979 wordsByline: By Steven Jiang, CNNDateline: BEIJING, China (CNN) BodyBEIJING, China (CNN) --  More than a million Chinese Communist officials are being dispatched to live with local families in the western region of Xinjiang, a move seen as a sign of the government's increasingly tightened grip over the area's predominantly Uyghur Muslim population. The so-called "home stays," announced by the government, target farmer households in southern Xinjiang, where the authorities have been waging an unrelenting campaign against what they call the forces of "terrorism, separatism and religious extremism."Government statements and state media reports show that families are required to provide detailed information during the visits on their personal lives and political views. They are also subject to "political education" from the live-in officials-- whose stays are mandated to be at least one week per month in some locations.International advocacy group Human Rights Watch highlighted and condemned the government's "home stay" program in a report released Sunday, calling it a serious violation of privacy and cultural rights of the 11 million ethnic minorities in Xinjiang."What can be more intrusive than forcing your way into somebody's home, making them host you while conducting surveillance on them and saying you're bringing benefits to them?" Maya Wang, senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch and author of the report, told CNN on Monday."It's the ultimate form of surveillance -- it's a forced political indoctrination and assimilation program," she added. "It's both creepy and perverse."The "home stay" program, evolved from a government attempt that began in 2014 to have officials regularly visit and monitor people in Xinjiang, has greatly expanded since, involving 110,000 officials just two years ago to more than a million now, according to government figures. State media reports these officials, most of whom belong to China's predominantly Han ethnic group, teach minority families to speak Mandarin, sing the national anthem and organize weekly national flag-raising ceremonies -- activities similar to what activists say are mandated for thousands of Uyghur Muslims arbitrarily detained in political education camps across Xinjiang.CNN contacted the Xinjiang provincial government for comment but has not yet received a response.'Forced intimacy'Tensions have remained high in Xinjiang -- a resource-rich area long inhabited by the Turkic-speaking ethnic Uyghurs and other Muslims -- following a spate of violent attacks in recent years. The Chinese authorities have blamed the incidents on Muslim Uyghur separatists seeking to establish an independent state.In numerous photos posted online, the authorities paint a picture of ethnic unity, showing smiling Han officials and minority families jointly preparing meals, doing household chores, playing sports and even sharing the same bed -- images that Human Rights Watch's Wang says put the "forced intimacy" element of the program on full display.Government statements have stressed the program's effectiveness in resolving people's daily and social problems such as trash collection to alcoholism. But in a speech last December, a top Xinjiang official made clear the scheme's "strategic importance" in "maintaining social stability and achieving lasting security," as well as instilling the political theory of President Xi Jinping in the minds of local residents. A local government statement online also indicated that officials must inspect the homes they are staying for any religious elements or logos -- and instructed the officials to confiscate any such items found in the house.Activists say the regional government, now led by a hardline Xi loyalist, has not only continued to arrest and imprison many Uyghurs, but also increasingly relied on both high-tech tools and mass mobilization programs to keep the population in check.In addition to the "home stay" initiative and the political education camps, they cite examples ranging from ubiquitous surveillance cameras, to mandatory GPS tracker installation in cars and DNA collection for all residents aged 12 to 65.Last year authorities also enacted a sweeping anti-extremism law, with long beards, veils in public and home-schooling all on the ban list, prompting new denunciations from international human rights groups.Amnesty International has said Uyghurs face widespread discrimination in housing, education and employment as well as curtailed religious freedom in their homeland. Other critics have linked the rise of violence in Xinjiang to Beijing's repressive reign there -- a claim the government vehemently denies.Ethnic tensionsOver the past decades, the arrival in Xinjiang of waves of Han Chinese has also fueled ethnic tensions, despite the government's best effort to portray an image of ethnic harmony."We guarantee the legitimate rights and interests of all ethnicities and prohibit the discrimination and oppression against any ethnic groups," Zhang Yijiong, a senior Communist Party official in charge of ethnic minority affairs, told reporters last October."The cultures, histories, languages and traditions of all ethnicities are protected and respected by national laws."Critics of Beijing's Uyghur policy see a starkly different scenario in Xinjiang, as the authorities intensify their crackdown and surveillance while forced political indoctrination spreads."The real intention of the Chinese government is to eliminate the Uyghurs as a distinct ethnic group," Rebiya Kadeer, a longtime exiled Uyghur leader who recently stepped down as president of the advocacy group World Uyghur Congress, told CNN in an interview in Washington last year."All this repression (in Xinjiang) only makes the Uyghurs hold on to their identity more firmly," she added. "China has awakened the Uyghur people."TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved.Load-Date: May 15, 2018End of Document

Rep. Smith Issues Statement on Digital Authoritarianism, Global Threat to Free SpeechTargeted News ServiceApril 27, 2018 Friday 10:17 PM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1114 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyRep. Christopher H. Smith, R-New Jersey, issued the following speech, which was published in the Congressional Record on April 26, on digital authoritarianism and the global threat to free speech:Mr. Speaker, today we held a hearing on China's digital authoritarianism. China has the world's largest number of internet users as well as the world's most sophisticated and aggressive internet censorship and control regime. The Chinese government, under the leadership of Xi Jinping, views digital controls as necessary for its political stability and control of core digital technologies as necessary for its economic future.The Chinese government spends $10 billion on maintaining and improving their censorship apparatus. The U.S. government has an annual internet freedom budget of $55 million and Congress still has little idea how this money is spent.Over the past year or so, Chinese companies were ordered to close websites that hosted discussions on the military, history, and international affairs and crack down on "illegal" VPNs (in response, Apple was forced to remove VPNs from the China App store). New regulations were announced restricting anonymity online and the Chinese government rolled out impressive new censorship technologies, censoring photos in one-to-one WeChat discussions and disrupting WhatsApp.Beijing has also deployed facial and voice recognition, artificial intelligence, and other surveillance technologies throughout the country, but particularly targeting the Uyghur ethnic minority, where between 500,000 to 1 million Uyghurs have been detained arbitrarily.The Chinese government and Communist Party's attempts to enforce and export a digital authoritarianism poses a direct threat to Chinese rights defenders and ethnic minorities and poses a direct challenge to the interests of the U.S. and the international community.The U.S. must recognize that we are engaged in a battle of ideas with a revitalized authoritarianism--online, in the marketplace, and elsewhere--and we need up our "competitive game" to meet the challenge.The Administration's National Security Strategy says quite clearly that the Chinese government and Communist Party (along with Russia) seek to "challenge American power, influence, and interests, attempting to erode American security and prosperity. They are determined to make economies less free and less fair, to grow their militaries, and to control information and data to repress their societies and expand their influence."[The Chinese government and Communist Party] is using economic inducements and penalties, influence operations, and implied military threats to persuade other states to heed its political and security agenda. . . China gathers and exploits data on an unrivaled scale and spreads features of its authoritarian system, including corruption and the use of surveillance."The Chinese government and Communist Party want to shape a world antithetical to U.S. values and interests and to export its economic, political, and censorship models globally.In response, the U.S. and like-minded allies must stand resolutely for the freedom of religion, fairer and freer trade, labor rights, freedom of navigation, the rule of law and the freedom of expression-- including online.A coherent and engaged internet freedom strategy must be a critical part of the U.S. diplomatic toolbox. This strategy should have at its core a commitment to protect fundamental freedoms, privacy, and promote the free flow of news and information.But it is not a matter of just having a strategy; it should be the right one. The Bush and Obama Administrations pursued cyber diplomacy; yet internet freedom has declined around the world, privacy is increasingly under threat, and the free flow of information has become more endangered.The right strategy must start with some humility. Cyberspace is a place to spread democratic ideals and a place where criminals, extremists, corporations, traffickers, and governments exploit vulnerabilities with impunity. Online communication can convey are highest ideals and our worst fears. It can shine a light on repression and be the source of hatred, manipulation, fake news, coercion, and conflict. It can bring people together or push us apart.Despite all this, I agree with the NSS's conclusions which says, "The Internet is an American invention, and it should reflect our values as it continues to transform the future for all nations and all generations. A strong, defensible cyber infrastructure fosters economic growth, protects our liberties, and advances our national security."Central to a revitalized U.S. internet freedom strategy should be a priority to open gaping holes in China's Great Firewall.Right now, I'm just not confident that this is the policy of the Broadcasting Board of Governors or the State Department right now.I think there are certain goals we should prioritize in our internet freedom strategy regarding China.First, China's netizens require easy, reliable and free access to uncensored information through anti-censorship technologies, so that anybody can freely access information regardless of their technical ability. Reliable solutions should work all the time, regardless of intensified crackdowns or major events (Party Congress, June 4th anniversary) taking place in-country.Second, solutions should also present difficult choices for the Chinese authorities--if the authorities want to disrupt these solutions, then they must disrupt many online services which they would normally be hesitant and unlikely to block.Third, Access to solutions should also come at no cost for Chinese netizens, the Chinese authorities often block access to payment providers so even if Chinese can afford a circumvention solution, they cannot get past censorship by their payment provider.Fourth, holistic anti-censorship solutions should be encouraged, including not just technical circumvention but also distribution of those tools (getting around Google Play being blocked, and censorship in the Apple App Store) and well as helping users share anti-censorship tools, as well as content, through messaging apps, social networks and QR codes.These are just a few starting principles. I am open to a conversation about these goals with experts and allies. But given the stakes and possible outcomes, moving quickly to fund and distribute anti-censorship technologies should be a priority.The future of our grandchildren--in the U.S. and China alike--may very well depend on open, interoperable communications online, with minimal barriers to the global exchange of information, data, ideas, and services.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6267633 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: April 28, 2018End of Document

TODAY IN OPENGOV: A HEALTHY SERVING OF SCANDALStates News ServiceMay 29, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1470 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the Sunlight Foundation:by Matt RumseyIn today's edition, the revolving door spins for Congressional staff who helped write last year's tax overhaul, states look to limit access to public records, President Trump's China dealings raise eyebrows, retweets become dangerous in Russia, and more.washington watchFacebooks' self-regulatory approach to online ad transparency highlights the government's failure to act. Paul Blumenthal dug into the situation, explaining that Facebook's "new policy is meant to shine light on the previously undisclosed ways that politicians and other groups aim to shift public opinion on elections and political issues. But the self-regulatory approach will occur at Facebooks direction and without any public oversightthe new policy also highlights how the failure of elected officials and regulatory agencies to impose actual disclosure rules through the democratic process is enabling the private sector to assert its authority over the conduct of U.S. elections." Sunlight's Executive Director John Wonderlich weighed in, arguing that the failure to regulate this space all together is a pretty abject failurenow we have private sector campaign finance regulation. Thats a pretty dystopian present. (Huffington Post)Congressional staff who helped write last year's tax overhaul are starting to move through the revolving door to K Street. "Republican aides in Congress who were instrumental in writing the sweeping tax law last year are hitting the exits to take jobs in the lobbying industry. At least a half dozen high-profile GOP staffers have departed or are departing Capitol Hill, swapping jobs in the legislative branch for plum postings at firms like Akin Gump and Squire Patton Boggs." (The Hill)A tactic tried by two super PACs to hide their donors ahead of a West Virginia primary could spread this election season. "The groups arrived on the scene with blurry names, like 'Mountain Families PAC,' but blunt intentions: to quietly use truckloads of outside money to feather their political beds ahead of the November general election. By the time their donors were revealed a few days ago, the primary felt like a distant memory. To do this, the PACs used legal tactics that were nonetheless designed to defy the spirit of current campaign finance law, campaign finance experts say." (CNN)In wake of reports that he used staff as personal "gofers", Rep. Scott Garrett (R-VA) announces retirement, citing alcoholism. "Rep. Tom Garrett (R-Va.) said Monday that he is an alcoholic and will not seek reelection in November a decision that came amid mounting scrutiny into his handling of his congressional office. The 46-year-old Garrett was the subject of a POLITICO report on Friday citing four former aides who said that the congressman and his wife, Flanna, had used official staff to run errands and take care of their dog." (POLITICO)states and citiesNew York City launches new tool to harness and publicize regional data. "New York Citys planning department has launched a new mapping tool that harnesses population, housing and economic data and makes it available for exploring by the general public. The Metro Region Explorer offers trending data on the citys greater metropolitan region: the five boroughs, upstate New York and Long Island, as well as parts of New Jersey and Connecticut." (Next City)States are increasingly looking to limit public access to public records. Katherine Barrett and Richard Greene write, "the Holy Grail for government transparency is making it easy and simple for citizens to know what their government is doing and how it arrives at its decisions. Weve always believed this can be achieved, in part, by providing access to public records. Of course, transparency isnt open-ended. Every state has statutes clarifying what information must be made public and what information should be kept sealed. However, in recent years theres been a steady chipping away at the publics right to know." (Governing)Louisiana Legislature considers a budget transparency boost. "Louisiana has re-introduced a bill to expand its website capabilities to deliver more information on government spending, a move that is increasingly gaining traction among states. HB 10, introduced earlier this week by Reps. Taylor Barras and Raymond Garofalo, seeks to not only include executive branch expenditures on the existing Louisiana Transparency and Accountability Portal (LaTrac), but also include spending information from the Louisiana judiciary, legislature and public universities, according to the bill." (Government Technology)trumplandChina's decision to award Ivanka Trump 7 new trademarks around the same time her father pledged to save a Chinese technology firm was probably a coincidence"China this month awarded Ivanka Trump seven new trademarks across a broad collection of businesses, including books, housewares and cushions. At around the same time, President Trump vowed to find a way to prevent a major Chinese telecommunications company from going bust, even though the company has a history of violating American limits on doing business with countries like Iran and North Korea. Coincidence? Well, probably." (New York Times)but, it's just another example of the conflicts, both real and hypothetical, that run rampant thanks to President Trump and his family's refusal to completely remove themselves from their business interests.Meanwhile, more than 60 Democratic members of the House called for an ethics investigation into Trump's business ties with China. "More than 60 Democratic representatives are demanding an ethics investigation into President Trump's ties to China, following the president's recent push to rescue Chinese telecommunications firm ZTE. Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) posted a letter to David Apol, acting head of the federal government's ethics office, to Twitter on Sunday, stating that the request was prompted by Trump "advocating" for ZTE just days after the Chinese government gave one of the president's business endeavors a $500 million loan."

XINJIANG AUTHORITIES REGULARLY IMPOSE 'HOME STAYS' ON MUSLIM UYGHUR FAMILIES: RIGHTS GROUPStates News ServiceMay 14, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1352 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Authorities are imposing regular "home stays" on Muslim Uyghur families in northwest China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) as part of an increasingly invasive "strike hard" campaign, according to New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW), which called on Beijing to put an end to the practice.Since early 2018, Muslimand particularly Uyghurfamilies have been required to invite officials into their homes and provide them with information about their lives and political views, HRW said in a statement on Sunday, adding that the hosts are also subjected to political indoctrination."The Chinese government should immediately end this visitation program, which violates rights to privacy and family life and the cultural rights of ethnic minorities protected under international human rights law," the statement said.Maya Wang, senior China researcher at HRW, said that the new policy had left Muslim families throughout the XUAR "literally eating and sleeping under the watchful eye of the state.""The latest drive adds to a whole host of pervasiveand perversecontrols on everyday life in Xinjiang," Wang added.HRW noted that in December 2017, it said, authorities greatly expanded an October 2016 drive called "Becoming Family"which saw more than 100,000 officials visit mostly Uyghur homes in southern XUAR every two monthsto mobilize more than a million cadres to spend a week living in homes, primarily in rural areas.The "home stay" program was extended in early 2018 and cadres now spend at least five days every two months in the families' homes, HRW said, adding that "there is no evidence to suggest that families can refuse such visits."During the visits, cadres "collect and update information about the families," including whether they have local hukoushousehold registrationor are migrants from another region, their political views, and their religion. The cadres report on any "problems" and can act to "rectify" the situation.They also carry out political indoctrination, including promoting Chinese president "Xi Jinping Thought," and warning people against the dangers of "pan-Islamism," which is seen as a threat to Beijing's rule.The cadres teach the families Mandarin Chinese, make them sing the national anthem and other songs praising the ruling Communist Party in Chinese, and ensure families take part in a weekly flag-raising ceremony.The activities are documented in reports submitted with accompanying photosmany of which can be found on the social media accounts of participating agenciesand show scenes of cadres involved in the most intimate aspects of domestic life, such as making beds and sleeping together, sharing meals, and feeding and tutoring children. There is no indication the families have consented to the posting of these images online."China's deeply invasive forced assimilation practices against Muslims not only violate basic rights, but are also likely to foster and deepen resentment in the region," Wang said."Xinjiang authorities should immediately end the 'Strike Hard' campaign and all the related abuses."In June last year, sources told RFA's Uyghur Service that authorities in the XUAR were doubling down on a bid to prevent Muslim Uyghurs from fasting and praying during Islam's holy month of Ramadan by embedding Chinese officials in their homes, but the new findings from HRW suggest the "home stay" policy has become much more pervasive since the beginning of the year.Turning homes into prisonsMunich-based World Uyghur Congress president Dolkun Isa on Monday called the campaign "unconscionable" and said it was doing more to harm ethnic relations than promote harmony in the region."It's not just a simple invasion of privacy, but the total annihilation of the safety, security and well-being of family members," Isa told RFA's Uyghur Service."China has, in effect, turned Uyghurs' homes into prisons from which there is no escape. Under such a campaign of systematic indoctrination and intimidation, Uyghurs and Chinese will never 'become family' members."Isa noted that the "home stay" campaign was implemented alongside the jailing and detention in "political re-education camps" of Uyghurs accused of harboring "strong religious views" and "politically incorrect" viewsa policy that has been in effect since April last year and has seen nearly all the adult male residents of Uyghur communities rounded up by authorities."How can Chinese officials 'live, eat and sleep' among Uyghur families whose men have been arbitrarily and extrajudicially detained by the Chinese government," he asked."Such policies and actions of the Chinese government must be condemned by the international community, and Chinese officials who have been involved in designing and implementing them should be held accountable under international law and the Magnitsky Act in the U.S."Last month, Senator Marco Rubio called in an open letter for U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad to visit the XUAR with the aim of investigating claims of "mass surveillance and detention" of Uyghurs, and asked him to determine whether Washington should level sanctions against those responsible for the policies under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act.Rubio termed the detention of Uyghurs in re-education camps "the largest mass incarceration of a minority population in the world today."'Police state'Also on Monday, the eve of Ramadan, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCRIF) denounced what it called an "increasing crackdown on Uighur Muslims" by the Chinese government in the XUAR, which it said "increasingly resembles a police state.""The Chinese government's pervasive policies and intrusive security controls deny Uighur Muslims' basic civil liberties and human rights and interfere with the practice of their faith, including during the holy month of Ramadan," which begins on Tuesday, USCRIF said.USCRIF chairman Daniel Mark said the Chinese government's restrictions on Uyghurs "are an attempt to assimilate a besieged religious and ethnic minority," and that by installing cadres in homes and detaining Uyghurs in re-education camps, authorities have "created a culture of fear, suspicion, and mistrust throughout Xinjiang.""The government's actions are disrupting entire communities as they try to live their lives and practice their faith in peace," Mark added.USCRIF noted that in addition to longstanding restrictions on Uyghur religious practice during Ramadan, the government has installed a multifaceted security grid in the region, comprised of armed checkpoints, facial and iris recognition software, and cell phone monitoring.Additionally, the government has sought to "stymie the growth" of the next generation of Uyghurs through methods such as a ban on Uyghur language instruction in school, the prohibition of children from attending mosques, and proscribing Islamic baby names considered "extreme."USCRIF called on the U.S. government to sanction regional and national government officials and agencies involved in religious freedom violations in the XUAR through the Magnitsky Act, the International Religious Freedom Act, and other measures.It called for China to remain designated as a "country of particular concern" (CPC) under the International Religious Freedom Act for engaging in or tolerating systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom. China has been repeatedly designated a CPC since 1999.China regularly conducts "strike hard" campaigns in Xinjiang, including police raids on Uyghur households, restrictions on Islamic practices, and curbs on the culture and language of the Uyghur people, including videos and other material.While China blames some Uyghurs for "terrorist" attacks, experts outside China say Beijing has exaggerated the threat from the Uyghurs and that repressive domestic policies are responsible for an upsurge in violence there that has left hundreds dead since 2009.Reported by Alim Seytoff for RFA's Uyghur Service.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi meets Chinese President Xi Jinping for informal summitCNN WireApril 27, 2018 Friday 12:20 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 950 wordsByline: By Manveena Suri and Ben Westcott, CNNDateline: NEW DELHI (CNN) BodyNEW DELHI (CNN) --  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Chinese President Xi Jinping Friday at the beginning of his informal two-day relation-building summit in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.The meeting, widely interpreted as an attempt to reset relations and rebuild trust, follows an extended period of diplomatic estrangement between the two neighboring nuclear powers. Though officials from both sides have stressed that the meeting has no stated goals or set agenda, an op-ed published Thursday in the state-owned China Daily suggested the two leaders would focus on a number of key issues, specifically global governance and shared international challenges."The common interests of China and India far outweigh their differences ... Of course Xi and Modi will also address each other's concerns, but they are not likely to indulge in strategic distrust and geopolitical competition," the opinion piece said.The summit comes after the two countries were involved in a tense 72-day military standoff last summer over the disputed border region of the India-China-Bhutan "trijunction."On Friday afternoon, Modi and Xi had a one-on-one meeting before touring the Hubei Provincial Museum in Wuhan, home to some of China's oldest cultural relics.Images posted by Indian Ministry of External Affairs Raveesh Kumar on social media showed Modi being welcomed to the museum with an elaborate Chinese cultural performance. "India and China's cultural connect goes back many centuries," Kumar said on his official Twitter feed. Other pictures showed Xi accompanying Modi throughout the exhibition as the Indian leader played musical instruments and viewed the displays.Busy schedule planned for summitJoined by China's foreign affairs heavyweights Yang Jiechi and State Councilor Wang Yi, Modi and Xi began a second round of talks at the East Lake guesthouse later in the evening.According to a schedule released by the Indian Foreign Ministry, Xi and Modi have a total of six engagements planned over the two-day period.On Saturday, they are expected to hold a second one-on-one meeting at a state guesthouse on the banks of the East Lake, followed by a boat ride. Modi said on his official Twitter account, ahead of his departure, the meeting would provide the two leaders with an opportunity to exchange views on a range of issues of "bilateral and global importance.""We will also review the developments in India-China relations from a strategic and long-term perspective," added Modi.But an Indian opposition leader sent a cheeky warning to Modi after the Indian Prime Minister had touched down in China, reminding him to mention India's "crucial issues" to Xi, including the border dispute at Doklam and China's large-scale economic investment in Pakistan.According to Indian media reports, a joint statement will not be issued following the visit.Closer trade tiesUnlike a more traditional state visit, the casual setting appears to have been arranged in a bid to avoid potentially complex policy negotiations.Writing in the Hindustan Times on the eve of the summit, Chinese Ambassador to India, Luo Zhaohui, described the two countries as being at a "critical stage of economic development and modernization," pointing out that economic and trade cooperation between the two nations has surged in recent years. Between India and China, their collective population and economies comprise more than 2.6 billion people and 17.6% of the global economy.China is India's largest trading partner with a total of $84 billion in bilateral trade last year. But the economic relationship is dwarfed by the US-China trade volume, which stood almost $600 billion.Referencing the rising threat of US protectionism, Luo stressed the importance of maintaining free and open cross-border trade. "With the current backlash against globalization, a heart-to-heart dialogue between the two leaders will promote free trade," read the op-ed. It comes as China is engaged in an escalating battle over trade with the Trump administration in the United States, which has threatened tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese goods.Whether Modi and Xi can work to develop closer trade ties, will depend to some extent on their ability to overcome more lasting, politically sensitive issues. Doklam standoffTensions between India and China rapidly escalated in July over a thin strip of land bordering both countries, as well as the kingdom of Bhutan, in the Himalayas.Bhutan accused the Chinese government of violating its treaty obligations by building a road inside Bhutan's territory. Beijing denied the accusation, saying the area -- known as Doklam -- was Chinese territory.India and Bhutan have historically strong relations and the situation quickly grew more serious, as both countries increased their military presence on the border.Eventually both Beijing and New Delhi agreed jointly to an "expeditious disengagement," although Chinese state media insisted "China will continue to exercise its sovereign rights." It came just days before Xi and Modi were due to meet in early September at the BRICS Summit in Xiamen.The Doklam standoff was the latest in a long-running series of territorial flare-ups between the two superpower neighbors. In 1962, China and India engaged in a bloody border war, and skirmishes have continued to break out sporadically in the decades since.Other longtime sore points between the neighbors include China's ardent backing of Pakistan, India's arch rival, and New Delhi's sheltering of the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader whom Beijing considers a separatist traitor.TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Rep. DeLauro Issues Statement on Tariffs on Chinese ImportsTargeted News ServiceJune 14, 2018 Thursday 7:01 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 391 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyRep. Rosa L. DeLauro, D-Connecticut, issued the following statement in response to the Trump administration's decision to impose tariffs on Chinese imports:In April, the Administration proposed $50 billion in tariffs on goods from China."America has lost millions of jobs to China over the past few decades due to our massive trade deficit, and the recent chaos from the White House has done little to fix that problem. The Trump Commerce Department's disorderly implementation of trade enforcement tools has not inspired confidence in the President's ability to appropriately hold our trading partners accountable. That is why I will continue to call for a meaningful strategy to address our deep trade deficit with China that has led to the outsourcing of good-paying American jobs. To make matters worse, President Trump rolled back sanctions on Chinese telecommunications firm ZTE--after the company sold critical technology to Iran and North Korea and lied to U.S. security officials about it. President Trump should be focused on American jobs, not China's."I have never shied away from disagreeing with past presidents in my own party--or agreeing with those on the other side of the aisle--when it came to the fundamental changes needed in our nation's trade policy. That is why I supported the Administration's decision to launch an investigation under Section 301 of the Trade Act last year. For too long, we have allowed the Chinese government to extract sensitive technology, steal trade secrets, and force the transfer of technology, innovations, and production at the expense of American workers and production. China's deep integration of civilian and military technology development, as highlighted in by the nonpartisan U.S. China Economic and Security Review Commission, is particularly concerning and must be addressed."Tariffs must be seen as one tool among many our country can use to hold bad actors like China accountable and to bring the Chinese government to the table to secure a more favorable balance of trade. We cannot allow the recent chaos to continue and risk further damage to our standing in the world. That is why I am calling on President Trump to fight for American jobs with a comprehensive strategy that puts American economic interests front and center."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6333717 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: June 16, 2018End of Document

The Rise of Chinese Robotics Companies: A Matter of When, Not IfPR NewswireApril 10, 2018 Tuesday 9:46 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 765 wordsDateline: OYSTER BAY, N.Y., April 10, 2018 Body Historically, the industrial robotics space has traditionally been dominated by Japanese and European vendors, while the commercial robotics has been the stronghold of robot startups from the United States and Europe. However, recent developments suggest that Chinese vendors are staking a claim in the robotics territory, according to ABI Research, a market-foresight advisory firm providing strategic guidance on the most compelling transformative technologies."The top four Chinese industrial robotics vendors reported a topline growth of 20% year-on-year in 2016 and a similar figure is expected for next few years. Their Japanese and European counterparts were either contracting or experiencing low single-digit growth in the same period. Two factors spurring their growth: China-based warehousing robot companies have been actively expanding their overseas operations and China's overall heavy push into 5G and AI," says Lian Jye Su, Principal Analyst at ABI Research.The rise of Chinese robotics suppliers is due to a strong government pressure and heavy investments in R&D by the companies. China is expected to become the world's largest single market of industrial robots, with total shipments of 134,000 in 2018, based on ABI Research's forecast. To become the leader in robotics technology, the Chinese government released its Guidance for the Development of the Robotics Industry for 2016 to 2020. At the same time, Chinese robotics companies and internet giants have been investing in key robotics technologies. There have been some early successes: Shanghai Siasun has launched its own dual-arm, 7-axis collaborative robot and Geek+ managed to raise US$ 60 million in the latest funding round.Admittedly, it would be very challenging for Chinese industrial and commercial robotics suppliers to replicate the roaring success of DJI, and to a certain extent Ecovacs, in both domestic and international markets. Chinese industrial robotics vendors only have 30% market share in the domestic market led by Shanghai Step Electric, Shanghai Siasun, Estun, and Guangdong Topstar Tech. Despite being backed by major e-retailers such as Alibaba and Suning, Geek+ will find the overseas market a different ball game, as it squares off with established players, such as GreyOrange, Swisslog, Fetch Robotics and Magazino.In addition, Chinese robotics suppliers are still lagging in terms of key components. "Chinese robotics vendors are still sourcing key robotics components from international companies. Top reduction gear vendors, for example, mainly come from Japan, while German firms have been in the leading position of gripper and machine vision technology. Meanwhile, U.S. startups have been introducing innovative solutions in actuator, LiDAR, and soft material handling," continues Su. "All these key components are essential to the competitive advantage and cost margin of robotics manufacturers. There will be a long road ahead before Chinese robotics suppliers fully develop in-house solutions but given what we have observed from other technology sectors, it is a matter of when, not if."These findings are from ABI Research'sIndustrial and Commercial Robotics Marketreport. This report is part of the company's Robotics, Automation & Intelligent Systemsresearch service, which includes research, data, and Executive Foresights. About ABI ResearchABI Research provides strategic guidance for visionaries needing market foresight on the most compelling transformative technologies, which reshape workforces, identify holes in a market, create new business models and drive new revenue streams.

Analysis: China is playing the long game against TrumpCNN WireMay 22, 2018 Tuesday 8:40 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 701 wordsByline: By Julia HorowitzDateline: NEW YORK (CNNMoney) BodyNEW YORK (CNNMoney) --  China knows what it's doing in negotiations with President Donald Trump on trade.In recent months, Beijing has shown a willingness to make concessions. It's lowering tariffs on auto imports. It's opening its financial markets to foreign lenders. And it will start allowing US automakers to make cars in the country without local business partners.But as notable as those changes are, China is standing firm on big issues. It's plowing ahead with its plan to dominate tech, including artificial intelligence. At the same time, China is pumping hundreds of billions of dollars into infrastructure projects in Asia, Africa and Europe - buying years of goodwill and geopolitical influence.Trump, meanwhile, focuses on the trade deficit. But economists say that fixation is misplaced. China will continue to be a giant producer on the global stage, while the US economy is driven by consumer spending.It would take enormous long-term guarantees to alter the trade imbalance in a meaningful way - not just increases to agriculture and energy exports, which China pledged over the weekend."This is China humoring the US," said Phil Levy, senior fellow on the global economy at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.On Tuesday, the Chinese Finance Ministry said China will cut import duties on passenger vehicles from 25% to 15% starting on July 1.It's a flashy move that would let the United States claim a win. President Trump singled out China's tariffs on cars for criticism last month, pointing out that they're far higher than the 2.5% import duty on autos levied by the United States. "Does that sound like free or fair trade?" Trump tweeted. "No, it sounds like STUPID TRADE - going on for years!"The easing of import duties isn't the only move China has made recently to show that it's willing to liberalize its economy. The Chinese government has also promised to remove restrictions on foreign carmakers that want to manufacture vehicles in the country. Previously, companies such as GM and Volkswagen had to form joint ventures with local partners in which the Chinese companies have the controlling stake. China said last month it will phase out those rules by 2022.And Beijing is working to lift restrictions on foreign access to the country's banking, securities, insurance and asset-management markets, with changes expected by the end of June.Such shifts benefit China on two fronts, according to Levy. They temporarily appease the United States, and they make it look like China is taking steps to become a team player on global trade, he said.At the same time, China remains full speed ahead on its state-directed push to dominate high tech fields from electric cars to 5G wireless technology."The US is not going to change China's approach to technology policy," said Samm Sacks, senior fellow in the Technology Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "They certainly are not going to do it from any unilateral US action."Beijing is also expanding its global clout by investing in ports, rail lines and other development projects through its Belt and Road initiative.These plays for global dominance could position China as a much bigger threat to US hegemony down the road.The Chinese government knows that Trump remains laser focused two big issues: North Korea and the trade deficit. Trump has made clear that he wants a potential summit with North Korea in June to happen, and he wants China to keep pressure on North Korea.Additionally, the president's emphasis on the trade imbalance has allowed China to provide the United States with nominal victories by making commitments to purchase more goods.Even on this, experts are skeptical. Global saving and spending patterns are fairly entrenched, making bilateral trade deficits difficult to manipulate."If your metric is the US deficit on trade with China, the programs that have been unveiled so far are not going to decrease it significantly," said Nicholas Lardy, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and expert on the Chinese economy. "It may prevent it from increasing further."TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved.Load-Date: May 23, 2018End of Document

China said last month it will phase out those rules by 2022.And Beijing is working to lift restrictions on foreign access to the country's banking, securities, insurance and asset-management markets, with changes expected by the end of June.Such shifts benefit China on two fronts, according to Levy. They temporarily appease the United States, and they make it look like China is taking steps to become a team player on global trade, he said.At the same time, China remains full speed ahead on its state-directed push to dominate high tech fields from electric cars to 5G wireless technology."The US is not going to change China's approach to technology policy," said Samm Sacks, senior fellow in the Technology Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "They certainly are not going to do it from any unilateral US action."Beijing is also expanding its global clout by investing in ports, rail lines and other development projects through its Belt and Road initiative.These plays for global dominance could position China as a much bigger threat to US hegemony down the road.The Chinese government knows that Trump remains laser focused two big issues: North Korea and the trade deficit.Trump has made clear that he wants a potential summit with North Korea in June to happen, and he wants China to keep pressure on North Korea.Additionally, the president's emphasis on the trade imbalance has allowed China to provide the United States with nominal victories by making commitments to purchase more goods.Even on this, experts are skeptical. Global saving and spending patterns are fairly entrenched, making bilateral trade deficits difficult to manipulate."If your metric is the US deficit on trade with China, the programs that have been unveiled so far are not going to decrease it significantly," said Nicholas Lardy, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and expert on the Chinese economy. "It may prevent it from increasing further."Load-Date: May 23, 2018End of Document

China quietly pulled a propaganda film celebrating its tech giants days after the US sanctioned one of them - and it could be troubling news for HuaweiBusiness Insider USApril 25, 2018 Wednesday 11:21 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 580 wordsByline: feedback@businessinsider.com,  (Tara Francis Chan)Highlight: Days after the US announced a ban on another Chinese company, the government quietly pulled a propaganda film that celebrated local tech companies.BodyWang HE/Getty Images• The US Department of Justice is reportedly investigating the tech company Huawei on accusations of breaching sanctions on Iran.• The investigation, which sources say has been running since 2016, could anger China.• Last week the US slapped restrictions on another Chinese smartphone maker, ZTE, for numerous infractions including breaching Iran sanctions.• But China appears to be just as angry at ZTE as it is at the US, slamming the company in reports and even pulling a much-lauded documentary celebrating the company's innovations.The US Department of Justice is reportedly investigating Huawei Technologies, a move that could jeopardize the company's reputation in China.Since 2016 the Department of Justice has been looking into whether the smartphone supplier breached sanctions by shipping US products to Iran, according to two sources who spoke with Reuters. The probe is reportedly being run out of the US attorney's office in Brooklyn.The news comes less than a week after the Department of Commerce banned American firms from selling products and technology to Chinese smartphone maker ZTE for seven years, in part for breaching sanctions against Iran and North Korea.While the Chinese government was unsurprisingly angered by the US decision - "The move should be regarded as part of the US tactics in its trade friction with China. Targeting technology is like throttling the neck of the Chinese enterprises," an editorial in the state-run China Daily read - it also slammed ZTE, which could set a worrying precedent for Huawei.China's top regulator of state-owned enterprises called ZTE's US interactions "stupid and passive" in a recent report."Many domestic enterprises are paying a terrible price for ZTE's short-sightedness and dishonesty. Our country's diplomatic layout and image will inevitably be affected," it said.But an even bigger indicator of China's anger over the situation could be the mysterious disappearance of its much touted propaganda film "Amazing China."The nationalistic film, produced by the state broadcaster and released nationally, celebrated China's advances in innovation and infrastructure since President Xi Jinping took office five years ago. Students and Communist Party members around the country were instructed to watch the film which glorified the achievements of Chinese companies, including ZTE.But four days after the US announced its ZTE decision last week, a memo was sent to websites hosting the film and some cinemas to take the film down "until further notice.""Please follow the instruction seriously," the leaked memo reportedly said.The instruction appears to have originated from the government's propaganda department, which had hoped the documentary would bring in 1 billion yuan ($158 million) in ticket sales.It hasn't been a good year for Huawei and ZTE in the US. First, intelligence chiefs said they wouldn't recommend citizens use the Chinese phones as they could be a conduit for foreign surveillance, and then large US retailers, including Best Buy, decided to stop stocking Huawei.NOW WATCH: Why Apple makes it so hard to get a new iPhone batterySee Also:• 25 of the most dangerous things science has strongly linked to cancer• 13 cars we can't wait to see at the Beijing Auto Show• Chinese cities wanting peace and quiet are using acoustic cameras to catch honking driversSEE ALSO: Australia's defence department is phasing out Chinese phones after US intelligence issued security warningsLoad-Date: February 11, 2019End of Document

At Intelligence Committee Hearing, Rubio Raises Threat Chinese Telecommunications Firms Pose to U.S. National SecurityTargeted News ServiceMay 15, 2018 Tuesday 7:54 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1096 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe office of Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, issued the following news release:At a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing today to consider the nomination of William R. Evanina to be the Director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center (NCSC) in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) raised the issue of the threat posed by Chinese telecommunications firms like ZTE.Last night, Rubio appeared on Fox News' The Ingraham Angle to discuss this and telecommunications threats to U.S. national security interests. Last week, Rubio delivered remarks on the Senate floor and introduced legislation to protect American workers from China's economic aggression. Rubio also recently wrote an op-ed (https://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=Press-Releases&id=736B5AF3-E5CA-47E9-AD77-21F893C67E5C) on his legislation, outlining how to counter these economic tools of aggression used by Beijing.A video of the exchange is available here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTFNAH7NTWQ&feature=youtu.be). A rough transcript of the exchange is below:VIDEO: AT INTELLIGENCE HEARING, RUBIO DISCUSSES THREAT CHINESE TELECOMMUNICATIONS FIRMS POSE TO U.S. NATIONAL SECURITYRubio: Would you ever use a ZTE phone?Evanina: I would not, senator.Rubio: Would you recommend anyone in any sort of position that is sensitive, whether in commerce or in government or in contracting use a ZTE phone?Evanina: No, I would not.Rubio: So it's not an exaggeration to be - there's some notion out there by some that this is a hysteria. Not just unique to ZTE - but it is a fact, is it not, that China utilizes its telecommunications companies for purposes of espionage even if those companies' leadership may not be open to it, they don't really have a choice but to be cooperative?Evanina: Senator Rubio, we have been on the record in the Intelligence community and law enforcement of that fact.Rubio: There's an addition national security factor at play and that is "Made in China 2025" is an endeavor by the Chinese government to dominate the top fields of the 21st century, many of them in telecommunications, aerospace, biomedicine, etc. If in fact they achieve that, because they're more competitive, because they have better ideas, because they out-innovate us, that's one thing. But that's not how he is pursuing it. How they are pursuing it, is it not, is they are stealing intellectual property, reverse engineering the transfer of intellectual property. There is a strategic aim on the part of the Chinese government to steal the commercial intellectual property of this country in order to advance themselves into a position of dominance in these key fields. Is that not something that is pretty clear?Evanina: That is correct, Senator.Rubio: And that poses a national security threat because our commercial capacity, just like our ship building capacity, is important to military hardware and aerospace, our technological capacity in the private sector. If we lose the high ground and another nation is dominant because they cheated their way into that position. Does that not pose a direct national security threat to the United States?Evanina: It does, Senator. As I mentioned, I believe our economic security is our national security.Rubio: I want to talk about a separate topic that I don't believe has ever been discussed before. Certainly not today. As you know, we live in an environment where false claims even ones that are totally preposterous can easily be spread on social media and often the media, under tremendous pressure to deliver clicks on a website or ratings on their television stations through outrage, are quick to jump on it. I raise that because of the concept of something called Deep Fakes. Are you familiar with that term?Evanina: I'm not, sir.Rubio: A Deep Fake is the ability to manipulate sound images or video to make it appear that a certain person did something that they didn't do. These videos, in fact, are increasingly realistic. The quality of these fakes is rapidly increasing due to artificial intelligence machine learning algorithms are paired with facial mapping software make it easy and cheap to insert someone's face into a video and produce a very realistic-looking video of someone saying or doing something they never said or did. This, by the way, technology is pretty widely available on the internet and people have used it already for all sorts of nefarious purposes at the individual level. I think you can only imagine what a nation-state could do with that technology, particularly to our politics.If we could imagine for a moment, a foreign intelligence agency could use deep fakes to produce a fake video of an American politician using a racial epithet or taking a bribe or anything of that nature. They could use a fake video of a U.S. soldier massacring civilians overseas, they could use a fake video of a U.S. official admitting a secret plan to do some conspiracy theory of some kind, they could use a fake video of a prominent official discussing some sort of impending disaster that could so panic. And imagine a compelling video like this produced on the eve of an election or a few days before a major public policy decision with a culture that's already - has already a kind of a built-in bias towards believing outrageous things, a media quick that is quick to promulgate it and spread it. And, of course, the social media where you can't stop its spread. I believe that this is the next wave of attacks against America and western democracies, is the ability to produce fake videos that are -- can only be determined to be fake after extensive analytical analysis and by then the election is over and millions of Americans have seen an image they want to believe anyway because of their preconceived bias against that individual.You've never heard of that term. But I ask you - is there any work being done anywhere in the U.S. government to begin to confront the threat that could be posed - that will be posed in my view by the ability to produce realistic looking, fake video and audio that could be used to cause all sorts of chaos and in our country?Evanina: Thank you Senator Rubio for that question. The answer is yes. And the intelligence community and federal law enforcement is actively working to not only understand the complexities and capabilities of adversaries but what from a predictive analysis perspective we may face going forward particularly with the election this fall as well as in 2020.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6292452 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: May 16, 2018End of Document

US cuts a deal with Chinese smartphone maker ZTECNN WireJune 7, 2018 Thursday 2:00 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 665 wordsByline: By Daniel ShaneDateline: HONG KONG (CNNMoney) BodyHONG KONG (CNNMoney) --  Chinese smartphone maker ZTE will pay a fine of $1 billion and bring an American monitoring team on board to resolve a high-profile dispute with the United States.The deal, announced by US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, will mean the end of a ban on ZTE buying American parts, provided the state-controlled company sticks to the terms.Ross said the deal was struck at around 6 a.m. ET on Thursday, and it will impose "the most strict compliance that we've ever had on any company, American or foreign." ZTE will also put $400 million in an escrow account. The fate of the company has become a major flashpoint in trade tensions between the United States and China.In April, the US Commerce Department blocked American firms from selling parts or providing services to ZTE, which also makes telecommunications equipment. The crippling ban was put in place after Washington said ZTE violated a 2017 deal in which the Chinese company admitted to evading sanctions on Iran and North Korea."Prior administrations have been real patsies for the Chinese and for other countries. They've never really pushed back," Ross said. "So I think the Chinese are well aware there's a new marshal in town and it's called Donald J. Trump, and he's a very, very good shot."But the deal came under fire from Senator Chuck Schumer, who accused President Trump of shooting "blanks" at China while aiming his trade fire at allies such as Europe and Canada."There is absolutely no good reason that ZTE should get a second chance, and this decision marks a 180-degree turn away from the president's promise to be tough on China," he said in a statement. The new agreement will force ZTE to replace its top management and board, Ross said. The compliance team will report to the company's new chairman, he added. A ZTE spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The $400 million will be forfeited, and the ban reimposed, if ZTE violates the terms during a 10-year probationary period. "I'm very, very happy with this arrangement," Ross said. "It is the strictest and largest fine that has ever been brought by the Commerce Department."ZTE, which employs around 75,000 people worldwide, buys key components from a range of US companies, including chips from Qualcomm and Intel. It said on May 9 that it had halted most of its operations because of the ban.President Donald Trump announced in mid-May that he was working with Chinese President Xi Jinping to give ZTE "a way to get back into business, fast." But his remarks unleashed a backlash in Washington that fueled uncertainty over whether the company would ever get a reprieve.Analysts say the ban is likely to have cost ZTE billions of dollars in lost revenue, tarnished its brand and strained its relationships with customers around the world.ZTE has repeatedly come under the scrutiny of regulators and officials in the United States, which is wary of its ties to the Chinese government. The company's controlling shareholder is Shenzhen Zhongxingxin Telecommunications Equipment, a Chinese state-owned corporation.In 2012, ZTE and Huawei, another huge Chinese tech company, were the subject of a US congressional report that focused on the equipment they make for telecommunications networks.The report said the companies "cannot be trusted to be free of foreign state influence and thus pose a security threat to the United States and to our systems." Both companies strongly disputed the report's findings.China's efforts to boost its high-tech industries are a key source of tension between the two countries.

HOW A CHINESE ACTIVIST USED BLOCKCHAIN TO MAKE A #METOO LETTER UNDELETABLEStates News ServiceApril 27, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 781 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Online activists in China employed "blockchain" technology used to encrypt currencies like Bitcoin to ensure that an open letter asking for answers about a decades-old rape-and-suicide case was undeletable from China's tightly controlled internet.Yue Xin, a final-year student at China's prestigious Peking University, was among eight students who lodged a freedom-of-information request with college authorities on Apr. 9 asking for information on its historical handling of an allegation made 20 years ago against former lecturer Shen Yangthat he raped a student who later committed suicide.Publicly, Peking University issued a statement saying it "attached great importance" to the conduct of its staff, and that the university's ethics committee would review the request.But privately, the university ramped up the pressure on the students, sending Yue home and threatening to prevent her from graduating if she continues to speak out.Tweets, posts and comments were quickly deleted by ruling Chinese Communist Party censors keen to nip what they saw as a nascent student movement in the bud.As Yue was repeatedly called in for "chats" with university staff and forced to delete all mention of her campaign from her personal devices, fellow #MeToo activists turned to blockchain to ensure her message was still visible to China's more than 730 million internet users.But an anonymous user stamped her account of the incident onto the Ethereum blockchain, meaning that it can never be erased or altered.A QR code circulating on Twitter quickly revealed the URL of the letter's location on Friday. The page shows a series of coded data about the user and the transaction, and a text box full of encrypted alphanumeric symbols, which can be converted to normal text by pressing a button marked "Convert To UT8."The button reveals both English and Chinese versions of Yue's Apr. 23 letter detailing her experiences since she raised the 1998 rape allegations made against Shen Yang by former student Gao Yan, and Gao's subsequent suicide.Chinese activists seldom get the opportunity to defeat government censorship in front of the international community, and the use of blockchain offers hope to rights activists and dissidents under the administration of President Xi Jinping that there is still an online space in which their voices may be heard.Social mediaBack on social media, users have also resorted to distorting or flipping screenshots of her letter to bypass object recognition features on social media sites like WeChat, while some protesters have put ink brush to paper and pinned up "big character posters" in a time-honored Chinese tradition of protest.Social media posts have urged students to "protect themselves" from official retaliation by distancing themselves from the #MeToo movement, and from the outcry over the 1998 suicide of Gao Yan, indicating that the Beida Communist Party committee views the movement as a student movement with parallels to the student outrage of the May Fourth movements of the early 20th century.Sulaiman Gu, a Chinese rights activist currently studying chemistry at the University of Georgia in the United States, said some of his friends have used blockchain to protect their online statements, too."Whether we are talking about Bitcoin or Ethereum, these are all non-government, unstructured virtual technologies, and a virtual technology world is naturally anti-institutional," Gu told RFA. "It's close to freedom."But because blockchain provides a viable channel for free speech, Gu expects the Chinese government to start blocking such technologies from users inside the complex system of blocks, filters and human censorship known collectively as the Great Firewall."They can cut off the internet just like that," Gu said. "We have seen this happen when politically sensitive incidents occur and in certain politically sensitive areas, where they often use disconnection as a means [to ensure control].""[When they do that], you can't get anything, not the internet, not mobile phone networks. Nothing," he said.A WeChat group titled "Blockchain Base Camp" saw a post appear soon after Yue's letter appeared on the Ethereum blockchain, which said: "This morning, our small world of blockchain was shaken by a college student surnamed Yue."The story of Gao Yan came to light as the #MeToo sexual harassment and assault violence began to go viral in China, leading to a number of high-profile allegations, many leveled against university lecturers in positions of power over their students.Reported by Jia Ao for RFA's Mandarin Service.

Trump announces tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goodsCNNMoney.comJune 14, 2018 Thursday 2:51 PM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: ECONOMYLength: 804 wordsByline: Pamela BrownBodyPresident Donald Trump is sharply escalating a confrontation with China over trade.The United States will impose a 25% tariff on $50 billion of Chinese exports, the president said early Friday. China vowed to retaliate immediately and said the United States had "launched a trade war."The US penalty is designed to punish China for stealing American technology and trade secrets. It will apply to roughly 1,100 exports and will target the Chinese aerospace, robotics, manufacturing and auto industries.Trade between the two countries "has been very unfair, for a very long time," Trump said in a statement. "This situation is no longer sustainable."US customs agents will begin collecting the duties on July 6, the administration said.The move represents a serious elevation of trade tensions between the world's two largest economies ? just as Trump has also picked fights with allies Canada, Mexico and the European Union over steel and aluminum.Beijing said Friday it will fight back with tariffs of its own. China previously outlined plans to respond with retaliatory tariffs on $50 billion of US products such as cars, planes and soybeans.China also said it would scrap promises to purchase more US goods. Those pledges came during negotiations with US trade officials last month."In this day and age, launching a trade war is not in the interest of the world," China's Commerce Ministry said in a statement. "We call on all countries to act together to firmly stop such an outdated and backward move, and to firmly safeguard the common interest of all mankind."Trump raised the prospect of even further escalation. He said that if China retaliated, the United States would authorize another round of tariffs on Chinese goods. He has previously suggested those tariffs could apply to as much as $100 billion of products.The US tariffs announced Friday will be enacted in two waves. More than 800 exports, about $34 billion worth, will be subject to tariffs starting in July. Another 280 or so still need to undergo a public comment period, and will take effect later.American companies will be allowed to apply for an exemption from the tariff. The administration will outline the exemption process in coming weeks, a senior administration official told reporters.The president gave the green light after a meeting Thursday with top economic officials, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.For months, Trump had slow-walked threats of tariffs against China as punishment for intellectual property theft.He first announced that the United States would impose trade penalties on about $50 billion of Chinese goods in March."We have a tremendous intellectual property theft problem," Trump said at the time. "It's going to make us a much stronger, much richer nation."After China warned it would retaliate, Trump threatened tariffs on a further $100 billion of Chinese products.In mid-May, both sides announced a ceasefire after two rounds of trade negotiations.The countries said in a joint statement that China would "significantly increase" purchases of US agricultural and energy products to reduce the trade imbalance, a top Trump administration demand. Mnuchin subsequently declared the trade war "on hold."Ten days later, the White House abruptly said it would proceed with the tariffs, along with new limits on Chinese investments in the United States.A further round of trade talks in Beijing earlier this month failed to yield any breakthroughs. And the Chinese government warned then it wouldn't honor its pledge to increase purchases of US goods if tariffs were imposed.The Trump administration last week cut a deal with Chinese telecommunications firm ZTE to end a crippling ban that prevented the company from buying American parts. ZTE's fate had become entwined in the trade talks. But the agreement to save the company has faced resistance from lawmakers in Congress, who argue the ban should stay in place because ZTE allegedly poses a security threat.Trump's decision to move forward with tariffs on China follows his recent imposition of steep tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico and the European Union on national security grounds.Those penalties have been met with consternation by world leaders, and led to a fraught G7 meeting with Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom last weekend.After the G7 summit, Trump sent out an angry pair of tweets in which he slammed Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as "very dishonest & weak," and ordered US representatives not to sign a joint communique with the G7 leaders.The European Union and Canada have said they will enact retaliatory tariffs starting in July. Mexico has already retaliated with its own tariffs on US goods.Load-Date: June 16, 2018End of Document

Jim Cramer: Trump Is Betting That China Is a Paper TigerRealMoneyJune 19, 2018 Tuesday 7:01 PM EDTCopyright 2018 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1216 wordsByline: Jim CramerHighlight: Our GLUM Index stocks will be hit hard by this trade war.BodyBoy, does this President ever think China is a paper tiger. Think about it. We import $500 billion from the Chinese. You put tariffs on $400 billion on top of the $50 billion, you are pretty much targeting everything. You are making a bet that the Chinese need us more than we need them.Can it work?Remember there are two variables. There's the pain that we receive in the stock market and the gain we may receive on trade.Here's the issue. If you just looked at the domestic economy, you know it can handle it. We may be, at this very moment, among the strongest economies in the world.But if you look at it from the point of view of the stock market, look out. The GLUM index is going to take a beating. Now we have to decide if individual stocks are.Here are the five that I am most concerned about, including some members of my made up ETF, the  . These are direct China issues -- and they could be the ones that China decides have to stop selling there.First, is Boeing  . I have been saying that if you take China out of the queue, there would be plenty who would jump into it. But the fade can't be bought because no one has believed me when I said they need our planes more than we need them.Second is Caterpillar  . Twenty-one percent of CAT is Asia/Pacific. A sizable portion of that 21%, the part that is growing the fastest, will be hurt. Can't get around it.We don't have a good read on the semiconductors. Their sales often look like they are direct to China. But China is an assembler. So you have companies like Skyworks Solutions SWKS, Micron Technology  and Intel  having about 90%, 77% and 63% Chinese exposure. But they are selling to manufacturers, which then export their products. There is no real replacement. But they always trade down on the first day.China, for example, counts for 65% of Qualcomm's  sales. Qualcomm negotiated hard with the Chinese for those sales. It would be highly unusual for the Chinese to just abrogate. However, I would think that the NXP Semi  deal gets shelved, and that name trades on its own. I could see it trade back to the low $90s and Qualcomm back to the mid $50s, because it doesn't have the diversification it needs away from cellphones without that deal. However, it does do $4 billion in Internet of Things business, now. And I think it is about to solve its Chinese problem. So that's very positive, especially with its 4% yield.We don't have Broadcom  numbers, but what we do have is a buyback that is so voracious that I think this is one that can be bought after 10 a.m. and then again after 3:30 p.m.. If the stock is down more than $10, the brokers who are selling it will nail the close -- so stay away until 3:55 p.m., but be ready to buy tomorrow again before 10 a.m. when the buyback will begin anew.Fifteen percent of United Technologies  is Asia Pacific, mostly Otis Elevator, said to be 600,000 a year and lots of service. Just hurt, period. You sell it on this, you lose the break-up that comes when UTX breaks apart.3M  gets 30% of it sales from Asia, and a lot of its growth from China. I own it for the Charitable Trust -- but it will be an easy knockdown.Kimberly-Clark  and Procter & Gamble  are often considered Chinese plays -- because of diapers for KMB and all sorts of household products from PG. All I can say is dream on. But they get hit anyway. They only wish they had big sales there. Except today. In fact, all the food companies wish they had more sales there. For example, Pepsico  has 13% of its business in Asia. Easily boycotted but to what end?Now some hardcore ones. What if the Chinese government wanted to boycott Apple  ? Foxconn, a big assembler, employs a million people. We don't have numbers on how many would be thrown out of work, but it is considerable. Samsung's the winner and some associated cheap Chinese iterations.There are 3000 Starbucks  in China. A $2 tariff equivalent would crush them. Yum China  is all China. You could boycott that easily. So go long Dunkin' Donuts  or McDonald's  , short Starbucks.General Motors  sold 4 million vehicles in China last year, surpassing U.S. sales. These are jointly made with SAID, but it would put a crimp on sales and would make the $134 price target yesterday look a little ridiculous. But GM's now an autonomous car play.Here are more wildcards: The big department stores, while they can source away from China, invariably half at least a quarter of their private label productsmade there. Costco  and Home Depot  sell a lot of merchandise sourced in China -- and those are very hot stocks that should get cool really fast. It will take a year, but China can lose all textiles. It's just too easy to switch if it is not economic -- and when the factories moved out of this country it took about a year to do so. The manufacturing of a lot of tools, though, and many other things, like toys -- which have already been hit -- will make things more expensive.The dollar stores were not hit on the first tariffs. Now they should be, because they get a preponderance of their cheap, throw away, seasonal goods -- very important for their margins -- from China, even as most of the other stuff is sourced here, because they are brand name staples and it is hard to bring staples in from China. But there is plenty from China in every aisle. I would watch these closely.It's possible that Disney's  movies won't be able to be be shown in China, and there could be a tariff on the theme park, but that's the outer reaches of the equation. Also tangential: Estee Lauder, which has a burgeoning business in China.FedEx  , and to a lesser extent UPS  , have spent a lot of money building up Chinese business. It's nothing for the Chinese to stall either company's planes on the tarmac. I suspect that's a natural.Remember we do about one -fifth the business in China that they do here. There are plenty of companies that expected and hoped to do business with China, including the finance companies that have failed miserably. As I mentioned, FANG gets the money in tech, along with the cloud kings like Salesforce.com  and VMWare  and Workday  and Red Hat  -- the latter reports Thursday. Adobe's  the one to watch there; it was just bouncing back. Keep an eye on Box BOX as it was just breaking out after a weak quarter. Other hot ones to watch Twitter  , Square  , DropBox  . Those three are in the stratosphere.We profiled Zuora  , Zscaler  , Pivotal Software  , DocuSign  and Carbon Black  as the most expensive stocks that have come public. There's an urge to get into them at all cost. So watch them.What shouldn't be hurt at all? Domestic health insurers. Watch UnitedHealth  when it is down four, because it has a huge buyback. Watch Centene  , because it just closed on the Fidelis deal and its stock zoomed 15 points. Might be a natural, if it comes in.Others to watch: Darden Restaurants  , Wendy's  , and Sonic  in food, Ralph Lauren  , Tiffany & Co  and Restoration Hardware  in retail.It's a mess. Today's a mess. Tomorrow, too. And the retaliation day will be the second leg down. However, if China ever bends because the president is right, these "China" stocks will take off so hard, despite other parts of the world being weaker, that you will regret that you didn't buy tomorrow or even later today, if it holds past 2:45 p.m.Load-Date: June 20, 2018End of Document

House Small Business Committee Issues Testimony From George Mason UniversityTargeted News ServiceJune 27, 2018 Wednesday 7:30 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2455 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe House Small Business Committee issued the following testimony by Andy Keiser, visiting fellow at the National Security Institute at George Mason University's Antonin Scalia Law School, at a hearing entitled "ZTE: A Threat to America's Small Businesses":"Thank you Chairman Chabot, Ranking Member Velazquez and distinguished members of the Committee."As someone who spent the first part of my career roaming these halls as a House staffer, it's wonderful to be back home among friends - particularly before a Committee that is taking a sobering, bipartisan look at one of America's greatest long-term national security threats: the threat posed by Zhongxing Telecommunications Equipment Corporation (ZTE) and Huawei to our telecommunications infrastructure."I will start with a story to which I imagine many of you will easily relate. My former boss, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, first became interested in the activities of ZTE and Huawei not because he was a former U.S. Army officer or Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) special agent. Initially, his interest did not even stem from his position on the Intelligence Committee, but because a Michigan company approached him with a problem."As each of you would do, he listened to that small business owner carefully. As it turned out, Chinese telecommunications companies -ZTE and Huawei - were bidding to build cellular telephone towers in the most rural parts of Michigan, far from population centers like Detroit. This small business owner was happy to compete but said the Chinese telecoms were coming in not just under his price, but under what the materials would cost to build the towers."That got a former FBI agent thinking: why on earth would they be doing that? More on this later."As I don't need to remind this room, small business is the lifeblood of the American economy. Small business employs more than half of the U.S. workforce and two out of every three new private-sector jobs created in America are created by small businesses."Small business in America is inherently resilient, creative, and able to adapt quickly to market conditions. One thing small business cannot do effectively, however, is compete against nation-state attacks, aggressive, unrelenting international espionage, and theft of trade secrets. And those are exactly the challenges presented by ZTE and Huawei."For thousands of years, China viewed itself as superior to all other world powers. Following a self-described "century of humiliation" resulting from imperialist incursions from the West and Japan, it now seeks a return to that perch."Under the consolidated leadership of Xi Jinping, newly declared "President for life," China today intends to become a global economic, military and technological leader rivaling or surpassing the United States and it aims to do so in the next 10-15 years. There are troubling indicators: China's gross domestic product is currently on track to surpass that of the United States by 2029. And the Chinese military is rapidly modernizing, directly targeting areas in which the U.S. maintains dominance, including in the cyber domain, space and power projection at sea."When I attended the Shanghai-hosted World's Fair in 2010, China was portrayed as a civilization that led the world for millennia. The storyline went that, now with failing powers like Russia and stagnating powers like the United States and Europe, China will again be called upon to lead the way into the future."Part of China's grand vision includes dominance in fields that have dual economic and military benefit. In 2015, Chinese leaders unveiled the "Made in China 2025" strategic plan. It focuses on the country becoming the world's leader in high-tech fields, squarely within the learned and stolen expertise of ZTE and Huawei."ZTE and Huawei are working fast to put Western vendors out of businesses to secure market dominance. In just seven years, Huawei went from an afterthought with poorly-functioning equipment and only 10 percent market share to having the top position now in the lucrative LTE radio business. Excluding the United States, Huawei enjoys roughly 38 percent of the total market share globally."By investing heavily in research and development, ZTE and Huawei are organically improving their native capacity to innovate, but they also have copied and stolen their way to success. Huawei has admitted to stealing router product secrets from Cisco. The theft was extensive, all the way down to the spelling errors in the manuals. And apparently Huawei stole the design for Apple's iPhone literally down to the last screw."Nonetheless, Huawei has surpassed every telecommunications provider in the Asia Pacific, Europe and in Latin America. Only markets in the United States and Middle East remain competitive due to the concerns raised by vocal U.S. government security leaders in the Administration and Congress. Huawei is now dominant in fixed access, IP routing, and LTE in many markets and is growing shares of these critical businesses in others. Western vendors are still able to compete for certain products and in certain markets, but it is unclear how long that will remain true. Absent U.S. government initiative and continued attention, the only telecommunications infrastructure option available in the world in the not-too-distant future could be a Chinese one."In my view, ZTE and Huawei do not share the motivation of most Western companies. Profit is not the motive. Deploying equipment in rural Michigan and all around the world at or below cost is not being done to make shareholders money; it is being done to harness the ability to collect vast quantities of information and to create leverage against adversaries in a potential conflict. National security thought leaders from both parties - like Senators Marco Rubio and Mark Warner - have brought attention to this threat. If Chinese telecom giants are allowed to infiltrate our telecommunications backbone, in a potential conflict they could incapacitate critical infrastructure - for instance, our electric grid -- bogging us down at home, while impairing our capacity to respond overseas."Chinese companies generally cannot be decoupled from the Chinese state. Resident Scholar Derek Scissors with the American Enterprise Institute has said, "ZTE is a tool of the Chinese state, which is controlled by the party." Indeed, under Chinese law, all Chinese companies, including Huawei and ZTE, are required to fully cooperate with Chinese law enforcement and intelligence services."If there was any question about Chinese government support to ZTE and Huawei, consider that ZTE is currently working to secure an $11 billion financing package from the Bank of China and the China Development Bank. This was done after losing nearly half of its' value following the issuance of the U.S. Commerce Department's denial order forbidding their acquisition of U.S. components. It is fair to say that no Western supplier would be able to secure that level of state-sponsored cash infusion under such circumstances."ZTE and Huawei have developed dubious reputations around the world. In the past 12 years alone, ZTE and/or Huawei entities have been investigated or found guilty of corruption in Kyrgyzstan, Uganda, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Gabon, Zimbabwe, Nigeria, the Philippines, Gambia, Ghana, Algeria, Malaysia, Norway, Zambia, Singapore, South Sudan, South Africa, Papua New Guinea, Mongolia, the Solomon Islands and even in China itself."The Arab spring led despots and dictators around the world to look to prevent a similar fate to that of Muammar Gaddafi being dragged through the streets. Andrew Rizzardi from Freedom House says the Chinese - i.e. ZTE and Huawei - own the "authoritarian telecommunications hardware store." ZTE and Huawei technologies are being used to suppress dissent in nearly all African countries. In recent years, advanced monitoring technology has been sold to Zambia, Ethiopia, Iran, Pakistan, and Venezuela by ZTE or Huawei. Authoritarianism is now officially a key Chinese export."The most comprehensive review to date of the threat generated by ZTE and Huawei was conducted right here by the United States Congress in a bipartisan way - specifically, in 2012 by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI). I was Chief of Staff to Committee Chairman Mike Rogers at the time and the report was fully supported by Ranking Member Dutch Ruppersberger. Many of its findings still hold true today."The 2012 HPSCI report stated that: "the risks associated with Huawei's and ZTE's provision of equipment to U.S. critical infrastructure could undermine core U.S. national security interests.""Most relevant to today's hearing, the report also found that: "private-sector entities in the United States are strongly encouraged to consider the long-term security risks associated with doing business with either ZTE or Huawei for equipment or services.""As background, ZTE has its origins in the Chinese Ministry of Aerospace and the government-run 691 factory, which is a now part of a state-owned research institution. According to the HPSCI report, the Zhongxinxin group, owned in part by two state-owned enterprises, has a controlling interest in ZTE."Internal Chinese Communist Party committees are also embedded within Huawei and ZTE. As of 2012, ZTE had Communist Party Committee members on its Board of Directors and serving as key shareholders."During the HPSCI investigation, ZTE repeatedly argued that it could not provide internal documentation or fully answer the Committee's questions for fear that it would be in violation of China's state secrets law and could be subject to criminal prosecution in China. In my view, this lack of response proves the point of concern."The founder of Huawei, Ren Zhengfei, was a director of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Information Engineering Academy, which is associated with 3PLA, China's signals intelligence division and the country's version of the National Security Agency. Ren also retains veto power over the company's decisions."According to the HPSCI report: "Huawei operates in what Beijing explicitly refers to as one of seven "strategic sectors." Those are considered as core to the national and security interests of the state. In these sectors, the Chinese Communist Party ensures that "national champions" dominate through a combination of market protectionism, cheap loans, tax and subsidy programs and diplomatic support in the case of offshore markets.""A separate, major U.S. investigation into ZTE began in 2012 after Reuters reported on the firm's business dealings with Iran. The Department of Justice found that ZTE conspired to evade Iran sanctions to secure contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars by installing telecom equipment that required U.S. components, which was in direct violation of U.S. export controls."ZTE admitted committing 380 violations and engaged in an elaborate scheme to prevent disclosure to the U.S. government, including forming a group to destroy, remove and sanitize all evidence relating to its dealings with Iran."After failing to comply with the terms of the settlement, the U.S. Department of Commerce issued an April 15, 2018 denial order stating that ZTE demonstrated "a pattern of deception, false statements, and repeated violations.""The denial order forbidding ZTE from acquiring U.S. components went on to state that: "ZTE agreed to a record-high combined civil and criminal penalty of $1.9 billion, after engaging in a multi-year conspiracy to violate the U.S. trade embargo against Iran to obtain contracts to supply, build, operate and maintain telecommunications networks in Iran using U.S.-origin equipment, and also illegally shipping telecommunications equipment to North Korea.""Also, in April, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai circulated a proposal to ban Huawei and ZTE from receiving government funds that subsidize low-income Americans' access to phone and internet service."In a statement, Chairman Pai wrote that: "Hidden 'back doors' to our networks in routers, switches--and virtually any other type of telecommunications equipment--can provide an avenue for hostile governments to inject viruses, launch denial-of-service attacks, steal data, and more.""In a 92-page submission responding to the FCC, Huawei attempted to equate PLA-founded Chinese telecommunications companies with U.S. companies who have a manufacturing presence in China. This is a ludicrous comparison as the U.S. companies are there due to requirements of doing business in China, not out of any allegiance to the Chinese government. The response, carefully written by American lawyers at two leading Washington, DC law firms, parses language from the Directors of the FBI and the National Security Agency in an effort to minimize the threat. It also attributes numerous Constitutional rights afforded to Huawei's U.S. subsidiary. I doubt that the founding fathers of the United States intended to protect the rights of companies controlled by our adversaries seeking to compromise core national security interests."In response to the ongoing and known security threats by these two companies, last month the Department of Defense ordered all ZTE and Huawei equipment to be removed from military installations."ZTE and Huawei have the capability, clout, motive and growth strategy to pose a continuing national security threat to the United States - one that directly harms American small business. Surely in part due to your steady work in this committee raising the profile of the issue, Congress has become convinced of this in a bipartisan way."The legislative House and Senate activity occurring around the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act could provide a long-term solution to the threat posed to the U.S. by reinstating the Commerce Department's denial order forbidding ZTE from using U.S. components, perhaps except for providing common-sense security patching and upgrades. This would be a severe blow to ZTE and would be a critical win for the United States of America's national security posture as we confront a rising China threatening our interests around the globe."Chairman Rogers and Congressman Ruppersberger again teamed up to pen an Op-ed earlier this year in the Wall Street Journal which called the threat from ZTE "a clear and present danger to U.S. national security." I agree completely and encourage this body to respond accordingly."Chairman Chabot and Ranking Member Velasquez, thank you so much for convening this hearing and raising these important issues. I look forward to your questions."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6350221 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: June 28, 2018End of Document

HRW: 'Men only' job ads show ongoing discrimination in ChinaAssociated Press Financial WireApril 23, 2018 Monday 10:32 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 896 wordsByline: By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN, Associated PressDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - One job ad for Chinese high-speed train conductors called for candidates who were "fashionable and beautiful." Another ad targeting men for a job in a Chinese internet company included photos of a female employee pole-dancing.Gender discrimination is widespread in the Chinese workforce, a human rights group said Monday, with many hiring advertisements openly calling only for male applicants and using the attractiveness of female co-workers as a draw.Human Rights Watch released its report, "Only Men Need Apply: Gender Discrimination in Job Advertisements in China" after looking at more than 36,000 job advertisements posted between 2013 and 2018 from recruiters, companies and the government."Sexist job ads pander to the antiquated stereotypes that persist within Chinese companies," Sophie Richardson, Human Rights Watch's China director, said in a statement. "These companies pride themselves on being forces of modernity and progress, yet they fall back on such (old-fashioned) recruitment strategies."China bans discrimination in both hiring and job advertising, but enforcement is weak. Government departments are among the offenders, according to the report, with 55 percent of jobs advertised by the Ministry of Public Security last year specifying "men only." The ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Discriminatory hiring practices further widen gaps in both female work participation and pay levels, according to official data, with urban female workers making just 67 percent of what men made in 2010, down from 78 percent in 1990 - a time when the government was loosening control over the economy.It's also a reflection of "deeply discriminatory views about women," the report said, including that they are less capable than men, or that they are not fully committed to their jobs because some will eventually leave their positions to have a family.In examining the tech sector, the report pointed to numerous cases where the attractiveness and availability of female workers is used as an inducement for men to apply for jobs.In one case, online shopping giant Alibaba ran an ad on its official microblog in 2013 enumerating the attributes of its female workers, accompanied by photos of female employees "in sexualized poses, including one engaged in pole dancing," the report said.Alibaba did not immediately respond to requests for comment.An October 2016 article on the official microblog recruitment account of tech company Tencent was even blunter, quoting a male employee as saying, "The reason I joined Tencent originated from a primal impulse. It was mainly because the ladies at human resources and that interviewed me were very pretty."Tencent apologized, saying the company values diverse backgrounds and recruits staff based on talent and ability. "These incidents clearly do not reflect our values," the tech giant said in an email. "We have investigated these incidents and are making immediate changes. We are sorry they occurred and we will take swift action to ensure they do not happen again."Despite laws against it, demands are frequently made for physical attributes that have nothing to do with the requirements of the job, another form of sexual objectification. Those can include minimums and maximums for height and weight, "normal facial features" and particular sounding voices.One notable ad in northern China even called for "fashionable and beautiful high-speed train conductors," the report said.The report also cited a 2014 study by the official All-China Women's Federation in which 87 percent of female college graduates said they had faced at least one form of gender discrimination when applying for jobs.The sexism ranged from job ads stating "men only or men preferred," ''rejecting or refusing to review female applicants' resumes" and "having higher requirements for educational attainment from female applicants," according to the federation's data.In some instances, preference is shown for men in the civil service and among kindergarten and elementary school teachers to offset the large percentage of women in those fields, the report said.It quoted one unidentified kindergarten principal as saying, "The lack of males makes children prone to look at and solve problems according to the way women think and behave."Beyond overcoming such attitudes, change is impeded by a lack of determination and enforcement mechanisms, along with obstacles linked to China's authoritarian politics, the report said."Instead of harassing and jailing women's rights activists, the Chinese government should engage them as allies in combating gender discrimination in the job market - and beyond," Richardson said.Gender discrimination is also reflected in the overwhelmingly masculine nature of China's political bodies, said Li Yinhe, a sociologist at the official Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Among the diplomatic corps, women can be excluded because duty in certain countries could be considered too dangerous for women, she said."There is no small number of Chinese women entrepreneurs who are among the world's richest, but it's far worse in the political field," Li said. "I think it's because women are latecomers, so the political resources are in the hands of men and it's a male-dominated society."___Associated Press researcher Shanshan Wang contributed to this report.Load-Date: April 24, 2018End of Document

HOW CHINA IS CLEANING UP ITS AIR POLLUTION FASTER THAN THE POST-INDUSTRIAL UKStates News ServiceMay 17, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 941 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF):By Thomas StoerkBeijing has seen some of the lowest air pollution levels in recent history this past winter, just as China's Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) now strengthened and renamed to Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) has put the final touches on a new, three-year plan to improve air quality. But while the trend is positive, air pollution levels in China are still dire: The MEP calculates an annual average PM2.5 concentration of 43 g/m3 for China's cities in 2017, more than 4 times the level of 10 g/m3 recommended by the WHO. Official measurements for Beijing even showed the capital's air quality at 58 g/m3Still, China is cleaning up its air faster than the United Kingdom did after its Industrial Revolution. Despite this early success, however, China could spark even more efficient improvements by adopting market-based incentives.Let's take a look at how both countries fared immediately after each of their industrial booms.Figure notes: The figure shows annual average concentrations of total suspended particles (TSP), a coarse and now outdated measure of air pollution. The black line shows the average for China, while the grey line shows London. Data sources: TSP concentrations for China through 2003 are based on the China Energy Databook 9.0 based on data provided by State Environmental Protection Administration. From 2004 on, TSP concentrations for China are based on author-collected air pollution index (API) data from the MEP datacenter. I imputed PM10 concentrations based on information on the main pollutant on a given day and the assumption that an API reading below 51 reflects PM10 (see Stoerk 2016 for explanations on the procedure). I then converted the PM10 concentrations into TSP using a conversion factor of 2 following Matus et al. 2012. TSP concentrations for London come from Fouquet 2011, who generously shared his dataset.Air quality in London is far from perfect, but it's also come a long way from the days when people died in the "Great Smog." The graphic above brings together the earliest known air pollution data from China, from 1980 to 2012, and from the UK from the Industrial Revolution until 2008. Air pollution levels in the main Chinese cities at the beginning of the 1980s were almost exactly at the level of London at the height of the Industrial Revolution in 1890 (a shocking outlier is Hohhot, the capital of Inner Mongolia, which reached a concentration of Total Suspended Particles of 1,501 g/m3 in 1987, possibly the highest level of urban air pollution in recorded history).The difference is in the speed of improvements: Air pollution in China has been decreasing at a similar trajectory as London's 90 years earlier, but at twice the pace. While extreme air pollution levels in China's recent history are typical for an industrializing economy, its pace in cleaning up the pollution is fast by historical standards.China started to seriously control air pollution from 2006 to 2010 by limiting emissions for each province. Relying on satellite data, my research shows that this first attempt was ultimately successful in reducing nationwide SO2 emissions by over 10 percent relative to 2005. Studying compliance over time, however, suggests that reductions in air pollution only happened after the Chinese government created the MEP in 2008. After its creation, among the many changes in environmental policy, the MEP started to gather reliable SO2 emissions data from continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS) at the prefecture level and increased the number of enforcement officials by 17 percent (a task that EDF China actively supported).This early success notwithstanding, China could do better by implementing well-designed market-based solutions, policies that align with the country's ambition to combine economic prosperity and environmental protection. Or, in the words of President Xi, to combine 'green mountains and gold mountains'.For example, a well-designed cap-and-trade program at the province level could have decreased the cost of air pollution abatement from 2006 to 2010 by 25% according to my research. The anticipated launch of a sectoral emissions trading system to limit a portion of China's greenhouse gas emissions suggests that the Chinese government is looking to embrace lessons learned in air pollution control and wishes to build on its own pilot market-based pollution control programs to bring its environmental policy into the 21st century.EDF is playing a key role in helping this endeavor through both hands-on policy work and research. The timing is serendipitous: China is at a cross-roads in environmental policy. Evidence based policy making is welcome. And data quality has improved in recent years. Given the right set of policies, countries can control air pollution, and improvements in air quality typically go hand in hand with economic prosperity.Both China and London have remaining challenges. Despite dramatic improvements, Londoners, like the Chinese, still live with significant air pollution. A recent report on London's air pollution found the city is not close to meeting WHO standards. Meeting them will be a challenge, in part because of the complexity of the causes (road transport accounts for over half of local contributions). So just as London must keep battling to improve air quality, Beijing will need to do likewisebut at least now each can now learn from the other.This entry was posted in air pollution, china, International.

CHINA: FREE ANTI-CENSORSHIP ACTIVISTStates News ServiceApril 2, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 671 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:Zhen Jianghua Held Incommunicado, Denied Access to LawyerThe Chinese government should immediately and unconditionally release human rights activist Zhen Jianghua, who has been held incommunicado since September 2017, Human Rights Watch said today. On March 30, 2018, Chinese police formally arrested Zhen on charges of inciting subversion, but continue to deny Zhen access to legal counsel and family members, citing "national security" concerns.Zhen, 32, is the executive director of the Human Rights Campaign in China, or Quanli Yundong (aˆ,a ), an online platform that publishes information related to detentions of activists, police abuses, and other human rights violations. Zhen is also the founder of ATGFW.org, a website that provides information and services to help people scale China's Great Firewall to access the uncensored global internet."By formally arresting Zhen, Chinese authorities are demonstrating their intent to eradicate human rights monitoring in China," said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. "The case against Zhen is an attack on all rights reporting."On September 1, 2017, police in Zhuhai, Guangdong province, took Zhen from his home, accusing him of "inciting subversion of state power." Zhen was later placed under "residential surveillance at a designated location," a form of secret incommunicado detention that enables the police to hold individuals outside of the formal detention system for up to six months without access to legal counsel or family members. There have been numerous reports of detainees being tortured while under "residential surveillance."For more than seven months Zhen Jianghua has been detained for exercising his right to free speech and put at grave risk of torture.Sophie RichardsonChina DirectorZhen is a former computer programmer who has been involved in human rights activism since the mid-2000s. As a social worker, he assisted women who suffered domestic violence in Zhuhai and people with autism in Macau. He helped victims of human rights abuses use the internet to promote their cases and taught university students about methods of circumventing internet censorship.After becoming executive director of Human Rights Campaign in China in 2015, Zhen focused on helping spread news about government crackdowns on human rights activists, and building a support network to advocate for their releases. During the "709 crackdown," in which authorities rounded up hundreds of human rights lawyers and activists, Zhen mobilized support for the detained lawyers and activists and their families. Over the past decade, authorities have harassed, intimidated, forcibly evicted, and briefly detained Zhen.Since 2016, the Chinese government has tried to eliminate the country's few independent human rights news platforms by jailing their founders and key members. In November 2016, authorities detained Liu Feiyue, founder of the Hubei-based grassroots rights monitoring organization Civil Rights and Livelihood Watch, or Minsheng Guancha (ac[deg]'c"Ÿe ,a¯Ÿ). Liu, charged with "inciting subversion of state power," is awaiting trial. Huang Qi, a veteran activist and founder of the human rights website 64 Tianwang (64a') has also been detained since November 2016 for "illegally leaking state secrets abroad." Huang suffers from several health conditions including kidney disease and has been denied adequate medical care since his detention.Both Liu and Huang's colleagues at Minsheng Guancha and 64 Tianwang have also been detained. In August 2017, a Yunnan court sentenced citizen journalist and protest chronicler Lu Yuyu, who had been detained since June 2016, to four years in prison on charges of "picking quarrels and provoking trouble.""For more than seven months Zhen Jianghua has been detained for exercising his right to free speech and put at grave risk of torture," Richardson said. "The Chinese authorities need to right these wrongs and release Zhen immediately."Load-Date: April 3, 2018End of Document

National security panel drops objections to Chinese firm's purchase of American insurerCNNMoney.comJune 10, 2018 Sunday 6:22 PM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: COMPANY NEWSLength: 440 wordsByline: Jackie WattlesBodyA large Chinese conglomerate is moving ahead with plans to acquire an American insurance company after a government panel that vets foreign deals for national security concerns dropped its objections.China Oceanwide and US insurer Genworth Financial said in a joint statement Saturday that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) ? which vets deals that could give foreign companies control over US firms ? "concluded that there are no unresolved national security concerns with respect to the proposed transaction."The deal still needs approval from Chinese, US and international regulators.Oceanwide chairman LU Zhiqiang said in a statement that the CFIUS decision to not block the deal marks a "major step in our efforts to complete this transaction, which will strengthen Genworth's financial position and allow us to bring Genworth's insurance expertise to China."CFIUS is a secretive multi-agency federal task force chaired by the Treasury secretary.A spokeswoman for Genworth confirmed the deal was held up by CFIUS for months. But a "mitigation agreement" that requires Genworth to use "a U.S.-based, third-party service provider to manage and protect the personal data of Genworth's U.S. policyholders" won the panel over, the spokeswoman told CNNMoney.The decision from CFIUS on the Oceanside-Genworth merger comes after a record number of Chinese deals were delayed or abandoned in 2017 because the group blocked them, according to a January report by Rhodium Group, a New York-based research firm.In January, MoneyGram called off its merger with Chinese financial services giant Ant Financial, citing objections from CFIUS. Lawmakers had raised concerns about the Chinese government gaining access to financial information about US citizens and stock markets.According to Rhodium Group, CFIUS "seems to have broadened its approach for reviewing Chinese deals," and is taking state efforts to obtain certain technologies and data protection concerns into greater account.The denials indicate the US government increasingly views certain foreign investment deals as potential security threats. And the United States recently identified China as one of the biggest concerns.Deals that involve certain tech products, like semiconductors, and those that involve Chinese investors appear to receive the most scrutiny.Earlier this year, President Donald Trump shut down a $117 billion deal between Broadcom, which is incorporated in Singapore, and US-based Qualcomm. The deal would have combined two computer chip makers, and a major concern was whether the merger would slow development of 5G technology stateside.Load-Date: June 11, 2018End of Document

China: Hold the cyber security 'key' in its own handsPR NewswireApril 24, 2018 Tuesday 9:00 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 820 wordsDateline: BEIJING, April 24, 2018 BodyA news report by China.org.cn on the U.S. ban on sales of components to ZTE, China's second largest telecom equipment maker: Facebook's recent data leak scandal has caused a huge public outcry. Data analysis company Cambridge Analytica accessed information from at least 87 million Facebook users without their knowledge. The leaked data was allegedly used to predict and influence the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election. While the Facebook scandal was still unfolding, the U.S. Commerce Department imposed a seven-year ban on sales of components to ZTE, China's second largest telecom equipment maker, on April 16.The sales ban is yet another action taken by Washington amid rising trade tensions with China. Its goal is to slow China's development in the information industry. It looks like a trade measure but it's actually a political one. The United States boasts the most advanced internet technologies in the world. Home to many big monopolies, it possesses many core information technologies. As a result, it's self-confident and capable enough to use the technologies for commercial benefits, impede the development of other countries, and even threaten their national security. In the Information Era, a few clicks on a keyboard can result in a widespread regional power outage. If key computer systems in the financial, energy, power, telecommunication, transportation or other crucial industries were invaded, the consequences would be disastrous. The surveillance program "Prism" disclosed by Edward Snowden only showed us the tip of the iceberg. In the future, the internet will inevitably play a bigger and bigger role in national security.      Since China was first connected to the internet in 1994, the internet has rapidly developed in the country over the past 20 years and, in particular, many new technologies and achievements in recent years have been remarkable. However, there remains a large gap in terms of core technologies, which is the reason why China has been regularly emphasizing its own control over its internet security and information development. At a national conference on the work of cyber security and information held from April 20 to 21, Chinese President Xi Jinping stressed the importance of innovation and called for building the country's strength in cyberspace.The U.S. sanctions on ZTE are no doubt an alarm for China.The design and production of chips require many steps that need to be improved upon and cannot be fulfilled with a single stroke. Nor can core technologies of the internet be developed in a single day. However, an old Chinese expression says like one can have the courage to mend one's ways and strive to make new progress with the awareness of shame. For China, the most terrible thing is not the challenges, but the failure to realize the advent of the challenges. As the Chinese government continues to open up to the outside world and work with other countries to promote economic growth, it is also important for China to hold the key to cyber security in its own hands.China Mosaic http://www.china.org.cn/video/node_7230027.htmChina: Hold the cyber security 'key' in its own handshttp://www.china.org.cn/video/2018-04/24/content_50957558.htmAbout China.org.cnFounded in 2000, China Internet Information Center (China.org.cn/China.com.cn) is a key state news website under the auspices of the State Council Information Office, and is managed by China International Publishing Group.

Industry Voices—Madden: China's 5G ramp-up will start soon, and it will be hugeFierceWirelessJune 27, 2018Copyright 2018 Questex Media Group LLC All Rights ReservedSection: ARTICLELength: 495 wordsByline: Joe MaddenBodyThe Chinese government has not made any official announcements yet with regard to spectrum and 5G ramp-up plans, but the big network vendors are starting to pump up the tires on the supply chain. Our checks with semiconductor and component vendors confirm that the 5G ramp-up in China is expected soon, and it will be bigger than anyone expected.In particular, we have heard from at least 10 different suppliers that the China 5G ramp-up is now expected to start in early 2019, not in July 2019 as previously scheduled. In addition, the numbers could become huge by the end of 2019, with deployment of enough 5G base stations to cover Germany during the month of December.This is a very odd situation. In my 2G, 3G, and 4G experience, I've never seen an OEM pushing a forecast so hard, before the mobile operators even have their spectrum lined up. They're asking vendors to triple production capacity for specific components, so this is not a meaningless exercise.If the ramp-up is only six months away, this one will break all speed records. They are pumping up the tires to be ready, but will there be any gas in the tank?The dominoes will need to start falling in rapid succession now. Some key questions need official confirmation, and then the practical issues of the ramp-up will become critical:We've investigated these issues and we have satisfactory answers for most of them. Handsets will be ready. Massive MIMO will be, well, massive. And we've identified the main component areas that will need a doubling or tripling in manufacturing capacity.The bottom line: We believe that China's government is in a hurry to prove something to Mr. Trump. They will be pushing hard to get base stations onto rooftops as quickly as possible, whether they are optimized or not. If you ask me, they consider this 5G network essential to the trade negotiations. In other words, they need to flex this particular muscle.Don't bet against this one. Suppliers need to be ready by January to run at full speed.Joe Madden is principal analyst at Mobile Experts, a network of market and technology experts that analyze wireless markets.

The shocking viral reaction to a prom dressCNN WireMay 2, 2018 Wednesday 8:45 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1004 wordsByline: By Jeff YangDateline: (CNN) BodyEditor's note: Jeff Yang is a frequent contributor to CNN Opinion, a featured writer for Quartz and other publications and co-host of the podcast, "They Call Us Bruce." He co-wrote Jackie Chan's best-selling autobiography, "I Am Jackie Chan," and is the editor of three graphic novels, "Secret Identities," "Shattered" and the forthcoming "New Frontiers." The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. (CNN) --  Prom dresses are designed to get reactions, and the history of social media is littered with viral prom outfits -- dresses made out of unusual materials, dresses that send statements and dresses that are, well, regrettable, to say the least. But the viral reaction 18-year-old Keziah Daum has sparked with her prom dress is shocking, in no small part because of its disproportionate intensity. Her decision to wear a Chinese outfit called (depending on your dialect) a qipao or a cheongsam to prom in Utah, despite having no Chinese ancestry -- and then tweeting pictures of her posing with friends at prom -- has launched a social media debate around cultural appropriation that's generated hundreds of thousands of posts and comments, many of them outraged, and some of them outrageous. As she said to Buzzfeed, "I never imagined a simple rite of passage such as a prom would cause a discussion reaching many parts of the world," Daum said. "Perhaps it is an important discussion we need to have." She's right on that point: Cultural appropriation is a real and serious concern that's deeply intertwined with issues like colonialism, labor theft, racial privilege and ethnic stereotyping. Dismissal of the phenomenon is often simply a knee-jerk reaction by those seeking to assail what they see as "political correctness." But as always with these discussions, it pays to consider context before opening fire. Is it inherently appropriative for a non-Chinese person to wear Chinese-style apparel? The answer is: It depends.Is the person wearing it as part of an attempt at racial aping, mockery or stereotyping (see: every Halloween ever)? Is the clothing itself an inappropriate variation of attire that's worn for culturally essentialist or religious purposes (example: conical peasant hats or anything with the Buddha stamped on it)? Is the outfit being worn to an event whose theme uses Asian aesthetics in the service of white establishment privilege (e.g., so many museum galas)? And what, for that matter, are the actual origins of the garment in question?Because the qipao, especially in its contemporary form, is far from a "traditional" Chinese outfit. In fact, it historically wasn't "female" clothing at all --- or even "Chinese." The outfit that became the qipao, the sijigiyan, was the traditional ethnic clothing of the Manchu, who took over China in 1644 and established their own Qing Dynasty as its rulers. In the process, they mandated that all adult Chinese men in service of the throne wear Manchu garb -- turning the loose-fitting straight-line sijigiyan, known in Mandarin Chinese as the changpao, into both a symbol of elite status and a stamp of absolute Manchu domination.Eventually, the practice of wearing changpao became common even among non-Manchurian Chinese men who weren't part of the government. But non-Manchurian Chinese women continued to wear typical Chinese outfits -- usually blouses and long skirts under loose coats or jackets -- until the Qing Dynasty fell in 1911. At that time, under the newly founded Republic of China, Chinese feminists called for women to end the practice of footbinding, cut their hair short and began wearing changpao as a means of asserting their equality with men. By the 1930s, in colonial Shanghai and Hong Kong, the traditional Manchu male outfit had become feminized and stylized: The long gown was cut short and shaped to fit women's curves, elaborately printed or embroidered and turned into the dress commonly referred to as the qipao.

The shocking viral reaction to a prom dressCNN.comMay 1, 2018 Tuesday 9:52 PM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: OPINIONSLength: 918 wordsByline: By Jeff YangBodyProm dresses are designed to get reactions, and the history of social media is littered with viral prom outfits -- dresses made out of unusual materials, dresses that send statements and dresses that are, well, regrettable, to say the least.But the viral reaction 18-year-old Keziah Daum has sparked with her prom dress is shocking, in no small part because of its disproportionate intensity. Her decision to wear a Chinese outfit called (depending on your dialect) a qipao or a cheongsam to prom in Utah, despite having no Chinese ancestry -- and then tweeting pictures of her posing with friends at prom -- has launched a social media debate around cultural appropriation that's generated hundreds of thousands of posts and comments, many of them outraged, and some of them outrageous.As she said to Buzzfeed, "I never imagined a simple rite of passage such as a prom would cause a discussion reaching many parts of the world," Daum said. "Perhaps it is an important discussion we need to have."She's right on that point: Cultural appropriation is a real and serious concern that's deeply intertwined with issues like colonialism, labor theft, racial privilege and ethnic stereotyping. Dismissal of the phenomenon is often simply a knee-jerk reaction by those seeking to assail what they see as "political correctness."But as always with these discussions, it pays to consider context before opening fire.Is it inherently appropriative for a non-Chinese person to wear Chinese-style apparel? The answer is: It depends.Is the person wearing it as part of an attempt at racial aping, mockery or stereotyping (see: every Halloween ever)? Is the clothing itself an inappropriate variation of attire that's worn for culturally essentialist or religious purposes (example: conical peasant hats or anything with the Buddha stamped on it)? Is the outfit being worn to an event whose theme uses Asian aesthetics in the service of white establishment privilege (e.g., so many museum galas)?And what, for that matter, are the actual origins of the garment in question?Because the qipao, especially in its contemporary form, is far from a "traditional" Chinese outfit. In fact, it historically wasn't "female" clothing at all ? or even "Chinese."The outfit that became the qipao, the sijigiyan, was the traditional ethnic clothing of the Manchu, who took over China in 1644 and established their own Qing Dynasty as its rulers. In the process, they mandated that all adult Chinese men in service of the throne wear Manchu garb -- turning the loose-fitting straight-line sijigiyan, known in Mandarin Chinese as the changpao, into both a symbol of elite status and a stamp of absolute Manchu domination.Eventually, the practice of wearing changpao became common even among non-Manchurian Chinese men who weren't part of the government. But non-Manchurian Chinese women continued to wear typical Chinese outfits -- usually blouses and long skirts under loose coats or jackets -- until the Qing Dynasty fell in 1911.At that time, under the newly founded Republic of China, Chinese feminists called for women to end the practice of footbinding, cut their hair short and began wearing changpao as a means of asserting their equality with men.By the 1930s, in colonial Shanghai and Hong Kong, the traditional Manchu male outfit had become feminized and stylized: The long gown was cut short and shaped to fit women's curves, elaborately printed or embroidered and turned into the dress commonly referred to as the qipao. Today, Chinese women who aren't restaurant staff or flight attendants do not wear the modern version of the qipao -- skin-tight, with a revealing leg slit and a hemline above the knee -- for anything other than weddings and gala events.Which brings us back to Keziah Daum's decision to wear a qipao to her prom. She clearly didn't consider the full implications of her decision to not just wear the dress, but to post pictures of herself doing so on social media without explanation. And her comments to the press make it apparent that she hasn't fully reflected on the way that wearing outfits or hairstyles associated with other cultures is itself an expression of privilege.But in all fairness, her critics may actually be less knowledgeable about the dress than she is -- after all, Daum has referenced the qipao's association with female empowerment as one of the reasons she chose to wear it.More importantly, those who have chosen to conduct a social-media pile-on of Daum rather than engage her in civil conversation forget that she's a teenager -- one whose interest in other cultures could easily be turned into respect, mutual exchange and positive engagement.(Though the cultural context of Asians who live in a majority-Asian societies, versus Asian Americans who live as minorities in the US, is quite different, it's worth noting that Chinese in China have largely stepped up to defend Daum's wearing of the dress as a valid homage and celebration.)Yes, cultural appropriation is something we need to discuss.

Trump amps up China trade war with tariffs on high-tech importsPolitico.comJune 15, 2018 Friday 2:02 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 1066 wordsByline: mcassella@politico.com,  (Megan Cassella)BodyPresident Donald Trump took another aggressive step in his trade war with China on Friday, announcing that 25 percent tariffs will start taking effect in July on Chinese technology imports.The penalties on $50 billion in goods - primarily targeting products containing "industrially significant technologies," like aerospace, robotics and automobiles - drew a swift rebuke from the Chinese government. Beijing promised that retaliation in equal measure against U.S. goods would take effect on the same day the U.S. duties kick in and called for other nations to take part."We call on all countries to take joint actions, resolutely put an end to this outdated and regressive behavior and firmly defend the common interests of humankind," the Chinese commerce ministry said, according to a translated statement.The White House said the tariffs, the first of which are set to begin on July 6, are aimed at cracking down on Chinese policies that force U.S. companies to hand over valuable technology and data to operate in the Chinese market. But the move also marks a significant escalation of tensions between the world's two largest economies and threatens to derail ongoing talks between the two countries, including plans for Beijing to purchase more U.S. agricultural and energy products.The Chinese commerce ministry on Friday declared invalid any previous trade agreements reached during negotiations.Trump said Friday that while Chinese President Xi Jinping is his "friend," the actions were necessary to "straighten out" the U.S.-China trade relationship and protect U.S. intellectual property and technology industries."We're going to protect those secrets," he said on "Fox and Friends." "You know those are the crown jewels of our country. ... We have the great brain power right in this country."The new penalties will fall on more than 800 products worth roughly $34 billion on sectors including industrial machinery and information and communications technology, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said in a separate statement Friday. That list includes industrial products but avoided commonly purchased goods, like cellphones and televisions, in what USTR said was an effort to minimize direct effects on U.S. consumers.The administration also highlighted an additional 284 products worth roughly $16 billion that were not on an original list of items proposed for tariffs, which was released in April. Those new items will have to undergo a public comment and review process before facing tariffs.The U.S. also said it will pursue additional duties if China engages in retaliatory measures.Beijing made clear that it will retaliate dollar-for-dollar against the United States as soon as tariffs take effect. To that end, nearly 550 U.S. exports to China, totaling $34 billion, will be hit with 25 percent tariffs on July 6, the Chinese Ministry of Finance said in a statement released on Friday afternoon, East Coast time - or early Saturday morning in Beijing. Those products will come primarily from the agricultural, automobile and aquatic industries, the statement said.It also compiled its own $16 billion list of 114 products - including chemicals, energy and medical equipment - that will be imposed at a later date, likely after Trump makes a final decision to move forward on the second set of U.S duties.U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer characterized the move Friday as something "that's been in train for a while.""It's thorough, it's moderate, it's appropriate," he said in an interview on Fox Business. "Our hope is it doesn't lead to a rash reaction from China. We're just trying to get back to even."He added that the U.S. hopes the action leads to further negotiations with China and "to China changing its policies, at least with respect to us, and opening up their market."Beijing first said weeks ago that it was likely to target agricultural products like soybeans - a crop crucial to Trump's political base in the U.S. heartland - as well as cars and aircraft.U.S. farm groups quickly voiced concerns that Trump's move against China on Friday could deeply harm an industry that has struggled in recent years amid stubbornly low commodity prices."For American farmers this isn't theoretical anymore, it's downright scary," Brian Kuehl, executive director of the advocacy group Farmers for Free Trade, said in a statement Friday. "It's no longer a negotiating tactic, it's a tax on their livelihoods."Some lawmakers and business groups added their voices to the chorus of opposition, warning that while China's intellectual property practices need to be addressed, tariffs are not the right approach."Tariffs will harm American and Chinese businesses and consumers, and will put economic growth in both countries at risk," Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) said in a statement. "Ill-conceived trade actions that weaken the American economy, alienate allies, and invite retaliation against American businesses, farmers and ranchers, undermine our nation's ability to successfully confront China's unfair trade policies."But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer backed Trump's strategy. "The president's actions on China are on the money," the New York Democrat said in a statement. "China is our real trade enemy, and their theft of intellectual property and their refusal to let our companies compete fairly threatens millions of future American jobs."Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) also strongly supported the tariffs, calling them an "EXCELLENT move."The White House had previously paused its rollout of the duties as the two countries pursued trade talks, but Trump appeared to lose patience last month and ordered his administration to finalize the list of targeted goods. The action appeared to be a clear statement that he wasn't happy about the direction of talks with Beijing.The Trump administration is planning still more trade actions against China, including a set of investment restrictions and export controls that are also aimed at curbing Chinese acquisition of "industrially significant" technology.The White House has said those restrictions will be announced by June 30. Lighthizer said Friday the goal is to stop China from forcing U.S. companies to hand over valuable technology and data, calling technology America's "biggest advantage."Victoria Guida, Sabrina Rodriguez and Doug Palmer contributed to this report.Load-Date: June 18, 2018End of Document

The Chinese company agreed to pay a $1.2 billion fine last year after a US investigation found it had illegally shipped telecommunications equipment to Iran and North Korea.But instead of punishing those involved, "ZTE paid full bonuses to employees that had engaged in illegal conduct, and failed to issue letters of reprimand," the Commerce Department said in a statement.As a result, the department said it has imposed a seven-year export ban on ZTE, forbidding American companies from selling parts and providing services to it.ZTE's smartphones use microchips from Qualcomm and glass from Corning.ZTE said in a brief statement Tuesday that it is aware of the US ban."At present, the company is assessing the full range of potential implications that this event has on the company and is communicating with relevant parties proactively in order to respond accordingly," it said.The company's shares were suspended from trading in Hong Kong on Tuesday following the US announcement.ZTE didn't address the developments in the United Kingdom, where the country's National Cyber Security Centre warned phone carriers that using the Chinese company's equipment and services poses risks to national security.The US crackdown on ZTE comes at a delicate time for economic relations between Washington and Beijing. The two sides have threatened each other with waves of new tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of exports.China's rise as a global tech powerhouse is at the heart of the trade clash. The United States accuses it of stealing American intellectual property and forcing companies to hand over sensitive technology.Beijing has rejected the allegations, arguing that it is stepping up efforts to protect intellectual property and that any technology transferred from US companies was done so with their permission.China's Ministry of Commerce said Tuesday, that it "will closely follow the developments" in the ZTE case."ZTE has a wide range of trade and investment cooperation with several hundred American companies, providing the United States with thousands of jobs," the ministry said in a statement."We stand ready to take necessary measures to protect Chinese companies' legitimate rights and interests," it added.ZTE and Huawei, another huge Chinese company that makes smartphones and telecommunications equipment, have repeatedly come under fire in the United States in the past.In February, US intelligence agencies warned Americans against buying ZTE and Huawei phones, saying the companies posed a security threat to American customers.Huawei phones are already effectively shut out of the US market, but ZTE has made inroads. It accounted for 10% of the US smartphone market last year, making it the fourth largest supplier, according to market research firm Counterpoint Technology.ZTE and Huawei's alleged ties to the Chinese government were also the subject of a US congressional report in 2012 that focused on the equipment they make for telecommunications networks. The report said the companies "cannot be trusted to be free of foreign state influence and thus pose a security threat to the United States and to our systems."The Chinese companies strongly disputed the report's findings.-- Steven Jiang contributed to this report.Load-Date: April 18, 2018End of Document

CONGRESSMAN TIM RYAN ASSAILS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S SELLOUT TO CHINA ON ZTEStates News ServiceJune 7, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 542 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the office of Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan:Congressman Tim Ryan assailed President Trump's formal bailout of Chinese telecom giant, ZTE."Days after President Trump took a sledgehammer to our relationships with Canada and Europe by imposing harmful tariffs -- jeopardizing alliances that helped us win the Cold War his Administration has formally announced its golden parachute for Chinese telecom giant ZTE. This is a company that repeatedly violated sanctions against Iran and North Korea, and with which the NSA, FBI, and CIA all have cyber security concerns. The Pentagon even stopped selling its phones on military bases. Nevertheless, they continue to get VIP treatment from President Trump and his inner-circle while communities like Youngstown and Akron suffer because of the President's own actions. President Xi and the Chinese government are celebrating, while President Trump got rolled. There's no other way of putting it. China has a long-term economic plan, a 20-year plan, a 30-year plan, a 50-year plan, 100-year plan. We're operating in a 24-hour news cycle. We should be facilitating a massive reinvestment into communities across the U.S. that have been left behind by rapid globalization, and by abusive and illegal Chinese trade practices. Instead, it's Trump first, China second, America last," said Congressman Ryan.Earlier this week, Congressman Ryan joined with Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Congressman Mike Conaway (R-TX) to introduce the Fair Trade With China Enforcement Act. This legislation would take sweeping steps to safeguard American economic and national security interests against abusive Chinese trade practices by specifically safeguarding American assets from Chinese influence and possession.Specifically, the Fair Trade with China Enforcement Act would:Prohibit the sale of national security sensitive technology and intellectual property to China.Increase taxes on multinational corporations' income earned in China at a rate similar to the lost value of stolen IP and technology.Cancel an income tax treaty signed in the 1980s and tax China on their "investment" in the U.S., including their holdings of the national debt.Prepare duties on, and impose Chinese investor shareholding caps on U.S. companies producing, goods targeted by the Made in China 2025 plan.Prohibit the federal government, or subsidiaries/contractors, from purchasing telecommunications equipment or services from Huawei and ZTE.Congressman Tim Ryan has been fighting illegal and unfair Chinese trade practices for his entire Congressional career. He has been leading the fight to reform trade deals so that U.S. workers are not at a disadvantage. This includes leading the charge to hold China accountable for currency manipulation. The Currency Reform For Fair Trade Act, which was introduced alongside Representatives Sander Levin (D-MI) and Bill Pascrell (D-NJ) in April of last year, takes aim at currency manipulators by enabling the Department of Commerce to impose countervailing duties to offset the impact of currency manipulation on a U.S. industry.An earlier version of this legislation which was introduced in 2010 passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 348-79 on September 29, 2010.Load-Date: June 8, 2018End of Document

Attempts by China's Communist Party (CCP) to influence local and national politics has been gaining steam in Australia, in particular.BodyHannah Peters/Getty Images• Hillary Clinton warned Australia and New Zealand to take China's interference attempts "seriously."• Clinton also praised a New Zealand academic, Anne-Marie Brady, who has pioneered work on the Chinese Communist Party's secretive arm that tries to influence policies overseas.• Brady was targeted in a number of break-ins and threats at her office and home. Burglars stole computers, phones, and flash drives, some of which were related to her work. In Auckland as part of a speaking tour, Hillary Clinton warned about China's foreign-interference campaigns and urged the countries to take the issue "seriously.""In Australia and here in New Zealand experts are sounding the alarm about Chinese efforts to gain political power and influence policy decisions," Clinton said.Attempts by China's Communist Party (CCP) to influence local and national politics has been gaining steam in Australia, in particular. The federal government has drafted a bill outlawing foreign interference and political donations, and a former adviser to the prime minister even spoke on the matter            with the US House Armed Services Committee in March.But Clinton also praised a local New Zealand academic who has done pioneering work on China's United Front, the CCP's secretive arm that tries to promote the party's policies overseas. "Anne-Marie Brady of the University of Canterbury has rightly called this a new global battle, and it's just getting started," said Clinton. "We need to take it seriously."US intelligence agencies found that Clinton herself was the target of an influence campaign spearheaded by Russian operatives in the 2016 US presidential election, during which she was the Democratic rival to Republican Donald Trump.Earlier this year, speaking at an Australian parliamentary committee, Brady described how her university office was broken into in December and her home was burglarized in February. Three laptops - including one used for work - two phones, and a flash drive were stolen."Meanwhile a jar of cash, my son's pocket money, in plain sight, was undisturbed as was jewelry, and the bedrooms were conspicuously disturbed," Brady said at the time. "Someone's obviously trying to send a signal to me - it's probably more like an intimidation."Days before the February break-in, Brady also received a warning letter threatening "push back" against those who oppose Beijing. Marty Melville/Getty ImagesUnited Front is the CCP's secretive arm that promotes its positions overseasBrady has been researching how the United Front, which Xi Jinping called one of the party's "magic weapons," essentially uses New Zealand as a test zone for China's political influence and interference campaigns. Some of these activities include "co-opting" the elite to promote Beijing's interests and using business people with links to the CCP to orchestrate targeted political donations.The United Front also tries to bring ethnic Chinese communities, politicians, and Chinese-language media "under CCP control."Business Insider reported a similar case last week where intelligence agents in Beijing physically camped in a migration agent's office in Beijing for two weeks, harassing him to end his advertisements in an independent Chinese-language newspaper in Australia.The incident is one of many attempts to cut funding to voices critical of the Chinese government in order to force closure or accept state funding along with state-driven editorial content.But Beijing isn't just focused on local businesses.The Civil Aviation Authority of China is pressuring 36 foreign airlines to change references to Taiwan on their websites in order to promote the CCP's political position and territorial claims.NOW WATCH: Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump tried to cut a secret deal with Planned Parenthood - here's what happenedSee Also:• Zimbabwe's opposition leader has pledged to rid the country of Chinese investment• Trump might be about to escalate his trade fight with China• One chilling story shows how far China will go to silence criticsSEE ALSO: One chilling story shows how far China will go to silence criticsLoad-Date: February 11, 2019End of Document

China has a long-term economic plan, a 20-year plan, a 30-year plan, a 50-year plan, 100-year plan. We're operating in a 24-hour news cycle. We should be facilitating a massive reinvestment into communities across the U.S. that have been left behind by rapid globalization, and by abusive and illegal Chinese trade practices. Instead, it's Trump first, China second, America last," said Congressman Ryan.Earlier this week, Congressman Ryan joined with Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Congressman Mike Conaway (R-TX) to introduce the Fair Trade With China Enforcement Act. This legislation would take sweeping steps to safeguard American economic and national security interests against abusive Chinese trade practices by specifically safeguarding American assets from Chinese influence and possession.Specifically, the Fair Trade with China Enforcement Act would:* Prohibit the sale of national security sensitive technology and intellectual property to China.* Increase taxes on multinational corporations' income earned in China at a rate similar to the lost value of stolen IP and technology.* Cancel an income tax treaty signed in the 1980s and tax China on their "investment" in the U.S., including their holdings of the national debt.* Prepare duties on, and impose Chinese investor shareholding caps on U.S. companies producing, goods targeted by the Made in China 2025 plan.* Prohibit the federal government, or subsidiaries/contractors, from purchasing telecommunications equipment or services from Huawei and ZTE.Congressman Tim Ryan has been fighting illegal and unfair Chinese trade practices for his entire Congressional career. He has been leading the fight to reform trade deals so that U.S. workers are not at a disadvantage. This includes leading the charge to hold China accountable for currency manipulation. The Currency Reform For Fair Trade Act, which was introduced alongside Representatives Sander Levin (D-MI) and Bill Pascrell (D-NJ) in April of last year, takes aim at currency manipulators by enabling the Department of Commerce to impose countervailing duties to offset the impact of currency manipulation on a U.S. industry.An earlier version of this legislation which was introduced in 2010 passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 348-79 on September 29, 2010.

We now send it over to Dagen McDowell. MORNINGS WITH MARIA start now. Hey Dagen.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Thank you so much ladies, great to see you both of you and great to see all of you out there this morning. Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Monday, June 18th. Your top stories at 6:00a.m. Eastern.Immigration in focus, President Trump meeting with lawmakers today and tomorrow trying to hammer out a deal. House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul taking an optimistic tone on Sunday Morning Futures.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MICHAEL MCCAUL, HOUSE HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: The president is fully committed to both of these bills, he's put the full weight of his office behind it. You know, the McCaul-Goodlatte Bill, it -- they both I would say provide the four pillars that I discussed with the president at that, you know, sort of famous roundtable discussion.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: We take a look at how a deal could be made straight ahead. The trade battle taking a toll on investors, fears now shifting back to NAFTA as many tried to figure out what would happen if that deal comes apart.Checking markets this morning, Futures are pointing to a selloff, 127-point loss on the Dow Futures right now after the Blue Chips shed 226 points last week but we have losses in the making to start this new week.Over in Europe, taking a look at England, France, and Germany, losses across the board, both the French and German markets down about one percent at the moment. In Asia overnight, markets in China and Hong Kong closed for holidays. We have the Nikkei and the Kospi in South Korea both facing a small selloff there.Oil prices also under pressure, driving the move China now weighing an important tariff on U.S. crude oil. We have $0.35 loss on the cultural crude at the moment. OPEC meantime eyeing an increase in oil output.Google making a move into China, how it plans to take on Amazon with its latest investment.The CEO of Audi arrested, he was taken into custody for his role in Volkswagen's emissions scandal. We have the latest from overseas.Plus, Tom Brady hinting at when he may leave the NFL, his retirement comment coming up.All that and so much more this morning, National Security Analyst, Morgan Ortagus is here. We're going to talk about anything by the way. She can talk about --MORGAN ORTAGUS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: So can you Dagen.MCDOWELL: Morgan could talk about business, intelligence gathering, the international relations, citrus crops in Florida.ORTAGUS: (INAUDIBLE) he probably agrees with you.MCDOWELL: And autos. And then PWC Partner, Mitch Roschelle is here. Fox News Contributor and former House Oversight Committee Chairman, Jason Chafettz. Good to see you. We can talk about golf yesterday.MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC: Good morning. And dogs, we're going to talk about dogs.MCDOWELL: And dogs. And always great to see you.JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you. Thanks for having me.MCDOWELL: Because you can -- you can try and explain the crazy ways of --CHAFFETZ: The NAFTA, that is Washington, D.C.MCDOWELL: It is a mess. It's been worst since you left, is that (INAUDIBLE)CHAFFETZ: Well, thank you.MCDOWELL: You're welcome.CHAFFETZ: I'll take that -- that's the best complement I'm going to be able to get. So I'll go ahead and take that.MCDOWELL: But let's get to our top story. Jason, nice to see you one more time Mr. Jason Chaffetz. A growing outcry at the border, the Trump Administration facing major blowback over its alleged practice of separating families crossing the border illegally.Lawmakers on both sides blasting the practice which has removed nearly 2,000 children from their parents in just six weeks' time. Even members of the White House showing their own uneasiness with the policy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT: As a mother, as a catholic, as somebody who's got a conscience, I will tell you that nobody likes this policy. You saw the president on camera that he wants this to end. But everybody has -- Congress has to act.CHUCK TODD, MTP HOST, NBC: He can end it on his own.CONWAY: Chuck, Congress passed the law that it is a crime. This is a congressional law for many years ago.TODD: Many.CONWAY: It is a crime to enter this country illegally. So if they don't like that law, they should change it.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: But Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen defending the administration's immigrant policies in a series of tweets writing this, "We do not have a policy of separating families at the border, period. For those seeking asylum at ports of entry, we have continued the policy from previous administrations and will only separate if the child is in danger, there is no custodial relationship between 'family' members or if the adult has broken a law."Meantime, President Trump is set to meet with key senators today and House republicans tomorrow on Capitol Hill to discuss a compromise immigration bill. Jason, your reaction to what we're seeing because, again, you heard from Kellyanne Conway there is real uneasiness as we said with this policy of separating these children?CHAFFETZ: The horrific things that happen to border, the human trafficking that's going on is really disgusting. But don't pretend that that's because of Donald Trump or because of border patrol trying to enforce the law.That's because there's a lot of human trafficking that's been going on at the border. First of all, if you want to claim asylum, do so in your country of origin. Go to the United States Embassy. If you're coming to the United States, go to a port of entry. But if they cannot determine that that child is actually has a familial relationship with that parent, then they're going to separate them and try to figure out because there is a lot of human trafficking and there are lot of drugs that are flowing through this country, they're using drug mills. But we're talking about people that are flowing between the ports of entry running, fleeing and we have a duty and an obligation to figure out who those people are.MCDOWELL: I -- really quickly though Congressman, I want to know, so this -- since April the -- this -- the administration has had zero-tolerance policy of detaining adults attempting to cross the border into the U.S.And the Department of Homeland Security does refer to these "alleged" adult parents, 1,995 immigrant children separated from 1,940 adults. Is there proof that this kind of aggressive message works? That it will keep individuals from trying to cross the border by sending a message that your -- if you try to bring kids across the border you will be separated from their parents?CHAFFETZ: There has been a longstanding belief that if you just get across the border then you're going to be released into the United States of America particularly if you are a minor.And so there have been these perverted incentives for people to come here, just a foot in the United States and then, boy, that's your free pass to get into the country. That's what the president is trying to help solve. Don't think this is some new phenomenon. I have been down on the border multiple times and I've seen this 15-year-old kid running drugs across the border. You can't prescribe one -- you know, one size fits all, it's not one or the other but you have a terribly difficult job trying to figure out who these kids really do belong to.MCDOWELL: Well you heard from Kellyanne Conway and her comments about this -- what's happening at the border and the first lady herself weighing in on the issue saying -- Melania Trump saying, she quotes, "Hates to see children separated from their families and hopes both sides of the aisle can finally come together."But comedian Kathy Griffin, of course, ceasing on that statement in a profanity-laced tweet Kathy Griffin wrote, "F you, Melania. You know damn well your husband can end this immediately. You feckless complicit piece of S." Morgan, your reaction to this, how is that helpful?ORTAGUS: I mean that's inappropriate. That's clearly the favorite that -- the words that you just read are the favorite words by Hollywood (INAUDIBLE) against the president. I mean, it does nothing to add value to our political discourse.I think that we've got two different things going on here, we have what the Congressman just spoke to in detail which is the policy and the legal application of all of this and the facts. But then you have a whole other realm Dagen that I think that the administration needs to improve on this week and that's the communications angle of this. And I think no matter what -- what the Congressman just explained makes a lot of sense.But I since yesterday you have a lot of people in the administration that weren't necessarily on the same page and whether it's the -- whether it's the Secretary of Homeland Security, whomever, I think from the communication standpoint the administration needs to come out very aggressively this week telling their story and getting these bills to Congress because they do think that they're losing a little bit of edge on the communications front.MCDOWELL: We should point out that the two bills that we're talking about is Goodlatte bill and the McCaul bill, each would broadly allow children arriving at the southern border to be detained with their parents in the same facility or for the release of a child to a relative.And Congressman, it does seem like that the administration is just taking a very hard stand on this and wants to make this a legislative issue and make it a -- and put it on the democrat saying, "If you want this fixed, then you need to come up with an immigration solution and vote for it."CHAFFETZ: As I recall the numbers, I have to go back and check. But I believe it's more than 100,000 minors have come across the border and been placed in we don't know where. We don't know how -- there's been no verification to the vetting of this.And I can only imagine that there's some really disgusting things that have gone wrong with this, it definitely needs a fix. But the fix in part is building that wall so that they don't try to flee across, that they do go to a port of entry where we're able to actually deal with this in a much better situation.MCDOWELL: Well -- and the wall funding was not in that giant omnibus spending bill, number one, for new wall.CHAFFETZ: Yes.MCDOWELL: It was replacement fencing was funded. And number two, we keep talking about this immigration bills, it could get passed to the House but what about the Senate? It's not even clear that the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would even put something up for a vote even though the president has said that the White House has indicated that he would sign anything that the republicans pass out of the House.ROSCHELLE: And I think voters are looking for some sort of legislative win that's bipartisan. This is something that obviously everybody is up in arms about. So this is an opportunity to now in the midterms to do something that Americans can get behind. So -- and the dysfunction is not helping the electorate get behind anything.CHAFFETZ: Give credit to the democrats to changing the topic because we have the -- it's very -- inspector general up, we have major problems of the Department of Justice, and boy, did they pivot and change the subject really quickly.ORTAGUS: The FBI Director both -- and Horowitz up before this and Judiciary Committee, I think that's going to be real fireworks. We know that Senator Graham is not going to let them get away with all that.MCDOWELL: I probably drove 25 hours in the last five days and so I've been listening to all the coverage on all of the networks and you have Attorney General Jeff Sessions quoting scripture and then I heard a democratic congresswoman quoting scripture back at him yesterday on television. That's where we are.CHAFFETZ: The Attorney General is worthless. He's there in name only. I don't know what he does all day, as long as he's the Attorney General. He's not doing anything. He's recused himself from the most problematic thing that we have going on at the Department of Justice.MCDOWELL: But I do want to raise the -- raise this, we also heard from first lady Laura Bush who wrote -- spoke about the separation of children from their illegal immigrant parents at the border.She said at an Op-Ed in the Washington Post, "I live in a border state. I appreciate the need to enforce and protect our international boundaries, but this zero-tolerance policy is cruel. It is immoral. And it breaks my heart." This is increasingly unless the republicans solve this somehow, it is going to become one of the most important issues when we come up to the midterms.You had Will Hurd, Congressman Will Hurd of Texas was down toward a temporary tent facility on the southern border that the administration had constructed. So he does -- he is trying to protect himself. So, again, this is a huge, huge issue republican or democrat coming up for -- moving into November.CHAFFETZ: Will Hurd represents a district that has more the border than anybody else. He's a wonderful member of Congress and he's very compassionate, he's very engaged in that.But let's also understand, if the temperatures are warmed up there has been a surge of people trying to come across, they're dealing with this by the tens of thousands as people have come across. But we're going to enforce the law, it doesn't mean we just suddenly loosen up on the law, I just -- you really got to enforce that but we got to get rid of the rewards and incentives, I really do believe they -- they're making a case for the president to fund the border wall and to put more security so that you are pushed to the ports of entry, I think that's -- I think that's what America wants.ORTAGUS: I think that was a -- that was an incredibly tough Op-Ed by Laura Bush and it's a little bit more -- it's more difficult to attack her than the president, you know, the former President Bush for doing that. So strategically, again, from communication perspective, I think that you saw first lady Laura Bush with a very tough Op-Ed, probably one of the toughest Op-Ed that we've seen --MCDOWELL: And she referred to the --ORTAGUS: She did.MCDOWELL: -- compared this to the Japanese and (INAUDIBLE)ORTAGUS: But you also have -- you have the first lady as well, Melania Trump, you know, with -- you know, comments also saying that this breaks her heart. So I think we really need to get the administration to get those facts that you just laid out Congressman. Maybe you should be the spokesman for the immigration policy, you're doing a good job this morning.CHAFFETZ: Well thank you.MCDOWELL: Well I'll add -- I will add this but since the start of the budget year in October, more than 32,000 unaccompanied immigrant children have been taking into custody by U.S. border patrol, that's a four percent increase over the same period in 2017 but separately more than 59,000 people traveling as families have been arrested at the border during the same period, that's actually down from the previous budget year.CHAFFETZ: I think -- it's an interesting question, when the apprehensions goes up, does that mean the border's more secure or less secure? It's really hard metric to just determine one or the other but the reality is, it's tens of thousands of people and these are just the ones that we're catching.MCDOWELL: And we see politically and financially and economically and even as a society the problems that Europe is having with Angela Merkel and the migrant problem in Europe.ROSCHELLE: And some of the elections in arrest in South America, in Latin America is just going to mean there's going to be more people fleeing? So this is -- and we talked about last week we're talking about some of these emerging economies that are really struggling.That just going to be more people wanting to leave there and come here, so this is an issue that is going to have to get dealt with by the right, the left, the center pretty soon.MCDOWELL: Then there you have it. Coming up, a fiery train derailment forcing evacuations in Indiana, the details from the investigation into that massive explosion.And breaking news, another top executive caught up in Volkswagen's emission's cheating scandal. The new charges against Audi's CEO.MCDOWELL: Take a look at Futures and what they're doing right now, 161- point loss on the Dow Futures, again, this is worries about trade, retaliatory tariffs from China, 50 from us, $50 billion from China, it will hurt businesses. The big question is how, when, and how much?At least three people are dead, hundreds more injured after a powerful earthquake rocks Japan. Cheryl Casone has the detail, Cheryl.CASONE: That's right Dagen, good morning. The 6.1 magnitude shock rattling the City of Osaka that burst water mains and knocked down walls, airports in the area close for several hours, train lines all interrupted.Among the victims, a nine-year-old girl who died when a wall fell on top of her, this was the strongest registered quake in the city's recorded history. Again, this is scheduled to host next year's G-20 Summit, Osaka. So, adding a little bit to both the city and the pressure they're under right now.Well a train derailment in Southwest Indiana sparking an explosion and a large fire. A mandatory evacuation issued after the train derailed nearby a trailer park last night. One rail car was reportedly carrying propane which may have led to the fire you're looking at. No injuries luckily reported in this accident.Well, breaking this morning, the chief executive of German carmaker Audi, Rupert Stadler has been arrested in connection of the diesel emission scandal. Munich prosecutor said they made the arrest because of a risk that Stadler might seek to suppress evidence. Audi is owned by Volkswagen which admitted to using illegal software to cheat U.S. emissions tests on diesel engines.Then there is this, Google putting more of its money to work at Asia and it's going up against competitors there like Amazon. They're investing $550 million in JD.com, that is a Chinese e-commerce company. The partnership's going to include promoting JD.com's products on Google shopping platform, it's pretty big.Orders reporting the move could help JD.com extend its presence in Asia to markets in the United States, maybe Europe. Taking a look at the stocks right now, wow, Jd.com in the premarket up more than seven and a half percent, Dagen. And those are your headlines this morning.MCDOWELL: Thank you so much Cheryl. Mitch, that's an interesting story about that Google investment in China's JD.com because this is one of the things I don't think that we're talking about enough that American businesses invest -- have invested about $200 billion in China.China could really put the hammer on our economy with increase inspection, safety inspections, delays in approving imports as possible tools. You name it, it's not just retaliatory tariffs from China if we get into a real, real, full blown trade spat.ROSCHELLE: And Dagen, it goes both ways, the other thing America is starting to bet is how dependent our capital markets are on foreign investment. So we sort of choked that off too because some of these sovereign nations aren't using their sovereign wealth funds or private investors don't want to invest in United States. So we're in sort of in the middle of a trade war that's going to (INAUDIBLE) very quickly in the capital markets.MCDOWELL: There's an editorial in the Wall Street Journal, I mean, we can talk about it later but it's about American lock makers and how the Trump steel tariff is harming these U.S. companies and their workers.Lion Holding group owns Lion and Republic, this are century-old companies that dominate the market for American made lockers, like school lockers and they're struggle -- in the Wall Street Journal editorial's words, "The Lion Group Holding is struggling to survive as the steel tariff gives Chinese competitors an unfair advantage." So these are lock like school lockers, but really incredible. We'll be talking about that.Coming up, spiraling toward the end of an era, what Patriots quarterback Tom Brady just said about retirement.And from the Senate floor to the hardwood, Ted Cruz takes on comedian Jimmy Kimmel in a charity basketball game for the ages. The hilarious highlights.MCDOWELL: Patriots quarterback Tom Brady speaking out about retirement. But first, we start with an incredible U.S. Open where MORNINGS WITH MARIA was live. I listen to it on the radio, Jared Max.JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTSCASTER: What a wild gold tournament. Who could have predicted that it would end as it did. You know, Dustin Johnson had a four-shot lead entering in the final round?Well watch what happens here in the final round, it was all about Brooks Koepka, the returning champion. Yesterday at Shinnecock Hills Brooks Koepka would tame the course and hold off a swarm of golfers who were within just a few shots. The approach shots were the difference for Brooks Koepka, the 28-year-old from West Palm Beach, this is the shot that won it for him, 16th hole, he gets it just within four feet of the cup. The crowd erupted and you knew that was it.Koepka birdie the hole, he was able to hold off Tommy Fleetwood of the U.K. Fleetwood shot a 63 and tied the U.S. Open record but lost by one. Koepka, the first golfer since Curtis Strange to win back-to-back U.S. Open to 1988 and 1989. He didn't even compete at the Masters last month, he was recovering from a risk injury.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BROOKS KOEPKA, PROFESSIONAL GOLFER: I miss competing, that's really what it is. I mean, I've got to be competing at something, it doesn't matter what it is. I just feel like I need to be back out grinding, I feel like I was missing so much.(END VIDEO CLIP)MAX: Congratulations Brooks Koepka. Take a look here at the final leader board. Look at that, one, two, three, four, five, world number one Dustin Johnson gave away the four shot lead, first time since 2013. The winner was above par and yesterday's score is 180 degrees in the previous days.You realize this, because of the pin placements were more realistic and the greens were watered, Jordan Spieth shot at 65 after an 84 on Saturday, 19- stroke difference. And Phil Mickelson even made up 12 shots.One of the most anticipated opening round matchups for this year's World Cup, Mexico scores (INAUDIBLE) to upset defending World Cup champion Germany. There was such a boom physically from the fans jumping up and down. Get this, seismologist said the celebration in Mexico caused a manmade earthquake. World Cup fever in Mexico.Stick with FOX and FOX Sports for continuing coverage of the World Cup. And all the things do come to an end even Tom Brady's NFL playing career. It's not happening just yet, relax. But the soon to be 41-year-old quarterback indicates the end is not far away. Brady tells the Boston Herald, "I think about it more now than I used to." He says, "I think I'm seeing there's definitely an end coming sooner than later." He said he'll keep playing as long as he's loving the training and preparation and willing to make the commitment. Brady wants to be there to spend more time with his kids.Basketball season may be over but the fun continues for Texas Senator Ted Cruz and late night talk show host, Jimmy Kimmel. Saturday, they played a one-on-one charity basketball game, it was supposed to end at 15 points but as the Houston Chronicle said, it was a slow motion car crash on half-court basketball. Kimmel said on behalf of both players, we apologized to the game of basketball as Senator Cruz was the winner, 11-9. This paying off a bet from some fun they had during the NBA finals, Dagen.MCDOWELL: Yes. You really need to see some video of that to understand how awkward it probably was.MAX: Even better if there are video of them warming up and practicing, it's pretty hysterical.CHAFFETZ: Are they making a new white man can't jump with that one?ORTAGUS: No, I interviewed Ted Cruz a few weeks ago at -- in Texas at the Maverick Pack in (INAUDIBLE) and I asked him if he was going to wear the short shorts, he declined. But he did -- he did sort of break it there that he was going to play Jimmy Kimmel. So, we had a -- we had a -- we was -- he was quite serious about it. I was joking but he was pretty serious.MCDOWELL: How about that Open? You watched -- you were out there watching.ROSCHELLE: We were both out there. Jared was out -- Jason --MCDOWELL: And you love golf.CHAFFETZ: I'm a big Tony Finau fan, he's the Alpine Country Club which I belong to, he's a member there but I did pretty well in my pool but I came in fourth. My screen name I'm pretty proud of it, I am "Total Putts."ROSCHELLE: That's right.CHAFFETZ: That's my screen name.MAX: P-U-T-T-S?CHAFFETZ: Yes.MCDOWELL: You should -- you shouldn't have told us that at 6:27 in the morning because that's completely what I'm going to call you the rest of the show.CHAFFETZ: I am total puttsMCDOWELL: And by the way, a shout out to Curtis Strange Dee Madigan.MAX: Oh, it was awesome. He was up in the 10, he spoke with us on Friday with Bill Hemmer, we had some great fun. Cool stuff. Back-to-back first time since then.MCDOWELL: I saw the photo -- I saw the photo online.MAX: Oh yes, yes, yes. We got some cool photos, gorgeous Shinnecock Hills.MCDOWELL: You can listen to golf on the radio, you can. I was driving yesterday --MAX: You can. Oh, you can.MCDOWELL: -- and you can listen to the golf on the radio, it was quite effective.MAX: It was great. I had a little earpiece, then they give you those American Express things, you could hear what's going on in the tournament, it's awesome.MCDOWELL: Like a NASCAR race, sort of. Jared, great to see you. Thank you so much. Jared Max. His sports reports on Fox News headlines, that's where headlines 24/7 Sirius 115.Coming up, new signs that the corporate earnings hot streak could be cooling off, the latest challenge for the markets ahead.And a heroic haul, Disney striking gold again with Incredibles 2. How much the animated sequel brought in over a record breaking opening weekend. Plus, Disney's alarming warning about seizures around this movie.MCDOWELL: Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Monday, June 18th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern. Trade tensions rising, Wall Street now squarely focused on NAFTA and what will happen next if that agreement falls apart. Checking markets this morning, those fears pointing to selloff at the open, the Futures are down 170 points on the Dow Futures, but, again, the S&P and NASDAQ selling off as well.And it's a selloff in Europe, to tell you about, in England, France and Germany, we have losses across the board and the selling is picking up steam in France and Germany. The DAX is off 1.3 percent at the moment. In Asia overnight, markets in China and Hong Kong closed for holidays, but the Nikkei and KOSPI in South Korea both heading lower as well. Checking oil prices, they are slipping for key OPEC meeting this week, up about 0.28 cents a barrel at the moment.Deadly crash at the border, at least five dead, after an SUV carrying illegal immigrants crashes in South Texas, following a high-speed chase, the details, ahead. Plus, the President will meet with key senators about the border wall, as the House prepares to vote on two immigration bills this week. And the tensions are rising over children being taken away from their parents at the border.Day in court, a dying cancer patient takes on Monsanto, he is the first of hundreds of cancer patients to see his case against the agro chemical giant go to trial. Disney, issuing a seizure warning about the Incredibles 2 film for fans with epilepsy. But that did not stop record-breaking ticket sales of the animated sequel.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BOB ODENKIRK, ACTOR: We need to change people's perceptions about superheroes and elastigirl is our best play.CRAIG NELSON, ACTOR: Better than me?(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: We have the record-busting box office numbers coming up. To our top story this half hour, racing the stakes of trade, China officially unveiling plans to hit the U.S. with tariffs on millions of dollars in goods, including oil and there are concerns that the escalating tensions will take a toll on the global economy. Joining us now is Lindsey Piegza, Stifel Chief Economist, Lindsey, how concerned are you about the mushrooming trade battle not just with China, but with other nations?LINDSEY PIEGZA, CHIEF ECONOMIST, STIFEL: Well, it is very concerning, right now, to put it in perspective, when we talk about $500 billion in terms of imports from China, the latest action from the White House is still relatively benign compared to what we could have seen, but, again, the bigger concern is that we are heading down a very slippery-slope into an outright trade war with one of our key trading partners.And, of course, when we talk about a trade war, there is the risk of slowing domestic growth, slowing job creation, leading to lower incomes, reducing productive capacity. So right now, i think the market is very right to be looking at this with a skeptical view, a very negative view, if we do continue to see this type of action from the White House as well as from China, leading to an outright negative -- significantly negative impact for the U.S. economy.ROSCHELLE: Lindsey, Mitch Roschelle, good morning, one of the things that concerns me, somewhat greatly about the trade war, the other side of it, which is China's economy, their industrial production is slowing and their capital expenditure investment in their companies is beginning to slow somewhat measurably, so maybe there are signals that their six percent, seven percent GDP growth is going to start to slow down, which Is going to impact their ability, you know, to move forward and it could actually help the negotiations, I think, what's your take on that?PIEGZA: It certainly could. And we have seen evidence that the Chinese economy is slowing, but slowing to still a pace well above what we're seeing in the U.S., closer to about six percent annual pace. But you're absolutely right, that when we talk about a slowdown in one of the largest economy in the global market place, this will result in a net decline in the demand for goods, for energy, overall raw materials which could then continue to put downward pressure on the market place and potentially give the U.S. further negotiating power at the table. But I think that's more of a medium to long-term impact and it does seem as if the White House would like more of a near-term solution to some of these trade tensions.MORGAN: Lindsey, this is Morgan, good morning, when you -- when you look at what the White House is trying to negotiate here, I think it's not just about tariffs and trade clearly, that's a big part of it, but i think the American business communities really concerned still about I.P. theft and the number of pressures that the Chinese government is putting on American corporations, we've all seen the stories about them making American corporation apologize for tweets or things on their website. Do you think all of that's going to get wrapped up into this tariff negotiation?PIEGZA: Well, I do think that's a very big part of it and I think that goes back to renegotiating some of these trade deals which have been in place for decades and upgrading the language which is very antiquated at this point. When we talk about, maybe, upgrading this to protect intellectual property, to protect the counterfeit of goods, this may be the net positive that comes out of some of these more contentious trade talks.But, again, if we talk about going down the -- that very slippery-slope of eradicating completely pushing to the side some of these trade deals or really escalating the trade tensions, I think, the net result will be very negative for the economy.Now, again, at this point, a still very modest impact, we are estimating only about two tenths of a percentage point to be shaped off from top line GDP as a result of these latest actions, but with the domestic economy still struggling to maintain two-ish percent growth, we really don't have the wiggle room to be giving up, even a few tenths of a percentage point, at this point -- in this stage of the recovery.MCDOWELL: And Jason, I know that you think about -- as a congressman, you thought about your constituents and even though you are not in Washington anymore, you still think about all the individuals who live in the area that you represented where you still live to this day, and that's why I pointed out that Wall Street Journal editorial about this locker-maker, where just the steel tariff, has taken these business LION Holding Group, from making a five-dollar profit, because still, prices are up almost 40 percent year to date.You go from making five-dollar -- a five-dollar profit to a $0.78 cent loss on each unit manufacture. These are hundreds of people employed by this company that make $12 an hour but they still live paycheck to paycheck. And when you're losing money in a low margin business, you only can lay people off. That's what they're left with.You can't raise prices and I think that there are going to be more and more of these stories in this country and that's what upsets me, the soybean farmers that will be hit by the retaliatory tariffs from China. It is the whole farmers, it' people I grow up with.CHAFFETZ: I do think that the President is moving in the right direction. He puts us in a position to negotiate better details in these agreements. But getting from here to there is painful. If you're agreeing one of the industries, it's going to be locked in with these tariffs, but my question is really about the move on oil prices. You know, one of the things that immediately impact -- I was in Michigan over the weekend, I think I paid $3.10 for a gallon of gas as we are moving into summer. What do you see happening on OPEC and the move on oil?MCDOWELL: Lindsey.PIEGZA: I think we could certainly --I apologize, I wasn't sure if that was coming back to me. Well, certainly, we have seen energy prices stabilize and begin to move higher. And we could see further upward pressure on prices, which obviously, there are always winners and losers in any economic scenario for domestic producers.The idea that energy prices have begun to gained traction has started to re-invigorate capital flows back to domestic oil production. However, for the consumer sector, this is my biggest concern as we are a consumer-based economy. If we do begin to see oil prices creep back up to multi-year lows, this could very much undermine some of that temporary support that the consumer has been relying on.At this point, remember, we're drawing down savings to a multi-decade low. We're taking on credit card debt and families have been increasingly reliant on low energy prices for the past several years to supplement their household spending. So, if we do continue to see these slow-creeping higher in terms of energy prices. The household, the average consumer could come under extreme amount of pressure as we're looking for growth to gain momentum, we actually may see the opposite in the latter part of the year.MCDOWELL: Lindsey, I want to get your reaction to this, this is the top story in the Wall Street Journal today above the ld, on the front age, that the next test for the bull market is slowing earnings growth. We've talked about this on this program for literally years about the strong earnings growth and earnings were up 25 percent in the first quarter. That now raises questions over whether we've hit a peak. What are your expectations and is that factored into the market?PIEGZA: Well, I think the market right now is really focused on the idea that the corporate balance sheet is still very healthy, still very wash in cash, and as we talk about tax reform coming down the pipeline, this is simply patting the corporate balance sheet even further. So, the equity market still has upward potential as businesses are using a significant amount of cash to reduce debt, to buy back stock, to pay out higher dividends all of which is very positive for the equity market.But I think longer term going forward as we talk about some of these downward pressure on the overall earnings capacity for businesses against the backdrop of still a very fragile consumer sector, if we don't see a sizable pick up in momentum to justify these levels that we are seeing in equity market, I do think there's room for quite a sizable correction back down to reality when we look at a longer term run rate of the U.S. Economy, closer to about 1 1/2, 1.8 percent. Certainly, well below some of the more optimistic estimates talking about pushing up to three or above three percent GDP.MCDOWELL: And typically, the second quarter is the worst quarter of the year during midterm elections for the S&P 500, for the broad market. So, the markets have been holding up really well. We've got a few more weeks left in the second quarter and it was an off-week last week, so we will see. We're going to keep watching these Futures for everybody. Lindsey, thank you so much for being here, Lindsey Piegza, with Stifel for us.Coming up, Monsanto going to trial, the first of hundreds of cancer patients, make his case against the agricultural giant today over its popular weed-killer, round up by the court battle could have major implications, legal, medical and otherwise. And another weekend, another box office record for Disney, how the hotly anticipated incredible sequel, made history in its opening weekend.MCDOWELL: An SUV packed with illegal immigrants crashing as it tried to flee border patrol. Cheryl Casone has the details, Cheryl.CASONE: Yes, at least five people were killed yesterday after an SUV carrying illegal immigrants flipped on a South Texas highway while it was trying to outrun border patrol agents. Authorities said, 14 people were in the SUV when it lost control after hitting speeds of more than 100 miles per hour. The crash taking place during a suspected smuggling operation. The driver was a U.S. citizen -- multiple arrests were made, we should say.Well, a 46-year-old cancer patient becoming the first person to take Monsanto to trial today accusing the company of hiding cancer dangers of its popular round up weed killer. The attorney for the Dwayne Johnsons as the California man used roundup extensively while working as a grounds keeper for a county school system. Hundreds of other lymphoma patients have made similar claims. Monsanto says round up is safe and can't be linked to individual cancer cases. Monsanto has recently acquired by Germany's Fire, we should add, in all of this.Well, Disney's new animated film, "Incredibles 2" now has a warning for movie goers. The company says people epilepsy could suffer seizures. This comes after social media users warned of scenes with intent flashing lights. 14 years after the original by the way, Pixar sequel "Incredible 2" had an incredible opening weekend.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We need to change people's perceptions about superheroes -- and Elastigirl is our best play.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Better than me?(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Yes, the animated family-friendly movie brought in a record breaking, get this, $180 million at the domestic box office. It beat the previous opening weekend record for an animated film which was "Finding Dory". Shares of Disney up more than one percent so far this year. Talk about a money maker for that company.All right. And then, finally, we have a wedding announcement to share with all of you. McKenzie (INAUDIBLE), one of our favorite producers here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA got married over the weekend in Sifnos, Greece. There she is with her husband George. She's now officially Mrs. Stratigapoulos. Say that 10 times really fast when comes home. McKenzie, we love you, congratulations! She looks gorgeous. And not a bad place to tie the knot -- Greece. A pretty good choice.MCDOWELL: It ensures that only the most special people in your life show up.(LAUGHTER)CASONE: That's commitment.MCDOWELL: Those people who are kind of on the, you know -- kind of on the margin, on the border. They don't show up. and you know what, they're always the ones that don't give you very good gifts. Just joking. I've been married twice. I had a total of 20 people in the weddings combined.(LAUGHTER)MCDOWELL: Coming up, having a glass of wine without taking out the cork. How one growing company is helping extend the life of a bottled wine. That is next.MCDOWELL: Wine lovers may have a new best friend -- not me. Coravin makes wine openers that can make a bottle last a lot longer. Maria caught up with Coravin Founder Greg Lambrecht and Coravin CEO Frederick Levy. This is it.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: So, we've seen the commercials actually, and I've wondered about this. Tell us about what went in in terms of creating this company first?GREG LAMBRECHT, FOUNDER, CORAVIN: Yes, I so love wine and loved it since I was probably too young. And luckily, I married a woman who loved it the same way. When she got pregnant, she stopped drinking, and all of a sudden, my partner that I used to open bottles with was no longer drinking. So, I realized that the way that I drank wine was constrained by the volume they sold it. I really wanted to be able to just drink a glass of white and a glass of red, and then not have to think about when I was going to drink from bottles again. So, that's the idea behind Coravin -- you can drink any wine, any bottle whenever and then come back to it any time later.BARTIROMO: And Frederick, you say that you can actually put this and get a little bit one glass, and the wine doesn't get messed up?FREDERICK LEVY, CEO, CORAVIN: The wine is still the same and age the same with no oxidation. You can come back to a bottle one week, one month, one year, 10 years later.BARTIROMO: How does that work? Doesn't it true that once air gets to the wine and immediately starts aging in and then it tastes differently.LAMBRECHT: That is the trick. Can I do a quick demo for you? So, this is our brand new fully-automatic Coravin Model 11. My dream when I started the company was faster, easier, and more fun than opening the bottle. You simply push it down; a thin needle goes through cork. You tip it sideways and it pushes the wine out of the bottle using an inert gaseous by wine makers -- it's argon. So, no air is getting in while it's pouring. Wine is coming out. You stop anytime just by tipping up. Pull the needle out of the cork and because cork is elastic, it reseals. You can put it back in your cellar, drink it again whenever.BARTIROMO: That's incredible.LAMBRECHT: Yes.BARTIROMO: All right. So, these are the devices and that's it. I mean, there's nothing else to it. You're just not actually opening the entire cork, it's just a little needle?LAMBRECHT: That's it. So, we figured -- cork is one of the most elastic materials known to people. That's what's been used in bottles as preservation technique for hundreds of years. And my thought was, if you just drink past the cork, then I can have glass of white or red. If my wife wants to have different wines or friends come over. We're now being used in restaurants worldwide to serve as many as 800 wines by the glass in some crazy restaurants. But really, they use this at home so that you can drink the perfect glass of wine.BARTIROMO: S, this is the Model 11, is that right?LAMBRECHT: Yes.BARTIROMO: And comes out later this year. Frederick, what makes this different than other models?LEVY: (INAUDIBLE) 199. We go to (INAUDIBLE) would be 999. It's fully automatic. It's connected to an app, and the app will manage the device but giving you moment. (INAUDIBLE) your wine, your moment, and the food you have tonight, and they're getting back tomorrow because wine is about experience, about the moment with friends or restaurant or special moment in your life.BARTIROMO: So, it's connected to the app. How does that work?LAMBRECHT: So, it's a Bluetooth connection and allows you to determine the speed of pour -- we have two different pour speeds. But also keep track of the wine that you own and it'll pair them with more than just food. It'll pair them with music -- you're always doing something when you're drinking a glass of wine: with friends, you're enjoying a good meal, you're listening to music, maybe you're watching a T.V. show. So, we've tried to do something special Coravin moments where it will actually look at the wines that you have and say this is a perfect music for that wine. Or if you want to combine food and music, it's kind of fun.BARTIROMO: Where does the growth come from Coravin.LEVY: First of all, with have the shoe around the financing. We raised $60 million. We are now available in more than 60 countries around the world. Then, want to be where people drink wine or produce wine. And currently, in the U.S. now, we are in the old in retails, from Amazon, from Neiman Marcus, Bloomingdale, William Sonoma, and (INAUDIBLE) and more to come.BARTIROMO: so, are there areas for new revenue streams then? I mean, where the growth from your standpoint?LAMBRECHT: So, it's really, I wanted Coravin to the fastest, easiest, and most fun way to pour wine. No matter what the closure is. We just launched Coravin's crew cap for the Australian and New Zealand wines. And then it's markets, so I was just -- we have a small office in Asia Pacific. We have not launched China which is growing very, very rapidly. It's the largest consumer of red wine in the planet. So, what's great about wine is it's enjoyed everywhere. There are so many wine drinkers and it's a growing market overall. So, I see tremendous amount of opportunity for us -- yes, and we still have some more stuff to accomplish. So, this is launching in September and I think it's going to be the first of our digital models. There's going to be some really cool stuff we can do technologically.(END VIDEOTAPE)MCDOWELL: We will be right back.MCDOWELL: Good morning. I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Monday, June 18th, your top stories at 7:00 a.m. Eastern.Load-Date: June 18, 2018End of Document

CONGRESSMAN MATT GAETZ ISSUES STATEMENT ON PRESIDENT TRUMP IMPOSING TARIFFS OF CHINESE IMPORTSStates News ServiceJune 15, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 521 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the office of Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz:U.S. Congressman Matt Gaetz (FL-01) today issued the following statement in response to President Donald Trump's announcement that the administration will be imposing tariffs on roughly $50 billion of Chinese imports."I commend President Trump for taking action against China's ruthless and unfair trade practices by enacting a 25 percent tariff on $50 billion of Chinese goods. For too many years, China has pursued trade practices and business policies that make it impossible for foreign companies to compete on a level playing field with Chinese companies.In August of 2017, Congressman Neal Dunn and I held a field hearing in Tallahassee: Wanton Loot How China is Stealing Ideas from American Entrepreneurs, which featured a panel of experts on Chinese trade and industrial policy. During the hearing, we heard about the many ways in which China consistently and deliberately steals American technology, then profits from it. China's clear violations of patent and trademark law undermine American entrepreneurship.China is engaging in a systematic and multifaceted strategy to steal intellectual property. Beyond the economic costs, this theft presents significant concerns for national security. The majority of Chinese companies that steal or benefit from stolen intellectual property are state-owned. The Chinese government is known for using their military's cyber capabilities to hack into private US tech firms, stealing IP, then transferring the technology to state-run companies who profit from its development.Over the past several months, President Trump has been taking concrete steps to address the critical issue of China's aggressive IP theft and unfair trade practices, which have cost America billions, if not trillions, of dollars in lost revenue and thwarted economic opportunities. After a thorough Section 301 investigation, USTR found that China's acts, policies and practices related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation are arbitrary and unfair, and burden U.S. commerce. The implementation of a 25 percent tariff on $50 billion of goods from China will be essential in preventing further unfair transfers of American technology and intellectual property to China which will ultimately protect American jobs.President Trump's "America First" policies are a much-needed step in the right direction, and a victory for American innovation and creativity. America does not need a playing field tilted in its favor; our products are the best in the world, and American manufacturers only need to compete on a fair and level playing field in order to succeed. President Trump is leveling the playing field for the first time in well over a generation, and his actions will help American businesses thrive in today's fast-paced global environment. As a member of the Subcommittee on Intellectual Property, I applaud the bold steps President Trump is taking to address this troubling issue. China is one of America's largest trading partners; their predatory behavior is unacceptable," Rep. Gaetz said.###Load-Date: June 18, 2018End of Document

2 BUSINESSMEN CHARGED WITH CONSPIRING TO COMMIT ECONOMIC ESPIONAGE FOR BENEFIT OF CHINESE MANUFACTURING COMPANYUS Fed NewsApril 27, 2018 Friday 5:48 PM  ESTCopyright 2018 HT Media Ltd. All Rights ReservedLength: 1129 wordsBodyWASHINGTON, April 27 -- The U.S. Department of Justice's U.S. Attorney's office for District of Columbia issued the following press release:Two businessmen, including one who is a Chinese national, have been indicted on charges alleging that they conspired to commit economic espionage and steal trade secrets from a business in the United States on behalf of a company in China that was engaged in manufacturing buoyancy materials for military and civilian uses.The charges were announced today by Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers, U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jessie K. Liu, Assistant Director Bill Priestap of the FBI's Counterintelligence Division, Special Agent in Charge Perrye K. Turner of the FBI's Houston Field Office, and Chief Don Fort of the Internal Revenue Service's Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI).Shan Shi, 53, a U.S. citizen from Houston, Texas, and Gang Liu, 32, a Chinese national, were among six individuals named in a superseding indictment returned on April 26, 2018, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. All six individuals initially were indicted in June 2017 on a charge of conspiracy to commit theft of trade secrets. The superseding indictment includes that charge and adds the conspiracy to commit economic espionage count against Shi and Liu, as well as a federal money laundering conspiracy count against Shi. CBM-Future New Material Science and Technology Co. Ltd. (CBMF), a Chinese company based in Taizhou, and its Houston-based subsidiary, CBM International, Inc. (CBMI), have also been indicted on all three charges.The other defendants include Uka Kalu Uche, 36, a U.S. citizen from Spring, Texas; Samuel Abotar Ogoe, 75, a U.S. citizen from Missouri City, Texas; Kui Bo, 41, a Canadian citizen who had been residing in the Dallas area; and Hui Huang, 33, a Chinese national. All of the defendants pled not guilty last year to the charges in the original indictment, with the exception of Huang, who has not been apprehended and is believed to remain at large in China.A seventh defendant previously pled guilty in December 2017 to a charge of conspiracy to commit theft of trade secrets.*"The superseding indictment in this case demonstrates that we will vigorously enforce laws meant to protect against economic espionage and related offenses," said U.S. Attorney Liu. "The charges also reflect the tireless dedication of the FBI, Commerce Department's BIS, IRS, and other law enforcement organizations to prosecuting theft of intellectual property.""The ongoing theft of American technology is a severe threat to our national security, and this is doubly true for technology with direct military applications. As this situation demonstrates, the FBI remains committed to working with its partners to combat this threat," said FBI Assistant Director for Counterintelligence Priestap."This indictment is a good example of the community, industry, and law enforcement working together," said FBI Special Agent in Charge Turner. "Economic espionage is a growing threat that costs the U.S. economy billions of dollars and puts our national security at risk. The FBI will continue to work with its partners to bring perpetrators of economic espionage to justice.""This superseding indictment alleges a vast criminal conspiracy involving everything from trade secret theft to money laundering and other financial crimes," said IRS Criminal Investigation Chief Fort. "By unraveling this scheme, we were able to hold those accountable who would profit from such a scheme while sending a message to others who would commit similar crimes in the future that they, too, will be brought to justice."**According to the indictment, China has promoted military, social, and economic development initiatives with a goal of making the country a marine power and has prioritized the development of engineered components of deepwater buoyancy materials. The charges in the indictment involve the development of syntactic foam, a strong, lightweight material that can be tailored for commercial and military uses, including oil exploration, aerospace and stealth technologies, and underwater vehicles, such as submarines.According to the indictment, from at least 2013 through May 2017, Shi operated on behalf of CBMF, which intended to create a facility in China to sell syntactic foam. CBMF received research funds from state funding in China and was part of a collaborative innovation center with Chinese government entities.The indictment alleges that Shi and Liu conspired with the other defendants to steal trade secrets from a global engineering firm, referred to in the indictment as "Company A," that is a producer in the global syntactic foam market.In March 2014, according to the indictment, Shi incorporated CBMI, which was owned and funded by CBMF, in Houston. The indictment alleges that CBMF employees wired approximately $3.1 million to CBMI between June 2014 and May 2017.According to the indictment, Shi and others recruited and hired current and former employees of "Company A" in Houston, including Liu, for the purpose of aiding CBMF's capability to make syntactic foam. Liu previously worked for "Company A" as a material development engineer and had access to proprietary and trade secret data. He and others are accused of passing along those trade secrets. According to the indictment, the technology was ultimately destined for China, to benefit the government and other state-owned enterprises.An indictment is merely a formal charge that a defendant has committed a violation of criminal law and is not evidence of guilt. Every defendant is presumed innocent until, and unless, proven guilty.The maximum statutory penalty for conspiracy to commit economic espionage is 15 years of incarceration. The maximum for conspiracy to commit theft of trade secrets is 10 years, and the maximum for conspiracy to commit money laundering is 20 years. The charges also carry potential financial penalties. The maximum statutory sentence is prescribed by Congress and is provided here for informational purposes. If convicted of any offense, a defendant's sentence will be determined by the court based on the advisory Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.The case is being investigated by the FBI's Houston Field Office, Commerce's BIS Office of Export Enforcement, and the IRS-CI.The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jeffrey Pearlman, Zia Faruqui, and Michael Romano of the District of Columbia, and Trial Attorney David Recker of the National Security Division's Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.

The maximum for conspiracy to commit theft of trade secrets is 10 years, and the maximum for conspiracy to commit money laundering is 20 years. The charges also carry potential financial penalties. The maximum statutory sentence is prescribed by Congress and is provided here for informational purposes. If convicted of any offense, a defendant's sentence will be determined by the court based on the advisory Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.The case is being investigated by the FBI's Houston Field Office, Commerce's BIS Office of Export Enforcement, and the IRS-CI.The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jeffrey Pearlman, Zia Faruqui, and Michael Romano of the District of Columbia, and Trial Attorney David Recker of the National Security Division's Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6268690 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: April 29, 2018End of Document

Kai-Fu Lee's perspectives on two global leaders in artificial intelligence: China and the United StatesMcKinsey & CompanyJune 14, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 McKinsey & Company, Inc All Rights ReservedLength: 876 wordsByline: MGIHighlight: Kai-Fu Lee shares his perspectives on developing and adopting artificial intelligence in China and the United States with McKinsey Global Institute partner Michael Chui.Body Link to Image Artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing at a breakneck speed, with two major players emerging: China and the United States. Each country has very different strategies, backgrounds, advantages, and disadvantages.Kai-Fu Lee has a unique view of AI development in China, in his present roles as chairman and CEO of Sinovation Ventures and president of Sinovation Venture's Artificial Intelligence Institute and from his extensive background in the topic in former leadership roles at Microsoft Research China and Google Greater China. Michael Chui, a partner of the            McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), spoke with Kai-Fu Lee to understand his perspectives on AI in two of the leading global markets.Interview transcriptMichael Chui: What are China's advantages in developing and adopting artificial intelligence? Kai-Fu Lee: China has several things going for it. It has a large amount of data, not only in mobile users but also the amount of mobile payments, the amount of transactions, the amount of data that's being captured. The fact that most users are willing to trade off some degree of privacy for convenience makes the data acquisition even easier. And on top of that, it's a bigger market.Second, the Chinese entrepreneurial system is an advantage for China. AI companies are moving very quickly into new spaces.A third big factor is the government support. At a local level, cities give subsidies to AI companies that move there, they have venture capitalists that invest in AI, and they have smart people move to these cities, including overseas-returning experts. Another aspect is that the Chinese government has always been techno-utilitarian, which means when it comes to new technology, it thinks, "Let's get the technology out there. And of course, there will be issues that come up, and let's course correct as they come up."As opposed to the Western countries, which tend to want to debate and resolve issues that may relate to privacy, security, bias, and explainable AI. When there are jobs being affected, the truckers' union will appeal to the president, asking to slow down the adoption. Whereas, in China, it's full speed ahead with AI.Michael Chui: What advantages does the US have in developing and adopting AI?Kai-Fu Lee: The US advantage is quite significant around research leadership, particularly around the education system. The US education system draws talent from throughout the world, and, especially in graduate levels, it's incomparable anywhere and way ahead of China and other countries.As long as American universities continue to be supported and attract talent, and to the extent that American visas are granted to graduates rather than having them go back to their countries, including China, that's an advantage that's very hard for any country to replicate in less than 30 or 40 years.Michael Chui: How do you see the AI field developing in these two markets?Kai-Fu Lee:AI has multiple types of applications. Clearly in internet AI, the US has a leadership position. But the Chinese companies with more data are catching up. With business AI, using data at banks, insurance companies, hospitals and so on, there are certain cases where Chinese companies may be moving forward due to accessibility of data, such as in healthcare. But in most spaces, the data in China is not yet fully digitized, structured, or warehoused. The US has substantial leadership overall, probably for five years or longer.Then there's perception AI, which involves using cameras and sensors everywhere to capture faces, motion, people, and objects to derive value. For example, recognizing returning customers at a shop or counting attendance at a school. These are things that affect privacy. And I think Americans will tend to be cautious about widely adopting it, but Chinese citizens would tend to be more willing to trade some privacy in return for convenience, and certainly for security. I think China will lead there.I envision the autonomous vehicle to eventually make everything affordable.Last, there's autonomous AI, which is AI that moves: industrial robots, commercial robots, home robots, and autonomous vehicles. This is a particularly impactful area, because I envision the autonomous vehicle to eventually make everything affordable. It will reduce the costs of chips, semiconductors, and sensors, and that will have a domino effect in making industrial commercial robots more viable and less expensive-essentially becoming the operating system of the future.Who will win this biggest one? I think it's 50-50. This is very technology-rich area. The US clearly leads in technology. But Chinese policies are accelerating the launch adoption of things like autonomous trucks and will not be slowed down by a trucker-union appeal or lobby. And with AI, the faster you launch, the faster you collect data, and the faster you use the data to improve your algorithm, the more you'll catch up. It's a game where the US clearly leads China, but China is moving at a faster trajectory. And I place it at a 50-50 for that area.About the authorsMichael Chui is a partner of the McKinsey Global Institute.McKinsey InsightsFor more of McKinsey's latest thinking, install our app for iPad or            Android.Load-Date: February 20, 2020End of Document

Trade War! Game On: Market ReconRealMoneyApril 4, 2018 Wednesday 6:48 AM EDTCopyright 2018 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 926 wordsByline: Stephen GuilfoyleHighlight: If you went to bed net long the stock market, there's a pretty good chance you're going to wake up deep in a hole.Body"Just because you do not take an interest in politics doesn't mean politics won't take an interest in you."- PericlesTrade War !Just posturing? US President Trump, and Chinese President Xi are playing a high-stakes game of chicken this morning. Obviously, these two leaders play the game like they fear nothing. NOTHING. I learned about guys who fear nothing at a very young age. I learned that the people around them usually get hurt. Late Monday, as equity markets were selling off hard, I realized that I had not been much of a buyer on the dip, with the exception of VanEck Vectors Vietnam ETF  . Has "buy the dip" become "sell the pop?" It also dawned on me that I had been methodically letting some of the air out of the tires (so to speak) in some of my very favorite long positions. By favorite I mean tech names that have a solid story in place, but carry too much Chinese exposure.I still like the demand story that supports Micron  , but 51.1% of the firm's sales are exposed to China. That's not good. Among some of my faves, Intel  , Apple  , Nvidia  , and Applied Materials  may not be exposed to that same degree, but all have more than enough cards on that table (18% or more). It is said that defense wins championships. Watch Gold. No one cares if you're good at making money when it's easy. NO ONE. Can you defend your own turf when it gets tough?Last night, the Trump administration laid put plans to hit Beijing with 25% tariffs on $50B worth of goods unless the Chinese government concedes in certain areas regarding trade, and foreign investment. While many of you were sleeping, China responded. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce would slap their own 25% tariff on more than 100 goods impacting...wait for it... $50B worth of US imports. Included on the list were aircraft, which will directly impact Boeing  this morning. This was, in my opinion...not completely priced in, as we know China's demand in this space to be keen.The good news? US companies still have until May 22 to make comment. The public hearing is currently scheduled for May 15th. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce did not publicly state when their tariffs would commence either. Hmm. This ballgame sounds like it may be in the first or second inning. As this game progresses, the evolving headline risk will very likely cause overreaction in both directions at different times by market driving high-speed algorithmic traders. That should be a real blast. In the meantime, if you went to bed net long the stock market, there's a pretty good chance you're going to wake up deep in a hole.The Death StarAs many of you know, I have been out of Netflix  and Alphabet  for a little while. Admittedly, I took my NFLX off of the table too early, and I usually never do more than rent  overnight in either direction. As for Facebook  , I'm just not a fan. Never was. Think the leadership is poor.Amazon  is different. Yes, I sold AMZN early in this "Tech Wreck." I have also started buying it back small on this discount. The prospects of a trade war will not overtly impact these FANG names as for the most part they have little exposure. Alibaba  is the Amazon (in a way) of China. The President of the United States can, in my opinion hurt AMZN more than can the President of China.That doesn't mean that I love the stock. My net basis remains well south of here. I understand the risk associated with being long a highly expensive name. I can tolerate that associated risk as long as the name does not approach my breakeven point. Then, I'll carve this name from my book without a hint of remorse. Now I'll tell you why this stock is so dangerous. The slayer of retail, also has the potential to slay your portfolio.1) The Dividend. There isn't one. That's right. You, the shareholder take on outsized risk, and Jeff Bezos pays you exactly zero dollars and zero cents as a fellow owner of the business.2) Debt. Yes, the firm has plenty of assets, and plenty of cash on hand. Total debt has ballooned from $20.4B at the end of Q4 2016 to $44.1B at the end of Q4 2017. Can the firm meet short to medium term obligations? Yes, the Current Ratio stands at 1.04. Strip out inventories you say? For the new kids, that called the Quick Ratio, and it's an item that you must understand. Hmm, suddenly a much uglier 0.7 appears on the screen. Would one invest in any other name with a number like that? Maybe, but only with the understanding that the investment was speculative in nature.3) Operating Margin. At the end of last year, the firm's Operating Margin printed at 3.62%. Hoo-ray. 3%. For comparison's sake, for the same period, Target's  operating margin is above 5%. Really? Is that true? You can look it up sport.We could go on. There are positives to be sure. There are also more negatives. For me this remains a spec play, and not at all a core position.Economics (All Times Eastern) 08:15 - ADP Employment Report (March):Expecting 198K, Last 235K.09:45 - Markit Services PMI (March-f)): Flashed 54.1.09:45 - Fed Speaker:St. LouisFed Pres.

China is investigating foreign chipmakersCNNMoney.comJune 4, 2018 Monday 1:24 AM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: TECHNOLOGYLength: 357 wordsByline: Ivana KottasovÃ¡BodyMajor chipmakers from South Korea and the United States are under investigation by Chinese authorities.South Korea's Samsung and SK Hynix and their US rival Micron said that investigators from China's State Administration for Market Regulation visited their offices in China on May 31.A spokesman for SK Hynix said the investigation is over suspected price fixing. Samsung and Micron -- which is based in Boise, Idaho -- did not comment on the subject of the investigation.The companies said they are cooperating with authorities.The Chinese government hasn't commented on the investigation. The State Administration for Market Regulation on Tuesday referred a request for comment to the Commerce Ministry, which in turn referred the request back to the regulator.Bernstein analyst Mark Newman said Beijing may be worried about the rising price of memory chips."[The price increase] is causing some concern from China as their domestic [smartphone] handset makers get hurt by the high prices," Newman said."China may also be using this price concern as a way to put pressure on the memory makers to share their [intellectual property]," he added.China purchases an estimated 90% of its semiconductors from foreign companies for use in everything from smartphones to automobiles.Demand in the country, which already purchases more than 60% of the world's chips, is expected to increase from $350 billion in 2016 to $500 billion by 2020, according to McKinsey.The Chinese government wants to develop its own chip industry, and it has tried to buy stakes in US chipmakers at least twice. Both attempts were blocked by US authorities.The country has been locked in a dispute with the United States over technology for months. The biggest flashpoint is Chinese smartphone maker ZTE, which has been banned from buying parts, including chips, from American companies.The White House has said it will impose tariffs on about $50 billion worth of Chinese goods following an investigation into the country's handling of technology transfers and intellectual property.-- Yoonjung Seo, Sherisse Pham, Serenitie Wang and Steven Jiang contributed reporting.Load-Date: June 6, 2018End of Document

Acclaimed Writers, Artists Call on China to Free Poet, Artist Liu XiaTargeted News ServiceMay 16, 2018 Wednesday 7:31 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 506 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: LONDON, England BodyAmnesty International issued the following news release:Dozens of celebrated writers, poets, and artists have called for the lifting of all restrictions on Chinese poet and artist Liu Xia, held under illegal house arrest without charge since October 2010.This show of literary solidarity comes following revelations about Liu Xia's declining health, which she revealed in April during a harrowing phone conversation with friend and exiled writer Liao Yiwu.Rita Dove, Paul Auster, JM Coetzee, Khaled Hosseini, Hu Ping, and Michael Chabon are among the group of writers who have read excerpts of Liu Xia's poetry as part of a video campaign advocating for her freedom.Khaled Hosseini, author of the Kite Runner, said: [I support this campaign for Liu Xia] as artists who are free to speak must do so on behalf of other artists whose voices are being stifled."The excerpts celebrate some of Liu Xia's most powerful works while calling on the Chinese government to end their cruel campaign of retaliation against her for her late husband Liu Xiaobo's calls for democratic reform.During the phone call with writer and friend Liao Yiwu released on 2 May Liu Xia, who suffers from depression, said she was "prepared to die" under house arrest.Suzanne Nossel, PEN America Chief Executive Officer, said: "Liu Xia's cry for freedom resonates around the world and rebukes the Chinese government's hollow claim that she is free."As efforts to allow Liu Xia to travel abroad for medical treatment stall, literary and human rights communities renew and amplify their call to release a poet who has been accused of no crime."We are proud to stand with Liu Xia's literary peers to celebrate her work, and challenge the Chinese government's relentless campaign to erase her voice."Lisa Tassi, East Asia Campaigns Director at Amnesty International, said: "The Chinese government's efforts to silence Liu Xia are despicably cruel. Liu Xia's poetry inspires so many who are now united in calling for her to be free."Liu Xia has been under illegal house arrest since Liu Xiaobo was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010. She is still closely monitored by state security agents and can only be reached by her closest friends by phone in limited circumstances.She has also been moved from her home in Beijing and held incommunicado for periods of time following the death of Liu Xiaobo in July 2017, with unverified clips appearing periodically on YouTube showing her in various locations in Beijing and Yunnan province.Liu Xia is known to be in poor health, and suffers from severe depression, but has been prevented from travelling abroad to seek treatment.Full list of artists:Alec SothAlice SeboldAyelet WaldmanChang-Rae LeeDaniel YorkJason Y.

The Mooch's China deal is deadBusiness Insider USApril 30, 2018 Monday 03:55 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 666 wordsByline: llopez@businessinsider.com,  (Linette Lopez)Highlight: 10-day White House Press Secretary Anthony Scaramucci will no longer sell his financial firm, SkyBridge Capital, to HNA.BodyAP Photo/Ariel Schalit• Anthony Scaramucci will no longer sell his financial firm, SkyBridge Capital, to the Chinese conglomerate HNA.• The deal was announced in late 2016.• HNA has been having financial problems, selling bits of its stake in Deutsche Bank.Dow Jones reports that Anthony Scaramucci, who spent 10 days as the White House Press Secretary, will no longer sell his financial firm SkyBridge Capital to Chinese conglomerate HNA in what was reportedly a $180 million deal. He will return to SkyBridge as a co-managing partner.This comes as HNA, a massive firm known as a "gray rhino" in China, has been forced to sell assets after a years-long buying spree. Scaramucci's firm is likely best known for the massive bash it used to throw in Las Vegas every year, one that attracts world leaders and stars of the world of finance for four days in the desert.But of course that's not the only business SkyBridge has. It is a fund of funds, which is to say that it is an investment fund that connects people (in this case well-off but not necessarily rich professionals like doctors and lawyers) to other investment funds.Over the last few years, businesses like this have been hurting on Wall Street. When you pay a fund of funds, you pay a fee to them, and a fee to the hedge fund they're connecting you to. The problem with that, of course, is that it's expensive, and when hedge funds aren't performing (as they haven't been for the past couple of years) no one wants to pay high fees.Scaramucci told me in an interview in 2016 that part of his job was to try to get fund managers to lower their fees so that he could lower fees for his clients. So when HNA said that it wanted to buy SkyBridge, knowing Scaramucci was in President Trump's inner circle, eyebrows raised.They raised even higher when reports of the sale price hit Wall Street - it seemed like HNA was overpaying for the firm.Gray rhinos getting slaughteredAs time went on it became increasingly clear this deal was on life support. SkyBridge and HNA were forced to refile their application to a shadowy agency within the US Treasury - CFIUS, The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. It's the nine-person panel that decides if a foreign company gets to buy a US company.What's more, HNA is in terrible shape. Deal after deal has left it cash poor and heavily in debt. Earlier this month, it sold off more of its stake in Deutche Bank. This is why President Xi Jinping refers to it as a "gray rhino" - a company that seems innocuous until it starts moving fast in your direction.A few more things about HNA:• The company claims to be owned by two charities, as well as its founders. Beyond that, the whole thing is murky.• Chinese billionaire businessman Guo Wengui claims HNA is owned by Chinese government officials. He's doing that from a self-imposed exile in New York City, and HNA is suing him for defamation.• A bunch of Chinese banks reportedly cut off credit to HNA in an attempt to stop it from growing larger. HNA CEO Adam Tan told Reuters that wasn't true, saying, "We've got nothing to hide."• There are reports here in the US of HNA buying businesses and then not maintaining them. This would support the thesis that the Chinese government is angry at these gray rhinos because it believes some acquisitions were just an attempt to get money out of China.HNA's problems continue to pile, and it continues to owe a long list of people money. Unfortunately for Scaramucci - he was clearly at the very bottom of that list.NOW WATCH: The chief economist at a $163 billion firm dispels one of investing's biggest mythsSee Also:• Airline pilot reveals the meanings of 23 code words passengers don't understand• Jeff Bezos says his advice to Amazon interns and execs is to stop aiming for work-life 'balance' - here's what you should strive for instead• The best photo from every single year of Prince Harry's remarkable lifeSEE ALSO: Inside the rise, fall, rebound, and spectacular flameout of Anthony ScaramucciLoad-Date: February 11, 2019End of Document

Great to see you this morning.BOB NARDELLI, FORMER CEO, HOME DEPOT AND CHRYSLER: Good morning. It's great to be here.BARTIROMO: Great to see everybody.JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, "WALL STREET JOURNAL": Good to be here.I hope the President's right that he's going to wrap up this trade negotiation soon. And it looks like Germany is up for his no-tariffs plan perhaps.BARTIROMO: You mean the heads of the auto --FREEMAN: The German auto companies --BARTIROMO: Yes.FREEMAN: -- according to our newspaper, the government is on-board with a tariff-free trade zone, U.S. and Europe -- so.BARTIROMO: That's a victory for the President --FREEMAN: It would be his.BARTIROMO: in all of this.FREEMAN: Let's hope so.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST: But you have to get France on-board with them, don't you?FREEMAN: Yes. Yes.MCDOWELL: Those cranky Frenchmen, yes.FREEMAN: A lot of details still to be worked out.BARTIROMO: And I thought France and the U.S. had a special relationship, given the relationship between Macron and President Trump.NARDELLI: Yes.MCDOWELL: But I think whatever trade agreement we enter into, it can't just be Germany. It has to be the whole -- the whole of Europe, number one. Number two -- like we're not so holier than thou when it comes to trade and tariffs. We have with nations that we don't have trading agreements with, there's a 25 percent tariff on importing trucks into this country. So we act like we've been giving away the store for years and years and years.Not really the case and quite frankly, Americans have benefited greatly from this trade deficit because we're a rich, prosperous nation and we like to buy stuff.You're making that face.FREEMAN: No. I think that says it all. That's one thing I really would argue with the President there, talking about how our friends have been ripping us off more than our enemies.The good news is both U.S. and Europe -- the average tariff is very low. We're talking about low single digits. Yes, theirs is a little higher but on the other hand, we also restrict our markets in some ways too.So let's hope this trade fight wraps up fairly soon and if it brings tariffs lower, terrific.NARDELLI: Well, the good news is you're seeing a lot of international auto manufacturers establish plants. We had an announcement yesterday. We see a lot of the BMW SUVs that are produced here are exported globally but creating good paying jobs here. So I think there's some good out of these negotiations.BARTIROMO: All right. Meanwhile the Bank of England keeping interest rates unchanged. The breaking news -- not much of a reaction from markets in Europe this morning as this was expected, Bank of England keeping interest rates unchanged.Coming up this morning former FDIC chairman and Systemic Risk Council founder, Sheila Bair is joining us this morning along with House Majority Whip and Louisiana Congressman Steve Scalise here. Also with us this morning -- former senior advisor to President George W. Bush, senior advisor Karl Rove out with an op-ed today going into the midterm elections. Don't miss a moment of it to hear what he says about the midterms.But first our top story this hour -- President Trump addressing the growing immigration crisis on the southern border, signing an executive action aimed at keeping families who cross the border together.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We're signing an executive order. I consider it to be a very important executive order. It's about keeping families together while at the same time being sure that we have a very powerful, very strong border. And border security will be equal if not greater than previously.We're going to have strong, very strong borders, but we're going to keep the families together.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The situation now turns to Congress. House Speaker Paul Ryan and Freedom Caucus chairman, Mark Meadows were seen arguing on the House floor yesterday ahead of today's vote.Joining me right now is Newt Gingrich. He's former speaker of the house and author of the new book, "Trump's America". Newt -- good to see you this morning, thanks so much for joining us.NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: well, it's good to be with you.BARTIROMO: What a situation.GINGRICH: It's been quite a busy week.BARTIROMO: It really is. Republicans -- do they have any chance of passing legislation out of the House or is this divide way too big on immigration?GINGRICH: Well, it may be too big in which case -- I mean they may be able to pass something. I was up in the House yesterday, talking to various people. It will be very close, I think. But one of the two bills they're bringing up might pass.But let me just say, if they don't pass anything what they should do is come back with a very narrowly drawn bill that both keeps families together, allows for inspection in terms of exploiting children through sexual trafficking which is a big part of this, allows for discrimination against for example MS-13 gang members who may be classified as children but they're in fact killers who are 15, 16, 17 years old.And finally, it should not go beyond this one issue. The house ought to pass it and then frankly challenge Senator Chuck Schumer who has been blocking things and say are the Democrats really going to block legally fixing this specific problem of keeping children with their families. And I think it will put the Democrats in a very difficult position.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean at this point the other day you heard Chuck Schumer say look, Mr. President, this is your problem, you deal with it. And even with the President's action, Democrats are doubling down on their attacks.Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. CHRIS COONS (D), DELAWARE: Reportedly he tries to solve the problem he has created by simply detaining parents and children together, indefinitely, while they await trial. There is no way to see your parents. I don't think this solves our problem.SEN. BOB MENENDEZ (D), NEW JERSEY: But indefinite family detention is not a solution to the problem. There's no way that we can in my mind humanely indefinitely detain families as they go through their asylum process. So - -(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Look, these pictures of kids in cages, Newt, is exactly what the Democrats wanted to see going into the midterm elections.GINGRICH: Of course,BARTIROMO: Is it too late for the President to actually fix this at this point?GINGRICH: No. Well I mean first of all, this is June, so the answer is no. But second, what's their solution? The drug cartels are deliberately bringing people north. The Mexican government is facilitating people coming out of Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras. We've had an enormous increase in the number of people trying to penetrate the United States border.Now some Democrats are for open borders. You know, 25 million people want to come in, that's terrific for them because they have zero understanding of the importance of American civilization and the importance of our country being coherent.But no country in the world can take open ended continuous migration. You're seeing a tremendous reaction in Europe about this now. It's going to get stronger. And I would just suggest, you know, the President's tried to follow a path that says we're going to be humane about the children but we're not going to open the border to continuous illegal immigration. That's a very important national choice.The American people want the border open and they want to have millions of people come in illegally, they ought to vote Democrat, because that's what the Democrats stand for.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean do you see the Democrats coming to the negotiating table or are they viewing this issue, the immigration problem as their winning issue for 2018?Karl Rove out with an op-ed in "The Journal" this morning titled "Make 2018 about taxes, not about migration." At this point they're going to be holding onto this going into the election.I know you say it's only June, but still, what does the President and the administration need to do to fight that?GINGRICH: Well, maybe -- first of all, the Democrats introduced the bill in the Senate that is crazy. It was written very badly by somebody who apparently didn't look at it in detail. They got every single Democrat senator to sign on to it. So every senator who is up for re-election in a red state -- in Missouri, in Indiana, in North Dakota, in West Virginia -- they've all co-sponsored a bill which basically would allow open-ended immigration.The way the bill is written is so badly done that the Democratic bill in the Senate -- and I think you're going to see every Republican candidate go after their Democratic opponent as favoring open-ended immigration, where anywhere in the country at any time and I think it is going to be a dead loser for the Democrats.Second, I think actually there will be two issues this fall. There will be the economy where Trump is going to win big. And there's going to be health care where the Republicans have to explain what they're actually doing.What Secretary Azar is doing is very smart. He's going to move towards better health coverage, lower cost. Whether you're talking about prescription drugs or you're talking about transparency for hospital and doctor and medical device costs.I think they are moving in the right direction but they don't explain it very well. If Republicans can explain health correctly as an alternative for government run systems, and at the same time Republicans can point out the scale of economic growth, we may have the best year in over a decade. Certainly dramatically better than anything Obama saw.BARTIROMO: Yes.GINGRICH: We have the lowest black unemployment in history. You ought to be able to campaign on that and have a real impact.BARTIROMO: You would think so. But at this point this immigration story seems to be taking the oxygen out of the room.And then there's this -- yes.GINGRICH: No. But look, that's the elite media -- the elite media sits around basically and says --BARTIROMO: Right.GINGRICH: -- ok, Trump is really winning on North Korea. What can we do to embarrass him?BARTIROMO: You're right.GINGRICH: They bring up a story which frankly Barack Obama did. They didn't scream about Obama. But now is the chance to try -- Republicans just have to blow past this and get back to talking about the economy and health care.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, you're right about the mainstream media. I mean it's wall to wall.Let me ask you about this -- a galaxy far, far away. President Trump is touting his space force. He touted it at last night's rally in Minnesota. The crowd was on board. Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CROWD: Space force. Space force. Space force. Space force. Space force.TRUMP: Space force.CROWD: Space force. Space force.TRUMP: Space force.CROWD: Space force.TRUMP: So we have the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marines, the Coast Guard. But we have the Air Force, now we're going to have the space force because it's a whole --We need it.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: So Speaker -- you wrote an op-ed for Foxnews.com titled "Trump will make America great in space again with these historic advances." What are the short and long-term benefits here of the space force?GINGRICH: Well, first of all we need something like the space force because you're going to see the Chinese and the Russians and others become competitive militarily in space. We have to have a coherent program to make sure that America is dominant in space -- that's the President's word.In addition, we're moving from exploration with a handful of astronauts to pioneering and colonizing. Trump will turn out to be the most pro space president in history because John F. Kennedy sent us to the moon to win a Cold War fight with the Russians, not to actually move out into space.Trump and Pence actually are trying to move us to a totally new model where ordinary every day Americans can earn a living whether it's asteroid mining or it's working on the moon or it's developing manufacturing in space. It's a very exciting project.However, it's also a great test of Trump's leadership because the Air Force has already issued a letter indicating they intend to slow walk this as slowly and as carefully and as avoiding any decision possible.The President ought to set a date, say March 1st, 2020 -- the force will be up, it will be established, it will be running. Because otherwise, the deep state bureaucracy in Defense will do everything they can to stop it.BARTIROMO: Really exciting stuff.All right. Let's talk trade for a minute here because the President has had real courage in pushing back on China. Peter Navarro makes the case in an op-ed in "The Journal" today, something I've been saying for weeks now. And that is, the intellectual property theft and the forced transfer of technology are the real issues.Your thoughts on trade away from China and the Europeans -- the fact that these tariffs have really been debatable.GINGRICH: Well, First of all, I think the fact that the German auto manufacturers are now proposing a free trade zone with the U.S. is an enormous breakthrough --BARTIROMO: Right.GINGRICH: -- and to Trump's credit.BARTIROMO: Sure.GINGRICH: But let me make two big points for this.First, the Chinese have for 20 years been cheating on virtually every front. They've been cheating methodically. The last Director of National Intelligence under Obama said publicly they were stealing $460 billion a year in intellectual property, that's more than our total sales to China.BARTIROMO: Right.GINGRICH: You can't tolerate having a competitor who cheats every morning.BARTIROMO: Right.GINGRICH: And that's going to mean real friction. They're not going to give up cheating just because we don't like it.BARTIROMO: Yes.GINGRICH: Second -- Trump has figured out a big thing. We're the largest economy in the world. We have the best position to negotiate. In the end, they need us vastly more than we need them.BARTIROMO: Newt -- good to see you this morning. Thanks so much.GINGRICH: Good to see you.BARTIROMO: Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich there.Coming up, Southwest Airlines hit with a lawsuit over the deadly jet explosion -- the very latest developments there.And then first Apple teams up with Oprah Winfrey. Now the technology giant makes a deal with another iconic TV brand. We'll tell you which company.All that right ahead.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Well, a group of passengers on board the doomed Southwest Airlines flight where a woman was nearly sucked out of a window -- that group now are suing.Kristina Partsinevelos with the details and headlines now -- Kristina.KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Maria -- the lawsuit against Southwest and Boeing claims passengers were quote, "confronted with their greatest fear -- the overwhelming horror of being trapped in a plane about to crash". The plane forced to make an emergency landing when an engine exploded in mid-air and broke a window back in April. One woman was killed.Shares of Southwest down 20 percent for the year.We're going from planes to Apple. Apple is teaming up with Sesame Street Workshop. And this is actually Sesame Workshop to create children's programming. Apple says it has given a multiple series order to Sesame Workshop. The shows will be part of Apple's upcoming streaming service. Apple says Sesame Street, not to be confused with Sesame Workshop which airs on PBS and HBO is not part of the agreement.Shares of Apple are higher in premarket trading this morning.And talk about some hot wheels. This rare -- you're going to see very shortly -- 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO could become the most expensive car ever sold at a public auction. It's expected to fetch more than $45 million when it's put on the block in August in Monterey, California.According to Sotheby's 36 of these GTOs were built. This was the third one off the assembly line and it's actually never been in a crash. The current owner is chairman of a software company and an early worker at Microsoft who bought the car in 2000.Ferrari shares are lower in the premarket. Are you guys big-car guys?BARTIROMO: I don't know.PARTSINEVELOS: Muscle cars?MCDOWELL: Since Bob ran a car company --NARDELLI: I've got a few.BARTIROMO: What do you think about that Ferrari?NARDELLI: It's beautiful. It's a beautiful car.BARTIROMO: People will buy that just to collect it.NARDELLI: Not as good.BARTIROMO: You're not going to get in that and drive it on the road.NARDELLI: No but --MCDOWELL: You have to drive it. You have to drive it, actually. You have to keep it road ready. It has to be maintained.NARDELLI: Yes. Get started up and --BARTIROMO: Take it out for a ride from time to time.MCDOWELL: You've got to take it out, yes.NARDELLI: Yes.I'm not sure it's as good as some of those Dodge Chargers and Challengers though, you know. Vipers.MCDOWELL: I'm driving a plug-in gas electric hybrid at the moment.BARTIROMO: Do you have the plugs available to charge?MCDOWELL: It comes with a -- it comes with a charging port.BARTIROMO: So in your house, but I mean away from that?MCDOWELL: Yes, it's in the trunk. You drive it around. By the way, you can charge for free at Whole Foods, I think. There are charging stations everywhere. But you only use that to drive like locally. It has like a 20-mile range so it's --(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: It's got a fake noise so it sounds like a real car.NARDELLI: Twenty-mile range at 15 miles an hour, you can go anywhere.MCDOWELL: It's a BMW.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Tell them you might be late though. That's true. It's a Bimmer after all.MCDOWELL: Yes.BARTIROMO: We'll take a break.When we come back -- the results of the first stress test for big banks since the President's Dodd-Frank rollback. It comes today. We're going to find out what to expect from those stress tests when we speak with Sheila Bair.Then luxury sips -- a New York City restaurant reveals the world's most expensive milkshake. How much it will cost you. Can you take a guess? Later this hour.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.So it is report card day for the country's banks. The Federal Reserve set to release the results of the banks' stress tests later today. Joining us right now to talk more about that is the former FDIC chairman and Systemic Risk Council founder Sheila Bair. Sheila -- good to see you.SHEILA BAIR, FORMER FDIC CHAIRMAN: Nice to be here.BARTIROMO: So now we have had several cycles of the stress tests.BAIR: Yes, you do, yes.BARTIROMO: The rules of the game changing with the rollback of regulation, of course. What's your sense of the health of the banking system today?BAIR: Well, it's certainly a lot better than it was prior to the crisis. But I think there are a lot of unknowns. There's a lot of risk, I think, associated with protracted, accommodative monetary policies. Valuations are very high, debt levels are pretty -- still pretty high by historical standards. Corporate is at an all-time high.So I think they need to be prepared. I mean I think we should be asking them to keep building their capital cushions because we're long in the cycle and we're probably going to be having a downturn in the next couple of years.And so I think it's a very bad idea to be releasing capital but it sounds like from the press reports that the Fed's going to be permitting them to pay out more in shareholder dividends than they're actually making in earnings which means they'll depleting their capital.BARTIROMO: So you're not happy with some of this rollback in regulation.BAIR: I am not. Not at all, no. I'm very concerned about it. I think it's precisely the wrong time. We shall see -- you know, the ink is barely dry on a lot of this. They're not perfect. But I think at least for the capital rules, leave them in place. Let's go through a cycle before we would tinker. And they really haven't been tested yet and to start rolling them back now I think is really ill-advised, absolutely.FREEMAN: So I guess the taxpayer might wonder what they're supposed to be rooting for with the stress tests because you don't want an unhealthy bank. But on the other hand, if they get a good grade it means they're going to start reducing the cushion they have for a rainy day.BAIR: Yes, exactly, which I don't get. And you can -- they're very profitable. I mean, you know, banking's back; the big banks in particular.They could still pay out a nice, healthy dividend without depleting their capital. There's still plenty of room left to keep building incrementally those capital cushions. So I don't understand why the Fed would want to do this.And well, based on press reports, we'll see what actually happens. But from everybody I talked to, that is what's going to happen.NARDELLI: Sheila -- your impression when a lot of new regulations went in on the big banks, what we felt in the market was, you know, the inability for some of the smaller companies to get a loan --BAIR: Yes.NARDELLI: -- but pushed it down to the community banks.BAIR: Yes.NARDELLI: What's your view -- I mean was that a good move or how's that working out from your point of view?BAIR: Well, that's a really good point because if you look at who was doing the lending during the crisis, the smaller banks that had much higher capital cushions kept lending through the cycle where the big banks that were much more highly-leveraged were pulling back on credit lines, not refinancing loans.NARDELLI: Yes.BAIR: You probably experienced some of that. So this idea that somehow lowering capital is going to increase credit availability is just not right. Through the cycle, better capitalized banks will do more lending and that was true with the small banks.So, you know, and I've asked -- I'm here for a "Women in Governance" conference today. One of the things I've been talking about is for boards, just because the Fed says you can doesn't mean you should. And you should talk with managers about what happened in the last crisis. How many customers lost their credit lines? How many customers had to be turned down for refis. We don't want that to happen again. I mean how well prepared are they --NARDELLI: There were a lot of small companies and loans that just got kicked out. They got 30 days to go find another bank --BAIR: Yes. Exactly right.BARTIROMO: -- which is why they changed some of the rule making for smaller banks and lending -- Dagen.MCDOWELL: If you look at the entire financial system right now -- where do you think is the greatest risk? Which institutions have taken on too much credit risk, maybe? I just think about auto lending --BAIR: Right, yes.MCDOWELL: -- and how the auto lenders are really stretching to get people into cars at this point.BAIR: Well, auto lending has been a problem for a couple of years now.MCDOWELL: Right.BAIR: And the -- yes, that's an area, leveraged lending is kind of out of control. Corporate debt is very high. A lot of that is market driven but banks still have some exposure to it.And a lot of companies get in trouble, as interest rates go up and they can't refinance the debt, that's going to have broader ramifications for the broader economy.You know, sometimes it's in things where you think are safe, like mortgages, right. Before, everybody said mortgages were safe and you know, it was hiding in plain sight. If you look at the kind of mortgages that are being originated, you know, that's not the case.I worry about government debt now, not for a default but for an interest rate shock. I think we're really straining our budget. The Treasury is having to pump out a lot of debt to pay for this tax cut, to pay for increased spending and, you know, where is that going to go? So again, the things we think of as safe, like government debt, could pose risk on the interest rate side no matter --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: You said that you are expecting a downturn at some point.BAIR: Yes.BARTIROMO: How significant a downturn are you expecting in the next couple of years?BAIR: Well, I think it depends largely on the banks. We had a tremendous crisis because the banks were over-levered. They had to pull back on credit which created a highly negative impact on the real economy.If they have adequate capital cushions now to keep lending through the cycle, we won't have a severe recession. But if they're too leveraged going into this, they're going to be a source of weakness, not a source of strength for the economy.BARTIROMO: And then you've got crypto currencies, right.BAIR: Right.BARTIROMO: Goldman Sachs going to trade crypto currencies and all of the digital products.BAIR: Yes.BARTIROMO: You wrote an op-ed --BAIR: I did.BARTIROMO: -- took a balanced view of why the Fed should get serious about looking at crypto creating its own digital currency. Tell me about a Fed coin and how that would change the financial landscape.BAIR: Yes. Well, I think that's years down the road. But they do need to be looking at it. There's a lot of private efforts to have what's called a stable value digital currency. And I do think there's some -- you know, these interchange fees and checking account fees are so unpopular. If a private entity really did find a stable value of crypto currency that would be widely accepted, I think there could be a real, you know, different kind of bank run, a flight out of banks into that crypto currency and then the Fed would lose control over the monetary, the money supply.So I think that's years off. But it's happening. There are a lot of very smart people investing in these start-ups. From a monetary policy transmission perspective it would be highly efficient. Because the whole idea so right now that the main tool that they use to govern interest rates is interest on excess reserves. (INAUDIBLE) so they pay interest to big banks on the reserve deposits they have. It's about 1.95 percent now. It doesn't trickle down. I just went to a large bank, I won't name, to open up a savings account for my daughter and I said what's the -- what's the interest rate on this and they said 0.01 percent. So you know, and then, it's kind of -- you know --BARTIROMO: Yes.BAIR: So, if you want people to save more by increasing interest rates and borrow less, this is not an efficient way to do it. If you actually had, you know, some level of control and ways to transmit those higher interest rates into consumer pockets, I think that you would have a very different monetary dynamic.BARTIROMO: 0.01 percent, even the town in the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates.BAIR: Yes.BARTIROMO: Bank of England today left interest rates unchanged. Do you worry about the Central Banks -- global story right now and whether or not the Fed's going to blow it by the way --BAIR: Yes.BARTIROMO: -- with too many rate hikes?BAIR: Well, they don't. And look, I've been a critic of these zero interest rates for years. But I think we need to be very slow and very gradual now, it's creating a lot. And the unwinding of the balance sheet too is -- you know, any foreign entity who borrows in U.S. dollars is having a problem right now with funding. So, they need to be -- they need to do it. But they need to be very gradual and very cautious about it.BARTIROMO: We'll leave it there. Sheila, good to see you.BAIR: Nice to see you.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much.

All that coming up this morning.But first, our top story this half an hour, investors caught in the middle of a fight for fair trade. Futures pointing to a lower opening amid tensions over tariffs. The European Union is set to impose retaliatory tariffs tomorrow. Over President Trump's import tax on steel and aluminum. The president defending his decision during his rally in Minnesota last night.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: You look at the European Union, they put up barriers so that we can't sell our farm products there and yet they sell Mercedes and BMWs and the cars come in by the millions and we hardly tax them at all. They don't take our cars and if they do, the tax is massive. So, they're basically saying, we're going to sell you millions of cars. By the way, you're not going to sell us any. Not going to work that way anymore folks.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Well, the president is not backing down on this fight. Bob Nardelli, you were in the car business for a number of years. He was really referring to the 25 percent tariff on U.S. cars versus the 2.5 percent tariff for European cars.NARDELLI: Exactly, it is out of balance. And I think as I mentioned earlier, we're seeing a lot of the international manufacturers relocate themselves back here to the U.S. in anticipation of that. It's good -- it's good for America. It's creating great, high paying jobs. A lot of the cars, you're talking about BMW, you know, the SUVs that are made here, almost 100 percent are exported internationally, not as much consumed locally. But I think this is a -- you know, looking as an old car guy, I think this is fair trade.BARTIROMO: You like this position?NARDELLI: I do.BARTIROMO: Dagen, you're not buying it because of what you saw on tariffs on trucks.MCDOWELL: Well, I just think that to say that we get ripped off by all these other nations. Again, because we've taken on this trade fight, not just with nations like China that steal intellectual property, force the surrender of technology, but we're now in a fight with allies. And I think that when you talk about automobiles, it's making a mountain out of a mole hill.That you've got four percent of the cars sold here in the United States every year are imported from Germany. Four percent. And these German automakers, Mercedes in Alabama, South Carolina -- BMW in South Carolina, they are employing U.S. workers. I just think that it's stirring up unrest and I think that I would like to hear the president just be very frank with the American people.If you want to close the trade gap with China, then you're going to have to buy less and what you do buy that's made in China, you're going to have to pay a whole a hell of a lot more for it. That would be an honest statement.NARDELLI: Yes.BARTIROMO: But let's not forget the other issues that -- regarding the crown jewels of this country, technology.MCDOWELL: I just mentioned that.BARTIROMO: Yes, I know you did.MCDOWELL: I just think the tariffs is not -- tariffs is -- I don't -- I don't knowBARTIROMO: Is this the answer tariffs, to deal with this problem of the forced transfer of technology and I.P. theft? I don't know. Tariffs going to do it.JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Certainly not when he's applying tariffs to the whole world.MCDOWELL: Right.FREEMAN: When he's focusing on Europe, as Dagen mentioned, we have barriers against some European products coming here. We have some tariffs on average, they're pretty low on both sides. But these tariffs so far from the Trump administration, they seem mild. They're hitting some industries pretty hard. We have the editorial in the paper this week about Lion, this is an American manufacturer of school lockers and they're heavy consumers of steel. They're saying look, we're going to have to fire everybody essentially and produce overseas if these tariffs stay in place. So it does hit particular sectors pretty hard.BARTIROMO: And the point you made over and over again, is there's so many more employees in the industries that are importing steel and aluminum, versus the number of employees, workers in the steel and aluminum industry.MCDOWELL: I saw somebody interviewed this morning who works in the -- who's a representative in the steel industry and President Trump was speaking to those workers yesterday and they're like yes, tariffs. I'm like 140,000 people work in steel producing in this country and 6.5 million people work in businesses that need and consume and use steel like Lion Locker.NARDELLI: Yes.MCDOWELL: Because of the rule, steel price increases are up about 40 percent this year, Lion has gone from making money on every locker to losing money and the owner is talking about OK, I've got 400 people who live paycheck to paycheck, we pay them $12 an hour, we're going to have to lay off all those jobs.BARTIROMO: Peter Navarro was with us yesterday, this is the White House National Trade Council director, and he basically talked about the importance of tariffs against China. He talks about that this morning in a new op-ed in the Journal he write this "The Chinese government's made in China 2025 blueprint reveals Beijing's audacious plans to dominate emerging technology industries. Many of these targeted sectors such as A.I., artificial intelligence, robotics have clear implications for defense. President Trump's new tariffs will provide a critical shield against this aggression." Yesterday, he talked more about that when he was out with a new report and joined us right after its release.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL TRADE COUNCIL: What the president is doing here, firmly, is saying you can't take our crown jewels. The tariffs are designed to defend our industries against the predatory practices which have been used to take other industries from us like solar, steel, appliances and things like that.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: So he's basically saying, Dagen, yes, there are fewer employees in steel and aluminum but we don't want those steel and aluminums to go the way of solar.MCDOWELL: Well, they're not. There's plenty -- I think there were record profits last year in our steel industries and they use the national security argument which they were planning to apply to cars which is just poppy cock. They used the national security argument on steel. But there's plenty of capacity still left in steel here in case of the need for defense.That's one issue. I just -- it calls into question President Trump's instincts are clearly spot on, with the voters, clearly spot on with addressing problems in this country. The issue is the people working in that White House and how they execute on those desires and wants and needs for President Trump and the American people and I think you look at the roll-out of the travel ban at the beginning of this administration, you look at how this was messaged, this tariff roll-out which was poor and then you look at what happened with the immigration problem at the border and the way it was being handled by the attorney general and Homeland Security.That was handled badly and messaged even worse. I think that it calls into question some of the people who were working, who are not -- who don't have the president's best interest at heart because he's got great instincts and great ideas. He needs better execution behind him.NARDELLI: Yes.BARTIROMO: And this trade dispute between the U.S. and China starting to have wider implications. We heard earlier that German automaker Daimler says it's expecting lower Mercedes-Benz sales this year because of a tax on U.S. vehicle imports in China, Bob.NARDELLI: Yes. Well, I think two things that James and Dagen said is -- I mean, the thought would be to create more repatriation of steel manufacturing back here in the U.S. And that's going to take a while to refurb and modernize some of the steel making. A lot of that transition was because of environmental controls. You know, if you go to China, you'll see the difference there, in you know, energy production, coal and so forth. I think, you know, one of the loopholes James as you point out is on the locker manufacturer, I mean, some CEOs will say, you know I'm better off producing over there and importing the lockers rather than pay the 125.FREEMAN: Yes.NARDELLI: So, that is Dagen, to your point a little bit of a loophole. Let's hope that, you know, responsible CEOs don't do that.BARTIROMO: All right, we'll leave it there. We're going to take a short break.When we come back, you can do it for the gram for up to an hour, Instagram rolling out a new app that is going head to head with YouTube.Then, on this first day of summer, how about having the world's most expensive milkshake?

Though there is growing demand from advertisers for mobile video. IGTV will not feature advertisements initially. Users will be able to view videos by swiping through a new section in the Instagram app. There's definitely a lot of people to watch. Because those videos -- well, right now there's actually over one billion monthly active users. Shares of Facebook are trading slightly higher in the premarket trading.And let's move to food because New York, there's a restaurant in New York called Serendipity Three that's whipped up the world's most expensive milkshake according to Guinness World Records.

The largest movie channel in America, AMC entering the fray with AMC Stubs A-List, that's what they're calling it. A $19.95 a month ticket service that allows members of its loyalty program to see up to three movies a week.The program cuts off next Tuesday when members can enroll online and start using the service right away. AMC is the biggest competitor to other rival subscription services like MoviePass which limits subscribers to one 2D movie a day and each unique movie can be viewed only one time. AMC has up to INAUDIBLE) by allowing subscribers to watch any movie at its theaters at any time available at an any available format including IMAX and 3D.A-List also allows movie goers to book tickets in advance, a featured not allowed by MoviePass. MoviePass started the business as a disrupter, right? But as movie attendance at theaters slowed, but they faced monthly losses of more than $21 million to keep the service going where it does now. AMC fought back by pulling the program from some locations.And now with its own service stands to be disrupt the disrupter. For its part, MoviePass responded to this tweets to the news, heard AMC theaters jump on-board the movie subscription train. Twice the price for a quarter the theater network and 60 percent fewer movies. Thanks for making us look good. This is a fight to the draw here. I mean, people are getting bloody.

STANFORD STUDY OFFERS A GLIMPSE INTO SHORTCOMINGS IN CHINA'S ANTI-CORRUPTION DRIVEStates News ServiceJune 14, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 956 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: STANFORD, Calif. BodyThe following information was released by Stanford University:A study shows how citizen complaints posted publicly online in a Chinese city are concealed from upper-level authorities when they implicate lower-tier officials or associates connected to lower-tier officials through patronage ties.By Melissa De WitteWhen Chinese President Xi Jinping took office in 2012, he launched the most extensive anti-corruption drive since Maoist rule in China.For many in China, the campaign was considered a success: it put government authorities under intense scrutiny and curbed corruption. But, as Stanford scholars have discovered, there are some shortcomings in how information about graft was gathered from the public.In a new paper published in the American Political Science Review, Jennifer Pan, an assistant professor of communication in the Stanford School of Humanities and Sciences, found that citizen complaints of lower management wrongdoing in one Chinese city were routinely concealed from senior authorities.Hidden in plain sightPan's study, co-authored with graduate student Kaiping Chen, comes from an analysis they conducted of a leaked email archive that came from a city in central China. Although the leaked email archive has received significant press coverage and has remained publicly available, it has not been systematically analyzed, the two scholars noted.In their investigation of the email archive, Pan and Chen found it contained not just internal communications among lower-tier officials of the city but messages they sent to senior authorities as well. Attached to their messages were more than 600 "Online Sentiment Monitoring Reports" that listed complaints local citizens submitted to their local government over social media."It was fascinating because it provided an inside look into how the Chinese government monitors social media and what types of things they pay attention to," said Pan about the glimpse into how a local government operated.When combing through 2,768 emails from 201214, Pan made a startling discovery. She found that the reports the city officials sent to central management did not include all of the public grievances she saw detailed in the department's internal communications."Not only do we know what they are monitoring but we also get a sense of how they are hiding information," said Pan about her discovery. Of the 28 percent of complaints related to government wrongdoing, only 31 percent of these were reported upward."Not only do we know what they are monitoring but we also get a sense of how they are hiding information."Jennifer PanAssistant Professor of CommunicationPan and Chen found that when city officials were accused of misconduct such as embezzlement, graft and violence they were less likely to report it upward than other governance issues, such as pollution or education policy.Pan and Chen explored various reasons that might explain why this information was held back. Did lower-tier officials think some complaints were unreliable? Were some complaints only hearsay? Were the complaints not deemed an important enough issue for superiors to deal with? Or were there political incentives at play?After cross-checking these different scenarios with the email archive and the public grievances posted online, Pan and Chen found that complaints implicating a city official or a person with political connections to city officials were less likely to be reported.Complaints about counties with workplace and birthplace ties to city politburo members (the most powerful group of officials in the city, controlling policy, judicial and bureaucratic functions of government) were 11 percent less likely to be reported upward. By comparison, content with the most positive sentiment was 51 percent more likely to be reported upward."In this era when machine learning and computational methods are getting better and better at mining large-scale data, there is still someone writing a report to summarize findings, and that's where there is an opportunity for bias, politics and manipulation," Pan said about the shortcomings she identified in one anti-corruption effort.In other words, at the end of the day there is still a person writing a report."Even though these complaints were submitted by the public and in plain sight, there are many ways to justify why certain complaints were not reported. There is subjectivity because someone is processing this data, that is is where manipulation comes in," Pan said about the partial concealment at play.Accountability in authoritarian regimesWhile China has built many channels to gather citizen complaints, Pan's research shows that there remain shortcomings in how an authoritarian regime gathers information from its public."What I found is contrary to an emerging view that accountability can be found in authoritarian countries," Pan said, noting that public participation is insufficient for accountability in non-democracies. Monitoring the behavior of regime agents will remain a challenge.Pan's research illuminates another concern: To what extent can citizens in an authoritarian regime hold non-elected, government officials accountable?"I think there's been optimism that even if you don't elect your officials, you can still somehow get the things that you want from the government," Pan said. "What I am showing is that there are significant limitations. We can't assume that because people are allowed to voice their grievances and report on corrupt officials to the government, that this information will make its way to the people who can sanction corrupt officials."Pan is an assistant professor in communication. Kaiping Chen, a doctoral candidate in communication, is co-author on the study.Load-Date: June 15, 2018End of Document

China blasts Trump and escalates trade battle after he makes abrupt reversal on tariffsBusiness Insider USMay 29, 2018 Tuesday 01:01 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 484 wordsByline: bbryan@businessinsider.com,  (Bob Bryan)Highlight: The Chinese Ministry of Commerce said it was "surprised" with the White House's announcement that tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods would go forward but also called the move "somewhat expected."BodyGetty Images / Thomas Peter-Pool• President Donald Trump on Tuesday announced that tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods would go forward despite a broad trade agreement.• In response, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said it was "surprised" by the move but at the same time "somewhat expected" it.• China also promised to "defend the core interests of the people and the nations" in response to Trump's crackdown.The Chinese government is urging President Donald Trump to return to the negotiating table after the White House announced that the US would move forward with a crackdown on trade with China.The Trump administration said Tuesday that tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods would be finalized by June 15 despite a trade agreement reached between the two countries earlier this month. Following the agreement, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said            the tariffs were "on hold."In a statement Tuesday, a representative for the Chinese Ministry of Commerce took a subtle dig at Trump's constant back-and-forth on trade issues."We are surprised by the strategic statement released by the White House, but, at the same time, it is somewhat expected," the statement said. "It is obviously against the consensus reached by the US and China in Washington recently."The possibility of inflamed trade tensions, coming just over a week after a trade war with China seemed unlikely, helped contribute to a tumble in US markets. The Dow Jones industrial average was down more than 400 points, or 1.6%, as of 12:30 p.m. ET.In the statement, China also promised to defend its domestic economy in the event that the Trump administration continues the trade attacks."No matter what the actions that the US plans to take, China has the confidence, the capability, and the experience to defend the core interests of the people and the nation," the statement said.In addition to the tariffs, the White House also announced forthcoming restrictions on Chinese investment in US tech companies.The back-and-forth comes just days before Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is scheduled to visit Beijing to continue talks with Chinese officials. The status of the agreement is unclear now that US tariffs look set to go forward.But even with the overall tough tone of the statement, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce representative ended on a conciliatory note."China urges the United States of meet us halfway with the spirit of our joint statement," the representative said.NOW WATCH: Why some countries are more corrupt than othersSee Also:• Trump just made a move that looks set to reignite trade tensions with China• TRUMP: US is having 'very productive talks' with North Korea on restoring summit plans• Trump reaches deal with China to lift sanctions on Chinese tech giant ZTE despite blowback from Democrats, GOPSEE ALSO: Trump just made a move that looks set to reignite trade tensions with ChinaLoad-Date: February 11, 2019End of Document

HOW TO DEAL WITH CHINA'S TRADE PRACTICESStates News ServiceApril 9, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1028 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Cato Institute:By Simon LesterIn a recent Washington Post op-ed on China's trade practices, Fareed Zakaria concludes by saying: "Getting tough on China is a case where I am willing to give Trump's unconventional methods a try. Nothing else has worked." In my view, he gets a number of things wrong in this piece, but he does raise some important issues, and it's a good jumping off point for a discussion of how China actually behaves in its trade policy, and what the possible responses are.Zakaria's main claim is that, "on one big, fundamental point, President Trump is right: China is a trade cheat." Many people say this, or some variation of it. But what exactly does it mean to be a "trade cheat"?What Zakaria seems to have in mind is that China is breaking some World Trade Organization (WTO) rules or taking actions that undermine them. Zakaria refers to the recent Section 301 report by USTR, which he says finds evidence that China "uses formal and informal means to block foreign firms from competing in China's market." According to this report, he explains, "the Chinese government has increased its intervention in the economy, particularly taking aim at foreign companies," and he notes that "[a]ll of this directly contradicts Beijing's commitments when it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001." Later, he elaborates on the Chinese behavior at issue:Look at the Chinese economy today. It has managed to block or curb the world's most advanced and successful technology companies, from Google to Facebook to Amazon. Foreign banks often have to operate with local partners who add zero value essentially a tax on foreign companies. Foreign manufacturers are forced to share their technology with local partners who then systematically reverse engineer some of the same products and compete against their partners. And then there is cybertheft. The most extensive cyberwarfare waged by a foreign power against the United States is done not by Russia but by China. The targets are American companies, whose secrets and intellectual property are then shared with Chinese competitors.The difficulty here is that some of this behavior violates WTO rules, while some may not, as WTO rules don't cover everything. There's a good case to be made that the forced technology transfer imposed on foreign investors does violate the rules; but some of the cybertheft issues may not be covered.For the behavior that is covered by WTO rules, the answer is easy: File more WTO complaints. As my colleague Huan Zhu and I have argued, WTO complaints against China are pretty effective. The system is far from perfect, and sometimes governments do not comply immediately and fully, but overall it works and China complies as well as other governments do.But what about areas that are not covered by the rules? Can China be "cheating" in a more general sense, even if it is not breaking any specific rules, by not behaving "fairly"? One key area, which Zakaria does not mention, is state-owned enterprises (SOEs), which China has a lot of and which often don't behave in a market-oriented way. Unfortunately, the WTO does not have extensive rules on SOEs. The best approach here is to add new trade rules on SOEs, so as to require these entities to behave in a manner consistent with commercial principles. The Trans Pacific Partnership has some detailed rules on this, and although China was not a member of the TPP, there was the possibility that it would join, or that the SOE rules in there could be used as a model for applying such rules to China in a different trade agreement. But the Trump administration pulled out of the TPP, and the opportunity for the administration to push this in relation to China may have been lost for now.A similar issue is that China's tariffs are higher than U.S. tariffs, which is something the Trump administration has complained about. This is true, but it's within WTO rules. The reason China's tariffs are higher is that China was fairly poor during the period (1986-1999) when it was negotiating to join the WTO, and therefore it was allowed to take on fewer commitments in some areas. As part of its WTO commitments, China did agree to lower its tariffs from existing levels, but not by as much as wealthier countries had done over the years in a series of trade negotiating rounds.Since then, of course, China has become wealthier, although it is not nearly as wealthy as the United States. There is a case for China lowering its tariffs further now, but the way to pursue that would be another negotiation. Keep in mind that although China had fewer commitments on tariff reduction, it did take on additional commitments in other areas (so-called "WTO-plus" commitments), so a negotiation of this sort might involve a mix of adding new obligations on China and removing some of the existing ones. That's probably the most politically viable approach to this issue.Putting all this together, there should be two components to efforts to address China's behavior in trade policy: (1) File more WTO complaints, and (2) sit down with China to negotiate new rules (on issues not yet covered, and so that China takes on more liberalization commitments in the areas that are covered). Both of these will work better if the U.S. joins with its trading partners in a coordinated effort.I don't mean to make this sound easy. It would be a lot of work. But Zakaria is missing the mark when he says, "Previous administrations exerted pressure privately, worked within the system and tried to get allies on board, with limited results." When previous administrations brought WTO complaints, the results were usually pretty good. But there were a lot of possible complaints that were not filed, and the negotiating efforts were fairly limited. Perhaps there were reasons for this, such as a reluctance to press China on trade because the U.S. wanted China's help on foreign policy issues. But it sounds like now the Trump administration is elevating trade concerns to the fore. If so, there are plenty of opportunities to press China within the system, or to expand and improve that system.Load-Date: April 9, 2018End of Document

Facebook says it gave Huawei and other Chinese firms access to user dataCNNMoney.comJune 5, 2018 Tuesday 6:42 AM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: TECHNOLOGYLength: 705 wordsByline: Jethro MullenBodyFacebook says it has provided access to its users' data to Huawei, a Chinese smartphone maker that US intelligence agencies have described as a security threat.Facebook on Tuesday said it has been operating data-sharing partnerships with four Chinese device makers that enabled the companies to recreate Facebook-like experiences for their users.The news is set to fuel further concerns about how Facebook handles people's personal information and protects their privacy. It comes after the social media company admitted earlier this week -- following an investigation by The New York Times -- that it signed data-sharing deals with dozens of phone and tablet makers over the years, including Apple and Samsung.The agreement with Huawei is likely to draw particular scrutiny because of concerns expressed by US officials that the Chinese government can use the company's smartphones and other products for intelligence gathering -- allegations Huawei has repeatedly denied."Huawei is the third largest mobile manufacturer globally and its devices are used by people all around the world, including in the United States," said Francisco Varela, Facebook's vice president of mobile partnerships. "Facebook along with many other US tech companies have worked with them and other Chinese manufacturers to integrate their services onto these phones."Facebook said earlier this week that it forged partnerships with around 60 companies back when mobile phones were less powerful and app stores did not yet exist. The social media company said it gave device makers access to software only so they could build versions of Facebook that worked on different phones or operating systems.Facebook announced in April it was winding down the partnerships. It said Tuesday that it has ended more than half of them and that the Huawei one will shut down this week.The other three Chinese companies that signed data-sharing deals with Facebook are Lenovo, Oppo and TCL, which owns the rights to the Alcatel and Blackberry smartphone brands."Facebook's integrations with Huawei, Lenovo, Oppo and TCL were controlled from the get go ? and we approved the Facebook experiences these companies built," Varela said.He added that "all the information from these integrations with Huawei was stored on the device, not on Huawei's servers."A Huawei spokesman said that "like all leading smartphone providers, Huawei worked with Facebook to make Facebook's services more convenient for users."Huawei "has never collected or stored any Facebook user data," he said in a statement emailed to CNNMoney.The other three Chinese companies didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.Facebook's social network has been blocked by Chinese censors for years. But the company has long shown an interest in finding ways into the country, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg working to build relationships with Chinese leaders.Facebook's partnerships with the Chinese firms were first reported by The New York Times.One of China's biggest and most prominent tech companies, Huawei has faced suspicions from the US government for years. As well as selling smartphones, it builds telecom networks in countries across Asia, Europe and Latin America.But its networks business has largely been shut out from selling equipment to American operators after Congress issued a critical report in 2012. Lawmakers suggested that equipment from Huawei and ZTE, another Chinese tech company, could pose a threat to national security. The companies strongly disputed the allegations.Huawei has suffered a series of setbacks in the United States this year.In January, an effort to get AT&T to sell its smartphones collapsed at the last minute. Then in February, top officials from the CIA, NSA, FBI and the Defense Intelligence Agency said at a Senate hearing that they would recommend against American citizens using products made by Huawei and ZTE.The Pentagon has also ordered stores on US military bases to stop selling Huawei and ZTE phones.Huawei has repeatedly defended itself, saying its products are sold in 170 countries and "meet the highest standards of security, privacy and engineering in every country," including the United States.-- Nanlin Fang contributed to this report.Load-Date: June 7, 2018End of Document

Jack Ma's online payments firm is now worth more than Goldman SachsCNNMoney.comJune 7, 2018 Thursday 7:37 AM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: TECHNOLOGYLength: 323 wordsByline: Daniel ShaneBodyChinese tycoon Jack Ma's online payments company just raised a huge pile of cash from investors.Ant Financial said in a statement Friday that it has brought in $14 billion from Chinese and foreign investors.

China's Solar Polysilicon Industry 2018-2022 - China Forecast to Import Over 100,000 Tons of Polysilicon a Year - ResearchAndMarkets.comBusiness WireJune 6, 2018 Wednesday 11:38 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Business Wire, Inc.Distribution: Business Editors; Manufacturing WritersLength: 781 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "Research Report on China's Solar Polysilicon Industry, 2018-2022" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The production volume of China's polysilicon reached 242,000 tons in 2017, representing a CAGR of 70% from 2007 to 2017. The newly installed photovoltaic bases in China reached 53 GW in 2017, ranking first in the world for five consecutive years. Also, the total installed capacity amounted to 130 GW, taking the first place for three consecutive years. Production scale of every link in the domestic industry chain all took over 50% of the global total and continued to be leading in the world.The export value of photovoltaic products, including wafer, cell, module and inverter, totalled USD 15.777 billion in 2017, increasing by 5.3% YOY. The export value of wafer, cell, module and photovoltaic inverter was respectively USD 2.968 billion, USD 0.797 billion, USD 10.61 billion and USD 1.402 billion, with a respective YOY increase of 14.4%, 17.39%, -1.2% and 46.3%. In addition, the export volume respectively reached 4.404 billion, 3.36 GW, 30 GW and 15.92 million units.According to research, solar grade polysilicon is the main raw material for crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells. On top of this, there were 22 polysilicon enterprises in normal production by 2017, with the effective capacity totalling 280,000 tons, up by 70,000 tons over 2016. Among them, major manufacturers include GCL Silicon Technology Holdings Inc., TBEA Co., Ltd., Daqo New Energy Corp., etc. Also, by the end of 2017, the aggregate capacity of 10 enterprises, each of which exceeded 10,000 tons, accounted for more than 70% of the country's total.Based on this analysis, the main driving force for the growth of China's polysilicon market in the next few years is still the demand from the photovoltaic industry, where the increase in domestic demand and exports is equally important. It is estimated that the emerging photovoltaic market will grow rapidly in the next few years. Among them, the installation demand mainly comes from Asia and America, and the market is also opening in Middle East and Africa.According to research, the demand for polysilicon in the Chinese market still has large room to increase. Although the production of polysilicon can gradually meet the domestic demand, monocrystalline silicon has been popular since 2016, which needs to be made of high-quality polysilicon raw materials. Concerned about the quality of domestic polysilicon, Chinese manufacturers of single wafer still import high-purity one from Germany and South Korea. It is forecasted that China will import over 100,000 tons of polysilicon a year from 2018 to 2022.Key Highlights• Economy and Policy Environment Faced by China's Polysilicon Industry• Development Status of Photovoltaic Industry• Anti-dumping Measures of Chinese Government against Imported Polysilicon• Supply and Demand of Polysilicon in China• Polysilicon Import and Export Levels in China, 2013-2017• Market Competition of Polysilicon in China• Price Trends of Polysilicon in China• Major Polysilicon Manufacturers in China• Driving Forces and Market Opportunities in the Polysilicon Industry• Risks and Challenges Faced by the Polysilicon Industry• Development Trends of China's Polysilicon IndustryCompanies Mentioned• Asia Silicon (Qinghai) Co.

US seizes pot-growing houses tied to China-based criminalsAssociated Press Financial WireApril 5, 2018 Thursday 12:14 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 726 wordsByline: By DON THOMPSON, Associated PressDateline: SACRAMENTO, Calif. BodySACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - Hundreds of federal and local law enforcement agents have seized roughly 100 Northern California houses purchased with money wired to the United States by a Chinese-based crime organization and used to grow massive amounts of marijuana illegally, authorities said Wednesday.The raids culminated a monthslong investigation focusing on dozens of Chinese nationals who bought homes in seven counties. Most of the buyers were in the country legally and were not arrested as authorities investigate if they were indebted to the gang and forced into the work, U.S. Attorney McGregor Scott said.Much of the pot was shipped to Georgia, Illinois, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania through Atlanta, Chicago and New York City, he said. The drug is legal in California but requires permits to grow and can't be sent across state lines. It is still banned by the U.S. government.Black-market pot-growing houses have proliferated in the inland California region where authorities carried out the raids, and many of them were traced to Chinese criminal organizations from the San Francisco Bay Area in the mid-2000s, Scott said. The high number of grow houses in the area may be because of low property prices compared with the Bay Area and the state's large Chinese population, the prosecutor said.Scott called the recent crackdown "a game-changer" that may have cost the criminal organization "hundreds of millions of dollars" in lost drug profits and the money it spent on the homes."It hits the criminals right where it counts - in the pocketbook," he said.Authorities tracked at least 125 wire transfers totaling $6.3 million from Fujian Province in China, all just below the $50,000 limit imposed by the Chinese government.Officials are trying to learn if the homebuyers are what Scott called "indentured servants" - indebted to the Chinese gang and brought to the United States to buy and tend the grow houses. Many speak only Mandarin Chinese."We're treating them as victims" who may have been "forced or coerced" to work in what can be toxic environments, FBI Special Agent in Charge Sean Ragan said.The buyers generally used the same Sacramento real estate agents, borrowed from private lenders instead of traditional banks, and used straw buyers who purchased the properties on behalf of the real owners.The U.S. crackdown comes as California is months into creating the world's largest legal marijuana market amid uncertainty about whether the U.S. government will try to shut it down.More than 500 officers, including SWAT teams, fanned out over two days to search and seize 81 houses and two real estate businesses. Another 25 houses were raided previously.They seized more than 61,000 marijuana plants, 200 kilograms (440 pounds) of processed marijuana, at least $100,000 in cash and 15 firearms, including one that had been stolen.The U.S. Department of Justice said it was one of the largest residential forfeiture operations ever. Prosecutors will now ask judges to transfer ownership of the houses to the U.S. government to resell while they track the enterprise back to its roots, Scott said.Most of the suburban houses were valued at $300,000 to $700,000, though some were in rural areas and some in more upscale neighborhoods.U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement that transnational criminal organizations are "a blight on our communities, bringing dangerous drugs to our streets and trying to impose a false sovereignty over our neighborhoods."The Chinese consulate general's office in San Francisco did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Illegal grow houses have been a widespread problem in Northern California for at least a dozen years. Sacramento officials have estimated that there might be as many as 1,000 illegal grow houses in California's capital city.Authorities previously said the practice of growing marijuana in homes instead of outdoors originated along Canada's West Coast and migrated south as border restrictions increased after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.Suburban tract homes get transformed with high intensity lights and irrigation pipes, gutted to add ventilation pipes and air filtration systems to vent the tell-tale smell, and stacked with tables full of marijuana plants that could produce multiple crops each year."It's like industrial agriculture," Scott said.Load-Date: April 5, 2018End of Document

Many countries share the concerns of the United States about China and its unfair business practices. The United States is exceptionally well positioned to lead that coalition, "wrote ITI president and CEO Dean Garfield in a letter to Mnuchin on April 9.  Among the companies affiliated with the ITI are: Google. Amazon, Samsung, Apple, Dell, Twitter, Oracle, MasterCard, Nokia, Microsoft, Visa, Ebay, Toshiba, Accenture, McAfee, IBM, Lexmark, Toyota, Tenable, Verisign and Adobe.  Garfield explained that China is one of the most important bilateral relations in the United States. As the two largest economies in the world, the range of interconnected interests is immense.  "It's hard to think of any product that does not include ideas or components that come from the United States and China. As such, China is not a country from which our companies or the United States can move away. Unfortunately, China has abused the privilege of being a member of the WTO, "he said.  On March 22, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) released the results of an investigation of Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 on the practices of the Chinese government with respect to to the transfer of technology and intellectual property.  The report details four methods that the Chinese government uses to unfairly advance its industrial policy objectives: forced transfer of intellectual property or technology; discriminatory licensing restrictions; acquisition of technology and assets coordinated or supported by the State; and use of cyber intrusions to obtain unauthorized access to corporate information of a confidential nature.  "China has promised open and fair trade, but instead enacted rules, regulations and practices aimed at taxing non-Chinese companies. This current approach can not be sustained. Consequently, we recognize the need to create a fair and reciprocal trade relationship with China, "Garfield added.  While the ITI supports the Research 301 process and believes that the USTR's final report was comprehensive, he said he can not endorse the approach to tariffs as a solution.  rmorales@eleconomista.com.mx Load-Date: April 10, 2018End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 27 of 313China's president offers US possible trade concessions  Page 30 of 313Hikvision, Dahua and Hytera target of government technology ban  Page 32 of 313China tries to defuse trade pressure, says world benefits  Page 34 of 313China tries to defuse trade pressure, says world benefits  Page 39 of 313Bloomberg and the China Center for International Economic Exchanges (CCIEE) Announce New Economy Forum in China, Convening 400 Influential World and Business Le....  Page 44 of 313Bloomberg and the China Center for International Economic Exchanges (CCIEE) Announce New Economy Forum in China, Convening 400 Influential World and Business Le....  Page 49 of 313Bloomberg and the China Center for International Economic Exchanges (CCIEE) Announce New Economy Forum in China, Convening 400 Influential World and Business Le....  Page 51 of 313China and the US have engaged in a full-fledged trade war  Page 55 of 313What Did You Do in the Trade War, Daddy?  Page 57 of 313World's First House-Sharing Industry Association Established in China by Xiaozhu.com, Airbnb China, and China State Information Center  Page 59 of 313DAINES CALLS FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN CHINA  Page 61 of 313Sen.
