European shares hit a two-year low and indexes across Asia dropped sharply. The new development comes amid a ceasefire in trade war between the United States and China over trade tariffs.        Load-Date: December 6, 2018End of Document

'China hack attack hits Apple and Amazon'Stillman Advance: Stillman CollegeOctober 4, 2018 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: HI-TECH; Pg. 1Length: 501 wordsByline: Sandy MccarthyBodyThat one-time event was determined to be accidental and not a targeted attack against Apple.China's ministry of foreign affairs responded by insisting it was a "resolute defender of cyber security". Companies including component manufacturers Huawei and ZTE, as well as surveillance camera-maker Hikvision, have all fallen under intense suspicion and scrutiny from the USA government in the past year.The reported Chinese chip in motherboards was discovered in 2015.It said the first information about the spying campaign had emerged during security testing carried out by Amazon in 2015 before it had started using servers from United States company Elemental, which had been manufactured by Super Micro Computer at plants in China.The report in Bloomberg says that Chinese state spies inserted microchip the size of rice grain into motherboard manufactured in Chinese factories for a company called Super Micro.Nintendo Online Cloud Saves Can Be Recovered Even If Subscription EndsIn fact, much of the Nintendo Switch Online classic gaming library operates exactly like the Classic Edition consoles do. But don't wait too long because Nintendo will only keep the files on its servers for 180 days .In total, Bloomberg says, the hack - which USA officials have branded as "the most significant supply chain attack known to have been carried out against American companies", allowed the Chinese government to spy on nearly 30 American companies. Apple and Amazon, however, both deny working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation on a top-secret probe. It's untrue that AWS knew about a supply chain compromise, an issue with malicious chips, or hardware modifications when acquiring Elemental. "Over the course of the past year, Bloomberg has contacted us multiple times with claims.of an alleged security incident at Apple", the company said in an emailed statement to Bloomberg.Amazon subsidiary Amazon Web Services, which provides on-demand cloud computing platforms, was described in the Bloomberg story as having known about the malicious chips and working with the FBI to investigate the matter.Apple added that it had repeatedly provided on the record facts to refute "virtually every aspect of Bloomberg's story relating to Apple".Beyond an infected driver discovered in 2016 on a single Supermicro server found in Apple Labs, Apple says that such claims are "inaccurate". Bloomberg's piece is titled "The Big Hack" for a good reason, as it involves microchips planted in servers destined for big USA companies, which stealthily hooked to the networks their carrier hardware was hooked to. Its statement said: "While we would cooperate with any government investigation, we are not aware of any investigation regarding this topic nor have we been contacted by any government agency in this regard". The FBI declined to comment for the story.Update 15.02 BST: At the time of writing, five hours after Bloomberg's investigation was released, Supermicro's share price is down 30.42 percent to $14.89.Load-Date: October 5, 2018End of Document

Google Employees Protest Controversial Chinese Search Engine ProjectUSNEWS.comNovember 27, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 U.S. News & World Report All Rights ReservedSection: CIVIC; National News; Vol.; No.Length: 528 wordsByline: Claire HansenHighlight: In an open letter, employees urged the company to stop work on a censored search engine for China.BodyGoogle employees on Tuesday demanded in an open letter that the company cancel a project to develop a controversial search engine for China. As of 3 p.m. Tuesday, over 200 employees had signed the open letter, which calls on the company to stop Project Dragonfly, a search engine that The Intercept reports would blacklist websites, censor terms about human rights and democracy, and allow the government to            track and monitor people's searches. SEE: [The Week in Cartoons, Nov. 26-30]"Our opposition to Dragonfly is not about China: we object to technologies that aid the powerful in oppressing the vulnerable, wherever they may be," the employees' letter read. "The Chinese government certainly isn't alone in its readiness to stifle freedom of expression, and to use surveillance to repress dissent. Dragonfly in China would establish a dangerous precedent at a volatile political moment, one that would make it harder for Google to deny other countries similar concessions." The letter was published in tandem with Amnesty International, which launched a global day of action against the project Tuesday and released its            own petition. Tuesday's open letter is not the first time Google employees have protested the project. After The Intercept reported on the secretive project in August, about 1,400 employees signed a internal letter opposing Dragonfly that was circulated on Google's internal communication systems, according to The New York Times. In August, a bipartisan group of 16 members of the House of Representatives sent a letter to Sundar Pichai, Google's CEO, raising questions and concerns about the project. That letter followed            similar concerns expressed by a bipartisan group of senators in August. According to details obtained by The Intercept, the search engine would remove content deemed sensitive by the country's ruling Communist Party. The tech company compiled a blacklist for censorship that included terms like "human rights," "student protest" and "Nobel Prize." The outlet also reported that prototypes of the project would link the search app to users' phones number, meaning that their searches could be tracked and traced. READ: [Google Expands Neighbourly, an App Just for India]"Google is too powerful not to be held accountable," Tuesday's letter read. "We deserve to know what we're building and we deserve a say in these significant decisions." The employees' letter comes after a similar response to news earlier this year that Google was working with the U.S. Department of Defense on Project Maven, an effort to develop artificial intelligence to analyze military drone footage, according to the tech news site Gizmodo. More than 3,000 employees signed a letter protesting the partnership, the Times            reported, and in June, the tech company said            it would not renew its contract with the government. Earlier this month, Google employees around the world walked out of work to protest the company's handling of sexual misconduct reports.Claire Hansen is a news intern at U.S. News & World Report.

Social data in ChinaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 12, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 546 wordsBody        In 2014, the Chinese government set out to achieve, by 2020, a comprehensive system capable of covering all its population and seeking an increase in social trust. One of the initial objectives was to mitigate commercial deception and thus identify companies that evacuate taxes , although today, thanks to advances in technology , the aim is to stimulate and reward good citizen behavior.  To date, several converging initiatives have been launched. For example, in the city of Rongcheng (370,000 inhabitants) 800 social credit points were initially assigned to each adult. The score varies: it increases, for example, if one performs voluntary work, donates blood, or contributes to the poor; and decreases due to traffic violations, unpunctuality in reservations and appointments, excessive purchases of alcohol and so on. Those who maintain high scores are publicly recognized and receive the benefit of fewer queues in hospitals or discounts in the use of gyms or public transport. A low score can even prevent you from traveling or getting a job.  Eight private companies have been authorized to launch pilot experiments in social credit measurement. Sesame Credit , a subsidiary of Alibaba (whose online platform already has 400 million buyers), has introduced an application by which its users authorize it to make an evaluation of their daily behavior, which then an algorithm qualifies. Baihe, the most popular dating service (90 million users), includes the Sesame Credit score in the description of the candidates. Already 200 million cameras record images that can affect the scores, a number that could triple soon. Because of the appetite generated by a market of 1.4 billion people, both Google and Microsoft have established research and data centers to participate in this market.  A lawyer, Lio Xiaolin , could not buy a plane ticket because he had breached, in the forms, a court order that obliged him to offer a public apology. The government has several other lists of people missing: for example, those who have circulated false rumors or have been discovered smoking on trains. In some provinces, mobile phones of debtors in arrears are intervened with recordings that identify them as bad payers. The system could also be used for social monitoring of local authorities. Professor Du Liqun of Beijing University believes that the construction of a good system of this type should start with the designation of reliable authorities.  In 2018 all the companies licensed to operate in China - as well as NGOs, unions and associations - have been incorporated into an 18-digit register that will be integrated into the general social credit system yet to be finalized. There may even be issues of sovereignty involved. For example, Muji , a major Japanese store, was fined for this system because the wrapper of one of its products indicated that it had been manufactured in Taiwan.  His critics believe that this system of social credit in China will become an Orwellian tool of social monitoring that would facilitate political repression. The Chinese government, for its part, promotes and defends it as an adequate mechanism to stimulate social administrative efficiency and foster social trust, as well as the adequate behavior of its citizens. Load-Date: November 12, 2018End of Document

Vice President of the USA accuses China of trying to interfere in US policiesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishOctober 4, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 494 wordsBody        The vice president of the United States on Thursday accused China of trying to weaken President Donald Trump, at a time when the White House is deploying a new, more aggressive rhetoric against Beijing's trade, economic and foreign policy.  During a presentation at the Hudson Institute research center, Pence said that China is using its power in "more proactive and coercive ways to interfere with US policies and national policy."  "China wants a different American president," Pence added.  Pence spoke a week after Trump during a meeting of the United Nations Security Council accused China of interfering in the US elections to help their Democratic rivals. "Unfortunately, we have discovered that China is trying to interfere in the forthcoming legislative elections ," Trump said. "They do not want me to win, they do not want us to win because I am the first president to challenge China on the commercial issue." As proof, the president later referred to a commercial published in the newspaper The Des Moines Register by entities affiliated with the Chinese government.  The vice president accused China of focusing on "industries and states that would play an important role in the 2018 elections" in its response to the protectionist tariffs that Trump imposed on the Asian giant. "According to one estimate, more than 80% of the US counties that China has focused on voted for President Trump in 2016; now China wants those voters to oppose our government, "he said.  The US intelligence agencies claim that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election to place Trump on his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, by hacking and disseminating sensitive information and manipulation on social networks.  Trump signed an executive order in September that authorizes sanctions against those who have been shown to interfere in the elections, but US officials have repeatedly said that they have not seen the same level of activity on the part of Russia and others in the elections. half period of 2016.  Much of Pence's comments seek to inform the population of what the executive considers a Chinese campaign, both covert and direct, to gain influence.  Since Trump came to the White House last year, his administration has increased the pressure on China, more recently with several rounds of tariffs, taxes on each other, on goods worth billions of dollars. . Trump's first national security strategy released last year labeled China a "revisionist power" along with Russia.  According to the text, Pence cited an assessment by the US intelligence community that "China is targeting the United States, governments and state and local officials to exploit any division between the federal and local levels of politics. It is employing important issues, such as tariffs, to deepen the political influence of Beijing. "  The entry Vice President of the USA accuses China of trying to interfere in US policies was first published in La Tercera. Load-Date: October 4, 2018End of Document

China orders more lending to entrepreneurs amid trade spatAssociated Press Financial WireOctober 7, 2018 Sunday 7:02 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 330 wordsDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - Chinese banks were told by the government Sunday to lend more to entrepreneurs to help shore up flagging economic growth amid an escalating trade dispute with Washington.The central bank said it had released 750 billion yuan ($109 billion) for additional lending by reducing bank reserve requirements by 1 percent. It said the money was for small enterprises - the official term for private companies that generate China's new jobs and wealth.The dispute with the U.S. is adding to downward pressure on an economy that already was forecast to cool after Beijing tightened lending controls to rein in a debt boom.The Asian Development Bank says China's economy is expected to expand at a 6.6 percent annual pace this year but slow to 6.3 percent in 2019.U.S. President Donald Trump last month imposed a tariff increase on $200 billion of Chinese goods over what he has labeled unfair trading practices and intellectual property demands. Beijing responded by imposing penalties on $60 billion of American products. That was on top of an earlier duty increase by both sides on $50 billion of each other's goods.However, Beijing has refused to yield to U.S. complaints that the Chinese government steals or pressures foreign companies into handing over technology.The United States, Europe and other trading partners say initiatives such as "Made in China 2025," which calls for state-led creation of champions in robotics and other fields, violate Beijing's obligations to open up its market to foreign companies. American officials worry they might erode U.S. industrial leadership.In its Sunday statement, the Chinese central bank said some of the liquidity released by the reserve rate cut will be used to pay back 450 billion yuan ($65.5 billion) of a medium-term lending facility that will mature on Oct. 15.The cut will "fill in the liquidity gap of banks" without easing monetary policy and putting downward pressure on China's currency, the yuan, the bank said.Load-Date: October 8, 2018End of Document

Chinese, European Experts Share Techniques for Detection of Fraudulent Travel DocumentsTargeted News ServiceOctober 19, 2018 Friday 7:56 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 310 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: KUNMING, China BodyThe International Organization for Migration issued the following news release:The UN Migration Agency (IOM) and the Chinese National Immigration Administration (NIA) this week organized a two-day technical workshop in Kunming on the detection of fraudulent travel documents.Speakers, at the event, which ends today, included experts from FRONTEX, the Netherlands, France, Germany, Portugal and China. Participants included some 60 Chinese officials from central and provincial authorities and representatives of European Union (EU) Embassies and Consulates based in China.Delegates highlighted the need to continuously develop innovative methods to curb document and identity fraud, including the use of big data analytics, to keep up with increasingly sophisticated efforts by criminals to evade border controls.Speaking at the workshop, IOM Officer in Charge in China Richard Fairbrother said: "This discussion is hugely valuable because this challenge cannot be effectively addressed in isolation and requires concerted efforts with international partners."The Head of FRONTEX's Centre of Excellence for Combatting Document Fraud Claudio Kavrecic said: "Equipping frontline officers with training on examination techniques and sharing of latest trends on fraudulent practices is crucial.

Chinese online star detained for five days for 'insulting' national anthemCNN WireOctober 15, 2018 Monday 5:28 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 492 wordsByline: By Ben Westcott and Eric Cheung, CNNDateline: HONG KONG, China (CNN) BodyHONG KONG, China (CNN) --  A popular Chinese online personality who authorities claim "insulted" the country's national anthem has been put into detention for five days, local Shanghai police said in a statement.Yang Kaili, a 20-year-old live streamer with at least 44 million followers, was punished after some internet users reported her to the police for "insulting the integrity of the national anthem during a live broadcast."In a video of the original broadcast on October 7, Yang sits in her apartment waving her hands in the air, mimicking a conductor, then sings the initial lines of the "March of the Volunteers," China's national anthem.Usually in her videos, Yang sings and dances around while talking to fans who tune in for her broadcasts.Police said she had violated China's "National Anthem Law" during her broadcast and had been taken for five days of "administrative detention" by the Jing'an branch of the Shanghai Police Department.Under strict new laws imposed by the Chinese government in October 2017, people who "disrespect" the national anthem could go to jail for up to 15 days.There were even reports at the time Beijing was considering extending the punishment to three years in prison.Yang's detention stands in stark comparison to the ongoing US national anthem protests in the NFL, where despite outrage from US President Donald Trump, players continue to take a knee during the anthem to make a stand against racial injustice.'Not above the law'Yang posted a series of apologies to her Weibo account shortly after the incident, offering her "sincere apologies" to her fans and saying she felt ashamed."My action has deeply hurt everyone's feelings. Sorry, sorry to my motherland, sorry to my fans, sorry to netizens, sorry to the (live-streaming) platform," she said.She said she would stop all broadcasting work and perform self-reflection. "I will deeply reflect, and fully accept ideological, political and patriotic education, and study hard on the National Anthem law and relevant regulations," she said.Video live streaming has become a huge sensation in China in recent years, watched by millions of faithful viewers. It's not just for fun but also profit. Some influential streamers can make tens of thousands of dollars a month through gifts and sponsorships.But as it has grown in size and influence, Chinese authorities have repeated crackdown down on live-streaming services and the people who use them, including tight restrictions on platforms and popular usersIn their statement, the Shanghai police department said the national anthem represented "the symbol and sign of the nation.""All citizens and organizations should respect the national anthem, and protect the integrity of the national anthem," the police said, adding live-streaming platforms were "not above the law." "They also need to respect the law and be moral."TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

CHINA HOLDING MORE THAN 800 POLITICAL PRISONERS IN 2018: REPORTStates News ServiceDecember 31, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1009 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Authorities in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong have handed down a two-year jail term to a prominent anti-censorship campaigner after finding him guilty of subversion, a rights group said with the launch of its annual report detailing hundreds of prisoners of conscience held in the country.Zhen Jianghua was initially detained at his home in Guangdong's Zhuhai city on the night of Sept. 1, 2017 on suspicion of "incitement to subvert state power."He was tried in secret in Guangdong's Zhuhai city on Aug. 10, and sentenced to two years' imprisonment after the court found him guilty of "incitement to subvert state power," his former defense attorney Ren Quanniu told RFA."Given the particular circumstances of the case, two years is quite a harsh sentence," Ren said. "They could have given him a suspended sentence for this, but this is probably because he refused to cooperate and plead guilty."Zhen had registered a website overseas to elude ruling Chinese Communist Party censorship, and offered information about censorship, and circumvention tools for accessing the internet beyond the complex system of blocks, filters, and human censorship that make up China's Great Firewall.Ren, who was prevented from acting for Zhen by the authorities' refusal to allow him to meet with him and the secrecy around his trial, said he remains concerned about his former client."It has been more than a year since his initial detention, and we haven't had any news of him whatsoever," Ren said. "That is very worrying.""This whole case has been conducted behind closed doors, with no transparency," he said.Help from relatives blockedRen said police-run detention centers frequently prevent the relatives of political prisoners from sending them food and other necessities in detention."They won't let anyone deposit money for them," said Ren, who was denied permission to meet with Zhen on the grounds that the case touched on matters of "national security."Zhen, 34, once known by his online name GuestsZhen, was detained when he went to bring money to detained activists after taking part in a memorial event marking the death of late Nobel peace laureate and political prisoner Liu Xiaobo last July.According to the overseas rights group, Frontline Defenders, Zhen had also worked as a technical consultant with Human Rights Campaign in China, as an advising expert with Chinese Wikipedia, and as a project officer of a HIV/AIDS prevention education project in Zhuhai, run by the Hong Kong AIDS Foundation.He had previously been detained by state security police for traveling to Guangdong's rebel village of Wukan following a crackdown by armed police in September 2016, on suspicion of inciting protests there, the group said.The news of Zhen's sentencing came as the Weiquanwang rights website published its annual reporting detailing more than 800 political prisonersincluding dissidents, rights activists, lawyers, and those who complain about the ruling Chinese Communist Partybehind bars in 2018.'Compulsory treatment'This year's tally of 879 prisoners of conscience also included Deng Yaoqiong, a woman incarcerated in a psychiatric facility in the central province of Hunan after she live-streamed video of herself splashing ink on a poster of President Xi Jinping.Dong Yaoqiong was sent for "compulsory treatment" after she streamed live video of herself splashing ink on a poster of President Xi in Shanghai, in protest at "authoritarian tyranny" on July 4.She is being held as a psychiatric patient in a women's ward in Hunan's Zhuzhou No. 3 Hospital. Her father Dong Jianbiao and Beijing artist-activist Hua Yong were also detained when they spoke out about her detention.Beijing artist Guo Zi said Hua Yong is now in contact with the outside world after his detention, but that nothing has been heard from Dong Yaoqiong or her father."It was a kind of solidarity with a fellow artist; he was exercising his freedom of speech in a normal manner," Guo said. "All he did was express his opinion to the media, and he was detained.""It's nearly 2019 now, and it's a great tragedy that there is still no legal framework being implemented for the freedom of speech ... nearly 20 years into the 21st century," he said.Life in dangerAnother political prisoner, veteran democracy activist Wang Bingzhang, has warned that his life is in danger in prison, where he is serving a life sentence for "espionage" in the southern province of Guangdong.Wang made the comments to his daughter, who visited him on Christmas Day."Wang Bingzhang personally told his daughter that he had a hunch that his life was in danger," Wang's brother Wang Bingwu told RFA on Monday."In particular, he said that if he met with an unfortunate end, it wouldn't be from health or physical problems, because his health was OK.""He also said it wouldn't be from the prison staff, but we don't know much about what my brother meant by this," he said.Mass incarceration of MuslimsPatrick Poon, China researcher for the London-based rights group Amnesty International, said the mass incarceration of Muslim Uyghurs and other ethnic groups in the northwestern region of Xinjiang has been a major concern during 2018.The authorities have also stepped up a nationwide crackdown on religious believers, shutting down churches and mosques and detaining anyone who resists."Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Hui Muslims, and other Muslim minorities have been persecuted to a high degree, and we have heard reports of torture and inhumane treatment," Poon said.Meanwhile, a crackdown on human rights lawyers and associated activists begun in July 2015 continues to widen, while political prisoners are denied a fair trial in Chinese courts."The Chinese government should stop all of this persecution, and respond to concern from the international community by releasing all political prisoners," Poon said.Reported by Lau Siu-fung for RFA's Cantonese Service, and by Liu Fei for the Mandarin Service.

Trudeau says third Canadian detained in China but denies Huawei linkCNN.comDecember 18, 2018 Tuesday 4:21 AM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: ASIALength: 457 wordsByline: By Paula Newton and Ben Westcott, CNNDateline: Ottawa BodyA third Canadian citizen, Sarah McIver, has been detained in China, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has confirmed, but he denied it was linked to the arrest of a Chinese executive in Vancouver this month.Speaking to reporters Wednesday, Trudeau said he was taking the matter "extremely seriously" but the detention was more "routine" than two earlier cases."We are still very much in the situation of collecting more information on this and I wouldn't want to say anymore than that," he added.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying wouldn't confirm McIver had been detained, but said on Thursday that the Canadian had received an "administrative penalty (for) illegal employment."Hua added that McIver's situation was different from the two other Canadian detainees. "The previous two have been put under compulsory measures by state security on suspicion of endangering China's national security. This person was given administrative penalty," she said.Canada's Global Affairs department told CNN it was providing assistance to McIver's family but couldn't release any more information.The two other Canadians detained in China have been identified as Michael Kovrig, a former Canadian diplomat now working for a non-profit organization, and Michael Spavor, a businessman.Those detentions were seen by many as retaliation for Canada's December 1 arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Chinese technology giant Huawei, at the request of the US over alleged violations of Iran sanctions.There has been no official confirmation the detentions were linked to Meng's case but the Chinese government has made clear its anger at her arrest, with numerous furious editorials in state-run media.On Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying urged Canada to "immediately rectify its mistakes" and release Meng."No matter what ridiculous pretexts they come up with, covering up under the appearance of being legitimate cannot cover up their ignorance for the real facts and their contempt for the rule of law, and people around the world are ridiculing them for this," she told reporters.Speaking Wednesday, Trudeau said Canadian officials were working with their Chinese counterparts on the previous two detentions."We are going to continue to defend them, to stand up for them, to ask for more information on the charges being brought forward (and) the reasons for detention," Trudeau said.Meng was released on bail on December 11 and is waiting in Vancouver for the next stage of her trial, which could see her extradited to the US.When asked on Wednesday about the third detainee, Hua said she had no information on the topic. "I'm not aware of the incident you mentioned, I haven't heard of that," she said.Load-Date: December 21, 2018End of Document

CHINA SHAKEN BY FOREIGN INVESTMENT SLOWDOWNStates News ServiceDecember 28, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1559 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:An analysis by Michael LelyveldPeople visit a booth displaying smartphones and electronics made by the South Korean multinational conglomerate Samsung at the Mobile World Conference in Shanghai, June 27, 2018.AFPHave foreign investors lost interest in China? Based on the latest official figures, it appears that investors may be holding back until the outcome of the trade war with the United States becomes known. As with much of the official data in China, the evidence is clouded, fragmented and inconclusive. Yet, despite the uncertainties over Chinese statistics, it seems clear that foreign investment growth has fallen far below the double-digit rates of a decade ago. Some reports have been quick to cite a "sharp deterioration in business confidence" among China investors following a steep drop in November's foreign direct investment (FDI), reported by the Ministry of Commerce (MOC). FDI for the month plunged 26.3 percent from a year earlier to 92.1 billion yuan, the MOC said in December. The November decline looked even worse in dollar terms, as U.S. $13.6 billion of FDI fell 27.6 percent year-on-year, the official Xinhua news agency said. Investors in China were "spooked" by fears of more tariff increases "at a time of high uncertainty about the impact the dispute was having on China's economy," the South China Morning Post reported on Dec. 13. "Given the prospect of additional tariffs, foreign companies are afraid to invest in China now," the paper quoted Shen Jianguang, chief economist at JD Finance in Beijing, as saying. As evidence of the cooling trend, the report cited a recent decision by California-based camera maker GoPro Inc. to move some production out of China and a reported plan by South Korea's Samsung Group to close a smartphone factory in the northeastern city of Tianjin. 'Base effect' argument The FDI results were perhaps the worst of the economic figures released for the month, which was generally marked by a slowdown of growth rather than absolute declines. The MOC had a ready explanation for the poor monthly showing on FDI, noting the "high base of comparison" with a surge of investment recorded in November 2017. A check of the record appears to support the "base effect" argument, since the MOC reported a 90.7-percent jump in FDI a year earlier, although there has been no explanation for the sudden increase. FDI for the full year rose at a much milder 7.9-percent rate in yuan terms, boosting the total to a record high. But 11-month FDI numbers for 2018 are significantly lower, dropping 1.3 percent from a year earlier to 793.3 billion yuan and rising only 1.1 percent in dollar terms to U.S. $121.3 billion, the MOC said. Xinhua called the FDI inflows for the 11-month period "basically stable." Loss of confidence in China may be one explanation for the falloff. Investors may also be waiting to see what new opportunities emerge from negotiations with the United States before making commitments. If that is the case, FDI growth could rebound in 2019. Reasons for caution Derek Scissors, an Asia economist and resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, noted several likely causes of the apparent slump but also reasons for caution in drawing conclusions. "Changes in monthly FDI numbers can be driven by a single disbursal. No repeat a year later and there's a 'crash,'" he said by email, warning against over-interpreting the results. FDI numbers are often "a product of Chinese money sent overseas coming back," said Scissors. In that case, there may be variable effects from government policies and capital controls. The MOC report suggests that FDI totals are the result of many smaller investments rather than big headline deals. In the 11-month period, the agency recorded 54,703 new overseas-funded ventures, an increase of 77.5 percent. But Scissors believes that "true foreign money is declining faster than 1.1 percent. Why? Because China's economy has been slowing," he said. Official statements from the government and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) have stressed "resilience" in the face of economic pressures. But growth rates were already on a steady decline before the trade war with Washington accelerated the slide. "Many economists say the slowdown is the worst since the global financial crisis a decade ago," The New York Times reported on Dec. 14. It may be too soon to see an impact from shifts in U.S. tariff policy, or the mild market access concessions that China has announced so far, said Scissors. "My guess is that new or existing potential investors are inactive and waiting for clarity," he said.Easing investment curbs Over the past year, China has outlined plans to ease investment curbs for a limited number of sectors. Last April, the government took the first step in the auto sector, ending foreign share limits for manufacturers of new energy vehicles (NEVs) and gradually allowing majority ownership of joint ventures for other car makers in the next several years. In June, the government announced more opening-up measures with a long-awaited revision of its "negative list," trimming the number of sectors off-limits to foreign investors from 63 to 48. The new list offered 22 measures to phase out prohibitions in "finance, transportation, professional services, infrastructure, energy, resources and agriculture," state media said. The government has promised that more access for foreign investment is on the way. On Dec. 23, an MOC official told Xinhua that the negative list is likely to be shortened further in 2019. In the past week, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress took steps to unify China's legislation on foreign investment, which is currently covered by three separate laws. Under the new draft law, foreign companies would receive "pre-established national treatment ... and have equal rights to participate in activities, including issuing stock and government procurement," Xinhua said on Dec. 23. And in an apparent scramble to signal concessions before expected tariff talks in January, the government announced new deletions from its separate "market access negative list" on Dec. 25. The new list for market access would cut 177 items, leaving 151 restrictions, and eliminate 288 specific rules, while 581 remain in place, Xinhua said. Response from investors But the response from investors until now has been underwhelming. There have been few takers for the breaks in the automotive sector so far. Despite initial enthusiasm, most foreign automakers have decided to stand pat with their local partners after investing heavily in their existing arrangements. In any case, the changes for passenger car joint ventures would not be allowed until 2022. A further complication is that the investment break comes just in time for a downturn in the auto market. Some recently-opened factories are already standing idle, The Wall Street Journal reported this week. The government also plans to open the financial sector with eased limits for banks, asset managers, investment firms and insurers under new rules announced in May. This week, the official English-language China Daily reported that international firms are rushing to apply for business licenses to take advantage of the asset management opportunities. One reported investment in financial services follows the recent approval for Swiss-based UBS Group AG to raise its share in its Chinese brokerage joint venture from 24.99 percent to 51 percent. The decision is notable in light of the company's reported warning in October to some of its bankers not to travel to China after a Singapore-based employee was detained and prevented from leaving the country. UBS has not commented on the matter, according to news agencies. In a statement carried by Xinhua on Dec. 1, CEO Sergio Ermotti stressed the company's long-term commitment to the Chinese market. "The further opening up of China's financial sector represents great opportunities for our wealth management, investment bank and asset management businesses," Ermotti said. Risk will continue While the attractions for foreign investment are likely to continue, so will the risks. China's tit-for-tat detentions of three Canadian citizens followed the detention of Huawei Technologies CFO Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver at the request of U.S. prosecutors, further complicating prospects for international business. Scissors said it is too soon to tell whether the cases will affect investment decisions. "There's not enough of a detention pattern for it to matter yet," he said. Economic growth rates and opportunities may be the biggest factors for FDI recovery in the coming year. But far more significant market opening may be needed to reverse long-term trends. A look back at FDI data shows that growth has been falling steadily for well over a decade after hitting an average annual rate of over 26 percent in 2004-2008, according to World Bank statistics. China last recorded double-digit FDI growth in 2010. Scissors said that if trade war tensions continue in the coming year, the effect on foreign investment may not show up in the official reporting. "The signal of a major downward move will not be official numbers, of course, but multinationals independently reporting disinvestment," he said.Load-Date: December 29, 2018End of Document

It is part of an overall economic policy of developing China at American expense," said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers. "We cannot tolerate a nation's stealing our firepower and the fruits of our brainpower. We will not tolerate a nation that reaps what it does not sow."Justice Department officials said Xu was arrested in Belgium on April 1after being lured there with the promise of obtaining information about GE Aviation and added they waited to unseal the charges until he was extradited.Assistant director of the FBI's Counterintelligence Division, Bill Priestap, said the "unprecedented extradition of a Chinese intelligence officer exposes the Chinese government's direct oversight of economic espionage against the United States."Load-Date: October 11, 2018End of Document

Chinese companies paying employees to buy Huawei after CFO arrestStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeDecember 28, 2018 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: MARKETS; Pg. 1Length: 629 wordsByline: Jean GarciaBodyFollowing the arrest of its CFO and ban threats from governments around the world, Chinese telecom company Huawei is now getting support from companies in its home market.Apple does a great deal of business in China.In protest, a Zhejiang-based telecom company released a notice titled "An announcement regarding resisting Apple and supporting Huawei" to its employees. Fuchun Technology, a communications service company listed on Shenzhen Stock Exchange announced on social media on December 11 that it would give each of its 200 employees who buy Huawei's smartphone before the end of 2018 between 100 and 500 yuan ($14.5 to $72.5). Overall, Huawei has gained support from more than 200 Chinese businesses. Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, was apprehended at the request of the U.S government under the claims that the Chinese telecom company violated US sanctions on the sale of products that feature American technology to Iran.Unfortunately, Huawei has had a rough year, and these fellow companies that specialize in tech sectors to breweries, have come together to show their support.The timing of Meng's arrest was notable because it came during the ongoing trade dispute between China and the US, caused by President Donald Trump's decision to apply tariffs on $200 billion worth of imported Chinese goods.A regional government official has claimed that several hundred businesses were conducting similar programs across the country, reports Nikkei. He stressed, however, that the option to choose Huawei over Apple products was "based on voluntary decisions".Chinese electronics maker Shanghai Youloke Electronic and Technology said it will fully subsidize up to two Huawei smartphones per employee, while a communications service company, Fuchun Technology, is offering employees a sum of 100-500 yuan (Rs. 1,020-5,100) to purchase Huawei's smartphones. It has threatened to confiscate Apple devices from its employees and fire them if they don't adhere to the rules. But, one thing is clear, Apple products have now lost the reputation of the status symbol that they once enjoyed in the country.People are not one bit pleased about Instagram's new updateThe change trended under the #instagramupdate hashtag on Twitter, accompanied by mostly negative comments. There is no option in the settings part of the app to change the feed back to the original one either.The call to support Huawei and boycott Apple products follows the arrest of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou in Canada. The executive was apprehended during a layover between flights at the request of the USA government.Some other Chinese companies are also boycotting Apple.She is accused by the U.S. of misleading financial institutions regarding transactions in Iran, that violated United States sanctions. During the 2012 protests over China's dispute with Japan over the Senkaku Islands, there was a mass boycott of Japanese vehicle manufacturers for example. The collaboration was meant to see AT&T carry the Mate 10 range of Android phablets but the telecom giant dropped the initiative mere hours before the thereof was meant to be officially announced at this year's CES, having reportedly been pressured to do so by USA legislators and regulators who threatened it with scrapping its lucrative federal contracts if it proceeds with the idea of working with Huawei.The american government has expressed concern over the fact that both companies might have installed spying devices into their products.It's not uncommon for Chinese consumers to boycott companies that have had bad relations with Beijing - South Korean Hyundai Motor and Lotte faced similar problems just past year, when Seoul deployed a U.S missile defense system.Apple has recently lost its legal battle against Qualcomm in China.Load-Date: December 28, 2018End of Document

European Union diplomatic cables hack linked to China, NYT claimsCNN.comDecember 18, 2018 Tuesday 2:52 AM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICSLength: 536 wordsByline: By Joshua Berlinger, CNNBodyA cybersecurity firm says hackers were able to infiltrate a European Union communications system for years and copy thousands of sensitive diplomatic cables, The New York Times has reported.Area 1, the cybersecurity firm which discovered the vulnerability, said thousands of EU diplomatic cables were accessed using "techniques resembling those long used by an elite unit of China's People's Liberation Army," according to the Times.The EU's secretariat told the Times it was "aware of allegations regarding a potential leak of sensitive information and is actively investigating the issue."If confirmed, such a hack would represent a stunning breach of security in what appears to be an audacious act of espionage.In a statement to CNN, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said reports like the one published by the Times are "suspicious, groundless" and "extremely irresponsible.""China is itself a victim of cyberspying and cyberattacks, and China is a defender of cybersecurity," the statement added. "China stands firmly against criminal hacking activities, and will pursue criminals it according to laws. If there is any evidence, relative departments will investigate."The Times said Area 1 supplied more than 1,100 hacked EU cables, a selection of which the news outlet posted online. An Area 1 representative told CNN it would release more information soon.Based in California, Area 1 was co-founded by three former employees of the US National Security Agency, according to the company's website.The communications reveal deep concerns about the Trump administration's negotiations with China, Russian relations with Western Europe and Iran's nuclear program.Though the trove made available by the Times online included many standard reports from diplomats, some documents contain particularly sensitive information -- including summaries of private meetings between top EU officials and leaders from around the world.One cable from July published by the Times about trade negotiations said the US was "behaving as if it was fighting in a no-rules freestyle boxing match" in talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping. It's unclear who made that characterization.Trump and Xi reached a temporary truce in the trade war this month, easing investor concerns. But the ceasefire didn't end the trade war. The tariffs already imposed remain in force and new ones could still be imposed. Washington and Beijing have simply agreed to take time out to talk.Chinese state-sponsored hackers have repeatedly been accused of targeting Beijing's adversaries, claims which the Chinese government denies.This month, a massive 2014 data breach at the Marriott hotel chain -- in which 327 million people had their names, phone numbers, email addresses, passport numbers and dates of birth exposed -- was reportedly traced back to China.Cybersecurity firm FireEye last year accused state-sponsored Chinese hackers of attempting to infiltrate a US-built missile defense system deployed in South Korea.Washington contends that the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system is a countermeasure against North Korea's missiles, while Beijing fears its extremely powerful radar could be used to monitor activities inside China.Load-Date: December 20, 2018End of Document

Washington and Beijing have simply agreed to take time out to talk.Chinese state-sponsored hackers have repeatedly been accused of targeting Beijing's adversaries, claims which the Chinese government denies. This month, a massive 2014 data breach at the Marriott hotel chain -- in which 327 million people had their names, phone numbers, email addresses, passport numbers and dates of birth exposed -- was reportedly traced back to China.Cybersecurity firm FireEye last year accused state-sponsored Chinese hackers of attempting to infiltrate a US-built missile defense system deployed in South Korea.Washington contends that the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system is a countermeasure against North Korea's missiles, while Beijing fears its extremely powerful radar could be used to monitor activities inside China.CNN's Nanlin Fang, Michael Callahan and Diane Ruggiero contributed to this reportTM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Chinese Entrepreneurs Visited Germany for Deeper Industrial Digitalization CooperationPR NewswireNovember 13, 2018 Tuesday 3:29 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 766 wordsDateline: BEIJING, Nov. 13, 2018 BodyPR NewswireA group of Chinese entrepreneurs, comprised of over 20 delegates, participated in a weeklong tour of Germany from November 4 to November 10th, 2018. The visit was organized by the China Green Company Alliance, under China Entrepreneurs Club (CEC), in order to deepen Sino-German cooperation in industrial digitalization and innovation, as well as to seek out business, and investment opportunities.Germany is currently China's biggest partner in technology exporting, with China as Germany's largest trading partner. The 2 countries have strong business connections over motors, automobiles, new energy, information networks, energy conservation and environmental protection, electric vehicles, etc. The Chinese and German governments have reached a strategic cooperation agreement between the German Industry 4.0 and China Manufacturing 2025.The delegation is interested in companies working in manufacturing innovation, industrial digitalization and hidden champions. Their intention is to further business opportunities with German companies in the aforementioned areas. Most of the entrepreneur delegates are leading business people working in manufacturing, finance and environmental service.The weeklong tour consisted of 9 business visits, starting with KUKA Robotics Corp on its innovative technologies and production systems, and followed by visits to observe FC Bayern Munich in its business operations, BYTON in its entrepreneurial innovation; the excellence of craftsmanship in Daimler AG and its digital, green and sustainable manufacturing, and startup cultivation in Factory Berlin; SAP's smart enterprise strategy; in-depth interpretation of hidden champions by Simon-Kucher & Partners, and the promotion of Sino-German business cooperation by Germany Trade & Invest (GTAI).The delegation visited the Chinese Embassy in Germany, where participants heard a speech from Ambassador Shi Mingde on Sino-German economic and trade cooperation, German industry 4.0, and German manufacturing.  The Ambassador explained that, in 2017, China became Germany's largest trading partner, with a trade volume of more than 180 billion Euros, which is more than the sum of Britain, France and Italy. With regards to investments in mergers and acquisitions, Germany accounts for more than half of the total in Europe. Germany's advanced enterprise management experience and keen pursuit of quality are worth understanding for Chinese companies, but after learning these lessons, Chinese companies must develop their innovation independently. Entrepreneurs are representatives for most developed business models and contribute greatly to economic development. The Chinese Embassy has promoted the cooperation between many Chinese projects in Germany, and will continue to do so. Some delegation members consulted Ambassador Shi Mingde and the Minister Counselor Wang Weidong with regards to the German M&A policy, China's investment trends in Germany, and strategies for medium-sized enterprises going abroad.During the weeklong visit, members of the China Green Company Alliance delegation had several in-depth discussions with visiting companies. As the representatives of China's high-speed growth enterprises, the delegates analyzed the difficulties of their own industries in the global digital age. Additionally, it served as a practical method of observing the spirit of Chinese and German entrepreneurship, and has paved the way for closer cooperation with German companies in the future.About China Green Company AllianceThe China Green Company Alliance is a value-sharing platform organized by the China Entrepreneurs Club (CEC) to promote alliances and establish sustainable business competitiveness. With the mission of "building a long-term foundation and promoting innovation and growth", it builds an enterprise-level interactive learning platform through annual forums, corporate interactive learning and overseas study, focusing on the innovation and growth of Chinese business, and promoting the deep interaction between business elites, helping the healthy development and the long-term success of the company.

How to win in AfricaMcKinsey & CompanyNovember 20, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 McKinsey & Company, Inc All Rights ReservedLength: 5215 wordsByline: McKinsey QuarterlyHighlight: The right strategy can unlock strong, profitable growth, explain the authors of Africa's Business Revolution.Body Link to Image In this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, Simon London speaks with McKinsey senior partners Acha Leke and Georges Desvaux about the opportunity before companies to develop and grow their businesses in Africa. Podcast transcriptSimon London: Hello, and welcome to this edition of the McKinsey Podcast, with me, Simon London. When you think about Africa, what comes to mind? It's hard not to be swayed by years of news reports of crisis and conflict. But as we'll hear, another narrative is starting to take hold. It's one centered on urbanization, technology, rising incomes, and better government. It's a story told compellingly in a new book, Africa's Business Revolution, coauthored by McKinsey partners Acha Leke and Georges Desvaux and McKinsey alumnus Mutsa Chironga. I was lucky enough to catch up with Acha and Georges in person for a wide-ranging conversation about Africa's business scene today, how and why it's changing, and why Africa might just be the world's next great growth market.Georges and Acha, welcome to the podcast, thanks for being here.Acha Leke: Thanks for having us. Georges Desvaux: Delighted to be with you.Simon London: Imagine for a minute that I'm running a big multinational company. I've got options to invest in many different parts of the world. Why should I prioritize Africa? Why should I be thinking about scaling up in Africa in particular?Acha Leke: If you're a multinational company, there's no better place to invest in than in Africa. If you think of the continent today, it's young, it's fast growing, and it's urbanizing. Half of Africans are under the age of 19, so if you're taking a long-term, ten-, 20-, 30-year view, where else do you want to be?The continent is going to add another billion or so Africans over the next 20 to 30 years (Interactive). We'll have the largest working population, larger than China, in 6,000 days. And it's urbanizing, so we're the fastest-urbanizing region in the world. Every year we have 24 million Africans moving to cities. To reach them is not that difficult. You decide to focus on a few critical cities.As you put all that together, when you take a long-term view as a consumer-facing company, it's hard to think of a better place. I'll give an example. In Nigeria alone, there are more babies born every year than in the whole of Western Europe. If you're a diaper company, where would you want to be based?Georges Desvaux: It's a little like thinking about whether [companies] should have gone into China 25 years ago. Having lived in China at the time, you can see the parallels playing out in Africa. It's roughly the same population but also what I find quite extraordinary is the level of energy, the level of development. When you go to a city like Lagos, you really think you are in China 25 years ago.When you look at this and you look at the energy, the entrepreneurship, the drive, it will probably take a different shape and form, but it will actually develop. There are two differences which I think are very important: in Africa, the young population, as Acha mentioned, will drive the development on a different scale because we'll get to two billion people in the next 20 years.Second is the availability of technology. Where Africa is, contrary to where China was 25 years ago, is actually leapfrogging in many places with technology and that opens up a lot more opportunities that people may not have seen at this stage.Acha Leke: I'll add one thing that we mentioned in the book: we talked a lot about the population growth. But you also think about the growth of disposable income because what we're finding is there's GDP growth and that's translating into disposable-income growth. When you combine those two factors, it's more like exponential growth than linear growth. There are very few places in the world today where you will really get those two factors coming together that strongly.Simon London: You two must spend a lot of time talking with clients about Africa and the Africa opportunity. What are some of the misconceptions that you hear as you do that?Acha Leke: I would say there's a big difference between perception of risk versus the reality on the ground. A lot of clients who are not based on the continent tend to read the news and the sensational headlines you hear. And their view of the risk is quite different from what's on the ground. I used to have a client, a downstream oil company, and they said, "Look, we're in 30 countries. Every year five will blow up, but we don't know which ones. But the other 25 will do great." What they always told me was, "But we love being in Africa because we do very well. And so we're very happy for people out there to think Africa is too risky." They would come into the market, and they would have less competition. There's a big difference between perceived risk and the reality on the ground.Georges Desvaux:  And the other thing that I think people fail to realize is how important Africa already is in terms of the industrial or private sector. It is in fact doing quite well. We surveyed companies to understand how big they are in Africa. When we would ask executives in Africa or outside of Africa how many companies do you think have revenues of more than $1 billion a year, most people would argue between 50 and a hundred.Acha Leke:  Many wouldn't even say ten.Georges Desvaux:  Some would say ten. And the reality is there are more than 400 of them. Not only are they large institutions but on top of that they tend to grow faster than their peers in the world and be at least as profitable. It's actually a healthy place if you know what you're doing and if you know how to capture the opportunity.Simon London:  You're dead right. I read the book, and I was very surprised to find that number, 400 companies with over a billion dollars of revenue.Acha Leke:  There are only two people who have gotten that number right, and each time we do the presentation we typically ask, "How many such companies do you think exist?" The last time I did it was actually in Barcelona two weeks ago, and the answer we got was between ten and 20. Typically they tell us 50 to 100, one of the two people who have gotten it right was Aliko Dangote, who has a good feel for what's going on in the continent as we know. He is the richest African and the richest black man in the world. But very few people realize the extent of how big the private sector is and the scale of the kind of companies you can build on the continent.Georges Desvaux:  And part of the reason why they don't realize how big the private sector is is because 70 percent of those companies are African. If you're African, you know. Africans CEOs figured out and are very happy with what's happening and what they are able to achieve. But the rest of the world typically underestimates what's happening because they heard about all the failures, and the ones who are active and successful tend to be quite understated.Simon London:  Just to be devil's advocate, the political risk is very real as you pointed out, Acha. There are certain countries, in any given five-year period where there will be more political risk and volatility than there might be in some other regions of the world. How do you respond to that? As a CEO, how do you manage around that?Acha Leke:  Let's be clear: there are risks. Political is one, so we urge our clients simply to think not just from a growth perspective but also combine growth and risk. When you do that you see three very clear sets of countries that emerge. There are the countries that are quite stable and growing fast. And that tends to be the East African and the francophone African countries. So the Rwandas and the Ethiopias of the world, but also you see some countries like Cote d'Ivoire, Morocco, countries like that. Then you have some that are what we call vulnerable growers, so they're still growing but they've been exposed to some of the shocks. The oil shocks affected places like Nigeria and Angola. Then you have a set of countries that have struggled to just grow. Places like South Africa. Those are the three segments, and in the past as an executive looking at the continent you could literally go anywhere and you'd find growth. Now you have to be a lot more granular, a lot more careful because there are pockets of growth where it's more important to really understand the situation on the ground. Because when you find growth, you have to really get a better sense for how the countries are doing but how the sector even is doing in the country you're interested in. Georges Desvaux:  You also have to look at it and say, this is a long-term play. This is a 20-, 30-years play. It's the same as China was 30 years ago, India was 15 years ago. Africa is going to be the next pillar of growth because of demographics, because of the natural resources, because of urbanization. And so what you need to do is you need to build the resilience that enables you to manage the risks that are inherent to those three different types of countries that Acha was talking about in order to make sure you are able to go through and weather the storms at some point.Because you take a country like Nigeria, for example, which many people would say, "Well, it's difficult, it's dangerous, there are risks, there is Boko Haram, there are issues." But there are 180 million inhabitants, with a striving group of entrepreneurs who are really driving very hard to develop their own enterprises, and that's a force that you cannot ignore. And you have that with Nigeria, you have Ethiopia with about 90 million people. You have the whole francophone West Africa, which is another 100 million, so those are massive places where people are really trying hard to develop and build their economies. Acha Leke:  Definitely, I think diversifying your portfolio makes sense. What we've found is the most successful companies have typically been across multiple countries because like I said, you just never know when something could happen. If you look at the multinationals that have been most successful, they've been in ten or more countries and they've been here for a long time. So that's one. But the second thing, which is important, is we've also realized in building these companies that have revenues over a billion dollars, it's very difficult to build a billion-dollar business if you're not in one of three economies.If not in South Africa, Nigeria, or Egypt, it's just very difficult, you just don't have enough scale. As you think about diversifying your portfolio think also about what is the role that one or many of these three countries will play in that portfolio. Simon London:  Just talk a little bit more about what it takes to win in Africa. The backbone of the book is building for resilience in your strategy, taking that into account. That's clearly a lever. What are the other things that jump out to you? What's the secret sauce?Acha Leke:  A lot of the book was focused on what's the secret sauce. We found four elements to that and I'll bring them all together, and we'll talk about each (Exhibit 1). One was, as Georges talked about, mapping your Africa strategy, which is very much about where to play. Which countries should you play in? Do you want to do what I call a Vodacom strategy?Exhibit Link to Image Or do you want a MTN strategy , which is to go across multiple countries at once? You can be very successful at either one, but you need to pick. We always say if you're a consumer-facing company, think cities not countries. So what 20 cities do you want to be in versus what five countries? But that's really about, where do you want to play?Then after there's innovating a business model. What parts do you want to innovate in? We've seen a number of places who have innovated in products and services. We've seen others who could leverage technology to innovate. So you have to think about is it just driving costs down to really be one of the lowest-cost producers? There's a third element that we've talked about, and that's the resilience. How are you going to build resilience? How do you make sure that you're here for the long term, because you're going to have ups and downs. It's a continent. There are 54 countries. Through ups and downs, how do you build resilience? And within that is what parts of the value chain do you want to control? We've seen a lot of companies that have been successful have had to insource a lot of work they would typically outsource in other markets because they need to gain control of that. And then fourth is talent. How are you going to build the talent you need? And each of these on its own is not rocket science. But I'll say two things: where we've seen companies that have been successful, they've been able to be successful across each of those four elements. They've known exactly where to play, they've been very careful about where they're going to innovate, they've been very careful about how they build resilience. And they've found a way to really grow talent. The second thing we found, which is actually quite interesting for us, is the most successful companies have come up at it from wanting to do the right thing for the continent. So it's about what we call doing good by doing well. They didn't come here just because they wanted to make money. They said, "I want to solve a problem and on the back of that I will make money." You have a longer-term perspective. You have a mind-set of really trying to make a difference and improving people's lives. And on the back of that also being a quite successful company for its shareholders. Georges Desvaux:  One thing that's very clear in Africa is you need to really think hard about the product and services and be able ready to innovate. You could say that in most markets in the world, but I think it's particularly relevant in Africa because the needs are going to be quite local. You need to think about colors and taste and price points, and so it's not about replicating a business model or services that has worked somewhere else.There's an example of this Chinese company that was making smartphones for Africa. They are dedicated to building them for Africa. What they did is they modified the camera's features so that they can give better rendering for people with dark skin because that is something that is appealing to African consumers. So you really need to go down into the details, in the trenches of what really matters for African consumers, if you want to be relevant to them. Acha Leke:  Equity Bank is a bank in Kenya. What Equity has been able to do is provide banking services to millions and millions of Kenyans. What they did is leverage technology, and so they didn't go out to build a bunch of branches. Africa has the highest number of mobile money subscribers around the world; 100 million Africans use mobile money. That's because there's leapfrogging in that sector. They were not building branches. So that's one.But you see a lot of technology innovation across sectors. We started seeing it in the financial-services space. We're seeing it in energy. So at the time when you want to get energy through a region, you had to build these transmission lines all the way to villages. You would never be able to make a return on your investment. Governments didn't have money to build it. But now with some systems such as BBOXX and a number of other solar-home-system players leveraging mobile technology and leveraging mobile payment, you can literally buy a solar home system for yourself, take a loan for it and pay on a daily basis, and then pay it off, and on the back of that you can get a loan for another product. (See Exhibit 2 for an example of a solar home system.) Exhibit Link to Image Simon London:  Talk a little bit more about this whole concept of choosing where to play in the value chain, and in some cases actually integrating. Just talk a little bit more about why that might matter in the Africa context, and maybe a couple of examples?Georges Desvaux:  This notion of getting a real understanding of where in the value chain you need to create control and quality is very important to success. For example, in e-commerce for a company like Jumia, they will also try to control and improve their last mile and be able to deliver because they have to do it the same way that Alibaba and Tencent did it in China. They were placated because you can't get the last mile, so you have to control it and you have to have the right service level and you have the right security, safety for the goods, and so on and so forth. So in some cases you just have to have it in order to give the right level of customer satisfaction.Simon London:  And Jumia is Africa's e-commerce giant or trying to become Africa's e-commerce giant?Georges Desvaux:  So Jumia is replicating the whole idea of the e-commerce that has happened in China. They have 400,000 merchants online. It's developing very well, and it serves a need. The need is interesting because we talked a bit earlier about why would that work? Part of the reason and what they've found in Jumia is that a lot more of their sales came from the rural areas than expected. They expected everything to come from urban areas, and part of the reason is because there is no availability of retail stores.People who have decent income in more rural areas, they don't have the time, they can't really access an urban center, and they're very happy to transact online as long as they can get the delivery there. And so you come back to how do you guarantee- Simon London:  And that's the last mile?Georges Desvaux: And that's the last mile.Simon London:  So Amazon or whoever you can rely on, the United States Postal Service, or UPS, or whoever does your deliveries, but that's not available in rural Africa so they have to own that piece of the value chain.Acha Leke:  We always talk about Dangote. Twelve years ago, Nigeria imported all of its cement. Every bit of cement was imported and then-Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo had this discussion with him. He said, "What's it going to take for your cement importers to produce locally?" And Dangote said, "Well, give us an incentive to produce locally." What they decided was to implement what they called backward-integration policy. They said they'd only give licenses to import cement to those who can show them that they're building cement plants.They said, "This year you can import X amount and that's going to decrease every year. And after four years, you shouldn't import anything else. You won't have a license to import because your plant should be up and running." Fast forward: today Nigeria is a net exporter of cement. So they produce enough for the local market, and they export it, and they've created the richest black man in the world. So there's a big piece around import substitution. That's very important for our countries. We still import billions of dollars of food every year across the continent. And how much of that can you produce locally. That's important. And then as a company what you then need to do once you decide where you want to play there is understand how much of your inputs you need to control because of the inefficiencies in the ports; the inefficient infrastructure is a problem. Dangote, for example, has 10,000 trucks to go deliver the cement in more advanced markets. He could outsource that to somebody. But that's a huge competitive advantage to him, understanding where your company's advantage is and how you can control that. Georges Desvaux:  There is a massive need for producing locally for local demand. We estimate that there's about $500 billion worth of industrial manufacturing in Africa. We believe it could be doubled within a decade.Simon London:  So to a trillion?Georges Desvaux:  Roughly a trillion. But of that, contrary to what China was 30 years ago, in Africa, two-thirds would be for local consumption. All of this can be produced, and it's an opportunity that, for example, Chinese companies have seized. In Ethiopia, you have the largest ceramic tile factory in Africa and it was built by a Chinese company. It is one of the market leaders. And that has been replicated many times. So there's also this notion of just going where the needs are and building the right service model because the demand is there.Acha Leke:  It was funny because of that $500 billion of products that are manufactured today, Chinese companies account for about 12 percent. These are not products manufactured in China and imported on the continent. These are Chinese companies like the ceramic tile manufacturer based in Angola, in Kenya, in Cameroon, in Senegal, manufacturing locally about 12 percent of Africa's full production.Simon London:  I was going to ask you about that because there's been some McKinsey research when one reads about it in the media as well. On the ground, it's a very real phenomenon?Georges Desvaux:  China in Africa is incredibly real. It's interesting because I think there are a lot of myths about Chinese presence because what's generally reported is the whole infrastructure project and the project financing by the Chinese government and all of this, which does exist. But what I think is misunderstood is the sheer economic presence from the Chinese private sector. Our own research, we had to interview a thousand Chinese companies in Chinese to understand what really was happening.We believe there are about 10,000 Chinese companies operating in Africa. But 85 percent of them are private and they're private because these are Chinese entrepreneurs who 25 years ago in China built a manufacturing plant for flip-flops or for ceramic tiles. They realized that they can replicate this because they look at the market, there is a market, there is demand. There is just no supply. And so they build it. It's beneficial for Africa because about 85 percent of their employees are African. It is really an economic force that is misunderstood very often. Simon London:  So, as you say, the Chinese entrepreneurs, they're creating a lot of jobs. They're actually leveraging local talent. It's one of the themes of the book, as you mentioned, Acha. It's part of the secret sauce is that getting the talent right on the ground in Africa. Again, imagine I'm a CEO, what's the advice you give to me about how I think about talent in Africa?Georges Desvaux:  One of the things that always has been striking for me is, and quite different, I would say than Asia, to draw the parallel, is very senior leadership or top talent. You have very, very good talent in Africa. Very well educated. They went to all the best universities, come back, and there is a passion to be there. You also have the people at the front line who are extremely ambitious, want to develop, and they don't always have the right craftsmanship.What's really going to be a struggle for most people is going to be to develop the intermediary talent and to develop leadership over time. And that is really one of the challenges that we've heard many times. And so some people like Jumia, for example, have created a university to try to build their own middle management and build them over time. Some other people like an oil company, for example, is building technical and vocational training to create whole families of mechanics who can then open up their own garages that can then use the right products. The challenge is going to be around vocational talent and early management. Acha Leke:  I think I would agree. Over time as a multinational the question is, how do you Africanize your talent, right, and make it much more African? Some companies like GE and Standard Chartered, have been very, very successful. So there's a way to do it. To Georges's point, for the frontline workers, just also rethinking a bit what success looks like and what are the markers for success in these candidates? And take a bit of risk.Simon London: And being prepared to be flexible, to do some investment where you might not do it in other parts of the world. And to your point, Georges, thinking long term as well.Georges Desvaux:  That's going to take time to grow the talent and it has to be part of your strategy from day one. What you need to put in place is systems and the processes to make sure it happens. You give them the opportunities, give them the right coaching, the right training, and then when you do that, it grows over time. But the other thing about talent is an opportunity that's linked to diversity and gender diversity. You have a very strong talent pool with women, and women in Africa are already playing an important role in the economic society. That's also an area where you have an immense potential to develop talent and to develop strong African women leaders. Some of them are very impressive whether they're in the governments or others. They're quite influential. It is an area where I think, especially for multinationals, you have access to terrific talent.Simon London:  A lot of our conversation so far has been very positive and rightly very positive. There's a lot to play for in Africa clearly. But there are also some pretty big barriers to doing business in Africa. What's the reality of doing business on the ground and what are some of the barriers just to getting things done?Acha Leke:  There are clear barriers. Infrastructure is one. Look at the continent today, we are spending $80 billion a year on infrastructure. We used to spend $40 billion but we need to spend $150 billion. Infrastructure gets in the way, whether it's power, or it's roads, or it's airports, ports, across any asset class. We're completely underindexed relative to any other emerging market. There are ways around it, but that's a barrier. Ease of doing business if you look at the World Bank rankings. Many of the African countries are at the bottom of that ranking. A number have improved significantly. Nigeria, for example, went up 24 places last year. Rwanda has been a darling, as Mauritius has been. A lot of countries are making efforts to reform and make the business realm an easier. Simon London:  And ease of doing business to be practical is?Acha Leke:  Permitting. Starting the company.Paying taxes.Getting access to electricity for your business. All the normal things that business would expect that will be provided to them. Progress has been made on that but still a lot more needs to be made. Corruption is another issue that people talk about a lot on the continent, which is real. But it takes two to tango in this front as well, so it's not just blaming the government.There are a number of challenges, but those who have been successful have been those who have been able to take these challenges and recast them as opportunity. Because behind every challenge is an opportunity, and that's what differentiates the winners from the losers. Georges Desvaux:  Those barriers are real. But you have to take them into the perspective of, are they being addressed? Are they improving? The regional groupings-East Africa community, inside those regions, you can see the trade going up 15 percent or more. (See Exhibit 3 for a look at the eight economic communities on the continent.) Things are progressing, and to some extent, they remind me a little bit of the early days of China and Southeast Asia, where, in 2000, if you wanted to deliver trucks from Beijing to Guangzhou, you'd take two or three weeks and you had to stop at every border, at every provincial border. And there are no highways. That's where you are. But, it will get there, and you can find ways around it in the meantime. And then as the barriers improve, your business opportunity will continue.Exhibit Link to Image Acha Leke: And I'll give you another example: travel across Africa. McKinsey has been working in partnership with the African Development Bank and World Economic Forum on this because if we're going to-we could talk about Africa, but it's 54 countries. To be able to increase intra-Africa trade, the 75 percent of manufacturing for which there are opportunities in Africa needs to circulate across the continent. We need people to be able to travel around.Five years ago, we did this analysis and we showed then that, on average, an African needed visas for 60 percent of African countries. At the time, a European needed visas for 52 percent of African countries and an American needed visas for 45 percent of African countries. So it was easier for an American or European to travel across the continent. There were only five countries that allowed any African to travel-either you could go there without a visa or you could just get it on arrival. Only five. And we've been doing a lot of work, and we published a report every year that now the African Development Bank publishes called African Visa Openness Index, and the good news is today we have 20 countries. We're up to 20 that allow visa-free access to any African. That's out of 54 countries, so we still have a long way to go. But that's the kind of progress that has been made in five years. You already see a lot of impact on tourism, so a lot of impact on intra-Africa trade, and just travel from Africans visiting those countries. We're hoping to see much more of that going forward. Simon London:  I know there's ambitions for an Africa-wide free-trade area. Do we think that's going to happen in reality, and it's been approved in principle but now needs to be ratified.Acha Leke:  It's happening, we have a lot more countries. I think South Africa has actually signed up now. I think the only big country that hasn't signed up now is Nigeria. So it's going to happen. I think we realize it's 54 countries, and for us to really grow as a continent, we need one big economic community for us to be able to speak to a China or speak to an India. India and China each have the same amount of people, but it's one country. Under the leadership of African Union Chairman Paul Kagame, we got it ratified, which is great. You need a lot more countries to come on board. You need it passed by the local parliaments, but we're going to get there because everybody realizes that that is critical for us to be able to carry our weight as a continent globally.Simon London:  I think that's all we have time for, but, Acha Leke and Georges Desvaux, thank you very much for joining us. Great conversation.Acha Leke:  Thank you for having us. We're looking forward to seeing many more companies accessing the African opportunity.Georges Desvaux:  Thank you again, and we hope that you will enjoy the book and that it will draw your interest into very practical actions to be present in Africa.Simon London:  And thanks as always to you, our listeners.

China's ByteDance is taking the social media world by stormCNN WireOctober 19, 2018 Friday 3:28 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 947 wordsByline: By Sherisse Pham, CNN BusinessDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  Chinese social media apps have struggled to win over users beyond their home turf. TikTok is changing that. In the space of just two years, the app has amassed more than half a billion users --- around 40% of them outside China --- who share short videos of themselves lip-syncing, cooking, dancing or just being silly.Created by Beijing-based startup Bytedance, TikTok has gained an international edge over China's established social media platforms, such as Tencent's (TCEHY) WeChat, Sina Weibo (WB) and Alibaba's (BABA) Youku."What sets ByteDance apart is its success in the social media category, which is dominated by Facebook, Twitter and Snap --- all Western companies," said Randy Nelson, head of mobile insights at analytics firm Sensor Tower.Social video apps reached new levels of popularity this year. Three of them are in the top 10 most downloaded apps worldwide, according to Sensor Tower. ByteDance owns two of the three: TikTok and Vigo. The other is Instagram, which belongs to Facebook (FB).ByteDance's success is attracting big investors. It's reportedly in talks with tech kingmaker SoftBank (SFTBY) about an investment that would value it around $75 billion, a huge jump from the $20 billion valuation it secured last year. That would make ByteDance one of the world's most valuable startups alongside Uber. ByteDance declined to comment on the reports. SoftBank didn't respond to a request for comment.Using AI to keep people hookedByteDance calls itself an artificial intelligence company. It uses machine learning and algorithms to figure out what people like and give them more of what they want to see. The company is best known in China for the popular news app Jinri Toutiao, or "Today's Headlines," which it launched in 2012. People quickly got hooked on the app's customized news feeds. Toutiao currently has more than 240 million monthly active users that spend on average 74 minutes per day on the platform.ByteDance applied a similar formula to Douyin, a video app that launched in 2016. It has Snapchat-like functions, where people can edit and add filters to 15-second videos before posting them online. The app has even spawned a phrase to describe people glued to their customized feeds: "shua Douyin" or "scrolling through Douyin." Going globalByteDance had global ambitions early on. It launched its first international product in 2015, the English-language news app Top Buzz.Last year, the company's global expansion went into hyper drive. In just 10 months, it bought Los Angeles-based video startup Flipagram, released TikTok, the overseas version of Douyin, and paid $800 million for musical.ly, a lip syncing app popular in the United States and other Western countries. Flipagram is now known as Vigo, and musical.ly users were moved onto TikTok earlier this year. Those moves have given it a vast user base spread across Asia, Europe and North and South America.ByteDance's growing video empire has made it the world's fifth biggest app maker, based on overall downloads, according to Sensor Tower. In the third quarter of 2018, downloads of TikTok were more than five times as high as in the same period a year earlier.ByteDance says TikTok and Douyin together have more than 500 million monthly active users. That's far more than Twitter (TWTR) and around half as many as Instagram, both of which are blocked in China. The buzz around TikTok even caught the attention of Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook. During a trip to Beijing last week, he visited ByteDance's headquarters, meeting with people who work on TikTok and Douyin. Money-making potentialInvestors like ByteDance because its hundreds of millions of users attract a lot of advertising money. ByteDance declined to disclose how much revenue its apps generate, but a source familiar with the company said Toutiao alone pulled in 20 billion yuan ($2.9 billion) in China last year. The video apps are even more lucrative because they attract a lot of users in their teens and 20s. That's what makes ByteDance such a threat to more established Chinese social media platforms, according to Xiaofeng Wang, an analyst with research firm Forrester. "Consumers have limited time and attention. [Whoever] wins consumers especially younger generations will win advertising dollars," she said. ByteDance also makes money through revenue sharing deals. People on TikTok, for example, can buy digital coins to give to other people on the app --- like throwing money in a performer's tip jar. ByteDance takes a cut of those earnings. Run-ins with the governmentByteDance's founder and CEO is Zhang Yiming, a 35-year-old former Microsoft (MSFT) employee. People who have worked with Zhang describe him as someone who thinks deeply about technology and spends much of his free time writing code. The company's name refers to 0s and 1s dancing together to form a byte, the binary code used by computers. The startup's meteoric rise has caught the Chinese government's attention. Like Facebook and Twitter, ByteDance is also battling fake news and inappropriate content. Regulators shut down Toutiao for 24 hours late last year, alleging inappropriate content. In April, officials ordered that another ByteDance app, Neihan Duanzi, shut down permanently for publishing vulgar posts and displaying "improper public opinion." ByteDance reacted by issuing a public apology and promising to add thousands more employees to review content. "Our product took the wrong path, and content appeared that was incommensurate with socialist core values," Zhang said in a social media post at the time.TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Conservative politicians are calling out Google, but for the wrong reasons - GatewayThe Gateway: University of Nebraska at OmahaOctober 11, 2018 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: EDITOR'S PICK; Pg. 1Length: 537 wordsBodyGraphic by Maria NevadaWill PattersonOPINION EDITORGoogle has become a way of life for most Americans and for people all over the globe. The search engine and its plethora of services have become commonplace in our day-to-day lives. This makes the recent accusations by conservative politicians and the company's future plans alarming for everyone.Google came under fire by President Donald Trump when he accused the search engine of specifically promoting left-leaning ideology. In a series of tweets, Trump accused the organization of promoting publications that only reported negatively on his administration. While Trump's claim is mostly baseless and more likely just another early morning Twitter rant, this doesn't mean that he didn't touch on some important issues.Exactly how must power does Google have? Considering that most Americans use the search engine as their primary way of browsing the internet, Google certainly does have the capability to skew public opinion.Google released a public statement refuting Trump's claim against intentional working against their organization. According to the statement, the company treated his first address to Congress (which is not the same as the State of the Union) the same way they treated the previous address given in 2009.To further establish these claims as rumors, Google CEO Sundar Pichai agreed to a private meeting with several lawmakers about bias concerns. Additionally, he agreed to meet with several members of Trump's cabinet about similar concerns. The meetings had not yet happened at the time of writing.So, Google might not actually be interfering in American politics through skewed results. There still appears to be a trend of the president making claims about schemes against him that are frequently untrue. That doesn't mean that Google is off the hook. While headlines have been filled with Trump and Google connections, there has been a lack of coverage over the company's reconsideration of rejoining the Chinese government internet.Due to China's strict government-imposed censorship laws, Google doesn't currently have a presence in the country. Previously, the company refused to bend to what they viewed as unethical censorship of the internet. Now the New York Times reports that a leaked secret project has stirred up internal controversy. The formerly secret project is a censored application intended for Chinese users.The New York Times also reported that at least 1,400 Google employees have signed a petition demanding more transparency. This petition has resulted in response to concerns that the company is violating serious ethical values.According to the Wall Street Journal, Vice President Mike Pence publicly called for Google to end its development of a censored Chinese service. Still, this has never been the main concern for American politicians and it absolutely should be.We know that Google holds immense power to control public opinion, and Google has claimed to refrain from doing that to American users. Political leaders need to stop worrying about false claims from the president and start working to prevent the Chinese government from utilizing Google for propaganda to over a billion people if they fail to act.Load-Date: October 11, 2018End of Document

Google's CEO says it's still considering a censored search engine in ChinaCNN WireOctober 16, 2018 Tuesday 3:55 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 619 wordsByline: By Heather Kelly, CNN BusinessDateline: SAN FRANCISCO (CNN Business) BodySAN FRANCISCO (CNN Business) --  Google is still considering whether to launch a censored version of its search product in China, CEO Sundar Pichai said Monday."It's very early. We don't know whether we could or would do this in China, but we felt it was important for us to explore," Pichai said at the Wired25 conference in San Francisco. The company publicly confirmed the existence of the controversial project during a Senate committee hearing in late September. Codenamed "Dragonfly" within Google (GOOGL), the project was first revealed by The Intercept in August. Google had been working on the project in secret, but after the reports about its existence emerged, more than 1,000 Google employees signed a letter asking for more transparency, according to a New York Times report. On Monday, Pichai described Dragonfly as an exploratory internal project. He said the company's absence in China --- a country with 20% of the world's population --- weighed heavily on Google, which has a mission to bring information "to everyone.""We wanted to learn what it would look like if Google were in China," Pichai said. "So that's what we built internally. If Google were to operate in China, what would it look like?"Google found that Chinese government censors would block less than 1% of users' searches, according to Pichai. The prospect of Google returning to China has fueled criticism from human rights groups that the company, which has long advocated a free and open internet, would be doing the bidding of the ruling Chinese Communist Party, which runs a vast censorship apparatus that stifles dissent.Google had a search engine in China from 2006 to 2010, but hasn't offered it in the past eight years because of concerns over government censorship. A handful of other Google products are available in the country, including its Android mobile operating system and a few apps.Pichai said that by offering a search engine in China again, the company would be able to provide users with better information than what's available on important subjects, such as cancer treatments.Doing business with the PentagonThe CEO also discussed another recent controversial decision by the company. In June, Google declined to renew a contract with the Pentagon after employees and outside groups said they were concerned about the use of artificial intelligence in weaponry. "When you are so early with a powerful technology, how do you thoughtfully work your way through it?" Pichai said Monday.Google also pulled out of the bidding for a multibillion dollar cloud computing contract with the Pentagon this month because the project could have conflicted with its corporate principles on artificial intelligence.Amazon (AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos on Monday defended his company's pursuit of the contract, saying it would continue to do business with the Department of Defense, despite internal and external criticism."If big tech companies are going to turn their back on the DoD, this country is going to be in trouble," Bezos said at the Wired25 event.Pichai said that Google is still working with the military on other projects, but is sticking to things it's more "qualified to do." That includes areas such as cybersecurity and logistics. He played down the influence employee protests had over the company's decision making."Throughout Google's history we have given our employees a lot of voice and say in it, but we don't run the company by holding referendums," said Pichai. "It's an important input we take seriously. But even on this particular issue it's not what the employees said, its more the debate within the AI community." TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Chinese online star detained for five days for 'insulting' national anthemCNN.comOctober 14, 2018 Sunday 1:53 AM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: ASIALength: 474 wordsByline: By Ben Westcott and Eric Cheung, CNNDateline: Hong Kong BodyA popular Chinese online personality who authorities claim "insulted" the country's national anthem has been put into detention for five days, local Shanghai police said in a statement.Yang Kaili, a 20-year-old live streamer with at least 44 million followers, was punished after some internet users reported her to the police for "insulting the integrity of the national anthem during a live broadcast."In a video of the original broadcast on October 7, Yang sits in her apartment waving her hands in the air, mimicking a conductor, then sings the initial lines of the "March of the Volunteers," China's national anthem.Usually in her videos, Yang sings and dances around while talking to fans who tune in for her broadcasts.Police said she had violated China's "National Anthem Law" during her broadcast and had been taken for five days of "administrative detention" by the Jing'an branch of the Shanghai Police Department.Under strict new laws imposed by the Chinese government in October 2017, people who "disrespect" the national anthem could go to jail for up to 15 days.There were even reports at the time Beijing was considering extending the punishment to three years in prison.Yang's detention stands in stark comparison to the ongoing US national anthem protests in the NFL, where despite outrage from US President Donald Trump, players continue to take a knee during the anthem to make a stand against racial injustice.'Not above the law'Yang posted a series of apologies to her Weibo account shortly after the incident, offering her "sincere apologies" to her fans and saying she felt ashamed."My action has deeply hurt everyone's feelings. Sorry, sorry to my motherland, sorry to my fans, sorry to netizens, sorry to the (live-streaming) platform," she said.She said she would stop all broadcasting work and perform self-reflection. "I will deeply reflect, and fully accept ideological, political and patriotic education, and study hard on the National Anthem law and relevant regulations," she said.Video live streaming has become a huge sensation in China in recent years, watched by millions of faithful viewers. It's not just for fun but also profit. Some influential streamers can make tens of thousands of dollars a month through gifts and sponsorships.But as it has grown in size and influence, Chinese authorities have repeated crackdown down on live-streaming services and the people who use them, including tight restrictions on platforms and popular usersIn their statement, the Shanghai police department said the national anthem represented "the symbol and sign of the nation.""All citizens and organizations should respect the national anthem, and protect the integrity of the national anthem," the police said, adding live-streaming platforms were "not above the law.""They also need to respect the law and be moral."Load-Date: October 16, 2018End of Document

Czech PM bans use of Huawei mobile phones by Government OfficeThe Acorn: Drew UniversityDecember 20, 2018 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 415 wordsBodyA spokesperson with Global Affairs Canada told Canadian newspaper the National Post that a third Canadian citizen had been detained by Chinese authorities on Tuesday.The move came weeks after Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Huawei, was arrested in Canada at the request of the United States.Global Affairs Canada confirmed today that a Canadian citizen had been detained but offered no other details, citing the Privacy Act. The cases follow Canada's december 1 arrest of Huawei Technologies Co. "It serves as a reminder for people that China is a detention state", he said.Officials say they do not believe this case is linked to that of two other Canadians recently held in China.Ms Meng has been granted bail but may face extradition to the U.S. on charges of violating American sanctions on Iran through Huawei's business dealings.Trudeau said one of the lessons he has learned throughout his three years in office and having to deal with complex consular issues is that every case is different and one can not use "one-size-fits-all cookie cutter approach" to all of them.In the past few days the Czech National Cyber and Information Security Agency issued a warning to critical industries against the use of both software and hardware of Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., and ZTE Corporation.Meng was released on bail last week in Vancouver pending a USA extradition hearing on fraud charges in the United Statesrelated to alleged sanctions-breaking business dealings with Iran.Specifically, NCISA Director Dusan Navratil said "China's laws ... require private companies residing in China to cooperate with intelligence services, therefore introducing them into the key state systems might present a threat", according to Reuters. "Escalation and political posturing might be satisfactory in the short term to make yourself seem like you are stomping on the table and doing something significant, but it may not contribute to the outcome we all want".The Chinese government and state-run media have lashed out against Canada for the arrest, which could dampen Prime Minster Justin Trudeau's ambitions to launch free trade talks with the country.Along with the third still-unidentified Canadian, former diplomat Michael Kovrig and business consultant Michael Spavor are also being detained. As part of the agreement with the court, Ms Meng, who cried as the decision was read out, must wear an ankle monitor that tracks her movements and hand over her Chinese and Hong Kong passports.Load-Date: December 20, 2018End of Document

The selling picking up a little bit of steam as we move closer to the opening bell a little more than two and-a-half hours from now.This after a week of red for all your major market indicators. Dow and Nasdaq falling more than 2 percent last week. The S&P down 1.6 percent.In Europe we had a little bit of buying earlier in the session. But now the CAC 40 in France and the DAX have dipped into negative territory.Asian markets finishing higher overnight. All four major markets there to the plus side.Trouble for Nissan, Japan's NHK reporting that chairman Carlos Ghosn has been arrested for alleged financial violations. The automaker looking to remove him as chairman.And a rough road for Apple, CEO Tim Cook speaking out against regulation but he says it is coming anyway. The tech giant already struggling with orders for its new iPhones. Suppliers are paying the price. We break down all of that for you.And leaving the crew -- why the CEO J Crew is leaving the company ahead of the holiday season after only being in the position for a little more than a year.Here with me this morning: Fox Business' Susan Li, along with "Wall Street Journal" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman, and pollster and Maslansky & Partners president Lee Carter. Welcome, one and all. What's on your mind?JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, "WALL STREET JOURNAL": Well, this trade issue where the Chinese will not -- the Chinese government, I should say -- will not even agree to the idea that we shouldn't have unfair trade practices. We've seen how in the past they've refused to acknowledge intellectual property theft. Now they're not even willing to endorse as a general principle that we ought to have open, fair trading relationship. Very bizarre.But maybe it's just setting the table. Maybe this is art of the deal and then they'll be more reasonable later. I don't know.SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: But I'm scare when you're using the term "cold war". This is a new cold war and it's been opened in 2018. And they're calling chaos at APEC. I mean they've never seen this before. And it's usually a friendly display of relations between all the countries.So this is something that President Trump and the administration is shaking up. And we'll see how it works.MCDOWELL: Let me just raise this issue though, what is better -- acting like everyone gets along and essentially lying? Like oh, we love each other.FREEMAN: Yes.LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY & PARTNERS: Isn't that what diplomacy is?MCDOWELL: Or actually like let's crack this egg and just show the world what's really going on.CARTER: Right. I think it's really fascinating too that people are willing to be patient with this process. Like I've been having some conversation with some farmers and ranchers, in some of the work that we do. They are willing to stick it out and say we're going to -- you know, it's worth it in the long term for us to take some pain now. And I think that's a fascinating thing that we haven't really seen before.MCDOWELL: We can continue this conversation because we've got Anthony Scaramucci on deck.LI: Yes.MCDOWELL: He's raring to go.American and Chinese trade tensions spilling over -- we were talking about this. Economic giants sparring at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit. China reportedly upset over the wording of a phrase they viewed as unfairly singling out their trade practices. This is the first time in the summit's nearly three-decade history in which a communique was not issued.Here now, former White House communications director, SkyBridge Capital founder, author of "The Blue Collar President" -- Anthony Scaramucci --ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, FOUNDER, SKYBRIDGE CAPITAL: Practicing my APEC wave here.MCDOWELL: -- no. If you're going to do the wave, we need to teach you the -- it's the light bulb, it's screwing in the light bulb. There you go.SCARAMUCCI: Good, good. I need shoulder surgery. But go ahead. I'm sorry.MCDOWELL: Your reaction -- China, the United States. Where do we go from here in terms of the trade relationship?SCARAMUCCI: So I'm going to say something outrageous. I actually think that they're going to get a deal done pretty quickly. And if it's not next week, it will be before the end of the year because that's the President's personality.And if you go back to the Canadian-Mexican deal, and you look at the concessions that were made that were minor concessions. And so this has typically been the President's style.He is very rough in the beginning. He comes out guns a-blazing. He's boxing away. If you read "The Art of the Deal", that's exactly what he does. And then he tries to meet in the middle towards the end of the negotiation.And so here's another thing for the President. I know his personality well enough to know that he wants this thing done by latest the end of January because he's got to set up the narrative going into the back half of his administration that he's tied up these trade deals. And then he'll want to work on an immigration or an infrastructure deal with the Democrats.LI: So Anthony I hosted APEC in 2014 and my sources are telling me --SCARAMUCCI: Were you doing this?LI: Well, you know, working on it, at great risk. Great risk --(CROSSTALK)LI: -- because of it. But basically from my sources in Asia, they said that they were insulted that President Trump didn't even make the trip to Papua New Guinea. So that was already, you know, laying the ground work by not showing respect.And that might may be a good negotiating tactic as well because at least you're sending a message to the rest of Asia, particularly China, aren't you?SCARAMUCCI: Well, I mean -- you know, that could be. I think it's a combination of different things. Just the unbelievable schedule that he had leading up into the midterms. I think that they probably held him back from going to Asia.But I don't really think that should be something that should be insulting anybody. I think what, you know, the Americans are upset about are the IP situation with China and so it appears that there are going to be concessions made there on behalf of the U.S. and so that's where I think the trade deal gets done. But I don't think anybody should be upset that he didn't make it to APEC.FREEMAN: Ok. So we've talked a lot about the President's time line. And this is really good news that this is not going to be sort of a permanent fight with the Chinese in your view. That he's looking to wrap it up.How about on the Chinese side? There's this sense that China thinks in decades or centuries but I think there's some pressure on Xi Jinping to deal as well.SCARAMUCCI: I absolutely think that. If you know where their market is Jim, and you look at where the currency is right now, both of those things are true. And I think one of the things that gets overstated by the western media is the overall strength of the Chinese economy.Like, if you look at their level three assets, if you're a banking analyst and you're examining their level three assets, it's really the core of the capital structure of the Chinese commercial banking system, they never wrote down those assets after 2008.And so those assets are wildly overstated which has a big impact on the Chinese government. It puts pressure on their reserves as they try to prop up those banks. And what you don't want is a material slowdown where you see the GDP of China dipping below 6.5 percent because that puts them in a danger zone as it relates to the mass urbanization that's taking place throughout China.So I absolutely think this is pressure on both sides and I think that the President likes -- I think both presidents like each other. So my guess is this thing will get done. If not next week, shortly thereafter.MCDOWELL: Anthony here is incoming House Republican Conference chair Liz Cheney commenting on the Democrats' economic message yesterday with Maria on "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES" on Fox. So listen to this. I want to get your reaction.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LIZ CHENEY (R-WY), CONGRESSWOMAN-ELECT: The Democrats right now are focused on this so-called Russia collusion, the Russia threat. I think the real Russia threat, Maria, is when you look at the kind of Soviet style economic policy that the Democrats in particular, some of the freshmen coming in are advocating.So I think the Democrats are going through a very challenging time. And Nancy Pelosi is working very hard to try to become the next speaker which means that she's got to kowtow in many ways to that wing of her party. That's not good for the country.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: President Trump offered to help Nancy Pelosi basically get the speakership.SCARAMUCCI: As many votes as she needs. As many votes as she needs.MCDOWELL: Every time I read that, I just laugh out loud. Because it -- it seems like he's really throwing shade which makes me chuckle.SCARAMUCCI: Well, he's throwing shade in one way but in another way she may need the votes. And by the way, she's going to be the speaker.So they can say whatever they want. And they can posture any way that they want. She's an absolutely ruthless killer. I say that in the most complementary, most admirable way.MCDOWELL: Not literally.SCARAMUCCI: No, I'm saying metaphorically. But I mean she's (INAUDIBLE) in. She's definitely going to be the House Speaker. So -- and by the way, I have an 11-day PhD in this nonsense that goes down in Washington, ok.So I'm telling you -- you know, I'm telling you right now, the knives are being sharpened metaphorically. And she is going to be the House Speaker. So do you want me to comment on what Representative Cheney was saying or you'd rather not?MCDOWELL: Money talks and mmm walks whether you're in Washington or anywhere else in the country. And ultimately she is one of the greatest fundraisers in modern Democratic history.SCARAMUCCI: And by the way, I mean you have to give her a lot of credit for the midterm elections. She raised a ton of money and she mobilized people in the right areas.And you know, you can call it a blue wave, a minor blue wave. It wasn't a blue ripple. If you look at the whole landscape, you look at the state legislatures and the governorships switching -- it certainly wasn't a blue ripple.Having said that, I think without the President's help it could have been way worse.MCDOWELL: I want to get to this -- speaking of the President. He was sounding off on the future of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and chief of staff John Kelly on Fox News with Chris Wallace yesterday. So listen to this, Anthony, and then react.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I like her a lot. I respect her a lot. She's very smart. I want her to get much tougher and we'll see what happens there.We get along well. There are certain things I love what he does and there are certain things that I don't like that he does -- and there are his strength (ph).John at some point is going to want to move on. John will move on.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: When will John Kelly move on?SCARAMUCCI: Look at me. It couldn't happen soon enough for me, right. But I'm just saying like as it relates to the President, ok, he's a lot like George Steinbrenner. So all of us that are aficionados of sports going back into the 70s and 80s known when he says we'll see what happens, that's like incoming, take cover. You follow what I'm saying.Get under the desk and see if you can wait the thing out with him. But he said that with, you know, the attorney general. And he has said that on many different occasions. And by the way, I wasn't even there long enough for him to say let's see what happens, ok. I was gone before he could say let's see what happens.MCDOWELL: Who's going to be the next attorney general?SCARAMUCCI: I don't know. I mean hope it's Chris Christie. You know, I think Chris would have the President's back but also be impartial. And I see, you know, there's some --MCDOWELL: I just made a face.SCARAMUCCI: -- some faces here but I like Chris a lot. I mean --MCDOWELL: There's a history with Chris Christie and Jared Kushner's father.SCARAMUCCI: I got it. I think they've moved past that.MCDOWELL: Ok.SCARAMUCCI: And so -- and I think he's a great guy, Chris. And so I would like to see him because I think he would have the President's back but he would also run the department properly.CARTER: There's this idea that the White House is sort of in disarray with all these staffing changes and all this kind of moves. Do you think all of this was underfoot before the midterms and this is just now happening? Or are there things that have recently happened that seemed to shake things up?SCARAMUCCI: That's the thing that I don't get about this because he's an entrepreneur. He's been an entrepreneur his whole life. If you study entrepreneurship, or you take a Harvard case study on entrepreneurship, there's tremendous turnover for entrepreneurs, particularly when they're getting started in a situation.Whether it's Jeff Bezos, Michael Dell, Bill Gates, Steven Jobs -- you can pick the entrepreneur, they're whipping through things in the beginning until they get the team right.And I think what the President's understanding right now is that like if you were a condo guy, you hire condo builders. If you're a golf guy, you hire golf course builders. He thought ok, I going into the government, I hire government builders.And what ended up happening there is a lot of those people were not very loyal to him or his agenda. And so now he's got to shift the deck and reshuffle the deck to people that are going to be more loyal to him.LI: So who's going to be the chief of staff? A budget guy? Do you think it will be Mick Mulvaney?SCARAMUCCI: I don't know. I like him a lot. I think he would be great. Somebody mentioned Nick Ayers who's the Vice President's chief of staff. I, you know, got to know him reasonably well, as well. I like him as well.Maybe the fact that I said that I like both of those guys is the kiss of death for both of them. They're probably going to call me later and say stop talking about me on TV. You know, I don't know but I like both those guys.FREEMAN: I mean your experience, I understand --SCARAMUCCI: PhD.FREEMAN: PhD -- you kind of wanted it to go a little longer than 11 days. But --SCARAMUCCI: I thought I was going to make it longer than a carton of milk -- Jim. But, you know --FREEMAN: Let's not get back -- I mean Kelly has done a lot of good things there. I mean --(CROSSTALK)SCARAMUCCI: Name one.FREEMAN: I don't think this is a given.SCARAMUCCI: Name one good thing that he's done.FREEMAN: Well, for example --SCARAMUCCI: Name one.FREEMAN: -- this is a White House that despite all the reports of chaos has remained remarkably faithful to the President's 2016 agenda and has gotten a lot done -- when we think about judges, we think about the tax cut.SCARAMUCCI: You're attributing that to John Kelly or to the President?FREEMAN: I would say both of them. But I would say Kelly deserves some credit here as the chief of staff.(CROSSTALK)SCARAMUCCI: We'll see the aftermath of this whole thing -- what really comes out, ok. I mean you read Bob Woodward's book, so did I. So we're going to see --MCDOWELL: I did.SCARAMUCCI: -- the aftermath of this whole thing.MCDOWELL: No. Because I want to -- that's the narrative.SCARAMUCCI: He hasn't been fair to the President. I mean just read what he talks about -- read what he says about the President.MCDOWELL: But that's the narrative that the President somehow needs a minder, somebody who teaches him how to close doors to the Oval Office. And I think that people who know the President push back on that.SCARAMUCCI: I pushed back on that very hard, ok. And I don't even care that John fired me. That's ridiculous. That won't be the last time I've been fired. It wasn't the first time that I've been fired, ok. I'm a bit of a renegade so I expect to be fired again in the future.But here's the bottom line, ok. He hurt the morale inside the White House, ok. And he's got a mercurial, militant sort of nature to his personality and he's pushed a lot of people out that were very valuable to the President.Forget about me. Let's say that I wasn't. but I'm just talking about other people inside the White House.FREEMAN: But in large part isn't this the job of the chief of staff?SCARAMUCCI: They're playing the music, brother. See that? I'm going to get out of here. We're going to get through a commercial break.MCDOWELL: I had so much more I wanted to ask you about.(CROSSTALK)SCARAMUCCI: Before I leave though -- Susan, how am I doing with the wave?LI: Make a twist, more wrist action.SCARAMUCCI: I just want to make sure. Ok.MCDOWELL: Scaramucci -- we don't use first names -- holding back.SCARAMUCCI: Holding back.MCDOWELL: Carlos Ghosn -- an overnight arrest. More when we come back.(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: Nissan ousting Carlos Ghosn as chairman. Cheryl Casone has the details on this developing story -- Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: It is. And we're hoping to learn more in a couple of hours from now -- Dagen.But first to this news. Carlos Ghosn is being dismissed after an internal investigation found significant acts of misconduct. Japanese media reporting Ghosn was arrested after he met with prosecutors on suspicion that he falsified his financial reports.Japan's NHK says Nissan's representative Director Greg Kelly was also arrested. Ghosn led a dramatic turnaround in Nissan, rescuing the company from near bankruptcy. He is also chairman and chief executive of France's Renault. Shares of Nissan down about 10 percent so far this year.Well, thousands of brokers reportedly have been allowed to scrub their records clean of complaints by customers and employers. According to a new study in the "Wall Street Journal", employees which found the practice makes it hard for regulators and consumers to watch the behavior of brokers. Discovering process overseen by FINRA which, of course, regulates the brokerages. FINRA's considering changes that's would make it harder for brokers to purge those records.Ok. There is this. Former New York City mayor, Michael Bloomberg giving a record-breaking $1.8 billion to his alma mater -- Johns Hopkins University. It's the biggest donation ever gifted to a school. The money can allow students to be considered for admission regardless of their ability to pay.Bloomberg says that he hopes the donation will allow Hopkins to offer more generous scholarships and ease the debt burden for graduates.And those are your headlines. A lot of cash -- Dagen.MCDOWELL: Yes. Enough that -- how much did he -- that's how much -- put it this way, I said this Cheryl to somebody, that like millionaires are beneath him.CASONE: Yes, pretty much.MCDOWELL: He has to socialize with billionaires.CASONE: Millionaire whatever. Yes.MCDOWELL: Just really quickly. This is money well spent. Running for president, maybe not so much.FREEMAN: Yes. I think he's going to look at that and find that there's not a kind of natural home for his mix of moderation on economics and social liberalism.LI: And he's one of the biggest donors for the midterms as well, on the Democratic side, obviously for Bloomberg.MCDOWELL: Because he was -- because he well, was in favor of the tax on sugary sodas. He's very much tried to fight cost of health care through things like that.FREEMAN: Yes.MCDOWELL: Very, very much in favor of gun control giving a lot of money on gun control issues. And then he's kind of fiscally conservative in some ways. He knows how to balance a budget. But that means taking things away from people.FREEMAN: Well, you do wonder, because he does have the funds to launch an independent candidacy, whether that might be a way to go. But I just -- I don't see it.CARTER: I don't see him being able to carry the vote but I could see him as a mastermind behind somebody's strategy and political ideology. So I don't -- I think that maybe he should be the man behind the curtain, not necessarily the man in front of the curtain -- or woman.LI: Or a running mate potentially?CARTER: An interesting idea, for sure.LI: You know.MCDOWELL: Just don't ask for like chipotle aioli with your corn dog at the Iowa State Fair. That's all I have to say.Coming up --FREEMAN: Always good advice.MCDOWELL: I can -- you know, they're not great retail politicians sometimes.Coming up, Facebook fall out. Mark Zuckerberg reportedly wants to go to war over the media's reporting of the company's disarray.Plus retail in focus this week ahead of Black Friday sales. Why strong corporate third quarter earnings were not enough to lift investors' spirits.MCDOWELL: Let's take a look at futures. They're pointing to a lower open on Wall Street with technology on the decline. The "Wall Street Journal" reporting this morning that more investors are looking towards stocks with slower but steadier growth -- cheaper growth.Joining me now, S&P global market intelligence portfolio manager Erin Gibbs. Do you think that this trend continues or do people ultimately come back to technology stocks?ERIN GIBBS, GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE PORTFOLIO MANAGER, S&P: No, we've been talking for a while about investors coming back to value stocks. There's been a change in leadership.Even last week we really saw value pick up over these like higher-priced growth stocks. And part of that is because technology is actually going to have massively slowing growth next year. They're actually going to have below average earnings growth versus the broader market.So people need to start looking in other areas if you're really going to look for where profits, revenues and earnings growth are going to come from as well as better valuations.MCDOWELL: Susan -- I noticed that last week that the Dow stocks that hit all-time highs at the end of the week were Coca-Cola, McDonald's, and Procter & Gamble.LI: Right.MCDOWELL: That's where the money was.LI: And investors are going into Starbucks and, you know, Bill Ackman bought a stake recently. But I was really a little shocked by reading the Goldman Sachs report this weekend. They're predicting GDP to be 3.5 percent this year -- that's the best year of growth since 2005. Next year in 2019, only close to 1.5 percent for expansion.GIBBS: Well, part of that is because we're having such a phenomenal year this year. But it's really tough to keep up that pace. And we're even seeing that in profit growth where we're looking at about 23 percent profit growth this year and 8 percent next year. And so it's just harder and harder to grow that fast and we're having such a phenomenal year this year.LI: But this slowdown in the economy, does that impact the markets?GIBBS: Well, I mean that's exactly what we've been seeing for the past month-and-a-half is as we're particularly going through Q3 earnings, people start looking at 2019. It's finally on their radar and they're saying oh, wow, it's going to be really tough to grow faster next year. There's going to be slower growth.It's still super healthy. We're not talking about a recession or anything. It's just -- it's going to be slower and you probably want to be a little more cautious about where you put your money and maybe focus on value a little.FREEMAN: Yes. I think that does raise a question, whether people are too cautious. The markets right now, given this 20 plus percent earnings growth, the multiples are not that huge. Maybe on some of the tech names, but in general is there a lot of room for upside surprise here next year?GIBBS: No look, right now we're trading -- we look at it as forward valuations and PEs. And we're trading at about 16 times forward earnings. That is not super cheap. That's actually in line with about your sort of three-year average.So yes, there's room to go up. We could certainly go up, you know, 10 percent from here and still be on a very healthy valuation. But we could also go down to 15 times forward earnings and go down another 5 or 6 percent and still again be in a very healthy, normal range.So there's a lot of possibilities around sentiment and we still say definitely evaluate the value stocks are definitely some of your safer bets for this market -- in this territory.MCDOWELL: I just want to mention retail really quickly. A big list of companies reporting this week including Lowe's, Target, I'm looking at L. Brands, that is the -- I think they report today.GIBBS: Victoria's Secret.MCDOWELL: Yes. That talk about trying to grasp for relevancy there. Anyway, what are we going to see from the retail sector? Will it give us a window into what the holiday shopping season looks like.GIBBS: Yes. This is sort of their -- the big report and what we're going to see, look for guidance for the holiday season. Right now forecast for retail for the holiday season is one of the best ever. We're looking at about a 5 percent growth, just on the earnings, obviously more of it goes to online.What we have been seeing with retailers is those that actually make and manufacture clothing, shoes, they're getting harder hit. The people that sell it, companies like Ulta (ph) that are really able to engage the shopper, they tend to do better, as well as anybody that has a strong online presence.And we're seeing, you know, different ways to deliver the product to consumers, not just always shipping it from home, being able to pick it up and that type of thing. So we're seeing a lot of creativity so it's going to be an interesting year. Yes, this is a very important week for those holiday sales.MCDOWELL: The reason I took a shot as L. Brands, it's like super skinny women strutting around in badly made lingerie -- I think that's a little outdated. The modern definition of beauty is just not whatever Victoria's Secret -- Vicky's Secret is still trying to sell. Anyway, that was my two cents.GIBBS: Agreed.MCDOWELL: I put you on the spot -- Erin. But let's hope for a nice holiday because Nordstrom had a bad week last week.GIBBS: Yes, they did. And they've been struggling. And they -- again, it's being able to deliver what the consumer wants and engage them. These big box retailers have really been struggling, so it's going to be a tough year.MCDOWELL: Good to see you -- Erin. Thank you so much.Coming up, Tim Cook issuing a major warning for big technology. Stay tuned to hear what the Apple chief had to say about the change coming to Silicon Valley.And a real life Santa Claus spreading holiday cheer at a Vermont Walmart.

We have the details. That was Susan Li going hmm.Plus, 'tis the season, the White House preparing to celebrate for the holidays and one mystery Santa makes some shoppers very happy at a Wal-Mart in Vermont. The heart-warming story ahead.And a fizzing success, we introduce you to two sisters who are making a splash with their own line of bath bombs. You got to stay tuned for that.To our top story this half hour, big technology regulation, Apple's CEO Tim Cook warning that more regulation in Silicon Valley is on the horizon.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE: I am not a big fan of regulation. I'm a big believer in the free market. But we have to admit when the free market's not working. And it hasn't worked here. And I think it's inevitable that there will be some level of regulation.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: This comes as Apple shares are in near bear market territory. Joining me now is Disruptive Tech Research founder and chief analyst, Lou Basenese. Lou, what do you make of Tim Cook's comments?LOU BASENESE, FOUNDER AND CHIEF ANALYST, DISRUPTIVE TECH RESEARCH: Look, he's being honest like, big tech blew it. They had an opportunity to self- regulate and they didn't do it. And you know, I think it's unfair for Apple because if there's one technology company that's really looked after users' data and protected it, it's Apple. Now, you flip over to Facebook and Twitter and Snapchat, you know, their entire business models are predicated on exploiting user data. So, you know, built by association.SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Well, Lou -- I mean, OK. So, yes, it's a different business model. I think we have to understand that first of all. And don't you think it's strategic also for Tim Cook to be able to go on the offensive at this point. He's -- yes, he's more of a hardware maker. Were as others sell free services, they take your data. So I think it's easy for him to say look, you know, we're holier than thou and we're probably better than Silicon Valley at this point.BASENESE: Yes, look, I think it's definitely strategic. There's no reason to get out in front of the public and figure out how to do this. If you remember when we were talking about trade wars and tariffs Tim Cook got out there, talking about that to try and influence the president, perhaps too. And I think that's going to go on with all these big tech executives because they are such a big part of our everyday lives.But at the same time, I do believe Apple can claim they are a little bit holier than the rest of the big tech sector and complex. They do look after our user data. Whereas Facebook, I mean, they just had a patent grant application filed that looks to predict your family demographic data based on data images and key words you use. I mean, is there no information that's not safe from Facebook? I mean, that's the kind of thrust of their business versus Apple's where they're trying to keep people from getting to your data.LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS: To be fair though, I mean, to say that the social media companies are using data and all of that, a little bit of fear mongering, right? Because if they're putting this together and maybe there's some benefit, people are getting the free access, maybe it's going to help them get better advertising, there is a value exchange that's happening. And we're acting a little bit like it's on the fairies and nobody has any idea what's going on.BASENESE: No, I agree with you. There's got to be an exchange, right? You get something for free, there has to be a cost associated with that and I think you are -- you are get willing and giving up sacrificing some privacy. But who draws the boundary where that privacy ends, where your protections kick in?So yes, it can get misconstrued as a fear mongering. But at the end of the day, people are the product for these advertising based businesses. I mean, Facebook derives 98.3 percent of the revenue from advertising, Apple is at 0.4 percent. So, you know, it's just built into that model and we have to figure out. Tim Cook said it, it didn't work. The free market didn't work here. Regulators' going to have to step in and figure out where that balance is.JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Lou, James Freeman here at the Wall Street Journal. I think we could argue whether the market's working or not, but tell us about Apple's market, is that working? We've seen these reports. They didn't -- they want to share a little less information lately, suppliers getting nervous, they're not seeing the orders they'd like to see. What kind of condition is Apple in right now?BASENESE: Listen, I think Apple's trying to find a new equilibrium. Less transparency on Wall Street is never a good thing. And you know, I think this morning, there's another report out from Wall Street Journal saying that production is getting cut on the three new iPhone models. So we've had multiple supplier data points stacking up to suggest that iPhone -- we might be at peak iPhone unit volumes.But the key is peak iPhone doesn't mean peak profit for Apple. They're really making this pivot to show that their services business. I mean, their services business now is the size of Facebook's entire business. So it comes down to the last couple weeks of December, right? That's going to be make or break for Apple. And we're not going to get the data on whether they sold enough iPhones. And I really don't think that's as important as how much money they've made per customer and from that those services businesses.MCDOWELL: Let's move back to Facebook, I guess.BASENESE: OK.MCDOWELL: Because the Wall Street Journal has a piece that details the tensions between top executives in the days following that New York times story last week. It's titled with Facebook at, quote, war, Zuckerberg adopts a more aggressive style. Here's part of it. Mr. Zuckerberg's new approach is causing unprecedented turmoil atop Facebook driving several key executives from the company. At times, it is created tensions with his long-time chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg. Lou, your take on this.Again, where is this man's focus been? If you're running the company, he was busy crowing about learning Mandarin and then reading 25 books every year. And where -- I was talking to someone I'm very close to who works in Silicon Valley and in reaction to that New York Times story, he said have a cocktail, join the party, where have you been. That all of these -- that all of these problems that have been reported at Facebook are built into their business model and have been going on in one way, shape or form since day one.BASENESE: Yes, focus, I don't think there's been a focus there. I mean, remember the Cambridge Analytica scandal? I mean, Zuckerberg was nowhere to be found for days. I think there's been inexcusable lack of leadership here. So look, I'm glad. If he's really genuine about going to war, it's about time. Facebook has made continuous excuses for why they've fallen short on a lot of areas, why they haven't disclosed data breaches early. It's about time from some of the leaders to step up.MCDOWELL: But the thing that makes my head hurt James, as Susan you better get in on this, Facebook gave app developers access to not only individuals who use these apps, but to the friends of the users of these apps, for years. LI: Yes.MCDOWELL: That was the business model. That's how they grew to the size that they are today and then they act like it's some big accident.But I know that you'll say this, if you ever use Facebook, you know why do you need to know my high school that I went to and my hometown and what my home address is and why you need my phone number. At every -- at every moment in every breath they're asking for more and more and more information and people are saying OK, let me just give it to you and the service is for free. Well, it's not free. They're using your data and they're selling it essentially or making money off of your back.FREEMAN: Yes, so I think their consumers have some responsibility here for the fact they enjoyed in many ways making this trade. But -- well, also, I think what's happening here in part and why all this focus on Facebook is that Washington and much of the media on the left side of the political spectrum has not forgiven them for their refusal to agree with the premise that Russian meddling was the decisive factor in the 2016 election.BASENESE: Yes, look, they've yet to issue Mea culpa for that, right? And I think you're right, it's --FREEMAN: Should they?BASENESE: I think they should, absolutely. I mean, look, the New York Times came out; they had 50 different sources, right? Saying that this was known well in advance and what if Facebook --FREEMAN: yes, but it would be the extent that it actually mattered in 2016.(CROSSTALK)FREEMAN: But maybe the reason they were not responding as aggressively is because they decided it's actually not that big a deal in this ocean of media that our customers are consuming.BASENESE: Yes, but listen, on Wall Street, there's clear definitions of materiality. And I would tell you that every single shareholder would argue that any interference from a foreign government on a platform that has access to 1.8 billion people would absolutely be material. So that's not something for Facebook to decide on their own in the absence of the public.MCDOWELL: James Freeman, I'm going to walk out on the plank and say this, I don't think the media would have paid attention to everything that's been going on at a Facebook over all the years and made as big of a deal about it if there hadn't been the Russia issue that they were lurking at --FREEMAN: Why -- exactly, right?MCDOWELL: -- that we would never know about any of this.FREEMAN: (INAUDIBLE) Facebook's business model.MCDOWELL: Yes, exactly. It's a little bit rich.LI: But I love the battle that's taking place in Silicon Valley between Tim Cook and Mark Zuckerberg. There's no love lost between those two. You know, in the New York Times report, Mark Zuckerberg basically said no one can use iPhones, everyone is switching to android after Tim Cook said that privacy is a human right and some people aren't doing it right including Facebook.MCDOWELL: And I'll just point out in terms of regulation, these social media companies have a liability waiver in Washington for user created content because they aren't or weren't media companies but now if they are, do they get that liability waiver? That's something that congress could easily do, just pointing that out.Thank you, Lou, Lou Basenese.BASENESE: Thank you.MCDOWELL: Good to see you. Come back soon sir.BASENESE Thank you.MCDOWELL: Great conversation.Coming up, leaving the crew, why J. Crew's CEO is out right before the holiday season's biggest shopping day.And Christmas is coming to the White House, the holiday tree making its journey to Washington today, more coming up. Stay with us.MCDOWELL: J. Crew parting ways with its CEO and he hasn't been there long. Cheryl Casone has the details. Hi, Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, quick relationship to tell you about, Dagen. James Brett has stepped down after just 17 months on the job. Brett says that he and the board couldn't agree on how the company should evolve. J. Crew now heads into the key holiday shopping season without their CEO. Four senior J. Crew execs are going to share CEO responsibilities until the company sets up a permanent management structure to appoint somebody new.All right, kicking off the holiday season in the nation's capital right now, President Trump and the first lady Melania are going to receive the National Christmas Tree at the White House today. The nearly 20-foot tall, 800 pound Frasier fir which (INAUDIBLE) North Carolina and will be featured in the Blue Room. It's scheduled to arrive at the White House around 1:00 Eastern Time. It won't be lit up until next Wednesday however. They're going to decorate it.All right, some lucky Wal-Mart shoppers have discovered they are on Santa's nice list. An anonymous man paid off every single item that was on lay away at a Wal-Mart store in Derby, Vermont.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He came up to the guy in front of me and said, either I'm going to pay for it now or I'm going to pay for it later. I get goose bumps, thinking that that is the true magic of Christmas, that's the Christmas spirit walking amongst us.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: When asked by someone who could afford to pay for all those items, the mystery man said Santa Claus can. Store officials are not going to say how much the secret Santa spent but good for him. No bah humbug at that Wal-Mart, Dagen.MCDOWELL: I was looking to see where Newland, North Carolina was because I did not know, sadly. It's been beautiful --it's somewhere near beach mountain I think up in the mountains of North Carolina.Coming up, two sisters partnering up and creating a successful business, all before they're old enough for college. We'll speak to these two entrepreneurs about their booming bath bomb business, next.MCDOWELL: Two sisters making bank with bath bombs and all before they even enter college. Caroline and Isabel Bercaw started Da Bomb Bath Fizzers in their mom's kitchen. And revenue is expected to hit $20 million this year. Joining us now are the Da Bomb Bath Fizzers co-founders, Caroline and Isabel Bercaw. Good to see you both.CAROLINE BERCAW, CO-FOUNDERS, DA BOMB BATH FIZZERS: Yes, you too.MCDOWELL: How old were you when you started this business?C. BERCAW: We were about 10 and 11. Yes, it was pretty crazy.LI: How did it start?C. BERCAW: Well, we wanted -- when we were younger we used bath bombs all the time. But we wanted to make our own because a lot of times it would stain the tub. And so, we decided to add a little extra something inside our bath bombs which was the surprise.MCDOWELL: So what is the surprise inside the bath bomb?ISABEL BERCAW, CO-FOUNDER, DA BOMB BATH FIZZERS: It could be like a toy or message on waterproof paper or even some jewelry. And it always coordinates with the name and the fragrance of the bomb. And we have bath bombs for everybody. So, we made them for boys and girls, and adults and kids a alike. Because we want to have fun.LI: But how did you think we could turn this into a business? You were 10 and 11 years old.C. BERCAW: Yes, we first started at a local art fairs. But then a local salon owner came by and it just happened they wanted to sell our stuff in his salon.I. BERCAW: And I think a really big part of it was we were just kind of fearless in a sense because we were 10 and 11 and we didn't really fully understand the consequences of what could go wrong in owning a business.MCDOWELL: Well clearly, you had a mom also who didn't say no, no, no, who didn't discourage you.I. BERCAW: Yes.MCDOWELL: And didn't -- who said OK, let's do this. And now, I just want to point out, your bath bombs are sold in stores nationwide, Costco, Target, just to name a couple. So it's gone beyond like the local salon owner.C. BERCAW: Yes.I. BERCAW: Yes. We're currently in 15,000 stores across the U.S. right now. No question that we haven't had a lot of help. You know, our parents help us and our business partners help us and everything.MCDOWELL: So, Lee can help you. Because she is a marketing and branding wizard, if you need any free advice. Lee?LI: Offer some.CARTER: I would love to do that separately. But I'm curious, you said that you've had -- just there's been a lot of generosity as you've been exploring this idea on how you can grow your business. Tell us a little bit about how you've been inspired by their folks or kinds of tips that you've gotten along the way.I. BERCAW: I think what's really inspiring is getting to talk to other people and know that they've been there as well. Because when you're starting a business it's really hard work. And there's a lot of fun as well. But there's also a lot that you may say, is this really worth it? So when you talk to somebody, understand that they've been down that road as well and that it's going to be OK, it's really nice to hear that.LI: Yes, can I ask from a parenting perspective, how do parents develop kids that want to be entrepreneurs like you at 10 and 11?C. BERCAW: We're so grateful our mom and our dad are both have been so supportive and just let us go with this. So, thanks mom and dad.MCDOWELL: Are they -- are they entrepreneurs or do they work in kind of more regular jobs?C. BERCAW: Yes, our mom has an advertising and writing background. And our dad was a consultant, business consultant before this. So they kind of work very well together.I. BERCAW: And they inspire us every single day to work really hard and to follow in their footsteps.LI: Are you going to go to college, both of you, do you want to go to college?C. BERCAW: Yes.I. BERCAW: Yes. If anything for the experience and I'd like to also look at other subjects as well, as well as business.MCDOWELL: So these two retail -- big retail partnerships, is that Target and Costco that I was talking about?C. BERCAW: Yes, we recently launched with Costco. We're in Ulta as well and CVS, so.I. BERCAW: And we just got a target end cap where all these new products will be available. So, they're brand-new additions to our line.CARTER: Really exciting.MCDOWELL: Bless you both. And Happy holidays. A Happy Thanksgiving to both of you. Caroline and Isabel Bercaw, take care and please come back.C. BERCAW: Thank you so much for having us.MCDOWELL: Absolutely. Still ahead, head quarter headache, Amazon facing new pushback over the planned New York offices, even a parody on "SNL". We'll tell you more, next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA.Load-Date: November 19, 2018End of Document

"The Chinese do not want to be subject to anything that we can take out of service." The Beidou Navigation System, which currently serves China and its neighbors, will be accessible worldwide by 2020 as part of President Xi Jinping's strategy to turn his country into a world leader in next-generation technologies. Its implementation has repercussions throughout the business world as manufacturers of semiconductors, electric vehicles and airplanes modify their products to also connect with Beidou to continue doing business in the second largest economy. The assembly of the new constellation is approaching critical mass after the release of at least 18 satellites this year , including three this month. On November 19, China launched two other Beidou machines, bringing the number into operation to more than 40. China plans to add 11 more by 2020.  Beidou is an element of China's ambitious campaign to displace Western domination in aerospace. A state company is developing aircraft to replace those of Airbus SE and Boeing Co., and national startups are building rockets to compete with the commercial launch business of Space Exploration Technologies Corp. of Elon Musk and Blue Origin of Jeff Bezos.  Next month China is scheduled to launch Chang'e 4, a lunar probe that would be the first spacecraft to go to the far side of the moon. A probe and an explorer vehicle are scheduled to take off to Mars in 2020.  "It's kind of a classic space race," said Andrew Dempster, director of the Australian Space Engineering Research Center in Canberra. China began developing Beidou in the 1990s and will spend in the system from US $ 8.980 million to US $ 10.600 million by 2020 , according to a 2017 analysis by the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission. The system will then offer positioning accuracy of 1 meter (3 feet) or less with the use of its ground support system.  In comparison, GPS provides a typical accuracy of less than 2.2 meters, which can be improved to a few centimeters with augmentation systems, the commission said.  The Beidou system, which is named after the Chinese word for the constellation Ursa Major, is the heart of an industry that will generate more than 400 billion yuan (US $ 57,000 million) of income in 2020, according to a forecast of the Satellite Navigation Office of China.  The entry In the middle of commercial dispute, China challenges the US in space and points to the GPS system was first published in La Tercera. Load-Date: November 26, 2018End of Document

The announcement was made by the leader of the White House on Twitter, after the trade truce reached this weekend in Buenos Aires, Argentina, between the United States and China.  "China has agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars arriving in China from the United States, which is currently 40 percent," Donald Trump wrote in the social network.  China has agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into China from the US Currently the tariff is 40%.  - Donald J.

According to Reuters, neither of them mentioned the tariffs applied to automobiles in their official communications after the meeting between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping.  What was announced by both sides was a trade truce that will postpone for 90 days the increase of tariffs on 200 billion dollars of Chinese imports, from 10% to 25%, scheduled for January, as well as the possible application of new rates to all Chinese goods.  The purpose of this truce is to give the two countries the opportunity to begin negotiations on structural changes that are a priority for the United States, and which relate to the protection of intellectual property and cyber-crime.  Donald Trump hailed a "productive meeting that opened unlimited possibilities for China and the United States," while Wang Yi considered this agreement a victory for both sides at the end of a G20 summit under high tension in Argentina.  Washington also noted that Beijing has committed to buying "yet to be determined, but very significant" quantities of US products to reduce the huge trade imbalance between the two countries.  In particular, China will start to buy "immediately" American agricultural products, assured. Load-Date: December 3, 2018End of Document

HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSIONER BRBEL KOFLER VISITS CHINAStates News ServiceDecember 4, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 358 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: BERLIN BodyThe following information was released by the Federal Foreign Office of Germany:Dr Brbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, is visiting China from 4 to 10 December. Following talks in Beijing, she will chair the German-Chinese Human Rights Dialogue in Lhasa, Tibet on 6 and 7 December. This was last held in Germany in 2016. In 2017, China cancelled the bilateral dialogue. After the Human Rights Dialogue, Dr Kofler will join the delegation of Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who is currently on a state visit to China, in Beijing. Prior to her departure, the Human Rights Commissioner issued the following statement today (4 December): I believe it is important for a regular, close and direct exchange with the Chinese Government to take place. That is the only way that we will be in a position to openly discuss issues on which we disagree. I am therefore pleased that, after a one-year break, a bilateral Human Rights Dialogue is once again taking place as a central dialogue format in our close relations with the People's Republic of China. I am deeply concerned about the human rights situation in China. It has become even more serious in recent years. This is particularly affecting the critical voices in civil society human rights lawyers, journalists and bloggers. I am shocked by reports of the treatment of the Turkic Uighur minority, more than one million of whom are estimated to be imprisoned in internment camps in Xinjiang. Unfortunately, my request to travel to Xinjiang in the context of the Dialogue was refused. I would have liked to have gained a first-hand impression of the situation there and will continue to push for permission to visit Xinjiang soon. The Human Rights Dialogue will now take place in Tibet. In view of the critical human rights situation in Tibet, this, too, is an appropriate place for our Dialogue. There are numerous reports of excessive controls, punishment of relatives for the crimes of family members, prohibition of normal religious freedom and "patriotic education" which give me great cause for concern.Load-Date: December 5, 2018End of Document

Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Tuesday, December 11th.Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.Stocks are rallying this morning, extending gains of yesterday. Futures indicating a big market day with the Dow Industrials up 180 points -- that's three-quarters of 1 percent. S&P is up two-thirds of a percent, 17 points higher. And the Nasdaq right now up almost 1 percent, 60 points higher right now after a wild session yesterday.Markets plummeted initially and then climbed from the lows to end the day in positive territory, up 34 points when all was said and done. The Dow had been down better than 500 points after British Prime Minister Theresa May delayed the vote on the deal to leave the European Union. Her spokesperson today is saying that the vote will take place before January 21st. Markets ended stronger and are continuing the rally today.Global markets meanwhile are also higher. FT 100 in London, up one and a third percent, 92 points higher. CAC 40 in Paris up one and three-quarters percent, 84 points higher. And the DAX index in Germany up 200 points, that's almost 2 percent higher in Germany.In Asia overnight markets little changed, as you can see fractional moves across the board.Meanwhile trade talks are moving forward. This is one reason the market has a firmer tone as well. The U.S. and China held a new round of negotiations last night. We will tell you about the phone call that happened on that story, coming up.And then Google's turn on the hot seat today. CEO Sundar Pichai is headed to Capitol Hill to testify before the House Judiciary Committee. Fox Business will bring you that live at 10:00 a.m. Eastern. We will take a look at what to expect from this testimony, coming up.On the short list, President Trump among the final candidates on the magazine's Person of the Year. We're taking a look at the other names on the list later this hour.And Steph Curry going viral but not for his play on the basketball court. His comments about the moon landing, landing him in hot water.All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning and joining me to break it all down -- Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, CFRA investment strategist Lindsey Bell and Beyond Sport global ambassador, Fox News contributor John Layfield. Good to see you this morning.JOHN LAYFIELD, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Great to see you. I don't know what Stephen Curry is smoking. But he thinks the moon landing is fake. He could be the greatest shooter of all time. He's certainly in the top five but that --BARTIROMO: He just doesn't believe it?LAYFIELD: He said, check out Stanley Kubrick who -- there's a big conspiracy theory that he filmed this for Apollo for nationalism and for the government. And apparently he doesn't. I don't know -- I couldn't figure out if he was joking or not.The Golden State Warriors are saying please, anything but this talk.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: I've got some chem trail theories and flat earth ideas that I can sell him if he's --LAYFIELD: Well, Kyrie Irving, the other great NBA (INAUDIBLE) said we do have a flat earth. So you have that.MCDOWELL: I'm no -- people laugh at the chem trails and the flat earth. But they're out there.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Meanwhile President Trump is still looking for his new chief of staff. Mark Meadows among the names really coming to the top of the list.We've got a market that is rallying this morning.Earnings keep beating estimates. What else are you watching?MCDOWELL: What are you watching?LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA: Well, I think the biggest risk to the market right now is this trade spat. So I think the sooner we get this resolved, the sooner we can resume daily operations of businesses across the globe, really.BARTIROMO: We have a phone call last night with Steven Mnuchin and his counterpart that we're going to talk about coming up.MCDOWELL: Right. I was just going to say, I think that -- and I've said this on the program before when Lindsey was here. I think business owners, operators, CEOs, are getting to the point where they're just not going to make any investment decisions for the next two years, waiting for the next presidential election. That's the danger.BARTIROMO: And cap spending.MCDOWELL: Yes. If it looks like that you have a White House in chaos that can't get its messaging straight, they can't get any trade deals done beyond here, you're looking at a really long slog for the next two years.BARTIROMO: That's what the Democrats would like.MCDOWELL: Yes.BARTIROMO: We'll see. We've got a big meeting happening today between the President and Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer.Coming up this morning, joining the conversation Ohio Congressman and House Judiciary Committee member Jim Jordan is with us on the day that Sundar Pichai testifies in front of his committee. Michigan congresswoman and House Energy and Commerce committee member Debbie Dingell is here to talk about General Motors. Plus the chairman and CEO of Motorola Solutions -- he's turned this company around Greg Brown is joining us. And former British parliament member, Euro-Pacific Capital senior economic consultant John Browne joining us. As well as the host of "VARNEY & CO.", Stuart Varney weighs in as well.Don't miss a moment of it. We've got a big two hours coming up.And we kick it off at this hour with this top story.It was a wild day on Wall Street yesterday and it's looking good today. Futures indicating a higher opening to the tune of 200 points at the start of trading this morning after a volatile session yesterday.The major indices closed in the green yesterday but that was really just part of the story. They bounced back from early losses which were sparked by escalating fears over the fate of U.S.-China trade and what happened in the U.K.The Dow slid to session lows about 11:00 a.m. after British Prime Minister Theresa May announced the delay of the vote on the U.K.'s exit from the European Union. But from that point on, it was a climb to positive territory. Her spokesperson today this morning says that that vote to leave the E.U. will take place before January 21st.Joining us right now is Oppenheimer Funds chief investment officer, Krishna Memani. Krishna -- great to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.KRISHNA MEMANI, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, OPPENHEIMER FUNDS: Pleasure to be here.BARTIROMO: How are you handling all this volatility?MEMANI: Well, it's not pleasant. It's not fun. But at the end of the day it's part of the markets. Having said that, I think what we need to focus on is the underlying economic strength. The economy continues to do well, rates are relatively low. So I think we are still looking for a positive outcome in the long run.BARTIROMO: Would you buy stocks here or do you want to --MEMANI: Oh, absolutely. I think cash is a good alternative. But if you have a long-term -- if you want to retire, you know, 2 percent, 3 percent just doesn't get you there. So you'll have to take risk and earn returns in the long run and I think equities are still very good value in that context.MCDOWELL: How much of the volatility that you've seen recently is do you think can be attributed to the reduction, the $50 billion a month reduction in the Fed's balance sheet, now below $4 trillion. You had some serious liquidity and trading problems in the markets last week where people, you had those exchange traded funds, those bond ETFs where the actual trading price was below the net asset value which isn't really supposed to happen, which tells you that the investors didn't really know what the bonds in those portfolios were worth.How much of that is contributing to the overall market swing?MEMANI: So the balance sheet reduction at the Fed is clearly a factor in the market, reducing liquidity in the market is an issue.I think volatility causes ETF prices to be away from what their net asset value is all the time. So I don't read too much into that. But the Fed, if it continues to tighten or if it continues down the path of reducing its balance sheet in a very aggressive way, I think that will have negative consequences in the market.Having said that, we believe the Fed will stop sometime in first half of 2019, because the economy would have slowed down and the inflationary pressures that they're worried about just won't manifest themselves. So maybe one or two times tightening and the Fed stops.So if you step back, the two issues driving the market -- the Fed, tightening by the Fed, and trade. I think we are on the verge of resolving the Fed issue. The trade issue is an open political issue that, you know, somebody can solve that problem tomorrow --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: There was a phone call last night, they're talking about this being a new round of trade talks taking place last night. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer held a call with their Chinese counterpart, reportedly discussing agriculture purchases, changes to China's fundamental economic policies, according to the "Journal" this morning.It comes amid heightened tensions over the arrest of Huawei's CFO. She's waiting to find out whether she's going to be released on bail. That decision could come today.So Krishna -- I mean what do the markets expect here in terms of, you know, looking at these recent developments from the CFO getting arrested to this Argentina meeting -- what's priced into the market?MEMANI: I think the market is still expecting trade issues to continue for a reasonably long period of time. And I think the driver of that is the fact that U.S. economic strength gives the Trump administration the flexibility to continue this path.However, by the middle of next year when the U.S. economy is kind of back to 2 percent, unless the Trump administration wants to take the risk of the economy slowing down even further, I think they will be forced into a situation to make some sort of compromise.So I think the trade conflict continues for a bit longer but I think even that will get resolved middle of next year.BARTIROMO: So is that beginning to get priced into this market, a slowdown? Is that what investment participants believe -- 2 percent next year this time?MEMANI: Oh, yes. I think in August and September we were talking about sustained growth rate, higher inflation. I think all of that has been flushed out in the market by October, November.BELL: Well tech has been a major area under pressure because of all this trade issues. But you saw yesterday in the comeback, it was led by Apple, it was led by the tech sector, and it was led by the semiconductors, up 2 percent, 3 percent across the board.And you're seeing that actually this morning, the Nasdaq is leading. You're seeing some of the semis do well again today. Do you think that bodes well? Can these stocks carry us into the end of the year, maybe give us that Santa rally?MEMANI: Well, I think if there is going to be a Santa rally, it will involve tech in a big way. There's no doubt about that. And I think valuations in tech have improved quite substantially. They have had a significant correction.I think for the long run, we continue to believe that a trend growth rate where growth will be around 2 percent, tech companies that have been delivering significantly better growth rate topline, profitability growth will lead the rally.It will never be about value. It will always be about growth and it will always be about tech companies if this rally continues as we expect.LAYFIELD: On the rally, we have consumer confidence at an 18 year high. We have unemployment at a 50-year-low. We have wages that are up. Looks like we're going to have a really good Christmas retail season.The question is what happens next. Do you think this is the last big hurrah before we slide back to 2 percent growth?MEMANI: I think the economy is already slowing down. You know, the consumption part was always robust. What we needed was capital spending. That ticked up a little in the first half and subsequent to that, it's been slowing down.I think that's the part that is missing and that is what ails the global economy. The desire to invest on business' part is just not there. Things like trade issues make it even less so and I think that's why we need to resolve it.LAYFIELD: You didn't mention Brexit at all. Brexit yesterday, the market dipped significantly, came back later because of what might, could or could not happen. Does Brexit factor into this in a big way next year?MEMANI: Brexit is a gift that keeps on giving, you know, unfortunately. You know, the likelihood that they will get a deal that everyone would like is basically zero. So we will have to reach some sort of compromise. It's political posturing on all sides.But at the end of the day, before middle of next year they have to find a solution.MCDOWELL: The United States has been kind of the stronger of the global economies broadly speaking. You've got Germany is now contracting, Japan contracting. Can businesses here in the United States up capital spending? How does the rest of the world impact what happens here at home?Does that make sense? Like, I know we don't operate in a vacuum. But can you see an uptick in capital spending if the rest of the world doesn't look so great?MEMANI: Well, so I think that's a fair point. If emerging markets were accelerating and Europe was accelerating, I think the desire to invest to support those markets would be higher.But U.S. has been the fastest growing market for quite some time. At least the relative to trend has been the fastest growing market. With that, if the investment didn't come through, the likelihood that it will come through and the U.S. economy slows down to 2 percent I think is less likely.BARTIROMO: Bottom line do you want to buy stocks or allocate some money to fixed income right here?(CROSSTALK)MEMANI: No. I want to buy stocks.BARTIROMO: Ok.MEMANI: I think stocks are good for the long run. They have cheap valuation. The economy is doing quite well and markets are going to go up over the next two, three years.BARTIROMO: Krishna -- it's good to see you.MEMANI: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Krishna Memani from Oppenheimer there.Coming up, Google is on the hot seat today. Find out what lawmakers want to know as Google's CEO Sundar Pichai takes to Capitol Hill this morning to testify in front of the Judiciary Committee.Then "Time's" Person of the Year -- that person will be revealed this morning. Top candidates -- President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin among the ideas. We'll talk about it.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Congress is getting ready to grill Google's CEO Sundar Pichai today about the company's data collection, the alleged political bias.Cheryl Casone with the details right now and headlines -- Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: And a lot more, Maria.BARTIROMO: And a lot more.(CROSSTALK)CASONE: Yes. Pichai expected to tackle all of these allegations head on today. In his prepared testimony, Pichai is going to say quote, "I lead this company without political bias and work to ensure that our products continue to operate that way. To do otherwise would go against our core principles and our business interests."Now, lawmakers also are expected to question Pichai about Google's plan to build a censored search engine in China. Fox Business is going to have live coverage of the Google CEO. That hearing, 10:00 a.m. Eastern time this morning.Well Pichai's appearance coming just one day after Google announced it is shutting down its social network, Google Plus, earlier than anticipated because of a privacy flaw. Google says a glitch exposed the personal information of 52 million users in November.This is the second time in two months that Google has disclosed the existence of a problem that enabled unauthorized access to these Plus profiles. The second one, a lot larger than the first, we should add.Well, Carlos Ghosn is facing more time in a Japanese jail. A decision by a Tokyo court means the former Nissan chairman will remain in custody through at least December 20th with no option for bail. Ghosn was indicted yesterday for allegedly filing false financial reports that understated his pay by about $44 million.Prosecutors also laying out new suspicions that Ghosn underreported $36 million in income between 2016 and this year, underreported. Ghosn has denied any wrong-doing in all this, we should say. Shares of Nissan are down 14 percent, Maria, so far this year. But he is staying in jail.BARTIROMO: Yes. And you know he's denying all of this and we still haven't heard from him. And they won't allow him to speak to his family. So he's in this jail cell, sitting -- sleeping on a cot, eating porridge, I'm told, and told you can't talk to your lawyer, you can't talk to your family.He could be facing 10 years of jail time, Dagen -- and we know what was going on behind the scenes and underneath all of these, you know, malfeasance headlines. And that is, he wanted to merge Nissan with Renault, the French company. The Japanese were not happy about it. They do not want to be acquired, one of their jewels, the Nissan company, to be acquired by the weaker, financially weaker French company, Renault.And he as the journal reported the other day, he was about to replace the CEO of Nissan who very conveniently turned on him in three seconds when he found out that. So I think there's more to this story. It's political and it's really a shame to see this and Japan calls itself capitalists. What do you think?MCDOWELL: Increasingly it looks like -- I think it's fair to at least raise the question, was he railroaded?BARTIROMO: Right.MCDOWELL: And by the way, I think it upends confidence in the global economy when maybe investors realize there is no rule of law in Japan that if you do business in Japan, you're going to get treated differently than in a country like the United States of America.BARTIROMO: Especially if you're talking about one of the jewels of Japan, and that is the automaker, you know.LAYFIELD: Yes.MCDOWELL: Absolutely.BARTIROMO: It's an incredible story. We'll keep watching it.Meanwhile there's this, this morning. Coming up, NBA star Steph Curry in hot water today over his comments about the moon landing. Wait until you see what he said.Then, the only list that includes Duchess Meghan Markle and special counsel Robert Mueller. We're taking a look at the candidates for "Time Magazine's" Person of the Year.MCDOWELL: The two most annoying people on earth.BARTIROMO: We are waiting on "Time Magazine's" 2018 Person of the Year. Who will it be. We will find out later this morning.Until then Lauren Simonetti is here. She's sharing the potential top 10 -- Lauren.LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: We've got the short list. The list that puts Meghan Markle and Robert Mueller, as you noted, in the same place and also Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin.Robert Putin -- well, I went to the Fox party that's why I'm a little foggy this morning.All right. Let's give you the "Time" Person of the Year short list for 2018.You can see, looking at this list, that in the running are -- show me the list. Ok, I'll just go on my own. Jamal Khashoggi, he was one -- the Saudi journalist that was murdered. He made it.Donald Trump, now he took the cover in 2016. He was the winner right after he was elected. But this year, Donald Trump making the short list for his controversial policies including a policy on separated families. Families that were affected by his zero tolerance policy that has ended but still kids remain not united with their families. So separated families is an option.Vladimir Putin, of course. He won a landslide victory for another six years back in March. He's on the list for his, you know, the Russian poisoning of the ex-Russian spy and also tensions with the Ukraine.Robert Mueller makes this list.The March for Our Lives activists after the school shooting at Stoneman Douglas in Florida. They make this list.Of course, Meghan Markle, married Prince Harry, now pregnant with child.So we'll see in the next hour who is the "Time" Person of the Year for 2018.Last year, do you guys remember the cover last year, in honor of the #MeToo movement. It was the silence breakers. So you see the popular names such as Ashley Judd, the actress and Taylor Swift but also, you know, the woman all the way on the left is a strawberry farmer in Texas. So women speaking out against sexual harassment. That was 2017.What do you guys think for 2018?BARTIROMO: Well, this cover used to be like the iconic cover that we all waited and wanted to know about. I don't know that it has the influence that it once did. What do you think?MCDOWELL: Because it's a pamphlet. It's not a magazine anymore, number one. Number two, here's my prediction. It's not going to be Meghan Markle, the most annoying person walking on planet earth.LAYFIELD: Why do you think she's the most annoying person?MCDOWELL: Because she's the most annoying person walking on planet earth. Can we actually -- she's not the first woman to ever get pregnant, how about that?BELL: She did marry a royal.SIMONETTI: It's such a divided time --BARTIROMO: She married a royal.SIMONETTI: If they go with Meghan Markle, I think there will be less to say about the cover because it won't be as controversial.BARTIROMO: Why would it be Meghan Markle? Was she really the Person of the Year?SIMONETTI: Christine Blasey Ford.BARTIROMO: No -- Donald Trump.SIMONETTI: She has a chance. You think Donald Trump again? So he would fill two covers in his first term.BARTIROMO: They probably won't give him two covers. Yes, you're right. Maybe it's Vladimir Putin.MCDOWELL: It might be the -- I think it might be the people of the March.(CROSSTALK)BELL: This is America. We can't have Vladimir Putin on the cover.BARTIROMO: I know. You're right. That doesn't seem right.(CROSSTALK)LAYFIELD: The most influential person in the world, though it has to be President Trump. It has to be. Right or wrong, he is the person at the center of almost everything going around the world.BARTIROMO: That's what I think too.BELL: That's what I think too.SIMONETTI: Everybody else essentially on this short list because of President Trump and one of his controversial policies.BARTIROMO: Here's an idea.(CROSSTALK)SIMONETTI: You know what, maybe it will be Donald Trump again.BARTIROMO: Here's an idea. I don't know if you mentioned. It's Elon Musk.SIMONETTI: He's not on -- he didn't make the short list.BARTIROMO: Wow. Ok.LAYFIELD: Meghan Markle did.SIMONETTI: The "Black Panther" director made the short list.MCDOWELL: The "Black Panther" director -- that would be awesome. That would be a great pick. And it might actually sell some of those "Time" pamphlets.BARTIROMO: How about Lady Gaga? She's not on the list either.SIMONETTI: She didn't make the list either.MCDOWELL: If she wins an academy award, maybe.SIMONETTI: Have you guys seen that movie? "A Star is Born".BARTIROMO:; The best movie ever.SIMONETTI: I know. And now the song is on the radio. You know what, we should redo the short list, put Lady Gaga on it and Elon Musk.BARTIROMO: We'll just keep chatting about everything all day.Ok. Thank you, Lauren.Coming up, aiding General Motors. Tesla is thinking about purchasing GM's old plants. We've got the details on this partnership. Stock is up 3 percent right now on that.And then attacking holiday debt, are you in debt already? Find out how you can avoid overspending this holiday season, next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, December 11th. Your top stories right now 07:31 a.m. on the East Coast.The bulls are making a run this morning, take a look. We're at the highs of the morning right here, Futures indicating a rally at the start of trading to the tune of 220 points, up one percent on the Dow, up almost one percent on the S&P and up better than one percent on the NASDAQ, 75 points higher on the NASDAQ right now.Technology stocks helping the major indices stage a major comeback yesterday. Remember when the Dow was down 507 points yesterday? Yes, it happened at about 11:15 a.m. only to bounce off of that level and work their way back to finish the day higher. Dow Industrials ended the day up 35 points, a fractional percentage move. S&P was up four and the NASDAQ up three-quarters of one percent, 51 points higher yesterday.Initially stocks were hit as British Prime Minister Theresa May canceled the vote on the U.K.'s exit from the European Union. That speech happened at 11:15. That's when the markets bounced at the end of her speech. And this morning we are hearing that British police, armed British police reportedly detained a man inside the parliament grounds. No word yet on why he was there, why he was detained. This is a developing story. We will bring it to you.Meanwhile, in European trading this morning, we're seeing gains there as well, FT-100 up 1-1/2 percent, the CAC Quarante in Paris up two percent and the DAX Index in Germany up almost two percent right now, 204 points higher in Germany.Small action in the Asian markets overnight meanwhile. Fractional moves as you can see across the board.A new round of talks meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer talks trade with China's Vice- Premier on the phone last night. We're going to break it down. This is being seen as a big positive step in this trade truce.Money for the border, details on today's meeting between President Trump and top Democrats including Nancy Pelosi. The Dems reportedly offering $1.3 billion to fund the border.Then, surviving the holidays, how you can save on your holiday spending and keep yourself from sinking into debt. Many people still paying off last year's holidays.Plus this, NBA star Steph Curry is in hot water this morning over his comments about the moon landing. We'll tell you about it coming up.But first, our top story this half an hour, General Motors shutdown, the automaker announcing last month that it will close five North American plants and lay off 14,000 workers. But in an interview at "60 Minutes", Elon Musk says buying those plants is a possibility.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LESLEY STAHL, CORRESPONDENT, CBS: Would you want to buy some of those plants, those factories, that they're closing down? You're shaking your head yes.ELON MUSK, CEO, TESLA: It's possible that we would be interested. If they were going to sell a plant or not use it that we would take it over.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell. Congresswoman, it's good to see you this morning. Thank you so much for joining us.REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D), MICHIGAN: Good morning and it's good to see you.BARTIROMO: First, give us your sense of the impact of the G.M. announcement. I think I saw you quoted the other day that G.M. is now the least liked company in Washington. People are really angry about these layoffs and these cutbacks. Can you explain?DINGELL: Well, I will say that people's reaction has been in the delegation meeting with Michigan delegation that Mary Barra had, it wasn't me that said that, it was several members on both sides of the aisle that told her she had managed to unite everybody in their -- you know, dislike and frustration.Look, this is a serious time. I've been warning my colleagues here for a year that this is a cyclical industry and you were going to see a softening at some point. But you're also seeing a transformation of the auto industry. I had some pretty strong feelings that week, still do, because I think people were not expecting these announcements the way that they were handled, upset people, and clearly -- look, I'm a car girl and I'm very proud of it, it's where I come from. But I want to keep manufacturing in this country. I'm tired of it going overseas. And a lot of people are concerned about what we need to do and what this government needs to do to help keep manufacturing in the U.S.MCDOWELL: Congresswoman Dingell, it's Dagen McDowell. On that note with the renegotiated NAFTA, it will be up to Congress to pass it. It is designed to keep jobs here in the United States, particularly auto jobs. So on that note, would you -- are you planning to vote in favor of it?DINGELL: I've not made a decision. I have talked to Ambassador Lighthizer multiple times. I've made it very clear -- you know, we still haven't seen the details of the bill on Capitol Hill. He knows how strongly I feel that I am not going to vote for a bill that keeps letting General Motors move production. They announced in July that they were taking the blazer there. I sent him a tape that I was given by some people, a ground-breaking in Mexico just last week on a new plant.So I want to make sure and we're going to have to make sure that the enacting legislation is going to keep jobs here. There are a number -- there are issues that we have with the bill that we're hearing about it. I know that this White House is hoping I will support it. If I can keep jobs in the United States of America I'll support it. I'm not there yet.JOHN LAYFIELD, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Congresswoman, G.M. needed a bailout because they ran a business very poorly. It seems to me like they're now running a business profitably and now the politicians don't like the fact they're running this profitably. It seems to me that this is flying absolutely 100 percent in the face of the free markets, exactly opposite of what America stands for with you guys interfering in a private business.DINGELL: So, I don't believe in government interfering with private business. And I knew -- I know that there are people out there saying that we're interfering in their production plants, but we do have a lot of questions.Know, on the same day that General Motors made that announcement, Ford Motor Company called me. I talked to them all of the time. And by the way, so does the Japanese government talk to its people, the Chinese government. There should be a good relationship so that we are supporting.But Ford took a shift out of a plant that's flat rock, it's where they produced the mustang. But they didn't -- you didn't hear about it publicly for several days. They talked to every employee that was going to be impacted by that shift change and they're finding other places for them to work in the immediate area.So, even the way that they announced it. They've got to make tough decisions. They've got to transform them themselves where I want the United States to stay at the forefront of transportation mobility. I don't want it happening in China or India or Western Europe.LAYFIELD: Are you sure you want to quote a Chinese communist government on how to handle business?DINGELL: I'm not quoting the Chinese government.LAYFIELD: You just did.DINGELL: I didn't say that. I said I don't want it built in China. I don't want it built and I said all of those governments support. You know, if an American company goes to China, they have to invest with a Chinese partner there. Our government needs to support our American companies so they locate jobs here and we create jobs here in America.BARTIROMO: Now, you sound like President Trump. Let me ask you --DINGELL: Well, I have said that I will work with anybody, if I'm going to help the American worker here.BARTIROMO: That's good, that's what the American people want to hear. Let me ask you your thought on trades and tariffs, congresswoman. What is the effect of the steel and aluminum tariffs on your home state of Michigan? We worry and there's a lot of worry that the economy is slowing down as a result of these higher costs.DINGELL: You know, one of my problems with the way that President Trump has done his trade policy is that you're not really sure what it is. Businesses need consistency and that's one of the things that we don't have. We have too much chaos. Obviously these aluminum steel tariffs are having an impact. I've been talking to the companies. I've been talking to the supplier industry. I've been talking to a lot of people, U.S. care on a regular basis. And I know that they know that we've got to deal with this issue. So, I am concerned about it.BARTIROMO: So, do you want the tariffs to go away?DINGELL: Look, I got to tell you, I have an empty steel plant that sat on the river of my district for 25 years. So, I know that we do not have a level playing field. I want a level playing field and I want consistency. I want a stable policy --BARTIROMO: Well, the steelworkers are happy about the steel tariffs.DINGELL: They are very happy about because they've got empty --BARTIROMO: So, are you happy about the steel tariffs?DINGELL: I know that it's having an impact. And I know that there is -- the way that it's being done right now is not having a positive impact on the businesses that could potentially impact the workers. I also know that we've got too many empty steel plants and too many empty plants in this country because of our lack of a good, strong policy.BARTIROMO: So it's both, you're talking on both sides of the issue.DINGELL: No, I'm not talking on both sides (INAUDIBLE)BARTIROMO: Because the steelworkers want the steel tariffs. They feel they've just got another lease on life because of the steel tariffs. They're happy about it. The companies that are paying those tariffs, the companies that are seeing their input costs are upset about it. Where do you sit?DINGELL: So, if you talk to Ford Motor Company or you talk to some of the other companies, so same companies that oppose TPP, I might also add, that the way that this has been implemented has been chaotic. And if we get a - - it has been chaotic.BARTIROMO: What ways has it been implemented? What do you mean?DINGELL: It's been chaotic. You don't know what the president's plans are. You don't know how --BARTIROMO: Well, you know what the president's plans are, he's putting tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.DINGELL: It has not been in a consistent way. The businesses need consistency. But I am going to tell you that I think this government needs to support American companies the way the Japanese support those companies.And we need to do some things too, like putting some quality standards in there. Some of the steel that we've been getting from Japan has not been at the same quality and we're seeing some damage because of that too. I might also add on the side.BELL: Congresswoman, getting back to NAFTA, the USMCA agreement, the Commerce Department is out there saying look, the only way they're going to back it is if the steel and aluminum tariffs are removed from Mexico and Canada. Where do you stand on that issue?DINGELL: I probably -- I'm listening to all of the discussions. I am having discussions with people but I think that is something that we need to take a very serious look at.BARTIROMO: So the bottom line, are you going to vote for USMCA?DINGELL: I don't know. And I call it NAFTA 2.0 because I want people to know that the first NAFTA really hurt jobs and screwed the American worker and I don't want to put a different title on it. It's NAFTA 2.0. and if it's going to help the American worker, if it's going to stop jobs going to Mexico, if I'm going to see another ground-breaking, I'm going to vote for it. Yes.BARTIROMO: Well, I mean, will it help or not? Have you seen it? I mean, this --DINGELL: I have not seen the details. I've had multiple discussions with many people. And until we see the details and there are some things in there that we know are going to take care of it, I'm not committed but I'm more likely to vote of it than many others.LAYFIELD: Are you at least going to read it before you vote on it?DINGELL: I am somebody who always reads a bill and you can ask my staff. There's many a night I've stayed up.BARTIROMO: Well, good for you, we like that.DINGELL: And you can ask (INAUDIBLE) -- yes, I am -- I don't just do this willy-nilly. I want to see jobs stay here. I know those people. Those are people that I have seen and worked with for years. I know what that fear and that panic is in that auto worker's heart from what happened in 2018.BARTIROMO: Well, I think that's probably why a lot of your constituents voted for Trump.DINGELL: It is quite. And by the way, I'm somebody who two years ago said that President Trump could win because Democrats did a terrible job of talking to the worker and letting them know that they cared about.BARTIROMO: So, how is the president doing now, congresswoman?DINGELL: He's got some -- you know, he campaigned in Ohio and Michigan and said he wouldn't let an auto plant close. Well, we just heard that we're going to see some plant closings, so we've got some issues.BARTIROMO: All right, you're going to blame him on the G.M. shutdown?DINGELL: I have said just for the record, I'd work with him. So I'm somebody that doesn't take him --BARTIROMO: Are you going to work with him on the border funding? I mean, we've got a showdown underway right here. President Trump is meeting with your colleague House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.DINGELL: That is correct.BARTIROMO: And Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer later today. They're trying to strike a deal on border funding. The Democrat leaders say they will offer $1.3 billion to fund the wall. That's a stark difference from the $5 billion that the president is requesting. So bottom line here, do you want the wall or not?DINGELL: So I wish the world was as crystal clear as you like to see it. I think the wall is a stupid idea and I think it's a symbol of division that we don't need. I do think that we need to keep our borders safe on both sides. People forget about the border that I live on. But if -- I'm not -- I don't think compromise is a dirty word. So let's see what happens.BARTIROMO: But you said it's a stupid idea. Then what's your security net. If it's -- you said it was a stupid idea.DINGELL: I think that it's more -- do you want to know what's more effective? We need more border crossings, we need to use more electronics. There are documented studies that say we can keep both borders a lot safer with a lot more advanced technology. I think all the wall is a symbol of division or that people are going to be able to get around anyway. I do think we need to invest in keeping our border secure.But let's -- the wall has become the symbol of many things, of division, that many people say isn't going to work. But we do have technology and we need more border agents to help keep our borders safe. National security matters. And I'm tired of people trying to say that people like the Democrats don't want to keep our nation safe. Every last one of us, number one -- number one, keeping our nation safe matters.BARTIROMO: So build a wall.DINGELL: You said -- I have not -- I have said the compromise isn't a dirty word. But go read the studies because there are several. And I'm glad given to you because I've stayed up at night reading them.BARTIROMO: All right.DINGELL: Saying that there are ways to keep this nation safer than building that wall.BARTIROMO: Congresswoman, you've got a lot of good ideas. We hope you come back soon.DINGELL: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much. Congresswoman Debbie Dingell there.Coming up, defense nominating the Seahawks beating the Vikings on "Monday Night Football" last night. We've got the highlights coming up.And then, one of the NBA's brightest stars with some pretty out-of-this- world thinking, find out what Steph Curry has to say about the moon landing, that's next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A controversial play helps the Seahawks win again. Jared Max with all the "Monday Night Football" highlights. Hi, Jared.JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria. Should there have been a 15-yard penalty, this is the question that remains. Fourth quarter, Vikings trail the Seahawks, 6-0. Seattle's Bobby Wagner, watch, he uses the shoulders of a teammate to help him leap over the line of scrimmage to block the field goal. Should have been a 15-yard penalty but the Vikings denied. Few plays later, Seahawks scored touchdown. And 18 seconds after this happens, strip sack of Kirk Cousins. Cousins yells uncle, Vikings lose 21-7. Seattle won four straight, Russell Wilson a career low, 72 passing yards.All right, the next time Golden State Warrior star Steph Curry meets with reporters, the pressing questions likely won't be about what Steph did last night on the court but rather something he said in a podcast. Steph scored 38 last night, seven of 14 from three point range. The Warriors win by eight against Minnesota. What will Steph Curry get asked about? This comment, made on the podcast, winging it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STEPHEN CURRY, NBA BASKETBALL PLAYER, GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS: We ever been to the moon?UNIDENTFIED MALE: No.CURRY: They're going to come get us. I don't think so either. Sorry, I don't want to start conspiracies.(END VIDEO CLIP)MAX: Have you ever been to the moon? Steph, NASA says we would love for Mr. Curry to tour the lunar lab at our Johnson Space Center in Houston. We have hundreds of pounds of moon rock stored there. He can see that firsthand what we did 50 years ago. Maria, Steph Curry says we didn't land on the moon.BARTIROMO: I don't know what to say about that. I mean --LAYFIELD: You could see footprints on the moon from the astronauts with a telescope.BARTIROMO: OK, thank you, Jared. We want to get to this tweet that the president just posted. President Trump is just tweeting on the border wall. Here's what the president just said. Despite the large caravans that were forming and heading to our country, people have not been able to get through our newly built walls, make shift walls and fences or border patrol officers and military. They are now staying in Mexico or going back to their original countries. ICE, border patrol and our military have done a fantastic job of securing our southern border, writes the president.The president says a great wall would be however a far easier and less expensive solution. We have already built large new sections and fully renovated others making them like new. The Democrats, however, for strictly political reasons and because they have been pulled so far left, do not want border security. They want open borders for anyone to come in. This brings large scale crime and disease. Our southern border is now secure and will remain that way.The president writes I look forward to my meeting with Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi. In 2006, Democrats voted for a wall and they were right to do so. Today, they no longer want border security. They will fight it at all cost and Nancy must get votes for speaker. But the wall will get built.The president goes on to say, people do not yet realize how much of the wall including really effective renovation has already been built. If the Democrats do not give us the votes to secure our country, the military will bring the remaining sections of the wall. They know how important it is, says the president. That was a long tweet. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Well, it is the most wonderful time of the year but also the most expensive. 15 percent of Americans are still paying off last year's holiday debt which averaged $1,054. Joining us right now is Ramsey Solutions financial expert and author of the upcoming book, Everyday Millionaires, Chris Hogan. Chris, good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.CHRIS HOGAN, FINANCIAL EXPERT, RAMSEY'S SOLUTION: Well, thank you.BARTIROMO: So, we all want to buy presents this holiday. What are some of the ways we can save and not get too far into debt, Chris?HOGAN: Yes, Maria, the most important thing is to remain in control. You know, you don't want to let the holidays make you crazy. So stay in control.So, I've got four tips for people. Number one, tally up what you've spent so far. A lot of people have been shopping throughout the year for Christmas. So be aware of what you've already bought, what you've already spent. I really want you to stay focused and stick to your budget. This is where you assign a dollar amount of how much you're going to spend and who you're going to afford to shop for.The next tip is use cash. Cash will help you remain in control. And it helps you to understand your limits. If you're going to spend $100 on your brother for Christmas, when that $100 is gone, you stop.The next tip is avoid the store credit cards. These things are sneaky, Maria, and they're a thief. I mean, it's amazing that they'll offer you 10 percent off that day, but charge you 24 percent every other day. So avoid that.And then finally, 22 percent of Americans buy gifts for themselves when they're shopping for others. So don't buy for yourself every time you go out shopping.BARTIROMO: I can't not do that.MCDOWELL: I know.BARTIROMO: I always buy myself a gift.MCDOWELL: Chris, with your perfect voice, it's Dagen, I just want you to sing the following line, you're a mean one, Mr. Grinch. Because you're Grinching on the holiday, Chris. I want to buy myself some socks.HOGAN: No, Dagen, I am not doing that. No, I'm not singing. But here's the thing. Credit card debt -- Credit card debt is a Grinch. Credit card debt is the thing that will steal your joy and it will cause you to be -- you know, trying to pay off Christmas for two to three holidays from now. So just take a deep breath and understand the real reason for the season. It's about family. It's about friends. It's not about how much you spend. It's not how much you buy for yourself. So let's go into this holiday with clarity. Be aware, remain in control, and don't bring debt into your life.BARTIROMO: All right, and you can't blame us for trying. You have an incredible voice, Chris.HOGAN: Well, maybe the next time I'm in studio I'll sing.BARTIROMO: Can't get enough of your love, babe. Chris, thank you, Chris Hogan.HOGAN: Thank you so much.BARTIROMO: Still ahead, Google on the hot seat, Sundar Pichai going before Congress later this morning. Details, next hour, right here, MORNINGS WITH MARIA, stay with us.Load-Date: December 11, 2018End of Document

One possible reason could be reports last summer on Hikvision and Dahua, two Chinese technology companies supplying the Chinese government with surveillance tools to be deployed in Xinjiang province (north-west), where up to a million Muslims, mostly of the Uighur ethnicity, are reportedly being detained in re-education camps without trial."With the blockage of IPVM, China-based journalists lose a tool that allowed them to better know the surveillance equipment used by Beijing, and therefore protect themselves and their sources", said Cedric Alviani, head of RSF's East Asia bureau. "This is new proof of Beijing's authoritarian escalation, based on the belief that blocking independent information would allow them to cover-up the abuses they commit."IPVM joins the long list of media blocked by the "Great Firewall of China", that includes most press agencies and international media, collaborative encyclopedia Wikipedia, search engine Google and social media Facebook and Twitter.China ranks 176th of 180 in the 2018 RSF World Press Freedom Index (https://rsf.org/en/ranking) and counts over 60 journalists detained.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6601497 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: February 10, 2019End of Document

Reuters could not determine the precise nature of the possible violations.The arrest and any possible sanctions against the world's second-largest smartphone maker could have major repercussions on the global technology supply chain . Shares of Huawei's Asian suppliers fell on Thursday.  Huawei is already under intense scrutiny by the United States and other Western governments for its links to the Chinese government, motivated by concerns that the Asian giant could use this company to perform espionage work.The company has been excluded from the United States and some other markets, but Huawei has repeatedly insisted that Beijing has no influence over it .  Meng, vice president of the company's board and daughter of founder Ren Zhengfei, was arrested on December 1 at the request of US authorities.

"The company has been given very little information regarding the charges and is not aware of any crime by Ms. Meng," he said.  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a daily press conference on Thursday that China has asked Canada and the United States for an explanation of Meng's arrest, but that "they have not provided any clarification."  The Huawei Executive High Arrest Arrest taint the commercial truce between the US and China was first published in La Tercera. Load-Date: December 6, 2018End of Document

CHINA'S SOCIAL MEDIA CRACKDOWN TARGETS TWITTERStates News ServiceNovember 21, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 370 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:Authorities Digitally Erase Even Past Critical SpeechYaqiu WangChina Researcher @YaqiuSince early November, the Chinese government has been targeting Twitter users in China as part of a nationwide crackdown on social media even though Twitter is blocked in the country. Authorities have detained or summoned dozens or more Twitter users, forcing them to delete sensitive tweets or close their accounts. In some cases, authorities appear to have hacked accounts themselves.The government's recent attention to Twitter absent any protests or other social events organized via Twitter as a trigger signals a new level of suppression of free speech under President Xi Jinping's repressive rule. Some of those detained have been low-profile users with a small number of Twitter followers, and do not appear to participate in activism offline. A Twitter user who was briefly detained told me that the police showed him a list of Twitter users in his city that authorities planned to "tackle."It seems that the authorities not only want to stop Chinese people from speaking out against the government, but also want to scrub from the Internet records of past critical speech. Some of the tweets authorities pressured Twitter users to delete were posted years ago; few would have viewed the tweets had they remained. It strains credulity that Beijing is worried that activist Wu Gan currently serving an eight-year sentence for subversion is suddenly going to start tweeting from prison, yet his tweets were first deleted and then his account vanished.Twitter has been a refuge of sorts for those who can't bear the censorship on China's social media. "Here are no sensitive words, no messages that can't be displayed 'according to the relevant laws,' and no risk of having our account shut down at any movement," wrote Twitter user @gavinleehead, whose account has now been deleted.But authorities might want to heed the backlash against their ever-tightening repression. "The policeman threatened to jail me if I did not delete the tweets," a Twitter user and activist told me. "And I blurted out, 'Do it now, lock me up!'" Yet, ultimately, he too deleted his Tweets.Load-Date: November 22, 2018End of Document

Silicon Valley is working with China to ease fears about AICNN WireOctober 17, 2018 Wednesday 10:51 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 518 wordsByline: By Sherisse Pham, CNN BusinessDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  Baidu has become the first Chinese company to join a US-led alliance on artificial intelligence that includes Silicon Valley's biggest names.The Partnership on AI was established in 2016 to ease concerns about the development and use of the frontier technology. Fears over AI include the risk of machines becoming smarter than people, which Elon Musk has said could pose an existential threat to the human race. Experts have also warned that rogue states, criminals and terrorists could use the technology to wreak havoc around the world by taking control of drones and other automated weapons. US tech heavyweights Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT) and IBM (IBM) set up the group to thrash out best practices for AI technology, in partnership with academics and ethics experts."Admitting our first Chinese member is an important step toward building a truly global partnership," the group's executive director, Terah Lyons, said in a statement. Tensions over technology are at the heart of a trade war between the United States and China. The Trump administration has accused Beijing of stealing tech secrets from American companies, and some of Baidu's partners in the consortium are banned in China. Artificial intelligence is spreading rapidly into daily life. It's already replacing warehouse workers, steering driverless cars and helping diagnose illnesses. And China's ambitions in the field are too big to ignore."Any conversation about the future of AI that does not involve China is an incomplete conversation," Lyons said. Baidu (BIDU), which runs China's biggest search engine, has been extremely bullish on AI and wants to become an industry leader. The company started aggressively investing in the emerging technology in 2012, back when it "was not that sexy," Baidu CEO Robin Li said in an interview with CNN last year. "AI is the new electricity ... it's going to change industry after industry and we are at the center of that," Li said. Baidu's self-driving car unit is partly based in Silicon Valley and the company has attracted global brands like Ford (F) and BMW (BMWYY) to join Apollo, its project to develop the technology. The Chinese government also wants to be at the center of the global AI revolution. Beijing set out a vision last year to build a domestic artificial intelligence industry worth nearly $150 billion in the coming years.But Beijing has also fueled concerns through its growing use of AI to keep an eye on citizens. Facial recognition technology is being used by police to catch suspects who attend public events like music concerts. "We recognize the importance of joining the global discussion around the future of AI," Baidu President Ya-Qin Zhang said in a statement. "Ensuring AI's safety, fairness and transparency should not be an afterthought but rather highly considered at the onset of every project or system we build."The Partnership on AI said it plans to add new members in China and other countries in the future. TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Stayed at Marriott worldwide? China's Ministry of State Security has your profileEturbo NewsDecember 12, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 eTurboNews, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 313 wordsDateline: U.S. BodyU.S., Dec. 12 -- Checking into a Marriott operated hotel in China means your data is in Chinese Government hands. This is usually expected when it comes to travel to a closed country like China.Checking into a hotel in New York or London and your data ending up in China is definitely not expected.This may no longer be true, after U.S. authorities are getting a clearer picture of who they believe is responsible for the massive hack of the Marriott hotel chain in recent weeks that compromised the data of more than 500 million customers.Investigators believe hackers working on behalf of China's main intelligence agency are responsible for a massive data breach involving the Marriott hotel chain.According to new reports from The New York Times and The Washington Post , the hackers are suspected to be affiliated with China's Ministry of State Security. While authorities caution their findings are still inconclusive, they say the methods of the hackers, along with a variety of clues related to the hack, tend to suggest it was state-sponsored, which is yet another headache in the already difficult relations between the US and China. Both countries, you'll recall, are still locked in the makings of a tariff-fueled trade war, and the CFO of leading Chinese tech company Huawei has been arrested in Canada ahead of possible extradition to the US.What is Marriott doing about it? There are big business interests for the world's largest hotel chain to consider. Marriott operates many hotels in the Peoples Republic of China and is on an expansion course. eTurboNews alone recently published dozens of stories of major expansion into the Chinese market by Marriott.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from US Eturbo News.

11 UYGHURS FLY TO TURKEY AFTER MALAYSIA DROPS IMMIGRATION CHARGESStates News ServiceOctober 11, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 640 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:The Malaysian government sent 11 Uyghur refugees from China's Xinjiang province to Turkey after dropping immigration charges against them in defiance of a request by Beijing that they be returned there, their attorney said Thursday.The move came after a Kuala Lumpur Court granted a request by prosecutors to apply a discharge not amounting to acquittal. Fahmi Abdul Moin, a lawyer representing the Uyghurs, said his team sent a letter in July to the Attorney General's Chamber asking that the charges be dropped.Officials with the Attorney General's Chamber, as well as the home minister and his deputy could not be reached for comment late on Thursday.In a letter seen by BenarNews, Fahmi raised the issue of the alleged systematic oppression of the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang and discrimination against them by the Chinese government, which have forced many to flee the country."As such, my clients are part of the victims of the ongoing turmoil in the Xinjiang province and were forced to escape," Fahmi told BenarNews, , an RFA-affiliated online news service.He told prosecutors that his clients had entered Malaysia as a temporary transit point and hoped to sort out their refugee status with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) before joining an existing Uyghur community in Turkey.Fahmi said they flew from Malaysia to Turkey on Wednesday morning.Escape from ThailandThe Uyghurs fled to Malaysia after escaping from a detention center in southern Thailand in November 2017. The 11 were part of a group of 20 who broke out of the center by drilling holes in a wall.Their capture and detention in Malaysia for violating the Immigration Act by entering the country illegally became known in February when Chinese officials requested they be returned to Beijing.Later that month, then-Home Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said Malaysia was in talks with Thailand to return the Uyghurs, while the government led by then-Prime Minister Najib Razak sought a diplomatic solution to the case."We will take action that will not hurt the feelings of any country," Zahid said at the time.Dolkun Isa, the German-based president of the World Uyghur Congress, had urged the Malaysian government to not send them to China and to respect the international principle of non-refoulement by working with UNHCR and resettling the refugees in a safe third country."When Uyghurs are handed to Chinese authorities, they will face torture and jailed, they probably will go missing or face death," he told Radio Free Asia, a sister-entity of BenarNews.He said Uyghurs sent from Malaysia to China had disappeared.International relationsThe decision by Kuala Lumpur to release the Uyghurs move could further strain Malaysia's relationship with China.Since assuming power in May, the government of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has halted major Chinese projects including a railway and two pipeline projects approved by Najib, citing a mounting national debt.In an interview with Bloomberg News, Mahathir's likely successor as prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, called for formal talks with China regarding its crackdown against the Muslim minority that has included the reported incarceration of Uyghurs in secret detention camps.Anwar said the Malaysian government had raised the Uyghurs with the Chinese government, which sees them as an internal issue."This has gone out into the mainstream media as an issue, and I believe we should use a proper forum to start highlighting these issues and seek this understanding from the Chinese authorities," he told Bloomberg.Anwar also shared his thoughts on why Muslim governments have been silent on the Uyghurs."They're scared. Nobody wants to say anything," he said.Reported by BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service.Load-Date: October 12, 2018End of Document

AGCO Receives 2018 China Automotive Logistics Innovation AwardTargeted News ServiceDecember 26, 2018 Wednesday 7:50 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 690 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: DULUTH, Georgia BodyAGCO, a designer, manufacturer and distributor of agricultural equipment, issued the following news release:* * *- Award Recognizes AGCO's Initiatives in Using Smart Logistics to Close Digital GapAGCO Corporation (NYSE:AGCO), a worldwide distributor and manufacturer of agricultural equipment, was awarded the "China Automotive Logistics Innovation Award" for AGCO's Smart Logistics initiative by the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing (CFLP) at its annual summit held in late November.The 2018 National Automobile Logistics Industry Annual Conference was held in Shenzhen, China. The event was sponsored by the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing, and was hosted by the China National Automobile Logistics Branch. The conference was attended by more than 1,200 professionals from the China Logistics and Purchasing Association, the Transportation Service Department of the Ministry of Transport, the Traffic Management Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security, the National Information Center, other Chinese government departments and related institutions, together with 480 auto manufacturers, auto parts suppliers, and logistics service providers from across China.AGCO and its global partner 4flow - a provider of supply chain consulting, software, and neutral 4PL services - won the 2018 China Automotive Logistics Innovation Award for the 2017 implementation of their collaborative inbound logistics 4PL project in China. Changan Ford Company, Anji-Ceva, and Beijing Hyundai were also considered for the award.AGCO and 4flow were recognized for their efforts in digitalization and the end-to-end integration of network partners within AGCO's domestic Chinese inbound supply chain. The implementation of this digital supply chain program in China is part of the global rollout of the AGCO Smart Logistics initiative, a joint endeavor between AGCO and 4flow that continues to generate significant efficiencies and transportation cost savings by integrating and optimizing AGCO's supply chain structures around the world.The AGCO Smart Logistics approach is based upon the principle of combining an intelligent transportation management system, a standardized supplier development process, and risk management into a central cloud-based IT solution. The innovative approach utilizes smart algorithms that strategically and dynamically optimize the network holistically, including capacities, supplier shipping requirements, lead-times, as well as monitoring a wide range of geopolitical, weather, and economic factors on a real-time basis in order to optimize the material flow. Additionally, the Incoterms for the vast majority of AGCO's suppliers were converted from Delivered at Place (DAP) to Free Carrier (FCA) prior to implementation, a measure that was crucial to enabling active network management.The solution enabled AGCO to reduce significantly the cost of the inbound supply chain during the past twenty months. Furthermore, both on-time delivery performance and process conformance have been enhanced with great success. In addition to the significant improvements in Supply Chain agility, costs, increased performance, and quality levels, the initiative is reducing the CO2 footprint through improved capacity utilization and, therefore, it not only benefits AGCO but the environment as well. The China implementation was led by Kathy Zhang, Logistics Manager at AGCO's Changzhou, China site. "Kathy's leadership and solution orientation has delivered great results in the areas of network performance and cost optimization," shared Greg Toornman AGCO global vice president, Materials Management, Logistics, and Freight.This is the latest in a growing list of accolades that AGCO and 4flow have won for their collaboration on the AGCO Smart Logistics initiative.

In space first, China launches lunar rover to far side of the moonCNN.comDecember 6, 2018 Thursday 12:01 PM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: HEALTHLength: 679 wordsByline: By Steven Jiang and David Allan, CNNDateline: Beijing BodyChina is poised to become the first country to explore the far side of the moon with the launch of a lunar rover Saturday, another step to its goal of becoming a space superpower.The Chang'e 4 lunar mission lifted off from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in the Sichuan province in the early morning, confirmed by the Twitter account of the country's state-run Xinhua news agency.It's expected to land in early January after 26 days of flight, said China's Aerospace Science and Technology Corp.The lander will conduct the first lunar low-frequency radio astronomy experiment, observe whether plants will grow in the low-gravity environment, and explore whether there is water or other resources at the poles.Another function of the mission is to study the interaction between solar winds and the moon surface using a new rover."Since the far side of the moon is shielded from electromagnetic interference from the Earth, it's an ideal place to research the space environment and solar bursts, and the probe can 'listen' to the deeper reaches of the cosmos," said Tongjie Liu, deputy director of the Lunar Exploration and Space Program Center for the China National Space Administration.Because the far side of the moon is free from interference from radio frequencies, the mission requires a relay satellite to transmit signals that was launched into place this year. The Chang'e 4 rover is 1.5 meters (5 feet) long and about 1 meter (3.3 feet) wide and tall, with two foldable solar panels and six wheels."China is anxious to get into the record books with its space achievements," said Joan Johnson-Freese, a professor at the US Naval War College and an expert on China's space program."It is highly likely that with the success of Chang'e -- and the concurrent success of the human spaceflight Shenzhou program -- the two programs will eventually be combined toward a Chinese human spaceflight program to the Moon," she added. "Odds of the next voice transmission from the Moon being in Mandarin are high."China's last lunar rover -- named Yutu, or Jade Rabbit -- ceased operation in August 2016 after 972 days of service on the moon's surface as part of the Chang'e 3 mission. China was only the third nation to carry out a lunar landing, after the United States and Russia.The overall design of the new rover is inherited from Jade Rabbit, according to the chief designer of China's lunar probe program."We worked hard to improve its reliability, conducting thousands of experiments to ensure its long-term operation, especially taking into consideration rocks, ravines and frictions on the Moon," Wu Weiren told state broadcaster CCTV in August.Beijing plans to launch its first Mars probe around 2020 to carry out orbital and rover exploration, followed by a mission that would include collection of surface samples from the Red Planet.China is also aiming to have a fully operational permanent space station by 2022, as the future of the International Space Station remains in doubt due to uncertain funding and complicated politics.In comparison, despite its recent success in sending a robotic lander to Mars, the US space agency NASA has faced years of budgetary constraints.Although the Chinese government has long stressed its "peaceful motives" in space exploration, Washington increasingly views China -- along with Russia -- as a potential threat, accusing Beijing of working to bring new weapons into space and prompting President Donald Trump to announce the establishment of a US Space Force by 2020.The US Congress has barred NASA from working with China due to national security concerns."A high percentage of space technology is (civilian-military) dual use," Johnson-Freese said. "The US sees pretty much everything China does in space -- including things the US has done in space -- as threatening."She suggested that combining military preparedness with diplomatic efforts would best deter perceived threats in space from all sides but added that "unfortunately, the US has not shown interest in diplomatic leadership regarding space security."Load-Date: December 9, 2018End of Document

UPS Service Enhancements Target Growing Import Opportunities in ChinaTargeted News ServiceNovember 6, 2018 Tuesday 7:18 PM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 683 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: SHANGHAI, China BodyUPS, a package delivery company and a provider of supply chain management solutions, issued the following news release:UPS (NYSE:UPS) today highlighted enhancements to its service and portfolio in China at a roundtable session with several business and trade media, hosted by Ross McCullough, President of UPS Asia Pacific Region, and Harld Peters, President of UPS China. This announcement comes as the Chinese government increases its focus on imports to encourage greater bilateral trade between its major partners:* Faster delivery for import shipments cleared via informal entry to Beijing and Tianjin from Europe and intra-Asia1 by up to one day to accelerate cross-border import trade* Expanded UPS Worldwide Express to more postal codes in 22 cities across China2 since January this year; customers with time-sensitive shipment needs can now opt to have their import packages delivered by 10:30 AM* UPS My Choice(R) package-delivery management service introduced to give Chinese consumers shopping from international e-tailers greater control over their deliveries* Four daily flights to UPS's Shenzhen Intra-Asia Hub and Hong Kong upsized to new Boeing 747-8 aircraft, which offer 15 percent greater capacity than previous Boeing 747-400s; UPS operates 16 daily flights to support customers with import shipment needs through gateways in Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong"China's fast-growing middle class and their rapid adoption of ecommerce is fueling more imports into China; creating opportunities for businesses looking to serve this dynamic market, and driving the demand for reliable and timely delivery services," said Ross McCullough, President of UPS Asia Pacific Region. "UPS's global network and our unmatched capabilities help connect businesses looking to sell to China, and provide locally-based companies the flexibility to import and export goods effectively."As an example, the expansion of alcohol shipping to China last year in combination with the recently introduced UPS My Choice enables alcoholic beverage e-tailers to deliver a stronger customer experience as online alcohol sales continue to rise year on year.3 Customers of these high-value shipments also benefit from UPS technology and security controls4 that provide visibility throughout the shipment journey, giving them a peace of mind.With one integrated network supported by multimodal transportation, UPS has also added eight new stations to its intercontinental UPS Preferred(R) rail service connecting China and Europe. The three new stops in China are in Hefei, Xiamen, and Xi'an, while five new stops were added in Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands and Poland. The logistics integrator first introduced its China-Europe rail service in 2014, and has expanded its rail stops annually since then to strengthen connectivity and provide more flexible transportation solutions for businesses."Much like the addition of nodes to UPS's China-Europe rail network, new corridors will continue to sprout along the New Silk Road with more markets integrating and participating in cross-border trade. Businesses will look for guidance to ensure their supply chains don't get derailed - UPS, with our broad portfolio and global presence, is in a prime position to keep them on the right track," McCullough added.UPS has served businesses in China for 30 years, and currently operates more than 225 facilities across the country. With more than 220 weekly UPS flights to and from its strategically located hubs in Shenzhen and Shanghai, these latest enhancements further strengthen the competitiveness of businesses with import shipment needs.1.

France and Germany dismiss for now blocking Huawei and Spain remains silentCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 10, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1126 wordsBody Despite the harsh declarations of the vice president of the European Commission for the Digital Single Market, Andrus Ansip, who said on Friday that the EU should be worried and "afraid" of Huawei and other Chinese technology companies because of the risk they pose to security, France and Germany have ruled out for now prohibiting the use of technology from the Chinese company as they have done other countries such as the US, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. For now, they are moving away from the anti-Huawei policy that the Anglo-Saxon world seems to be adopting.  The French authorities have preferred to be cautious. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has assured that Huawei is welcome in France, although he admitted that his government could block certain investments. "Huawei is a company that plays an important role in France, which invests in France and these investments are welcome. If any of these investments affect national sovereignty or sensitive technologies, it will be up to our government to set certain limits, "he told reporters after speaking with Chinese Vice Premier Hu Chunhua.  According to Les Echos, Huawei teams have their place in French networks, as long as they respect some unwritten red lines: not being in the core of networks, not being in more than 50% of an operator's network, and not be in the Paris region. Something that has not prevented Huawei from closing important contracts in the country.  Germany, for its part, has opposed excluding suppliers such as Huawei for its future 5G network, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry said. The German authorities would have debated on the subject, but the industry of the telcos of Germany would have defended its long relation with Huawei. Deutsche Telekom, for example, carries out a 5G project in Berlin with Huawei.  In Spain, the Government prefers to maintain silence. Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Borrell limited himself to describing Meng's arrest as "worrying" on Friday. This newspaper was put in contact yesterday with Moncloa and the Secretary of State for the Digital Advance, employee of Economy, but they did not provide any information on if Spain will prohibit or not the use of the equipment of the Chinese company. Spain was, together with Portugal, the first country where Huawei entered Europe 17 years ago, and here the Chinese company works with all the major operators in the country. Among other actions, the Chinese giant signed a memorandum of understanding with Telefónica regarding 5G.  From the Foreign Ministry yes Yesterday referred to the detention of the heiress of Huawei in Canada on December 1. "The accusations do not end up being clarified and to what years they refer. In any case, if we talk about the last three years, they refer to the violation of sanctions applied exclusively by the United States to Iran. If they go back to an earlier period, the sanctions were from the United Nations. They are very different scenarios. When this point is clarified we will pronounce ourselves, "Foreign sources explained to Cinco Días.  Another European country, the United Kingdom, has admitted that it is evaluating what policy it will adopt, although BT did warn last week that it will exclude Huawei as a provider for the core of its future 5G infrastructure.  Some experts in the world of technology, such as Enrique Dans, professor at IE Business School, have raised the alarm about the risks of reducing the number of suppliers, specifically excluding Huawei. "For any country, blocking Huawei products usually means committing to a more expensive and slower development of their 5G networks, something that is very difficult to do if there is no fully justified reason for doing so. And to date Huawei has been subjected to careful scrutinyby companies and governments around the world, and no one has had more arguments when it comes to acquiring their products than the fact of being with one of the companies that invests more in technology R & D, which has obtained more patents than no other in areas as crucial as the development of 5G, and which is also very competitive in its quality / price ratio ".  The aforementioned French newspaper also warns that excluding Huawei as a provider for future mobile networks means depriving telcos of the knowledge of this technology. Something that surely worries the operators. Even the rivals of the Chinese company are worried, adds Les Echos. The CEO of Ericsson France, Franck Bouétard, admits that in the short term, this Huawei crisis could be interesting for European equipment manufacturers. "But if this leads to the closure of some markets, or even to the development of two different standards, we would return to 15 years ago."  Threats from China to the US and Canada  Over the weekend, the Huawei case, far from losing intensity, has risen several steps, as China increased its pressure on Canada and the US, demanding that they release the financial director and daughter of Huawei founder Meng Wanzhou. The Asian government threatened the authorities of the first country with "serious consequences" for the arrest, according to Efe, making the case one of the worst diplomatic conflicts between Beijing and Ottawa and Washington.  Vice President of Foreign Affairs of China, Le Yucheng, convened the Ambassador of Canada and the United States, John McCallum and Terry Branstad, respectively, to express their "deep protest" about the arrest of the board in Vancouver and demanded its immediate implementation. freedom. China urged Canada to seriously protect its legitimate rights. "Otherwise, Canada must accept its responsibility for the serious consequences caused," the Chinese government said in a statement.  Although China did not specify what actions it would take against Canada, the South China Morning Post newspaper indicated that these could range from the freezing of diplomatic exchanges to the suspension of trade, according to Efe. Reprisals that could be launched if Meng is finally extradited to the US. "The only way to avoid paying a very expensive price" is the immediate release of Meng, the People's Daily said.  Regarding the United States, he criticized his ambassador for having made "an irrational demand" to Canada to stop the board while he was transferring a flight in Vancouver. "The actions of the United States seriously violated the legal and legitimate rights of a Chinese citizen, and by their nature, they were extremely unpleasant." "China will respond according to the actions of the United States," the Chinese politician added without giving further explanations, Reuters reported.  The entrance France and Germany discard for now block Huawei and Spain remains silent was first published in La Tercera. Load-Date: December 10, 2018End of Document

CHINA JAILS NANJING BLOGGER FOR SUBVERSION OVER RETWEETS, SLOGANStates News ServiceDecember 27, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 602 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Authorities in the eastern Chinese province of Jiangsu have jailed an outspoken journalist for four years on subversion charges, his lawyer said.Sun Lin, who also uses the online nickname Jie Mu, was found guilty of "incitement to subvert state power" by the Nanjing Intermediate People's Court following a trial in February.The court passed verdict and announced the sentence of four years' imprisonment on Tuesday, in Sun's absence, his defense lawyer Mo Shaoping said."Sentence was passed in absentia, which is to say that Sun Lin wasn't in court, but back in the detention center," Mo said. "The judges appeared in court, and Sun Lin was connected via a video link, and able to communicate with the court."He said that while the sentencing arrangements were unprecedented, the sentence didn't come as a surprise."This was within our expectations," Mo said. "The judgment actually treats him as a re-offender, because less than five years had passed since he finished serving his last sentence, so the sentence was harsher than it otherwise might have been."Mo, who argued during the trial that Sun was not guilty of the charges against him, said his client plans to appeal.Sun, who has frequently spoken out against the use of staged "confessions" by the authorities in the past, refused to cooperate during his detention with police demands that he "confess" or plead guilty to the charges.The case against him rested on 25 social media posts and videos retweeted by Sun on social media, as well as his shouting "Down with the [ruling] Communist Party!" at an official party meeting in his neighborhood."We don't believe that this amounts to incitement to subversion," Mo said.Sun was initially detained by police on Nov. 16, 2016 as he shot video footage of the opening of the trial of Nanjing-based rights activist Wang Jian.Wang said Sun is innocent."I think he's innocent," Wang said. "Detaining and sentencing him is outright political persecution, under international law and under the Chinese constitution."Sun had already served a four-year jail term from 2007-2011 for "picking quarrels and stirring up trouble" after he wrote about official abuse of power in support of a group of forced evictees in Nanjing.He has been financially dependent on relatives since being unable to find work owing to his police record, and his in-laws have had their sources of income cut off too, he has previously said. 'Subversion' charges Patrick Poon, China researcher for the London-based rights group Amnesty International, said the authorities are increasingly using "subversion" charges to target peaceful critics of the Chinese government."Incitement to subvert carries a maximum jail term of 15 years, while subversion of state power carries no upper custodial sentence limit," Poon said.He said the authorities also often use "picking quarrels and stirring up trouble" to target peaceful dissents, although such charges can often be changed once more evidence is gathered."Picking quarrels and stirring up trouble carries a maximum term of six or seven years," Poon said.China is the world's top jailer of journalists and bloggers, with 60 behind bars in 2018, Paris-based press freedom group Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said in its annual report.The majority of those are citizen reporters who operated outside the Chinese Communist Party's strictly regulated state media, the group said earlier this month.

Researchers Say World's First Gene-Edited Babies Have Been Born in ChinaStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeNovember 27, 2018 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: MEDICINE; Pg. 1Length: 848 wordsByline: Samantha LongBodyHe's unverified claim came on the eve of an worldwide summit dedicated to discussing the emerging science and ethics around powerful tools that give scientists unprecedented potential to tweak traits and eliminate genetic diseases - but that have raised fears of "designer babies".The Chinese government has ordered an "immediate investigation" into the alleged delivery of the world's first genetically edited babies, as experts worldwide have voiced outrage at such use of the technology.He also produced a YouTube video outlining the project and announcing the birth of the two girls, dubbed "Lulu" and "Nana". "The babies are home now with their mom Grace and their dad Mark".Subsequently, a singlesperm was put into a single egg in order to create an embryo. In each case, the father was infected with HIV; the mothers were HIV-negative. His work has resulted in one pregnancy so far.He's claim has not been independently confirmed or published in a journal where other experts could review his work. Although China has no laws explicitly banning gene editing in babies, using the procedure does violate guidelines published by China's health ministry in 2003, and goes against global guidelines agreed to at a summit on the issue in 2015."I think this isjustifiable, " Church told the AP.More than 120 Chinese scientists called the experiment "crazy" in a letter, adding that it dealt a huge blow to the global reputation of Chinese science.A spokesman for He said he has been on leave from teaching since early this year but remains on the faculty and has a lab at the university.Some scientists were astounded to hear of the claim and strongly condemned it.He is scheduled to speak at the summit on gene editing on Wednesday, but organizers were unsure whether he planned to discuss his experiment."We don't know how much of this is true or verified". He had also previously spoken with the Associated Press about his study, which he says resulted in twin girls born with the first genomes edited by man. "Why would you use this instead of an already established approach?"GM to slash 14,700 jobs in North AmericaIt will shut two unnamed plants outside North America, in addition to the previously announced closure of a plant in Korea. Barra said the company will double resources dedicated to electric and self-driving vehicles over the next two years.In a pre-recorded video on the conference's website, biologist and chair of the worldwide summit David Baltimore said: "We have never done anything that will change the genes of the human race, and we have never done anything that will have effects that will go on through the generations".In his promotional video, He describes targeting the CCR5 gene, which helps the HIV virus enter healthy human cells. Scientists have long searched for ways to block this pathway to protect people from HIV. We need comprehensive studies to show that genome editing is not going to cause harm to the future people it helps create."Gene surgery is and should remain a technology for healing".It is said that many mainstream scientists feel like gene-editing humans are too unsafe to try, and others are said to have denounced this Chinese research as it being akin to human experimentation."It is premature at this stage of technology", wrote Shoukhrat Mitalipov, a scientist at the Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, Ore. Mitalipov was the first scientist to report using CRISPR to successfully edit human embryos, but stopped far short of trying to use them to make babies. The SUSTech Department of Biology Academic Committee believes that Dr. Jiankui HE's conduct in utilizing CRISPR/Cas9 to edit human embryos has seriously violated academic ethics and codes of conduct. 3.Scientists are investigating the use of CRISPR-Cas9 as a treatment for many genetic diseases, such as muscular dystrophy and sickle cell anemia. As a result, it's revolutionizing scientific research and raising high hopes for major breakthroughs, including preventing and treating many diseases.But making changes in humanDNA that could be passed down for generations has always been considered off-limits. And researchers around the world have been racing to determine how it could be done safely.It's "unconscionable.an experiment on human beings that is not morally or ethically defensible", said Dr Kiran Musunuru, a gene-editing expert from the University of Pennsylvania. It would be a significant step, and it's raised widespread ethical concerns among researchers."Gene editing itself is experimental and is still associated with off-target mutations, capable of causing genetic problems early and later in life, including the development of cancer", Julian Savulescu, an ethicist at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom, said in a statement released today by the U.K. Science Media Centre."If this goes unchallenged, other rogue actors will soon offer wealthy parents purported genetic enhancements for their children", said Marcy Darnovsky of the Center for Genetics and Society. "And I am willing to take the criticism for them".Load-Date: November 29, 2018End of Document

CHINA GRABS 3.4 MILLION AMERICAN JOBSStates News ServiceOctober 25, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1245 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Campaign for Americas Future:Leo GerardEverything is great, right? Unemployment is the lowest in half a century. The economy is churning out a high GDP. Home values are rising rapidly again. Inflation remains low.Still, the stock market has been crashing in recent weeks. Investors don't like President Donald Trump's trade war with China. It makes them nervous.Nervous? They have no idea. Since 2001, when the United States agreed to allow China into the World Trade Organization, U.S. workers have been nervous every day. Twenty-four hours a day. Three hundred and sixty-five days a year. They fear losing their jobs to China. And rightly so. A new study by the non-partisan Economic Policy Institute (EPI) shows the growth in the U.S. trade deficit with China between 2001 and 2017 cost 3.4 million American workers their jobs.Trump's tariff war hasn't solved this problem. The August trade deficit with China was the highest on record, at $38.6 billion, and the deficit for 2018 is projected to be the largest ever. The trade deficit that is, the billions more that China sells in the United States than the United States sells in China is what kills jobs. As that deficit rises, more work to produce goods and services is done in China. If the deficit declined, or trade balanced, more work would be done in the United States. That is the administration's goal. If it could be accomplished, workers' job anxiety would ease.Of the jobs lost between 2001 and 2017, nearly three quarters were in manufacturing 2.5 million. Those were good, family supporting jobs. The shock, fear and anger workers feel when they learn that their factories will close and that their work will be moved offshore is palpable in the viral video of Carrier officials telling 2,000 workers in Indianapolis in 2016 that the corporation intended to close their factory and ship the jobs to Mexico.Among the 2.5 million who lost jobs since 2001 is Lisa Crissman of Western Pennsylvania. She was struck down twice. The second time was earlier this year when her employer, Pittsburgh Glass Works, laid her off as it prepared to permanently close its auto windshield factory in the little town of East Deer, Pa., and move half of the work to Mexico.The first time it happened was in 2012 when the auto mirror manufacturing company Flabeg closed its Brackenridge, Pa., factory. The year before, Crissman and her Flabeg co-workers had made 14 million auto mirrors in Brackenridge, accounting for 70 percent of the domestic market.At both jobs, Crissman was a member of the union I lead, the United Steelworkers, and made good money and got good benefits. The Flabeg workers received federal Trade Adjustment Assistance because the company offshored the work. Flabeg told the federal government it was transferring mirror fabrication to China and Brazil because its American factory couldn't compete with low-cost mirrors imported from Asia. It closed the Pennsylvania plant for cheap labor and lax environmental protections overseas.Crissman lost her job to an underpaid worker denied union benefits in China. Her husband, coincidentally, lost his job at about the same time when the hydroelectric plant where he worked was sold, and the new owners laid off workers with the most seniority. Crissman recalls her daughter fearing that the family would lose their home to foreclosure.The two experiences taught Crissman a bitter lesson. She says, "No job is secure. Nothing is set in stone. Nothing is safe."That is the way U.S. factory workers live now: nervous. Any day could be their last on the job. Any day, their work could be shipped to China. Finding new work that pays a living wage is difficult in many places. Crissman managed to get another good job, but then it too disappeared. Multiply her experience times 2.5 million. That's the anxiety that hovers over U.S. factory floors, no matter how skilled, dedicated and efficient the American workers are.EPI figures that growing trade deficits with China and other countries altogether cost America 90,000 factories and 5 million jobs in the past two decades.Small towns across America have suffered just as workers have. After a factory closes, unemployed residents move away for new work, shops close, and mayors lacking tax revenue cut services. The upshot is hollowed out shells of towns. Pittsburgh Glass Works was the largest employer and taxpayer in East Deer Township. The township, unsure of its finances after Pittsburgh Glass Works announced the closure, immediately postponed improvements at its Memorial Park.While jobs like those at Carrier and Pittsburgh Glass Works continue to move to Mexico, the trade deficit with China accounts for the majority 78 percent of the U.S. manufacturing jobs lost since 2001, according to the EPI report titled, "The China Toll Deepens."The loss was not concentrated in just one state or region, like Michigan or the Midwest. Every congressional district in every state bled jobs. Michigan, famous for auto and auto part manufacturing, is not even among the 10 states that lost the most jobs as a share of total employment. Those are New Hampshire, Oregon, California, Minnesota, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Vermont, Wisconsin and Texas.Workers laid off because of trade, like Crissman, lost wages totaling $37 billion per year from 2001 to 2011. But there was another, even more dramatic effect on the earnings of American workers as a result of the growing import competition with China and other low-wage countries. EPI figures imports from low-wage countries cut the earnings of America's 100 million workers without a college degree by 5.5 percent, or $1,800 per year per full-time worker. The total cost to them $180 billion in 2011 alone.That money, EPI says, went instead to CEOs, highly paid professionals with college degrees and corporate profits. It went to the guys who gamble on stocks and who now think a trade war could cut their earnings, guys who probably have no idea what their free trade demands have already cost American factory workers.When China gained access to the benefits of the World Trade Organization in 2001, it agreed to abide by what are essentially free market rules. But it has not. Its prices are lower because the Chinese government subsidizes exports, providing its industries with perks like loans that don't have to be repaid, free or cut-rate raw materials, and discounted utility bills. While it suppresses unions that would enable workers to bargain for decent wages, it keeps people employed by subsidizing overproduction of materials like steel and aluminum, then dumps the excess at below-production-cost prices on the international market.These market-distorting practices kill industries in market economies like the United States, Canada and European Union.The Trump administration has imposed a series of tariffs on imports, mostly on China, to apply pressure on Beijing to stop violating trade rules. The administration hopes this will begin to cut the trade imbalance and the loss of U.S. factories and jobs.The researchers at EPI believe it's not enough, though. They say the dollar is overvalued by 25 to 30 percent, which acts as a tax on U.S. exports and a subsidy on imports. Currency manipulation and misalignment by China, Japan and other countries must be confronted, or the United States will continue to lose its manufacturing might and its vital, middle class jobs.Load-Date: October 29, 2018End of Document

We got some firmness when we heard that there was progress on the China deal.Here's what IAC Chairman, Barry Diller, told me about China's trade practices(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARRY DILLER, CHAIRMAN, IAC: Their trade practices have to change. And us, being tough-minded about it, I think it's sensible. I think us being outrageous and excessive about it is dangerous.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: We have the very latest this morning. More from Barry Diller as well on technology and what's been happening with tech stocks, all those stories coming up this Friday morning.And joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the Wall Street Journal's Assistant Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman, and Bench Mark Managing Partner, Kevin Kelly.Great to see you this morning.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning.KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK: Great to be here.BARTIROMO: Good morning.MCDOWELL: Look who's back two days in a row?JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good to be here.BARTIROMO: Yes, love it. Love it.FREEMAN: Yes, so exciting. I'm sorry you had to impose this on your viewers again, but --BARTIROMO: I'm so happy you're back. Yes. It's great.FREEMAN: -- I'm going to be here for a little while. The -- you know, I don't think the President said it was fantastic, but he did say it was good and nice talking to President Xi Jinping, so --MCDOWELL: Very good.FREEMAN: -- let's hope this is a step toward resolution of the trade dispute.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's right. And when we heard that they had the phone call, it actually did help markets yesterday.MCDOWELL: Right. Take --FREEMAN: Yes, and I --BARTIROMO: Big boost.FREEMAN: I think that's a lot of what you're seeing in the futures here as well.MCDOWELL: And on Apple's side, it's not just the revenue forecast for the December quarter, it's also the fact that they're -- they are no longer going to break out device unit sales in any future financial results.So basically, Apple is telling investors, "You're going to get a lot less information from us about what is going on with the company, with sales of our devices," and that's why the stock down five percent.But Apple was only down three percent in the month of October when Amazon was in a bear market losing 20 percent of its value.BARTIROMO: That's a good point, yes.MCDOWELL: We talked about that yesterday morning.So, again, revenue is a problem and then when any company says, "Oh, by the way, we're going to give you less information --BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: -- that's not --BARTIROMO: That's what happened to --MCDOWELL: That's what happens to the stock.BARTIROMO: That's what happened to Oracle a couple of weeks ago. I mean - - and a lot of the analysts who have said that they said that they weren't going to break out cloud revenue and these specific lines within the cloud revenue, less transparency, you know, and so that's one thing.So we're going to know less about how the company makes --FREEMAN: But the revenue and the earnings are good.BARTIROMO: Yes.FREEMAN: It's just the outlook.BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.FREEMAN: And then that's -- we have seen that with a lot of these companies, where the numbers are fine, it's the future and the concern, and maybe some of it is going away now with this discussion on China.KELLY: But --MCDOWELL: Amazon --BARTIROMO: And which is the issue. Which is the issue. Are we going to see growth slowdown in the future? And what we're hearing, as far as these revenue expectations, is, yes, things will slow down with the growth.MCDOWELL: The midpoint of the revenue forecast for the holiday quarter from Apple is just a three percent gain year over year.That is for a company at this valuation, Apple being cheaper than other tech names, but that's still lackluster, quite frankly.KELLY: Yes. I mean I think it's important to note that they're not going to be announcing unit sales and that's because they actually missed on unit sales this time.Sixty percent of their revenue comes from iPhone sales.I mean, that is it. And so if they're missing on those numbers now and then they're not going to give them in the future, that's uncertainty for investors, especially because the biggest important market, which President Trump's going to be talking to Xi Jinping, is China.We saw the revenues come down from 21 percent the previous quarter to 18 percent and they're continuously slowing down over there.That's the most important market for growth.MCDOWELL: Uh-hmm.BARTIROMO: And that's what Dan Niles pointed out, that, look, are we really going to see people pony up a thousand dollars for an iPhone X in China when you know that things are slowing down there?And he also mentioned the inventories, when you check on inventories at Apple as well coming up.Also joining the conversation this morning, my exclusive interview with Barry Diller. He is Chairman of InterActive/IAC, and Expedia Group. Don't miss what he has to say about markets and technology, and really where the growth is going forward.All that is coming up.But first, our top story this hour. Apple shares under pressure despite a earnings report. Earnings per share of $2.91 a share.Revenue 61.9 billion -- as you see earnings revenue, $62.9 billion on revenue on earnings of $2.91 a share.Apple stock is down better than five percent right now, as you can see. The stock is down as investors worry about that guidance.The company's decision to stop reporting unit sales for the products, seeing it as sign of potentially slow sales growth.Joining us right now is Mahoney Asset Management CEO, Ken Mahoney. Ken, it's good to see you.KEN MAHONEY, CEO, MAHONEY ASSET MANAGEMENT: Great to be back again.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us.Let me just point out that it is also Jobs Friday.MAHONEY: Yes.FREEMAN: Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo.BARTIROMO: So we will have the Jobs number out in two and a half hours and we're going to talking about that as well.MAHONEY: Glad to know.BARTIROMO: But your reaction to the Apple numbers.MAHONEY: Again, soft numbers. You know, they're really playing around and pushing the envelope when it comes to elasticity of the man. Remember that little textbook phrase?I mean pushing up prices and see where that demand is, I mean, look, I think the estimates were about $750 a unit to now they came to $793.But they're really pricing out a lot of households. I mean what is that -- what is that elasticity of the man? Where is that level where you could actually have good margins and also have some good sales?And I think that's the thing. And also by the way, I think the new offerings are quite confusing to consumers, right? There's the XL's, and G's, and D, like --BARTIROMO: No --MAHONEY: Before, it's quite simple, you had a red card to pick, a white card, and a black card color, you know.KELLY: Right.MAHONEY: And now we have, like, 19 different choices, so what is the consumer -- where is that kind of sweet spot now for Apple with their iPhone offerings?MCDOWELL: So the XR is the cheaper of the new model. The X -- I say X, it's 10, it's 10R, 10S, 10S Max, and it's actually the 10R, or the XR, that's gotten the really good reviews and that's the lower price change.And so that, again, is -- was a concern going into this report.KELLY: Yes, I think you're bringing up a great point because what happened is they keep increasing their average selling price, but also the parts and components are going down.So their operating margins are expanding pretty significantly and that's going to be a future headwind because we're not going to see DRAM prices go down even more.And so I think, when you're talking about pricing power, that's what is going to help companies succeed next year when they can --MAHONEY: That's right.KELLY: -- when they can pass along that pricing power.So what are you seeing for next year and how you're going to be positioning yourself in the markets?MAHONEY: Yes, look, it's going to be a volatile year. We also have to deal with the headlines, the Fed raising rates at a time when, you know, that's another kind of one of those bugaboos that's going to be out there, right?So, you know, I feel like the Fed's going to keep raising rates until something breaks, and some things are breaking around us -- housing, we're seeing construction, homebuilders, and so forth.So I think -- I think investors are becoming nimble. I mean we don't make them day traders, but kind of active when we have these swishes down like we had in February, in April, coming off of a strong January and March.And now, again, a strong August-September we've had.So I think we are -- we have a hybrid strategy, basically. Seventy percent long, large cap growth, but also about 30 percent kind of buy the dip, sell the rip, you know, into some of these crazy volatilities.So I think next year, look, we have a lot -- we have a lot of things to kind of deal with after midterm elections, but at the -- at the end of the day, I think investors can make volatility their friend instead of their foe, is kind of the way we're going to come and play this.BARTIROMO: But are you saying you are expecting a slowdown in the coming couple of years?MAHONEY: I think so. Again, some specific interest rate sensitive industries, again, home builders, again they bounce a little bit, we wouldn't be there.BARTIROMO: Well, what about the broad economic --MAHONEY: All those and --BARTIROMO: -- growth? I mean we're talking about 4.2 percent growth for the second quarter, 3-1/2 percent for the --MAHONEY: 3.5, yes.BARTIROMO: -- third quarter. Do you see economic growth slowing down?MAHONEY: Oh, yes, absolutely. Yes, it's definitely slowing down 4.1.BARTIROMO: OK.MAHONEY: But, again, the point is the Fed keep raising rates here, it's going to slow a lot of things.And we're seeing already, by the way. If you look at the real estate market, especially in the metro area here, you're starting to see some softness, so it is having impact, these higher interest rates.FREEMAN: So if the President, best-case scenario here, gets a deal quickly with China, not predicting this, but if Xi Jinping says, "OK, we'll respect property rights and lower trade barriers," you're thinking that doesn't give the market much of a bump because the focus stays on interest rates or it does?MAHONEY: Look, look, look, we saw, since Monday, you know, look, we had a whipsaw kind of -- bungee market, we were up 350 points.The President said, "Hey, we're going to add some more trade tariffs in China in case we don't get a deal," and the market fell out of bed again.FREEMAN: Yes.MAHONEY: So he knows his words are tied into his algorithms that trade offered us.FREEMAN: Right.MAHONEY: So, the tariffs are really important. Look, we heard from 3M, Caterpillar, even Apple last night, talk about the uncertainty because of China trade.So, that definitely helps out. But, again, I think 4.1 may be your peak GDP, quite frankly, and 3-1/2 of, you know --KELLY: No.FREEMAN: Yes.MCDOWELL: I was going to -- I would point out, the Apple stock, until through yesterday, was still up 31 percent year to date.FREEMAN: Yes.MCDOWELL: And one big concern is the iPhones and the imports of Apple goods made in China have not been hit with any tariffs by this government yet.But it looks like if something doesn't get resolved by the end of the year, iPhones will get hit with tariffs, and then you have to factor in the worry that the Chinese government retaliates against Apple.MAHONEY: Right.MCDOWELL: Retaliates in terms of China as a sales market, but also as a manufacturing hub for Apple, so there's a lot of concern.It would be a huge, huge boost for the stock potentially if the U.S. could get something done with China on trading.MAHONEY: It's important, too, because this has been going on for about a year now.MCDOWELL: Yes.MAHONEY: Versus protecting aluminum and steel industries now, we have some of the other industries aching from this.So at the end of the deal, you know, we've been playing Liar's Poker. My 50 billion, your hundred billion, my 50 billion, my hundred -- you know, at this point, we really should get a deal here, right?BARTIROMO: But he's got -- this administration has got to push back on China. Don't forget what we heard yesterday and this was just one company and this is just one issue and that is from Steve Ballmer.MAHONEY: Right,BARTIROMO: Former CEO of Microsoft.MAHONEY: Microsoft, yes.BARTIROMO: That 90 percent of the -- of the companies in China use the Microsoft operating platform and only one percent pay for it.MAHONEY: Right.BARTIROMO: And that equates to $10 billion to Microsoft.MAHONEY: No, I remember back in --BARTIROMO: Lost profit --MCDOWELL: But the --BARTIROMO: -- that goes to China because they're stealing it.MAHONEY: Right.MCDOWELL: But I started the week by talking about this and the Journal writes about it today. The better China strategy is what we've seen them going after, Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Company, which has been accused of stealing technology intellectual property from Micron.That's what this administration has done. We hit the Chinese company for allegedly stealing those secrets.The Journal writes about it, calling it a better China trade.MAHONEY: Well you -- well --BARTIROMO: And I don't disagree.MCDOWELL: Rather than -- rather than blunderbuss Paris.BARTIROMO: And we should have -- and I --MAHONEY: Yes, well --BARTIROMO: And I don't disagree, we should have pushed back on ZTE as well.MCDOWELL: Yes.MAHONEY: That's right.KELLY: Yes, and we did. We actually imposed some fines --BARTIROMO: But then he came back.KELLY: -- because he was skirting sanctions. Right. But I think the important thing to note here is that it's not just American companies and the American government.We saw, at the World Trade Organization, the Europeans came around with our viewpoints as well and said, actually, they should not be getting a most- favored nation status at the World Trade Organization.BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.KELLY: They're still considered an emerging economy, yet they're still skirting regulation.BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly.MAHONEY: Right.KELLY: So if you even have the Europeans aligned with the Americans, that's going to be saying something. But this goes back --MAHONEY: Right.KELLY: -- to what you're talking about, is that even if we get -- do get good growth next year, the dollar's going to get stronger.MAHONEY: That's right.KELLY: And the Feds is also going to continue to raise rate because --MAHONEY: Right.KELLY: -- they're going to tamper inflations because if parts go up, then inflation's going up.MAHONEY: Right.KELLY: So the stronger dollar, I see, is one of the biggest impediments.MAHONEY: Absolutely.BARTIROMO: Are you selling into this rally right now?MAHONEY: Yes, this morning we will be selling. But, look, from -- yes, from Monday's low -- this is like Friday's, it's been a long month this week, right, guys?So from Monday's low to this open, it's about a 10 percent move for the NASDAQ.I think we go back in film, not bearish, but I think we need to break down like we did, we do this bounce, we do a retest, I hope we make higher lows.BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.MAHONEY: I mean that'd be great technically. But at the end of the day, we were up 10 percent intraday from Monday now through Friday.I think it takes some shekels, have some -- your powers run away in case we have to go back, or in case next week, the midterm elections don't go the way people think it's going to go, or the China talks don't go the way we think they will go.BARTIROMO: Yes.MAHONEY: You have some -- you have some -- you have some power drive.BARTIROMO: So sell into strength? I like that.MAHONEY: Sell into strength.MCDOWELL: Sell some shekels.MAHONEY: That's true.BARTIROMO: All right. Let's talk jobs for a second. It is Jobs day in America this morning.Thee October Jobs Report out in two hours, 8:30 a.m. Eastern. Here are the expectations, a hundred and ninety thousand jobs added to the economy in the month of October.With the unemployment rate holding steady and 3.7 percent. Kevin, what are you expecting from today's Jobs numbers?KELLY: Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm.BARTIROMO: What are you going to be focused on this morning?KELLY: Yes, I think we're actually going to get a print above 200,000, and one of the reasons why is holiday expectations and needing to fill those seasonal jobs.And especially after the hurricanes, I'm going to really be looking at the labor participation rate and I think that's the biggest one because we need to see people coming into the labor force if this economy continued to grow and expand.Because that will lead to productivity for the companies --BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.KELLY: -- so they can keep their margins where they're at.BARTIROMO: Is a good number priced into this market, Ken?MAHONEY: I don't know. I think today, the market's mostly focused on the trade deal with China.BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.MAHONEY: And a little bit about Apple.I mean this is important, but I think it's already a foregone conclusion that the Fed's going to raise rates in December.BARTIROMO: Yes.MAHONEY: We're going to be watching wage growth very closely.And to your point, you know, a lot of companies are saying we're having trouble finding employees to grow our business.KELLY: Yes.MAHONEY: So this is -- this is an issue. So, participation rate is important.KELLY: The rate.MAHONEY: But it -- the wage growth is what the Feds' going to watch closely. So, we have to watch when the Feds' watching to make our decisions.BARTIROMO: yes, wage growth is important.FREEMAN: Yes, and --MCDOWELL: It's supposed to be the best in nine and a half years, so (INAUDIBLE)FREEMAN: Yes, because we have a worker shortage.MAHONEY: yes.FREEMAN: That's what we saw on the NFIB report yesterday.BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.FREEMAN: And it's good to see the President the last couple of days recognizing that, saying we want border enforcement, but we want to let people in, too.MAHONEY: That's right.BARTIROMO: All right. Let's jump. Ken Mahoney, good to see you.MAHONEY: Thanks very much. Good Friday.BARTIROMO: We are all hands on deck, so keep it right here. MORNINGS WITH MARIA, we've got full coverage of the October Jobs Report beginning at 8:00 a.m. Eastern, special coverage where we identify where the jobs are right now.First up, protecting that border, the first 100 troops have arrived at the border for Operation Faithful Patriot as the migrant caravan closes in on the border. The very latest next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A sheriff's deputy in Texas fighting for his life this morning. Cheryl Casone with all the details and headlines now. Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, Maria. Good morning.That deputy and another officer were attempting to serve a warrant to a man who failed to register as a sex offender.The officers had to use a stun gun on the suspect after he resisted arrest, but he escaped and fled to his apartment. That suspect started shooting. He hit the deputy in the head, the unnamed officer remains in critical condition this morning. The suspect is, though, in custody.Well, the first 100 active-duty troops arriving at the Southern Border. As part of Operation Faithful Patriot, President Trump said the number of troops deployed to the border could go as high as 15,000.Meanwhile, the President plans to sign an executive order that could keep migrants, including asylum seekers apprehended at the border, in detention until their legal cases are heard.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Those who choose to break our laws and enter illegally will no longer be able to use meritless claims to gain automatic admission into our country.We will hold them for a long time, if necessary.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Well, at least three caravans of migrants are currently heading north from Central America right now.Then there's this, AT&T's WarnerMedia accusing the Justice Department of collaborating with Dish Network.WarnerMedia issued a statement saying, "The Department of Justice collaborated closely with Dish in its unsuccessful lawsuit to block our merger. Well, that collaboration continues to this day with Dish's tactical decision to drop HBO, not the other way around."So here's what's going on. For the first time in its 40-year history, WarnerMedia's HBO went dark on Dish Network yesterday after a disagreement over a new distribution deal.Now AT&T is going to go back to court next month in the DOJ's appeal of that antitrust decision approving AT&T's deal to buy Time Warner Media.So obviously, Maria, a lot of twists and turns in the story, but forget about it, you're not going to get your Sopranos reruns on HBO and Dish. Sadness.BARTIROMO: Oh, forget about it. All right, Cheryl.CASONE: Yes.BARTIROMO: Thank you. Coming up, the President's midterm rally blitz, the President is making stops in key states with just four days left before voters hit the poll.We are on countdown mode. We're breaking down the races coming up right after this.Then my exclusive interview with IAC and Expedia Group Chairman, Barry Diller. He's talking social media regulation, if it's even possible.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Spotlight on the midterms now. We are not four days away from the midterm elections. We are taking a look at key economic data in states with some of the most influential races, so today we zero in on Missouri, Montana, and Colorado.Joining us right now is Kristin Tate, she is The Hill contributor and author of "How do I Tax Thee?" Kristin, good to see you. Thank you so much for joining us.KRISTIN TATE, CONTRIBUTOR, THE HILL: Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: Before we get to Missouri, let me get your take overall. How do you think the Republicans fair in the midterms on Tuesday night?TATE: Well, I think this is really a referendum on Trump, so Republicans are trying to inject Trump into these races as much as possible to get his supporters to the polls.This is all about mobilization, but Trump mobilizes Democrats, too. We have Democrats running on the perceived hatred of Trump, so it's just about who can get the most folks to those voting booths.But I think that the Democrats are going to take back the house. But it'll be tight.BARTIROMO: All right. Let's start with Missouri here. The President was there last night campaigning for Republican candidate, Josh Hawley.He's locked in a tight race against incumbent Democratic Senator, Claire McCaskill, first elected back in 2006.Missouri's first quarter GDP, 2.4 percent. The unemployment rate, 3.2 percent in September. The state's leading industries are hospitals, nursing and residential care facilities.President Trump won this state back in 2016, what's your take here? Can Hawley unseat McCaskill?TATE: So this race is really a toss-up, but the most recent polls do suggest that Hawley has a slight edge here.Remember, Missouri is kind of a right-leaning state, Trump won it by 19 points. So, McCaskill is really trying to position herself as a moderate Democrat, someone who's worked with Trump.She's really courting Trump supporters because, frankly, she needs them to win this race.The two biggest issues there are health care and the economy. The economy there in Missouri is doing pretty well, growth has not been as robust as it's been for the nation as a whole.I think unemployment sits out about 3.3 percent, but interestingly, Hawley really hasn't been talking about the economy much and I think that's because of tariffs.Hawley supported President Trump when he tried to win these trade wars, but now Missouri is really feeling the effects of tariffs.China buys about one-third of Missouri's soybean crop, and of course they slapped 25 percent tariffs on soybeans, which reduced their value by about 20 percent, so that's really devastating to the farming industry there, which was already hurting.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's really a good point. And don't forget what Claire McCaskill said the other day, she's really trying to look like she's a moderate, calling her colleagues crazy.FREEMAN: Yes.BARTIROMO: She said, "Those crazy Democrats."TATE: Right.FREEMAN: Well, I wonder, does that affect turnout for her in St. Louis? She's obviously trying to get more of that rural vote, but what does that do for kind of the core Democratic voter there?TATE: She's in a tough position, you know, because she comes off as looking too liberal for the moderates and conservative votes, but too moderate for the really liberal voters in those cities.So, she is walking a very tough tightrope here, but Hawley has responded by really hammering her on that no vote that she gave to Kavanaugh, and a couple of other issues like her personal wealth.You know, McCaskill loves to say that, you know, she's just an ordinary Missouri gal, but really she's extremely wealthy. I think her net worth is, like, $29 million.So there are several issues that she's being hammered on and this is all to get the base energized on the right, but I do think she's going to have a hard time reaching out to people in the cities and, you know, these really far-left progressive voters.BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.TATE: Because, again, she is seen as too moderate for them.BARTIROMO: All right, Kristin, let's move on to Montana. Incumbent Democratic Senator Jon tester, facing off the Republican challenger, Matt Rosendale.Now on the economic front, first quarter GDP in Montana, two and a half percent. September unemployment, 3.6 percent, so a good unemployment number.The President is headed to Montana tomorrow. This is this last-minute campaign blitz before voters head to the polls. Kristin, what's driving voters here?TATE: Well, Tester is, again, another Democrat trying to fight for his political life in a state that loves Trump.Up until recently, he had been seen -- Tester had been seen as having a kind of wide lead here.BARTIROMO: Yes.TATE: But now, this is a toss-up race because the libertarian candidate in that race dropped out, presumably giving votes to the Republican.The big issues are health care and the economy.BARTIROMO: Yes.TATE: Insurance rates have been on the rise in this State of Montana, premiums have gone way up.BARTIROMO: Right.TATE: And then when it comes to the economy, Montana's really roaring under Trump. Unemployment, the lowest it's been since 2007 and --BARTIROMO: Yes, which is why -- which is why he's headed there today.TATE: -- median household incomes are way up.BARTIROMO: Real quick on Colorado.TATE: It's a --BARTIROMO: The state's first quarter GDP was three percent in Colorado. September unemployment, 3.1 percent, now the leading industry here, oil and gas extraction, contributing more than $11 billion to GDP. Real quick on Colorado, Kristin.TATE: I'm watching very closely the sixth congressional district race. People are saying this is kind of a bellwether for who controls congress.Of course, Colorado has been trending blue for many years now, so it's an uphill battle for the Incumbent Republican there, but Colorado citizens are very happy with the direction of the economy, that looks really good for Republicans, so we'll see what happens.BARTIROMO: All right, Kristin. Great analysis from you always. Thanks so much. We will see you soon.TATE: Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: Kristin Tate joining us. Stay tuned. We've got special coverage from -- on Fox Business for the midterm elections beginning November 6th."LOU DOBBS TONIGHT" kicks us off at 7:00 p.m. Eastern Tuesday night.Neil Cavuto takes over at 8:00 p.m. I will join Neil at 8:00.MORNINGS WITH MARIA the next morning starts an hour earlier. We'll all be here. All hands on deck 5:00 a.m. Eastern. The next day with all the results because some of these races could go late with, of course, California closing late on Tuesday night.Coming up, my exclusive sit-down with IAC Chairman, Barry Diller. What he says about the future of social media and companies in his portfolio, including Match, Tinder, and Angie's.Plus, oil earnings in focus this morning. Supply concerns weighing on investors. We'll talk more about that after this.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Friday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us. TGIF, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Friday, November 2nd, your top stories right now, 6:32 a.m. on the East Coast.Finishing up another week of earnings, it's a big one, Apple shares are under pressure, this morning, the technology giant, reporting the fourth straight quarter of record revenue and profit. However, the company said it will no longer report unit sales, not going over well with investors, this morning.And isn't it interesting that we are looking at Apple, down almost six percent, and we're still expecting a rally, in the broader markets.We're waiting on energy names this morning, reporting their quarter, including Exxon Mobil and Chevron. We are also waiting, of course, on the October jobs report, that's going to come out in two hours from now.We are expecting 190,000 jobs added to the economy in the month of October, with an unemployment rate holding steady, at 3.7 percent. We will look at what it all means for the midterm elections, now, four days away from the midterms.Check out Futures, going into all of that, Dow Industrials expected to be up 225-point rally at the start, even with Apple, down where it is. The other averages also higher, the NASDAQ and the S&P, up fractionally.The major indices finished higher, yesterday, as well. We had a 3-day rally underway, Dow Industrials yesterday, at the close, up 264 points, better than one percent. Check out the NASDAQ, yesterday, at the close, up 128 points, that was one and three quarters percent, yesterday.In Europe this morning, momentum is continuing, FT 100 up three quarters of a percent, 50 points higher, CAC Quarante in Paris, up one and a third percent, 65 points higher, and the DAX Index in Germany, up 1-1/2 percent, 166 points higher.Overnight, in Asia, markets were higher across the board, best performer, Korea, up 3-1/2 percent. Hang Seng, up more four -- the Hang Seng Index up better than four percent, in Hong Kong.And protests at Google are continuing, thousands of employees are protesting the company's -- they're walking off the job after the company is reacting to the sexual harassment allegations. We will tell you about that. How the company's reacting to all these protests.But first, our top story this half an hour, the future of the internet, IAC and Expedia Group Chairman Barry Diller, sitting down with me, in a FOX Business Exclusive, we talked about the brands of his business and I also got his take on regulation, will hit the industry in the wake of privacy scandals at major players like Google and Facebook.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)DILLER: Well, look at what has happened with Facebook and with Google and with all of the large players in communications or in social communications, where the proliferation, the ability to simply get into the system with infectious disease, bad, evil thought, manipulations by Russians or by the Chinese or by this political action side or that.The demonizing of George Soros, and, in fact, where every one of these -- Facebook just announced that they had this huge breach, every technology, it is -- the cyber warfare of it. All of these things are just -- you know, it's just the stir of what has been enabled. And we are not even yet at the even beginning stage of taming it. And it will, over time, get tamed.I think it's going to get tamed by regulation, because I think we've reached the stage where regulation is a recommended thing when you have these areas that have gotten so strong and powerful, with so many unintended consequences that the only way that you can really probably deal with them is, through some -- through, hopefully, wise regulation.BARTIROMO: What is regulation, though, going to look like, because you can't really regulate a company just because it got big and powerful, but if they have market share of 90 percent of all search, like Google does, or if they have vulnerabilities to the bad actors, like Facebook, how do you regulate that?DILLER: Well, I think, we should resurrect some form of what was called, the fairness doctrine. So, if you have an opinion over on this side, you have to air -- you have to provide a countervailing opinion on the other side, that's called fairness doctrine.And it ruled broadcasting for 25 years until, of course, there were then lots more outlets for expression and they say, we don't need this anymore because we've got enough diversity, OK? Now, we have the opposite end of this coin, which is they have too much out there, and too many divisive currents running throughout it.So, some semblance of this fairness doctrine that tries in its way, to not have, essentially, one voice speaking, only one thing to one constituency and another that continues to polarize everything, so I think, that may be a solution. It's complicated.And by the way, everybody in broadcasting will hate it. Listen, if we can do anything through legislative process, we really ought to have nonpartisan people get in a room and say, we've got to figure out ways not to control this or crimp it, but realizing its power and realizing what these very near-term effects have been for the last couple of years, particularly.And right, today, with what has happened in the last couple weeks, something has got to be done.BARTIROMO: And now, these companies are saying, OK, government is coming, the big hand of government may start regulating us, let's try to start policing this ourselves. Has Facebook done a good job of trying to put things in place?DILLER: I read this piece, this morning, in the New York Times, saying, is Mark Zuckerberg too big to fail? The idea of being that -- just like these big banks, you know, they were too big to fail, they would have terrible consequences. That he is now a figure because he controls the company. That he also, is too big to fail. You can't let him fail and nobody can replace him.However, replacing him, people say, would be a good idea. Here's the thing, this is a holy -- this is a -- this is an extraordinary talent who created a company and has been learning since childhood, 20 years old or whatever, to be a good executive on the job.He has done really well, so well, that his company got huge and got, essentially, in front of his ability to control it tame it. And they have done a tremendous job trying, extraordinarily difficult ability to actually do so.But they've been trying and trying with some success and some failure, to actually control this or let's say, adjudicate what is the right kind of information for them to put over their platform. And yes, I would say within the construct of how difficult it is, they put huge amounts of resources against it, they've announced to the markets that they're going to have a slower growth because of it.That they're going to have less net income, because they're going to have to spend so much, all of which, they're doing. And who else should do that? Now, I think, that through a level playing field, government regulation is going to have to help him.BARTIROMO: I want you to assess where we are, right now, in terms of where the growth is, internet-related businesses. Where do you see the growth in the coming 5 to 10 years?DILLER: Well, I mean, the growth is just part of the revolution. You know, people kind of forget that the internet revolution is still in, like, in year terms, really young, it's 22 or 23 years, and it took 10 years to 15 years just to get up enough bandwidth, to actually have rich media, being served through it.So, we're really at the very, very earliest stage of this. Now, there are companies that have, kind of, Expedia, for instance, one of the first companies that kind of colonized travel for the internet, 20 years ago.But, that's a world where the colonization of all these businesses is just now coming on, so to speak, full line, where you can do almost everything and almost everything more, through digital platforms, so the growth is everywhere.BARTIROMO: So, it's really digital platforms, enabling you to do whatever you want, so with Match, you're talking about dating, and with Expedia, travel. Are there areas that have not been capitalized on, in terms of that digital platform?DILLER: Well, I'll give you one, which is when we're engaged in, but there are lots of others. I mean, financial -- FinTech, Financial Technology, is just now, really getting into very much mainstream, and big companies are being built in it.For us, home services, being able, in your home, to do the same thing essentially, you do, when you want a car, which is, you know, you want to be taken someplace rather than drive yourself. Where, you have an app, and with Uber, you simply say, I want it now, and you see the car coming, you can see where it is, and all that.With home services, which has been the most difficult, one of the most difficult areas to tame, because it's the most essentially vocal of everything, which is, your water heater breaks, your -- whatever, air- conditioning doesn't work. You have -- just take it on the emergency side or the quick service side.You want help, right? Now, there is an app, in ANGI Homeservices, and HomeAdvisor. There is an app where, literally, you do the same thing. You say, I need a plumber, and it will show you plumbers hovering around, Uber- ish like, service providers.And you'd be able to do the full circle of that transaction on your little mobile device, because it's there, and it's ready for you. Well, that is just now at its very earliest stages. And so, it's just one example where growth is -- you know, runway is infinite.BARTIROMO: So, is there an opportunity to create another ANGI, to go aside from that or you just use ANGI to, as the vehicle, to capitalize on that?DILLER: Well, no. You have to think again, it's a platform. And the platform essentially takes consumers over here, who have needs, and service providers over here, who provide services. And through technology, it makes a perfect match or good match.So that's what all of those things are. They're platforms. So, once, by the way, you have a platform, then, when you say, will others be created? I mean, certainly, there'll be other platforms created, but there won't be that many because the network effects have to come into play.BARTIROMO: Let me ask you about Match, since you're talking about a perfect match, when that first came on the scene, and when you -- we were first talking about meeting somebody online, it was so foreign to so many people, but it seems to have really resonated it, to the extent that people are meeting and getting married, I mean, increasingly. Where is that business right now?DILLER: When you say increasingly, you know, we've been involved in this for almost 20 years, I think. I mean, we bought Match, quite early, in the -- in the cycle. We found that, you know what? That's a very good idea.We found this little company in Texas called Match.com, which we bought, and the thing is, when you say it's just now becoming where people get married, we've watched, 10 years ago, we had literally -- I think -- I don't know what the count was, it was definitely above 1 million marriages come, out of Match.com.And then, the technology moves forward and forward, and you have Tinder, which is actually younger, in terms of the people. People on Match were fairly serious. I mean, yes, they wanted to date and see what would happen on our little one-time date. But they also really wanted relationships.Tinder, kind of, got younger in earlier stage of, let's say, pre- relationships to say one-time dating or one-time whatever. But now, is moving into the same track that Match did, which is real relationships are coming out of Tinder.The thing is, it's an alternative to the historic going to bars, being fixed up, et cetera, et cetera. This actually does bring technology into the mix.BARTIROMO: That's incredible. Are you surprised on what has taken place in the last 25 years? I mean, when you --DILLER: Well, shocked more than -- I mean, not shocked. You can't. It's a stupid thing. When you are inside of a revolution, which I was just lucky enough, in timing, to get into at the early stage, you know, you don't -- you don't realize the effects of what is happening, so to speak, around you.But this is a truly radical revolution. And right now, it's a very troubled revolution, which happens at -- let's call it really early stages.(END VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: He's going to talk more about where the trouble is, right now, more of my exclusive interview with Barry Diller, next hour. You know, I've covered Barry Diller now for 25 years, and I've watched him amass this incredible portfolio of internet companies.And he really has highlighted or targeted or put his finger on some of the real growth stories of the internet, whether it's dating or ANGI and home, you know, HomeServices or Tinder, and so many others. But, interesting, James, that he mentions regulation, is going to be, sort of, the next leg of what's to come.FREEMAN: Yes. I hope it doesn't go there. The history is that it ends up favoring big incumbents and preventing new competitors. And I think we'd like more competition to some of these drives.I also think he's talking about the fairness doctrine. That is going to be very tough to square with the first amendment, so not sure where that's going. But, as far as his investments, glad I don't have to date anymore, but, it's nice that he's offering people some good technology to do this.BARTIROMO: Yes, for sure. And meanwhile, then, there's Google, thousands of Google employees, around the world, walking off the job, protesting the company's response to sexual misconduct allegations.Lauren Simonetti is here with more details there, and I've been astounded by the story, Lauren, with the maker -- the creator of the Android, getting $90 million after some really rough behavior there.LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Explosive allegations that were found to be credible. Andy Rubin is that man, he denies those allegations. Anyway, the message that we heard from Google workers yesterday, that time is up for tech.Google staff, thousand strong and more than they expected, are staging a powerful global walkout, you are looking at some of the most amazing pictures that we saw from yesterday. They're protesting how the company handles sexual harassment.The catalyst was this bombshell New York Times report, that Google paid Andy Rubin, $90 million in severance, even though, Google actually concluded the allegations against him were credible. It seems that the sexual misconduct is more widespread at the company than we might have thought.Google says it fired 48 executives over similar allegations and it did not give those executives exit packages. But the power of yesterday's protest underlines two things for me. The first one is the influence of this activist workforce, and how they influence their company to act in certain ways.We saw it with their response to Google, looking out ways to get into the Chinese market. And we saw with their criticism of Google, doing work with the Pentagon, and also a sense of hypocrisy. You know, they have this motto, this code of conduct at Google, do the right thing, and employers are calling foul on that.They're protesting an end to forced arbitration, so victims of sexual harassment would be able to sue and they're also looking for gender pay equality, among other things.So, they had a message, they had a mission. The Google's CEO, Sundar Pichai, he was at the New York Times DealBook Conference yesterday, and he said this "Moments like this, show that we didn't always get it right, and so we are committed to doing better." And he did silently or gave a muted endorsement of the protest yesterday.KELLY: I talked to a couple of people in Silicon Valley, and one of the -- one of the biggest points that was made is that, there were a lot of confidentiality agreements that were going around too, that were very Weinstein-esque.And so, that's what -- that lit a lot of fire for some of the people that walked out, because I was talking to people yesterday, what do you make of this? Why is it so strong? And they said, listen, there's a double standard, executives weren't held accountable. There were confidentiality agreements and that just not in the best interests, so employees were treated different than the (INAUDIBLE)MCDOWELL: It is like the Weinstein situation, in the sense that there is a double standard, politically, as well. Organizations are -- who were considered conservative, are targeted by the loudest voices in the country.But I think that the Valley and these tech companies got a little bit of a past because they are Bastian of liberalism, quite frankly. And now, the women who work there are coming out and saying hey, Human Resources was not handling these sexual harassment complaints in the way that they should have.And I think it remained hidden and they weren't -- they weren't targeted verbally and loudly, across the country because, again, that's where the Dems live.KELLY: Well, they made Rubin resign, right? And the situation was that they gave such high praise. So, here he was --BARTIROMO: And $90 million, $90 million, as a hero's exit.MCDOWELL: And there was another executive who quit this week, by the way.SIMONETTI: And also a lot of severance package too, so very not transparent in how they dealt with these sexual misconduct allegations. Time's up for tech.BARTIROMO: Yes. All right, we'll talk more about that, coming up. Thank you so much, Lauren. Coming up, it is job's day, we are expecting 190,000 jobs added to the economy, in the month of October, we're talking about what that means for the midterm elections now four days away, special coverage, coming up.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well, earnings are the story, certainly, Alibaba set to report momentarily. As soon as those numbers hit, we will get you them. The stock is up ahead of the numbers. What are you watching from Alibaba, this morning, Kevin Kelly? It's up 3-1/2 percent.KELLY: Yes. What's pretty interesting is that actually Cloud should be their biggest driver of growth. They actually have a data center in Silicon Valley. They have -- they have one in Europe that they've opened up. They're expanding that business to take on Amazon, to take on Microsoft, especially in China. Microsoft has been expanding their Cloud business there.One of the interesting things is we need to see what Jack Ma says about the trade war. He said the trade war could last for over 20 years. I don't know if you remember that, but that made a lot of headlines, when he was talking about that.So, we're going to see some guidance because they're also investing in the retail, pretty significantly, and expanding. So expect the top line revenues to do very well. But actually, the bottom line to be very, very thin.And one of the things that may have impacted them, is that the U.S. government actually ended the sweetheart deal on parcel services coming over here in the United States, I heard there was a lot of subsidies, so that ended recently, so we'll have to see guidance, how that's impacting some of their sellers on their site, Tmall.BARTIROMO: Was there still questions about how the company reports certain revenue lines? There were a lot of questions about the structure of the revenue, reporting it, at this company, for a long time.KELLY: Yes. And that's still taking hold, especially because they're always moving things around if you think about their financial services, Alipay, was actually taken out of the company right before their IPO. And now, Alipay is actually being influenced to break up their largest money market mutual fund over in China, so there's not really any transparency or accountability because it can move assets --BARTIROMO: That's why some people won't invest in Alibaba for that one reason.KELLY: Yes, unequivocally, absolutely. But, Singles' Day, they've sort of revolutionized how people transact. They have, on November 11th, 1111, they have Singles' Day. And then, you saw Amazon follow them into that, with Prime Day.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's right, Singles' Day.FREEMAN: I don't know if we will get any more visibility, but this question, why he's leaving? He's a relatively young man, I don't know if it says something about his thoughts on China, going forward, but doesn't seem like a bullish sign.BARTIROMO: Good point.KELLY: Yes, he's getting older and he's tired.FREEMAN: He's not that old.BARTIROMO: He's a young guy, but --KELLY: I mean, that's what he said. That's what he said. That's what he said.BARTIROMO: By the way, Apple, one of the issues with Apple is because of transparency, as well. They're not going to be reporting their unit sales and that's why the stock is down, this morning. We'll take a short break.When we come back, stop the suds, WeWork is putting limits on how much free beer their employees are entitled to. Yes, how much free beer are you entitled to drink during the day? Next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA, right here, stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Load-Date: November 2, 2018End of Document

Continue reading The UK s inquiry into fake news is focused on a long-dead bikini-finding appOn Saturday, the Observer published an article describing a rather incredible caper that took place in the United Kingdom. As part of an ongoing inquiry into fake news, Parliament seized a cache of documents obtained during legal discovery in a case mounted by an app developer against Facebook in an unrelated matter in the United States.Carole Cadwalladr, who rose to prominence this year as one of the journalists who broke the Cambridge Analytica story, has the tale:Damian Collins, the chair of the culture, media and sport select committee, invoked a rare parliamentary mechanism to compel the founder of a US software company, Six4Three, to hand over the documents during a business trip to London. In another exceptional move, parliament sent a serjeant at arms to his hotel with a final warning and a two-hour deadline to comply with its order. When the software firm founder failed to do so, it s understood he was escorted to parliament. He was told he risked fines and even imprisonment if he didn t hand over the documents. We are in uncharted territory,  said Collins, who also chairs an inquiry into fake news.  This is an unprecedented move but it s an unprecedented situation. We ve failed to get answers from Facebook and we believe the documents contain information of very high public interest. What, exactly, might be of interest here? In the Wall Street Journal, Deepa Seetharaman catches us up on Six4Three and why it s suing Facebook:The Six4Three lawsuit stemmed from Facebook s decision in 2014 to stop giving outside developers broad access to information about users  friends. The move was a harsh blow to developers, forcing a number of apps to shut down, while Facebook argued it helped bolster user privacy.Six4Three was the developer of an app called Pikinis, which allowed its users to find photos of Facebook users in bathing suits. It ceased operation in 2015 because of Facebook s decision to curtail access to its users  data, according to the lawsuit.The 2014 changes were, of course, the ones designed to tamp down on the kind of invasive third-party data harvesting that would eventually come back to bite Facebook this year with the Cambridge Analytica scandal.What makes the seizure of documents strange is that so little of the Cambridge Analytica story is, at this late date, in dispute. We know what data was made available to third-party developers before 2014. We know Facebook gradually became uncomfortable with how these developers were exploiting its users. We know they deliberated about it internally and eventually shut off the spigot.Seetharaman suggests that it is these deliberations that are of interest to Collins. And perhaps some spicy emails will see the light of day. But it s hard to square the facts of the case with the way the document cache is presented in the Observer, which is as a development somewhere on the level of the Pentagon Papers.And in any case, it remains unclear what 2014 data privacy discussions have to do with Collins  inquiry, which is supposed to be investigating the impact of fake news. The inquiry, which began in 2017, produced an interim report in July. Perhaps the document cache will link data privacy and fake news. Or perhaps a politician is simply casting about looking for new cudgels with which to beat Facebook in front of television cameras.Collins  committee will hold a public hearing on Tuesday, and may discuss the cache of documents then. (Mark Zuckerberg was invited to go, and declined.) But as we waited for those internal communications to become public, a new court filing introduced a rather amazing twist.Collins only got the documents because he was able to ascertain the hotel in which Ted Kramer, Six4Three s managing director, was staying during a business trip to London. And who told him that? Ryan Mac has the story in BuzzFeed:Although Kramer concedes he does not know how the DCMS committee knew where he was staying in London, he suggests in a 19-page court filing made on Monday that Carole Cadwalladr, a freelance reporter at British outlet the Observer, had tipped off the committee to his hotel address so that it could obtain the documents. Kramer and his lawyers did not immediately respond to his request for comment. Cadwalladr also did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Damian Collins declined to comment. [...]The filing alleges that on November 17, 2018, during a phone conversation with Cadwalladr, Kramer told the reporter he would be on an unrelated business trip to London. According to the document,  she suggested they meet for her to receive another update on the case. Mr. Kramer agreed to meet with her at his hotel and sent her a calendar invitation with the address of the hotel. Standards for journalistic ethics vary widely from country to country. In the United States, it would typically be frowned upon for a reporter to tip off a government body that a foreign national and source was coming to town and might be in possession of documents useful in an ongoing inquiry. At the very least, such an arrangement would require a prominent disclosure from the journalist were she ever to write about the seizure of those documents.In any case, it certainly seemed possible on Monday that the contents of the document cache would amount to less than the Observer suggested   and that the story of how Collins obtained it might amount to much more.DemocracyFacebook s Sheryl Sandberg Is Tainted by Crisis After CrisisSarah Frier digs into the various ways Sandberg s standing has been hurt by two years of perma-crisis. This story inadvertently triggered a daylong debate on Twitter after Frier, citing Facebook, reported that the company s vaunted election war room had been shut down and replaced with a Friday-morning meeting. After I tweeted about it, Facebook s Guy Rosen tweeted back that the war room not only wasn t shutting down, but that it would expand. Then TechCrunch wrote about that.Anyway, my unpopular opinion is that the war room was probably useful and not (just!) a PR stunt, and I m glad that the idea of a focused cross-functional teams sharing physical office space will endure into the future. My popular opinion is that Frier s story good and that you should read it.Information Attacks against DemocraciesBruce Schneier has a new paper out that is highly relevant to our interests here. Here s a good, concise summary:Democracies, in contrast, are vulnerable to information attacks that turn common political knowledge into contested political knowledge. If people disagree on the results of an election, or whether a census process is accurate, then democracy suffers. Similarly, if people lose any sense of what the other perspectives in society are, who is real and who is not real, then the debate and argument that democracy thrives on will be degraded. This is what seems to be Russia s aims in their information campaigns against the US: to weaken our collective trust in the institutions and systems that hold our country together. This is also the situation that writers like Adrien Chen and Peter Pomerantsevdescribe in today s Russia, where no one knows which parties or voices are genuine, and which are puppets of the regime, creating general paranoia and despair. [...]In other words, the same fake news techniques that benefit autocracies by making everyone unsure about political alternatives undermine democracies by making people question the common political systems that bind their society.Memo from a  Facebook nation  to Mark Zuckerberg: You moved fast and broke our country.Kara Swisher interviews Maria Ressa, co-founder of the news site Rappler in the Philippines, who is facing 10 years in prison for honestly reporting on its authoritarian leader. She blames his rise, in part, on Facebook:RESSA: President Duterte, in his second state of the nation address, in July of 2017, singles us out, he doesn t, he attacks the top television network but he singles us out and says,  This Rappler is foreign-owned or 100 percent owned by foreigners.  I couldn t help myself, because we were live. I automatically tweeted about it,  Mr. President, you re wrong.  I want my independence. This is part of the reason we set up Rappler. Then within a week the first investigations began. Then the cases came in.Russia accuses Google of failing to remove links to banned sitesRussian state officials formally accused Google of breaking the law by not removing links to websites that are banned in the country, Colin Lecher reports:The potential penalty that Google could face is minuscule for a company of its size: officials said in the statement that the search giant could only face fines of up to 700,000 roubles, or about $10,000. But Reuters reports that the Russian government has been considering more drastic actions, including fining companies up to 1 percent of annual revenue for failing to comply with similar laws. Russia has passed a series of laws in recent years that give the government more power to censor the web, and has clashed with major websites like Wikipedia over the rules.Google tightens political ad policies ahead of 2019 EU electionsGoogle has announced it will publicize the identity of organizations paying for political ads during the 2019 EU Parliamentary Elections, Jon Porter reports, in a move that could address Facebook s dark money problem.Any ad that mentions a political party, candidate, or office holder will have to tell users who paid for it, with Google also introducing a new process to verify these identities.Google flouting EU competition ruling, say rival price comparison sitesAn EU ruling says Google has to give  equal treatment  to rival shopping sites. They ve written a letter saying the company is not meeting that condition.YouTube Lets California Fire Conspiracy Theories Run WildYouTube has gotten better about removing conspiracy theories from top search results, but Caroline Haskins finds a miss on the California wildfires:Currently, when a user starts typing  California fire  into YouTube, the top autocomplete search suggestions are  conspiracy 2018,   agenda 21,  and  laser beam,  all of which refer to conspiracy theories related to California s wildfires. Similarly, typing in  California wildfire  leads YouTube to suggest  lasers,   directed energy weapon,  and  dew,  which is an acronym for  directed energy weapon.  Simply typing  California fire  and searching it does return straightforward news coverage, which is an improvement over, say, the false flag and crisis actor conspiracies YouTube was surfacing about the Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School mass shooting earlier this year.Beijing to Judge Every Resident Based on Behavior by End of 2020Beijing will adopt  a lifelong points program  by 2021, assigning individual ratings to each resident, Bloomberg reports in a chilling story:The capital city will pool data from several departments to reward and punish some 22 million citizens based on their actions and reputations by the end of 2020, according to a plan posted on the Beijing municipal government s website on Monday. Those with better so-called social credit will get  green channel  benefits while those who violate laws will find life more difficult.The Beijing project will improve blacklist systems so that those deemed untrustworthy will be  unable to move even a single step,  according to the government s plan. Xinhua reported on the proposal Tuesday, while the report posted on the municipal government s website is dated July 18.America s Elite Universities Are Censoring Themselves on ChinaAmerican universities have many Chinese students and increasingly get a lot of funding from China, and increasingly they are biting their tongues for fear of aggravating the Communist Party, Isaac Stone Fish reports:More often, the self-censorship is nuanced and difficult to detect.  You re not going to get a lot of China specialists openly confessing that self-censorship is a big problem,  said Minxin Pei, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College in California who is known for his critical stance toward the Chinese Communist Party. And yet Pei believes that those who communicate to non-academic audiences, particularly in the media, thus increasing the likelihood that the Chinese government will see their work, and those who work on sensitive issues like Tibet, must watch what they say.  You don t want to go out on a limb,  he said.  You want to come across as very measured.  Sounding  too strident,  he said, not only risks  the ire of the Chinese government but could also lose the respect of your peers, who value evidence above opinion.  Robert Barnett, who ran Columbia University s Modern Tibetan Studies Program from its founding in 1999 until stepping down in 2017, emphasized that Columbia never actively restricted his work, but that there was often  a very strong tendency within the university, and with many prestigious institutions in the U.S., not to include people who study the kind of subject I work on in any kind of academic collaborations in China or in dialogues with Chinese delegates. ElsewhereNo Refuge for Investors as 2018 Rout Sends Stocks, Bonds, Oil LowerTech stocks keep dropping. Akane Otani and Michael Wursthorn report:Twenty-six funds dumped their entire stakes in Facebook Inc. in the third quarter, according to a Goldman Sachs Group analysis of 13-F filings, including billionaire Daniel Loeb s Third Point LLC, which offloaded 4 million shares, citing  a very disappointing quarter  for Facebook.It s Easy To Blame Online Rhetoric For Violence. The Reality Is Much Harder.Joe Bernstein explores the cases of two far-right keyboard warriors in an effort to learn how much the online culture war can be blamed for real-world violence:The truth is, as researchers of violent extremism like James and Horgan will tell you, the vast majority of people who use Gab and Stormfront will never commit a violent crime. That s not to absolve online communities of the beliefs of their members. It s not to say digital spaces can t play a major role in ushering people toward violence. As the lasting influence of Anwar al-Awlaki and Dylann Roof show, they can. It s not even to say such spaces have a right to exist on private hosting services. They don t   at least not as far as the First Amendment is concerned. But there isn t an easy answer when it comes to finding the small number of people who will commit extremist violence.Internal Facebook memo sees outgoing VP of comms Schrage take blame for hiring DefinersThe newsletter was off when this story broke, and it seems like too much time has passed to really weigh in on it here now. The key thing is that Facebook admitted to sending Definers after George Soros. Six days later, that s all that really matters.Instagram s new profile designs emphasize users instead of their follower countLike Twitter before it, Instagram is shrinking follower counts on the profile.Who could buy Discord? Acquirers have been giving the gaming startup a long look.Teddy Schleifer looks at who might buy the platform popular among video game players and horrible racists. Some relevant chatter about Facebook:Facebook might make the most sense and the least sense of everyone on this list. The most sense because Facebook is the big tech company for communication and messaging, which is what Discord does. Plus Facebook has a strong interest in gamingand the reputation for going out and spending big on companies that can help expand its social networking moat.The biggest knock on the Facebook idea is that it feels unlikely that the government will let the social giant buy up another communications service.

Abhijit Bose, co-founder and CEO of Indian digital payments firm Ezetap, will become head of WhatsApp India in early 2019.

In a country where culinary traditions are often spoken but not written, WhatsApp has provided an open, democratic forum where Indians can share and codify their knowledge and skills, in new ways, and even profit from them. One of the problems with documenting Indian food is that the people who prepare it    mainly homemakers, farmers and young cooks    tend to be less empowered and less formally educated,  said Vikram Doctor, 51, a journalist in Mumbai.  They just don t document. They are not comfortable using a computer or blogging, or people just don t ask them. Here s How A Secret Meeting Of Twitter Execs And Indian Activists Caused A Caste ScandalTwitter CEO Jack Dorsey went to India and posed for a picture holding a poster reading  Smash Brahmanical Patriarchy,  a reference to harassment and abuse that takes place on Twitter and elsewhere as a result of India s historical caste system. This caused a furious uproar among right-wing Hindus.

He seemed mostly dismissive of the idea, which is surprising to me given how many of his streamers are broadcasting for eight or more hours a day:SHEAR: Twitch people don t open our app that many times a day. They just open it for a long time when they do. And I actually think that s a much healthier way of interacting with your technology, and with entertainment. You know? I go to a movie, I ll spend two hours watching a movie. That doesn t mean that I m addicted to the movie. It just means that it s a good piece of entertainment I decided to go sit down and watch. And I don t necessarily think that s such a big deal.That said, we definitely are paying attention to this, and I think that it s really important for every tech business to be self-reflective about, you know,  Is this addictive? Are people actually getting value out of their usage?  And making sure people feel like ... You know, you give them the tools to have control over that.LaunchesNothing launched Monday, as everyone was very tired from Thanksgiving.TakesLean OutKara Swisher says Sheryl Sandberg is getting too much blame over the Definers scandal and that the real blame belongs with Mark Zuckerberg.To be clear, as the No. 2 in charge, Ms. Sandberg deserves much blame for the bad decisions at Facebook. But it s notable that she is under much more fire than Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive. While he underwent some scrutiny at Congressional hearings and in interviews, he has somehow managed to come off like a geek who has lost his way in the woods. Whatever blame he got has dissipated quickly.Sheryl Sandberg Can t Have It AllJennifer Senior says Sheryl Sandberg uniquely does deserve blame over the Definers scandal:What makes Sandberg s current behavior so unsavory is that she put corporate interests   and her own image   ahead of the needs of democracy. She would sooner downplay Facebook s involvement in a national security crisis than compromise the integrity of her reputation. And in so doing, Sandberg, one of the country s most influential and renowned feminists, may have contributed to the historic loss of the first viable female candidate for president of the United States.Do You Have a Moral Duty to Leave Facebook?Philosopher S.

CHINA STEPS UP ONLINE 'CLEAN-UP,' MONITORING OF ORDINARY CITIZENSStates News ServiceNovember 16, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 969 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Beijing's powerful Cyberspace Administration on Friday announced a nationwide "clean-up" operation targeting social media accounts, official media reported.The move follows a crackdown on social media information providers last month, which saw sanctions handed out to 9,800 subscription-based information accounts on WeChat, Weibo or news portals such as Toutiao.The CAC has summoned 10 social media platforms, including those run by Baidu, Tencent and Sina, requiring them to shut down accounts that spread pornography, "lewd content" or rumors, or those posting illegal advertisements, state news agency Xinhua reported.The social media platforms were warned never to allow previously sanctioned account operators to open new accounts, or to continue spreading "illegal information," it said."The administration will coordinate with other departments for closer supervision over social media platforms and harshly punish those severely violating the regulations," the report quoted an administration official as saying.Beijing-based artist Ji Feng said the authorities are mostly on the lookout for comments critical of the ruling Chinese Communist Party."They got them all together and blamed them for turning a blind eye to online content that was inaccurate, anti-Communist Party or critical of the government," Ji said. He said the move was part of a wider pattern aiming at total control of people, using a nationwide network of monitoring and surveillance.The agency has also issued a directive requiring all internet service providers "possessing public commenting or mobilization capabilities" to submit a security assessment, including user data, to the authorities starting Nov. 30.'The Chaoyang Masses'Meanwhile, police in Beijing have set up a social media account to take clues and tipoffs from the general public using a phrase referencing ordinary citizen informers that has acquired meme-like status on the country's closely monitored internet."The Chaoyang Masses are filled with a a sense of justice and responsibility, and their main concern is gathering clues about those who break the law," according to the app's launch statement posted to the social media platform WeChat this week."They dare to fight against anyone or anything that violates public or private personal rights or property, and they have to be good at it," the account description reads."You can notify the police of clues via the Chaoyang Masses app or by tagging the Chaoyang Masses WeChat account," it said. "We look forward to your participation in the building of a safe and secure society."Ji Feng said the Chaoyang Masses are seen as local neighborhood informers in a nationwide network reporting to the authorities."The Chaoyang Masses has been around for a while, but now they have raised its profile by giving it a WeChat account," Ji said."They want to use it to stamp out social tensions of any kind, and turn it into a a special force that can be brought into the nationwide monitoring network."The "Chaoyang Masses" meme appeared in the state-run online newspaper The Paper in March 2015, which ran a humorous column about citizen volunteers, some of whom were elderly women practicing tai chi in public spaces, contributing to a celebrity drugs bust.The meme also drew on the mass-recruitment of citizen security patrols in the Chinese government's "war on terror" in the wake of a string of violent attacks in Kunming, Guangzhou, Urumqi, and on Beijing's Tiananmen Square.By the end of 2017, the ranks of such volunteers had swelled to some 140,000 mostly retired senior citizens with a brief to report anything "suspicious" in their neighborhoods.They have been credited by state media with providing thousands of valuable tip-offs in crimes ranging from bicycle theft to drug use.'Everyone will be recruited'Wang Longmeng, a political commentator currently living in France, said the government is now approaching an era of total surveillance of the population."[The Chaoyang Masses] are the most fundamental and direct form of the grassroots control of the population, through grassroots structures," Wang said. "This kind of management is KGB-style.""The Chaoyang Masses phenomenon is an advanced melange of cutting-edge technology and evil intent," he said."Once these networks are in place, then we'll have a situation that is far worse than that depicted in The Lives of Others," Wang said, referencing a 2006 movie about Stasi secret police eavesdropping on citizens' lives in Soviet-controlled East Germany."In the future, everyone will be recruited to control and monitor everyone else," he said.Chinese citizens are already monitored by more than 20 million surveillance cameras as they go about their daily business in public places, according to a recent documentary by state broadcaster CCTV.Now, artificial intelligence can identify and "tag" individual cars, cyclists, and pedestrians with distinguishing information that can be stored and searched for descriptions of wanted individuals.The smart video tool correctly identifies the gender, age, and clothing descriptions of passersby, as well as distinguishing between motorized and non-motorized vehicles, recent media reports say.The technology comes amid a growing trend towards using facial recognition as a secure form of ID, including to identify rail and airline passengers, physical and e-commerce customers, and missing persons cases.Facial recognition technology is also being used in city subway systems, and in ride-sharing and robotic package delivery apps, airport and college dorm security, and social credit schemes, as well as to guard against jaywalkers.Reported by Ng Yik-tung and Lee Wang-yam for RFA's Cantonese Service.

University of New South Wales and Top China Scientific Body Join Forces With Leading Academic PublisherTargeted News ServiceNovember 19, 2018 Monday 7:30 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 608 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: SYDNEY, Australia BodyThe University of New South Wales issued the following news release:* * *Publishing house Springer Nature is joining with UNSW Sydney and the Chinese Academy of Sciences to promote research to the world.UNSW Sydney and the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute for Science and Development (CASISD) have announced a partnership with the world's leading academic publishing house, Springer Nature, to increase global promotion of Australian and Chinese research.The multilateral collaboration cements the existing research relationship UNSW has had with the Academy since 2009. The Academy has become one of UNSW's largest global research collaborators. The Institute, which falls under the Academy, was established in 2016 and is an influential think-tank that provides advice to major Chinese Central Government policy agencies, including the State Council and the Ministry of Science Technology.Adding Springer Nature to the collaboration will increase its reach beyond China and Australia to influence international research leaders. With China now ranking second in high-quality research output, this new partnership reflects China's growing role as a major player in global knowledge production, and Australia's role as a catalyst for international exchange of ideas and research."The partnership is the largest between an Australian university and the Academy," said UNSW President and Vice-Chancellor Professor Ian Jacobs. "The addition of Springer Nature will significantly enhance the partnership with the opportunity to provide services to the research community to ensure research is accessible, available, understood and shared so that it may lead to new discoveries."The combination of the expertise and knowledge within the Academy, UNSW's world-leading research and strong links to China, and Springer Nature's credibility and channels, creates a unique opportunity to promote the capabilities of all three organisations, as well as outstanding research from Australia and China."This three-way partnership further strengthens Springer Nature's commitment to fully support world-class researchers in Australia and China," said Dr Paul Evans, Director, Nature Research Group, Greater China. "Publishing quality research is a key aspect of a researcher's career; Springer Nature provides innovative tools and services to help develop collaborations, build reputations and to make sure new ideas and knowledge are shared outside of a silo."The new collaboration was launched at the inaugural China-Australia Innovation Summit, held on Monday 19 November at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing.The Summit will alternate annually between China and Australia focusing on multi- and interdisciplinary challenges affecting the construction of research, science and economic policy, with the objective of making recommendations to senior levels of government on both sides.During the 2018 Summit, UNSW and Chinese academics delivered a five minute presentation on four themes selected as key challenges for China, Australia and globally: energy, global health, artificial intelligence, and next generation materials.Professor Pan Jiaofeng, President of CASISD, said the collaboration builds on a solid foundation for future Sino-Australian joint research activities."CASISD and UNSW will continue to conduct excellent research directly in China and Australia," said Professor Pan. "By pooling together an elite talent pool, CASISD and UNSW will build an advanced international strategy and policy research network to address major issues facing both China and Australia, and the world."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6522877 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: November 19, 2018End of Document

This also goes for all other prisoners of conscience detained by the authorities in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).Parliament expresses its grave concern at the report that Ahmed Mansoor has been subjected to forms of torture, and calls on UAE authorities to ensure that detainees deemed to have broken the law are given a fair trial according to international standards.The resolution also urges the UAE to review various domestic laws, including on counter-terrorism and cybercrimes, since they are repeatedly used to prosecute human rights defenders.Further, MEPs stress the need for an EU-wide ban on the export, sale and maintenance of any form of security equipment to the UAE, including internet surveillance technology, which could be used for internal repression.The resolutions on Belarus and China were approved by a show of hands. The resolution on United Arab Emirates was approved by 322 votes in favour, 220 against and 56 abstentions.Load-Date: October 4, 2018End of Document

China can already identify its citizens just by their way of walkingCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 8, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 491 wordsBody        The Chinese Big Brother continues advancing in his steps towards the control of the citizens. It has been the pioneer country in testing the rating system among its inhabitants, what they call the Social Credit System that, using big data will score the more than 1.300 million inhabitants of the Asian country to judge whether or not they are reliable citizens . China is the country of video cameras. Months after this initiative appeared in all the media, the next step is known: the country can already identify its citizens by their way of walking. A twist to the artificial intelligence that is used to monitor .  Chinese authorities have already started to develop and test this new surveillance tool: it is software that uses people's body shapes and their way of walking to identify them, even when their faces are not visible to cameras (China it is home to the largest CCTV camera network in the world, with more than 170 million).  This system is already used by police in the streets of Beijing and Shanghai, along with facial recognition, to identify people in crowds and catch criminals. In addition, it is developing an integrated national surveillance camera data system, according to the AP news agency.  The startup Watrix has been responsible for its development. Its CEO, Huang Yongzhen, explains that you can identify the walk of people who are at a distance of up to 50 meters, even with their backs or their faces covered. "This can fill the gap of facial recognition, which requires close-up, high-resolution images of a person's face to function." Yongzhen himself recognizes that "the cooperation of the people is not necessary so that they can recognize their identity". As is. In addition, the system can not be tricked limping, walking with legs extended or stooped, because it analyzes all the characteristics of the body. We can not cheat Big Brother.  Although the positive side is that it can be used to catch criminals, the Chinese government has been criticized for implementing these surveillance systems for more sinister purposes that include the control of its citizens (it also has defenders). In particular, the way he uses his databases and facial recognition technology to monitor ethnic minorities is suspect. "A system deployed in Xinjiang, a western province with a population of some 10 million Muslims, is designed to notify authorities when targeted individuals go beyond their home or workplace," according to Bloomberg.  Now it is more real than ever, but the applications of this technology are not new. Scientists from Japan, the United Kingdom and the Defense Information Systems Agency of the United States have been investigating the recognition of the march for more than a decade, trying to overcome the skepticism that people can be recognized by the way they walk.  The entry China can already identify its citizens only by their way of walking was first published in La Tercera. Load-Date: November 8, 2018End of Document

Jim Cramer: Here's Why the Market RalliedRealMoneyDecember 12, 2018 Wednesday 7:01 PM EDTCopyright 2018 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1249 wordsByline: Jim CramerHighlight: What else can you say about a decision by the Chinese that amounts to a potential repudiation of the Made in China 2025 plan?BodyIt's a start.What else can you say about a decision by the Chinese government that amounts to a potential repudiation of the Made in China 2025 plan, a plan that is tantamount to stealing our technology to make their technology superior to our own?It's why the market rallied and, to me, it makes perfect sense.Here's why.Throughout this tortured period of trade negotiations there have been two tracks, there's the track of those who want more trade with China on a fair basis, and those who don't care about trade if it is going to fund China's plans for worldwide hegemony as expressed by the Made in 2025 plan.That plan, which is literally a manifesto to rip off our companies that want to do business in China chiefly by creating absurd joint ventures that feast off of our own technological know-how, is antithetical to the way every other country does business. It's a big deal if they mean it.But therein lies the problem. We have no indication whatsoever that they mean anything. There has been a relentlessness to the Chinese to catch up and beat us in all things technological whether it be semiconductors or aerospace or robots and the like. The only way to prove they mean business is to renounce their joint venture policy and begin to let some outfits in to do business. In other words, show in deeds, not just in words, that an American Express  or a Mastercard  or a Visa  can work unfettered in the country just to give some examples of companies that thought they would be in China a long time ago.I don't want to be skeptical on such a good day for the bulls, but if the Chinese are so eager to make deals than I wonder why they are eager to sell our technology to the Iranians against our curbs or hack our companies to get information, like the hack that occurred against Marriott  , according to the New York Times, which splashed it all over the front page today. That's just plain old state sponsored terrorism, something that FireEye FEYE, a company that tries to combat these hacks, will talk about tonight on Mad Money.I want for a moment, though, to put this China news in perspective because it can really make a difference if you think about it.First, one of the biggest underlying weaknesses in this market is the plummet in Apple's  stock. Now we know this company has its share of challenges as we keep hearing about weaker sales globally. However, it is China that's causing the most worry. For example, we learned Monday that an obscure court in China ordered a host of Apple phones banned because of patent issues with Qualcomm  . The semiconductor company has filed suit all over the world against Apple in a long running dispute. The Communist Party controls all courts so this decision presumably has the blessing of the Chinese authorities; there is no freelancing in China. However, it is hard to imagine a situation where China's making nice to the U.S. and at the same time trashing its second largest company in retaliation to the arrest in Canada of the CFO of a $100 billion Chinese company.Second, we have so many industrial stocks that have been sold down endlessly on a belief that there's nothing China could do to mollify the hardliners in the White House. The 2025 plan is at the real crux of our grievances against the Chinese. These companies have been a horrendous drag on the averages, including tech companies that are or hope to do a lot more business in China. Maybe there's a whiff of hope here.Finally, there is a sense that the Chinese, so often portrayed in the media as being all powerful, may not be in as strong a position as the China hands think. Their economy is slowing. The trade issues are bigger than just the U.S. or a country like Canada wouldn't do our bidding in this Huawei case.Finally, there's something nobody's talking about that could be behind some of this softening. There is a mistaken belief in this country that the president is an implacable foe of China on every front, not just on trade, although he calls himself Tariff Man on Twitter. Untrue. He's more practical, more open-minded than others in this administration.Strange as this may sound I think the Chinese are making a calculated bet that they might be on the wrong side of U.S. history if they don't get their act together. That's because the real hardliner, the person who is toughest on all aspects of China, especially religious freedom and unchecked foreign expansion, is the vice president. That's right, Mike Pence is the real hawk who doesn't seem all that interested in trading with China because he wants to starve their attempts to dominant the globe militarily. Unlike President Trump's view, when you read speeches Pence gives you think about the old Soviet Union and the desire to have regime change. Compared with Vice President Pence this president is the proverbial bird in the hand.Now, let's talk bigger. Why did almost every stock fly up on this news today? Because the buyers want to own the S&P 500 with a belief that our entire market may be worth more without a trade war. This is a market where everything goes up on day one, today, and then tomorrow, it gets selective.What stays strong on day two? First, barring any contradictory riposte, like the indictment of top level Chinese officials by the U.S. Justice Department over hacking, it will be tech again. I think that the semiconductor capital equipment companies like Lam Research  and Applied Materials  and the fast growing semis, like Advanced Micro  , Broadcom  and Xilinx  could get a boost.I like the prospects of the companies that are frantically trying to move away from Chinese suppliers and are having quality issues doing so: think Restoration Hardware  . The dollar stores that want too much to have cheap merchandise and keep going back to China to get it: Dollar Tree  and Dollar General  . And the department stores that have a decent percentage of Chinese goods. Think Kohl's  . Throw in some off-price companies with Chinese sources, the usual suspects, Burlington  and TJX Cos.  and you have some winners. And of course, Visa, Mastercard and American Express.Now there were some other positive distractions today. The endless Brexit soap opera might be reaching a conclusion: I think by this time it might not even matter. We are hearing the Italians are, once again, trying to get some logical closure on their budget issues, although by this time it might not matter. Germany is making noises of fixing the Deutsche Bank  worries soon, although by this time it might not matter. Yep three really boring issues where there are clear, well known paths that can end somewhere, anywhere, but at least end as they hang over this market like a dark shroud.Oh and there's the Fed. It got a tame consumer price index number today to go with a tame producer price, in part because of a decline in oil that no longer seems to be ephemeral. Fed Chief Jerome Powell thinks he has to raise to slow down hiring -wages are the real inflationary flashpoint now that almost every other form of inflation is disappearing.What should he do?I think he should wait a month. But he's committed. So he does it. We slow the economy more than we should and then he'll be done. Not optimal but he has to live with his boomtown description of an economy going south and if we get high tariffs and no real agreement with China, will go south real fast.(Apple and Kohl's are holdings in Jim Cramer's  .

Huawei arrest: This is what the start of a tech Cold War looks likeCNN WireDecember 8, 2018 Saturday 4:10 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1054 wordsByline: By Julia Horowitz, CNN BusinessDateline: NEW YORK (CNN Business) BodyNEW YORK (CNN Business) --  The arrest of a top Huawei executive raises the stakes in the intensifying battle between the United States and China for tech supremacy.Huawei is one of the world's biggest makers of smartphones and networking equipment. It is at the heart of China's ambitions to reduce its reliance on foreign technology and become an innovation powerhouse in its own right. The country is pumping hundreds of billions into its "Made in China 2025" plan, which aims to make China a global leader in industries such as robotics, electric cars and computer chips. The introduction of 5G wireless technology, which hinges on Huawei, is a top priority.The United States, meanwhile, has made clear it intends to push back against China's growing tech power in order to maintain American dominance."In the 20th century, steel, coal, automobiles, aircraft and ships --- and the ability to produce things in mass quantity --- were the sources of national power," said James Andrew Lewis, director of the Technology Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, in a report this week. "The foundations of security and power are different today. The ability to create and use new technologies is the source of economic strength and military security."It's through that lens that some in the Chinese government view the arrest of Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, at the request of US authorities."The US is trying to do whatever it can to contain Huawei's expansion in the world simply because the company is the point man for China's competitive technology companies," said an editorial Thursday in state-run newspaper China Daily. Weng's case could rapidly escalate a broader fight that's been steadily building. Much depends on the language the United States uses moving forward --- and how China ultimately responds.Growing pressureChina's tech aspirations have garnered concern in the United States for years --- especially because Beijing's goals are seen as relying on the misappropriation of American technology.President Donald Trump has tried to tackle these issues directly. His administration says that the hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs it's slapped on Chinese goods are part of an effort to stop China from stealing US tech. Officials also say that China must stop forcing companies to hand over trade secrets as a condition of market access.Meanwhile, the United States has targeted Chinese tech companies that rely on US parts. The Commerce Department in April banned American companies from exporting essential components to ZTE, which the agency said had violated an earlier deal punishing the company for evading sanctions on Iran and North Korea. The high-profile move forced ZTE to halt almost all of its operations for months.In October, the department issued a similar export ban for state-owned Chinese chipmaker Fujian Jinhua. The US government said it posed "a significant risk of becoming involved in activities that are contrary to the national security interests of the United States."At the same time, Chinese President Xi Jinping has been pushing for China's tech sector to become more self-sufficient by cutting reliance on foreign suppliers.Turning the spotlight on Huawei, however, adds a new wrinkle. Huawei is a state champion that plays a crucial role in China's rollout of 5G. The company has spent heavily on research and development and on marketing its 5G devices. Paul Triolo, the head of global tech policy at risk consultancy Eurasia Group, said it's the only company in the world right now that can produce all the elements of a 5G network, such as base stations, data centers, antennas and handsets, and put them together "at scale and cost.""Xi Jinping says that he wants China to dominate the 5G market globally," Lewis told CNN Business. "A lot of people see it as the next wave of technology [and think] it will be like the internet or smartphones."The Huawei riskBut for Huawei to succeed at building out 5G networks, it needs the United States.Out of the Huawei's 92 main suppliers, 33 are US companies, including chipmakers Intel, Qualcomm, and Micron, and software firms Microsoft and Oracle, Tom Holland of Gavekal Research said in a note Friday."If Washington now prohibits these companies from selling to Huawei, the Chinese telecoms giant will struggle to survive," Holland said.The Meng case, then, has major ramifications. The US government claims that Meng covered up violations of sanctions on Iran, according to Canadian prosecutors, who spoke at Meng's bail hearing in Vancouver on Friday.Whether Huawei itself faces legal trouble remains to be seen, though there's speculation that the company could receive an export ban due to sanctions violations like the one imposed on ZTE. Such a ban, if enacted, would be catastrophic for the company --- and would derail Beijing's plans to deploy 5G on a large commercial scale by 2020."The arrest of Huawei's CFO in Canada will significantly raise the uncertainty of China's 5G timing, since any US export ban imposed on Huawei could either delay China's 5G rollout, or significantly reduce the scale near term," Jefferies analyst Edison Lee said in a note Friday. Such a ban would force Huawei's business to "come to a halt," he added.In this, the United States has the upper hand. "They're dependent, so that puts them in a weak position," Lewis said.Huawei has already run into problems in the deployment of its 5G technology amid concerns that its devices pose national security risks. New Zealand and Australia have barred Huawei equipment from its 5G mobile networks. UK telecoms group BT said earlier this week that it wouldn't buy Huawei equipment for the core of its 5G wireless network.But formally penalizing Huawei could have serious consequences for how the US-China tech fight plays out down the line."They'll accelerate their efforts to become independent, and they'll look for ways they can ding us," Lewis said, noting that China could reduce orders of Boeing airplanes, or target US companies for violations of Chinese law. "Their hope is that in 10 years, they won't need us anymore."CNN's Jethro Mullen and Sherisse Pham contributed to this report.TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

China OKs Qualcomm-NXP Merger, But Companies Have Moved OnBenzinga.comDecember 3, 2018 Monday 4:13 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Accretive Capital LLC d/b/a Benzinga All Rights ReservedLength: 370 wordsByline: Wayne DugganBodyQUALCOMM, Inc.(NASDAQ: QCOM)'s wild 2018 continued this weekend after trade negotiations between the U.S. and China potentially opened up the possibility that a previously scrapped buyout of NXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ: NXPI) may be back on the table.Qualcomm said the deal is dead, but China said it is no longer opposed to a union of the NXP and Qualcomm.After a deal for Qualcomm itself to be acquired by Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ: AVGO) was blocked by the U.S. earlier this year on national security grounds, China subsequently stepped in and opposed Qualcomm s $44-billion deal for NXP. Qualcomm eventually abandoned the NXP deal in July, paid a $2-billion termination fee to NXP and committed to an aggressive capital return program for shareholders.After meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit over the weekend, President Donald Trump said China is now open to approving a merger between NXP and Qualcomm if the deal is renegotiated.In a statement, Qualcomm said it has no intention of reviving the NXP deal. While we were grateful to learn of President Trump and President Xi s comments about Qualcomm s previously proposed acquisition of NXP, the deadline for that transaction has expired, which terminated the contemplated deal,  Qualcomm said in a statement.Stifel analyst Tore Svanberg said Sunday that the news may help boost investor sentiment related to NXP stock in the near-term. While near-term investor sentiment may be positively biased due to the recent supportive commentary from the Chinese government regarding a renewed QCOM/NXPI deal should one materialize, we believe key fundamental risks remain,  the analyst said. Stifel has a Sell rating and $78 price target for NXP stock.Related Links:G20 Developments Send Oil Prices Soaring'We Expect Another Rangebound Year': Morgan Stanley's 2019 Investing OutlookPhoto by Ryo Fukasawa/Wikimedia. Latest Ratings for NXPIDateFirmActionFromToNov 2018CitigroupMaintainsNeutralNeutralNov 2018BMO CapitalMaintainsMarket PerformMarket PerformOct 2018BarclaysUpgradesEqual-WeightOverweightView More Analyst Ratings for NXPI           View the Latest Analyst Ratings© 2018 Benzinga.com.

How China's video game crackdown caused a $200 billion stock wipeout for TencentCNN WireOctober 16, 2018 Tuesday 11:51 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 412 wordsByline: By Jordan Valinsky, CNN BusinessDateline: NEW YORK (CNN Business) BodyNEW YORK (CNN Business) --  China's crackdown on video games has hammered one of its most valuable companies. And it's unclear when the situation will improve.Shares of Tencent (TCEHY), a huge technology and entertainment conglomerate, are down about 40% from their peak in January. Its epic stock plunge has wiped out more than $230 billion in market value.The decline has been enough to push Tencent out of the world's 10 biggest companies. It's now No. 11, according to data from Refinitiv. As recently as March, it ranked fifth, eclipsing corporate giants like Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB), Facebook (FB) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).China is the world's biggest gaming market, and Tencent is the world's biggest gaming company. But investors are worried that Chinese authorities will extend into next year a freeze on approving licenses that allow companies to make money from new online games.Tencent shares in Hong Kong have fallen more than 2% so far this week. It has also suffered recently from the broader sell-off in global tech stocks.But the uncertainty over when the Chinese government will start approving new game licenses again remains a key problem for Tencent shares, analysts at investment bank Daiwa Capital Markets said in a research note Monday. They expect the company to report a 20% drop in revenue from its mobile gaming business for the third quarter of 2018.There are other concerns hanging over Tencent, which owns WeChat, China's most popular messaging platform.China's Education Ministry announced in August that it would "control" how many new games come online and look into setting up a system to remind users about which games are appropriate for users of different ages. It said the measures are part of an effort to reduce nearsightedness in children and adolescents.Tencent reported a rare decline in profit in August, blaming the drop mainly on regulators not approving licenses for new games. But if approvals resume soon, that could prompt a turnaround.The Daiwa analysts, who recommend buying the stock at its current levels, said they believe the company has strong long-term growth prospects. They highlighted the vast number of people who use Tencent's products (WeChat has more than 1 billion users) and the company's "superior" ability to make money out of them.Tencent did not respond to a request for comment.Sherisse Pham contributed to this report.TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

(SUB) was able to bypass China's great firewall--China's mechanism that prevents citizens from accessing websites like Google, YouTube, and Twitter. By using a SubstratumNode, a Chinese citizen was able to access websites that are otherwise blocked by the Chinese government; this is huge for citizens in internet-censored countries like China, Russia, and Iran that block many websites and web-based services.Substratum's CEO Justin Tabb said,"The fact that it was a member of our community, one of the Beta node hosts, that did the work to prove this out makes me especially proud, grateful and blessed to have such an amazing community supporting our efforts."The SubstratumNode is the first part ofSubstratum'sthree-part ecosystem that includes a crypto payment gateway "CryptoPay" and a newly formed decentralized fiat to altcoin exchange "Amplify Exchange."SubstratumNodes are part of a decentralized network. Each node in the network is able to receive requests from users via SubstratumNode. SubstratumNodes route those requests back to the original requester after encrypting the request and passing it along a network of nodes.When information is routed through a network of nodes instead of brokered to internet users from a centralized internet service provider or server, the oppressing body is not able to block website requests. Even if the oppressor can identify and block one of the SubstratumNodes routing requests, there will be a myriad of other nodes within the Substratum network that will remain active and working to route requests.Not only does this give internet users a way to circumvent internet censorships, but individuals who choose to run a SubstratumNode will be paid in cryptocurrency (SUB) for fulfilling the requests that pass through the SubstratumNode network.Soon, Substratum will be launching the third piece of their three-part ecosystem:Amplify Exchange, a distributed and decentralized exchange where SubstratumNode acts as the backbone.SubstratumNodes will process Amplify transactions and node operators will earn AMPX tokens alongside SUB tokens, which means there will be increased transaction volume on the Substratum network. In addition, SubstratumNode allows Amplify to utilize their groundbreaking BridgeChain, which will bridge the distributed and decentralized exchanges by mirroring their ledgers, giving users the benefits of both types of exchanges.The SubstratumNode is available for download on theSubstratum website, and look out for theAmplify ICO going live on November 16th!Media requests go tomedia@substratum.net View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/substratum-bypasses-chinas-great-firewall-300748551.htmlSOURCE SubstratumLoad-Date: November 13, 2018End of Document

"Today, Sunday, October 7, Interpol's general secretariat in Lyon received the resignation request from Meng Hongwei (pictured), as Interpol's chairman, with immediate effect," a statement released on Twitter said. hours after the woman's wife told the media in Lyon that her husband was "in danger" in China.  BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) - Beijing authorities confirmed Monday the arrest of Meng Hongwei for alleged "serious violation of state law," according to the South China Morning Post.  Meng was considered missing since September 25, when he traveled to China. After several days of silence, the National Anti-Corruption Commission (China's anti-corruption body) briefed the detention of Mr Meng, who held the post of former deputy minister for public security of the Chinese government before being appointed top of Interpol in November 2016, according to the Hong Kong newspaper.  In the official communiqué, the reasons for Meng's detention are not indicated, nor would some of the Communist Party's norms have been violated - the way the National Supervisory Commission indicates the alleged cases of corruption that undermine the investigation.  According to the paper, a meeting of senior Chinese Communist Party leaders was held on 30 September in which Public Security Minister Zhao Kezhi provided details of a conversation he had with Ding Xuexiang, chief of staff of Chinese President Xi Jinping, and where he expressed the urgency to strengthen vigilance against corruption.  Meanwhile, the Interpol president's wife said she believed her husband was "in danger" and asked the international community to intervene to clarify her whereabouts.  Grace Meng hosted a press conference at a hotel in Lyon, where the international police organization's headquarters are located, to explain that she received two disturbing sms messages from her husband on 25 September and has not had news of her.  In the first message, Meng asked to "wait for his call", and later another sms arrived with an emoticon that represented a dangerous situation, according to local newspaper Le Progrès.  The woman read a statement in Chinese and English where she also urged the international community to intervene to find out what happened to her husband.  Interpol's secretary general, German Jürgen Stock, had already asked China yesterday to clarify the whereabouts of Meng, who disappeared shortly after arriving in his country.  Stock was awaiting "an official response from the Chinese authorities" to clarify these concerns about Meng, who according to his country's press would be detained and under investigation, information that was eventually confirmed.  The Lyon prosecutor's office opened an investigation Friday into the disappearance of Meng, who according to several Hong Kong media was being investigated as a former head of the Chinese government and could have been the victim of an internal purge of the regime.  Despite being an essentially honorific position, Meng's designation was heavily criticized forhuman rights organizations. Load-Date: October 7, 2018End of Document

FIVE FACTS ON THE CFO OF HUAWEI'S ARRESTStates News ServiceDecember 13, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 742 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by No Labels:In early December Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer (CFO) of Chinese tech titan Huawei, was detained in Vancouver, Canada, after the request of U.S. authorities and collaboration with the Canadian government. Yesterday she was released on bail but could face extradition to the United States. Here are five facts on her arrest.According to Canadian prosecutors Meng's detainment surrounds allegations of the CFO violating sanctions on Iran.Meng is said to have aided Huawei in circumventing U.S. sanctions on Iran by misleading financial institutions. Meng allegedly told these companies that a Huawei subsidiary was a separate company, thus allowing for continued deals. Prosecutor John Gibb-Carsely asserted to the British Columbian Supreme Court that between 2009 and 2014 Huawei used a Hong Kong company, Skycom Tech, to make deals in Iran. Julian Ku, professor at Hofstra University explained to The New York Times: "US law prohibits exports of certain US-origin technologies to certain countries," he said. "When Huawei pays to license certain US tech, it promises not to export to certain countries like Iran. So it is not unreasonable for the US to punish Huawei for flouting this US law".China has responded swiftly to the arrest and detainment of Meng.Upon hearing of the incident in Vancouver, China summoned the Canadian ambassador to address Meng's detention, calling her arrest lawless, reasonless and ruthless. Today it was confirmed that China has in turn detained two Canadian figures: former diplomat Michael Kovrig and Canadian businessman Michael Spavor. According to the BBC today Chinese Foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said Spavor and Kovrig were suspected of engaging in activities that threatened China's national security.This isn't Huawei's first conflict with the U.S. the company has long faced scrutiny as an alleged potential national security threat.As the company has grown to become the second largest phone distributor in China, many of Huawei's previous efforts to break into the American market have been blocked over U.S. fears of cyber spying, given Huawei's close ties to the Chinese government. The company has been singled out among other Chinese companies, as U.S. agencies warned American consumers against purchasing Huawei products. In January ATandT decided against doing business with the electronic company amidst concerns from Washington, walking away from a deal to distribute Huawei smartphone Mate 10 in the U.S.Meng's arrest signals increasing tensions between U.S. and China, potentially threatening the two countries' 90-day trade truce.Meng's arrest adds another complication to the steep challenge that lies ahead of China-U.S. trade negotiations. University of California at Berkeley Political Science Professor T.J. Pempel commented, "The arrest of a family member linked to Huawei's founder indicates how the tension between the two sides is rapidly escalating," The New York Times reported. Negotiations during this 90-day trade truce originally are to include China seeking relief from U.S. tariffs, and in turn the U.S. seeking lower trade barriers to enter further into the Chinese market. Now, discussions may also include whether to bring Meng to trial. Scott Kennedy, expert on Chinese economics and trade, told CNN that for U.S. and China to save relations from deteriorating, "Both sides need to proceed with abundant caution and a clear sense of their long term interests.The markets continue to prove volatile as Meng's arrest further complicates U.S.-Chinese trade outlooks.After Meng's arrest earlier in December stocks took a steep slide around the world as investors see the increasingly risky trade relations and the potential threat U.S.-Chinese relations pose to world financial markets. Since the start of the trade war, investors have increased their concern about potential rising interest rates as one of many unforeseen consequences of trade tensions. U.S. tech companies specifically are beginning to take concern in the volatility of U.S.-Chinese trade relations, as U.S. tech and Chinese telecom companies have interconnected supply chain systems. Not all sectors may be affected though. Notably, China purchased 1.13 million metric tons of U.S. Soybeans this week, marking the ninth-largest daily sale of U.S. soybeans ever. This could be a sign of progress between the countries, despite continued tensions.Load-Date: December 14, 2018End of Document

Canada Arrests Huawei CFO; Extradition Hearing to US PlannedStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeDecember 6, 2018 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: MARKETS; Pg. 1Length: 576 wordsByline: Jean GarciaBodyAs reported by Bloomberg, tensions are back on the rise between the USA and China following the Canadian arrest of Huawei's global CFO, who is set to be extradited to the U.S. to face charges of violating Iran sanctions. At this time, the department spokesperson can't share more details because Meng requested a publication ban. "The Chinese side has lodged stern representations with the U.S. and Canadian side, and urged them to immediately correct the wrongdoing and restore the personal freedom of Ms. Meng Wanzhou".Meng was arrested while transferring between flights, according to a statement provided to CRN by Huawei.A Wall Street Journal report last month said the US government was trying to persuade wireless and internet providers in allied countries to avoid equipment from Huawei. It has overtaken Sweden's Ericsson and Finland's Nokia to be the world's largest telecoms equipment maker by revenue.London's main index fell by as much as 2.5 per cent this morning as blue-chip companies were burnt by fears that China and the United States trade war could intensify after a key Huawei executive was arrested overnight.The arrest is related to violations of United States sanctions, a person familiar with the matter said. "The Chinese government should seriously mull over the USA tendency to abuse legal procedures to suppress China's high-tech enterprises".Wanzhou is also the daughter of Huawei's founder, Ren Zhengfei, one of China's most prominent businessmen.A visitor uses his mobile phone at the Huawei stand on the second day of the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.Vigneault's speech comes shortly after three members Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance - New Zealand, Australia, U.S. - opted to ban carriers in their jurisdictions from purchasing telecommunications equipment from Huawei.The U.S.is anxious about the extent to which Chinese-made equipment is used in the telecommunications sectors of countries that host American military bases.Senate Resolution Would Fault Saudi Prince for Khashoggi DeathYemen, where a Saudi-led coalition is fighting Iran-backed Houthi rebels, has spiraled into the world's worst humanitarian crisis. Saudi authorities said the agents who killed Khashoggi exceeded their authority.ZTE is China's second-largest telecommunications equipment maker and relies on US components for its smart phones and networking equipment.Huawei itself has been increasingly on the rocks with the United States for the past year.Markets had initially brightened after US and Chinese leaders agreed a temporary trade truce at a meeting on Saturday.It's hard to overstate the size and importance of Huawei both within and outside of China, and how shocking this arrest is.Huawei has managed to achieve significant global market share despite the fact that it is largely shut out of the American market.The Chinese government has demanded that Meng be released.Earlier this year, six top U.S. intelligence chiefs voiced their concerns about Huawei phones to the Senate Intelligence Committee, with FBI Director Christopher Wray saying he was "deeply concerned about the risks of allowing any company or entity that is beholden to foreign governments that don't share our values to gain positions of power inside our telecommunications networks".In a response, ZTE denied the charges while Huawei insisted it "posed no greater cybersecurity risk than any ICT [Information and Communications Technology] vendor".Load-Date: December 7, 2018End of Document

US limits tech exports to Chinese firm on security groundsAssociated Press InternationalOctober 30, 2018 Tuesday 10:36 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 484 wordsDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - The Trump administration has imposed restrictions on technology exports to a state-supported Chinese semiconductor maker, citing national security grounds amid a mounting tariff battle.The controls imposed Monday on Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co. reflect concern Chinese competition could drive American technology suppliers out of business, leaving the military without secure sources of components.Beijing has spent heavily to build up Jinhua and other chip makers as part of efforts to transform China into a global leader in robotics, artificial intelligence and other technology industries.The United States, Europe and other trading partners say Beijing's tactics violate its market-opening obligations. American officials worry they might erode U.S. industrial leadership.President Donald Trump has imposed tariffs of up to 25 percent on $250 billion of Chinese goods in an effort to pressure Beijing to roll back those plans.Jinhua is completing "substantial production capacity" for integrated circuits, possibly using U.S. technology, which "threatens the long-term economic viability of U.S. suppliers of these essential components of U.S. military systems," said a Commerce Department statement.The company was added to the department's "Entity List," which will require it to obtain an export license for all software, technology and commodities, the Commerce Department said. It said such applications "will be reviewed with a presumption of denial."That "will limit its ability to threaten the supply chain for essential components in our military systems," Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in the statement.China's foreign ministry said it hoped foreign governments would treat Chinese companies "reasonably and fairly.""We hope the United States will do something that serves the two sides' interest and helps improve mutual trust, instead of the other way around," said a ministry spokesman, Lu Kang.Calls to Fujian Jinhua's offices rang unanswered Tuesday and there was no immediate response to an inquiry made through their website.The order marks the second U.S. action this year blocking technology exports to a Chinese buyer.ZTE Corp., China's second-biggest maker of telecoms equipment, faced possible bankruptcy this year after Washington imposed a seven-year ban on sales of U.S. technology to the company over its exports to Iran and North Korea.American authorities lifted the ban in July after ZTE paid a $1 billion fine, agreed to replace its executive team and hired U.S.-selected compliance officers.Meanwhile, Jinhua is embroiled in a court battle with U.S. chip maker Micron Technology Inc., which accuses the Chinese company of stealing its technology.Micron sued Jinhua in December in federal court in California. Jinhua sued the U.S. company the following month in a Chinese court and obtained an order blocking sales of some Micron products.Load-Date: October 31, 2018End of Document

Portions of the interview will air on today's All Things Considered and Friday's Morning Edition.Stations and broadcast times are available at NPR.org/stations.Excerpts of the interview are available below and can be cited with attribution to NPR. A full transcript will be made available after the interview has aired. Audio clips are available upon request, please email mediarelations@npr.orgOn the arrest of Meng Wanzhou Chief Financial Officer of Huawei;"I'd rather not get into the specifics of law enforcement matters. But we've had enormous concerns for years about the - in this country - about the practice of Chinese firms to use stolen American intellectual property, to engage in forced technology transfers, and to be used as arms of the Chinese governments objectives in terms of information technology in particular. So not respecting this particular arrest, but Huawei is one company we've been concerned about. There are others as well. I think this is going to be a major subject of the negotiations that President Trump and President Xi Jinping agreed to in Buenos Aires."Bolton went on to describe frustrations about Chinese companies like ZTE doing business with Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions - sanctions Bolton described as one of President Trump's signature policies.INSKEEP: "Is this [arrest] about Iran?"BOLTON: I was referring to the broader subject of our concerns with Chinese companies. As I said, I don't think it's appropriate to get into the specifics of a particular law enforcement."On whether Bolton or the President knew in advance that the arrest was coming;BOLTON: "I don't know the answer to that. I knew in advance. This is something that we get from the Justice Department. And these kinds of things happen with some frequency. We certainly don't inform the President on every one of them.INSKEEP: "Okay so you knew at that dinner over the weekend with China's president that this arrest was taking place."BOLTON: "Well you know there are a lot of things that are pending at any given time. You don't know exactly what's going to happen in terms of a particular law enforcement action. That depends on a lot of other circumstances."On the link between Chinese Economic and Political Liberalization;"I've heard going back years, 'Just let the Chinese economy grow a little bit and you'll see democracy spread all through the country. You can't have economic openness without having political openness. And on the basis of empirical reality, we know today that connection is far from certain.""Well, I think what we're gonna do, beginning in the next 90 days, as President Trump and President Xi agreed, is see if we can address some of these structural issues in China's economy. I think that would have [a] potentially profound impact on their political structure as well. That's not what we're aiming at but if the theory is correct, we'll see what flows from it. The main thing is to protect American jobs and American companies from the unfair treatment they've received at the hands of the Chinese government over a long period of time."On a second summit with North Korea;"Well I think President Trump's trying to give North Koreans a chance to live up to the commitments they've made at the Singapore Summit. He's held the door open for them, they need to walk through it. And this is one more chance for Kim Jong-un who is the only decision maker that matters in the North Korean system to deliver on what he said in Singapore and that's possible I think some time after the first of the year.""Well, I don't think the president views [it] as rewarding him. The issue is not simply what North Korea says. We've heard for decades that they're willing to give up their nuclear program. What we need to see is performance."Contact: Ben Fishel, NPR media relations, mediarelations@npr.orgCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6543023 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: December 7, 2018End of Document

Meng Wanzhou, in addition to being the leader of the company is also the daughter of the founder of this.  According to the United States, Wanzhou violated the US sanctions imposed on Iran by exporting products of US origin to that country and other countries subject to US sanctions since 2016, in violation of the laws of the United States (who now requests their extradition).  For its part, Huawei said on Thursday that it is unaware of any alleged "crime" committed by its financial director.  "The company received very little information about the allegations and is not aware of any crime by Meng Wanzhou," Huawei said in a statement, noting that the company complies with all applicable laws in the countries in which it operates.  (See more: The "princess" of Huawei fall into the trap of the rivalry China-USA.)  On Friday, the leader appeared before a Canadian judge who should rule on his possible conditional release. That hearing will be resumed on Monday and Meng reported on Sunday that for years suffering from severe hypertension and indicates that after his arrest had to be hospitalized several times  "I still do not feel well and I fear that my health will deteriorate during my incarceration," Meng says in the 55-page sworn statement, in which he justifies his demand to be released.  The arrest could affect the recent trade cease between China and the United States  Faced with this, Washington rejected the idea that the arrest could contaminate the trade negotiations with Beijing, even though on Sunday the Chinese government summoned the US ambassador, which increased the tension between the two powers.  The US trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, the country's chief negotiator, also said he was not planning to extend the 90-day truce in the trade war granted last week by US President Donald Trump. of a meeting in Argentina with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping.  (See more: Huawei: China demands the immediate release of Meng Wanzhou) Threats to security In addition to the situation with the daughter of the company's founder, several members of Congress in Washington consider Huawei "a threat to the security of the United States" and invoke the group's relations "with the Chinese Communist Party, and with the services of Chinese security and intelligence. "  Similarly, Japan said it will ban government use of telecommunications devices manufactured by Chinese giants Huawei and ZTE due to cybersecurity concerns. The decision could be implemented as of Monday, according to the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper and the Jiji Press news agency.  This ban would come after the United States asked its allies to avoid the products manufactured by those two companies because of fears that they serve to carry out cyber attacks, says Yomiuri Shimbun, citing unidentified government sources.  (Read also: Europe already distrusted Huawei before executive arrest)  Japanese products that use parts manufactured by some of these two Chinese companies will also be excluded from government use.  On the other hand, the Vice President of the European Commission, Andrus Ansip, had expressed concern about the possibility that Huawei is forced to disclose sensitive data of its European customers, given the relationship maintained by the company's technological openness to Beijing.  "Do you have to worry about Huawei or other Chinese companies? Yes, I think you have to worry"affirmed Friday Ansip. These companies are forced to "cooperate with Chinese intelligence services", he added, and "it is not a good sign when companies must open their (operational) systems to secret services." Unstoppable growth The truth is that Huawei surpassed in the second quarter of this year to Apple, to become the second manufacturer of smartphones in the world and has Samsung, market leader, targeted.  The exceptional development of the Chinese giant generates mistrust, and some Western and Asian countries refuse to install 5G technology in their networks, which is strategic in nature.  Affordable Huawei smartphones have achieved a strong foray into the developed world, but the company has faced several setbacks in large Western economies due to security concerns. Load-Date: December 10, 2018End of Document

The gathering accounts for 55 percent of global trade and 60 percent of the world's population.Amnesty International and some European lawmakers urged EU leaders at the meeting to call out their Asian counterparts on human rights abuses, including the persecution of Myanmar's Rohingya Muslims and China's internment camps for an estimated 1 million Muslims in the western region of Xinjiang.In a speech Monday, outgoing U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said the Chinese government "is engaged in the persecution of religious and ethnic minorities that is straight out of George Orwell."China has characterized the mass internment of ethnic Uighurs as a push to bring into the "modern, civilized" world a destitute people who are easily led astray.EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini said European leaders would raise rights issues with their Asian counterparts and singled out the Rohingya crisis as an area of particular concern."We'll have discussions ... on seeing how we can try to help the United Nations to have proper access and have the return of the Rohingya in a safe and dignified manner," Mogherini said.The meeting is taking place amid a trade war between the United States and China and ongoing trade tensions between the EU and Washington, but Mogherini said it was not about presenting a united front to U.S. President Donald Trump."Together, Europe and Asia are upholding the multilateral trade system based on rules - free and fair trade," she told reporters.The informal meeting, which is held every two years, will also discuss peace moves on the Korean Peninsula, migration, cybersecurity, fighting extremism and combating climate change.On Friday afternoon, EU leaders will hold talks with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and sign a free trade deal with Singapore.Thursday's meeting came a day after U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross criticized the EU for moving too slowly in trade talks and warned that Trump's patience with the Europeans might soon run out.China knows how that feels. Trump has imposed punitive tariffs on about $250 billion of Chinese products amid U.S. accusations that China engages in cyber-theft and coerces foreign companies into handing over technology in return for access to the Chinese market. Trump is also angry over China's trade surplus with the U.S.The EU has similar concerns about creating a level playing field for European companies doing business in China, said Frans-Paul van der Putten of the Clingendael think tank in The Hague.On a visit to the Netherlands this week, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reasserted pledges to open up his country to foreign investment."We will remove foreign equity restrictions to Dutch companies as well," Li said.Van der Putten said Li will likely bring that message to Brussels, too."I imagine at the EU level the Chinese government will have a similar message," he said.Load-Date: October 19, 2018End of Document

The gathering accounts for 55 percent of global trade and 60 percent of the world's population.Amnesty International and some European lawmakers urged EU leaders at the meeting to call out their Asian counterparts on human rights abuses, including the persecution of Myanmar's Rohingya Muslims and China's internment camps for an estimated 1 million Muslims in the western region of Xinjiang.In a speech Monday, outgoing U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said the Chinese government 'is engaged in the persecution of religious and ethnic minorities that is straight out of George Orwell.'China has characterized the mass internment of ethnic Uighurs as a push to bring into the 'modern, civilized' world a destitute people who are easily led astray.EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini said European leaders would raise rights issues with their Asian counterparts and singled out the Rohingya crisis as an area of particular concern.'We'll have discussions ... on seeing how we can try to help the United Nations to have proper access and have the return of the Rohingya in a safe and dignified manner,' Mogherini said.The meeting is taking place amid a trade war between the United States and China and ongoing trade tensions between the EU and Washington, but Mogherini said it was not about presenting a united front to U.S. President Donald Trump.'Together, Europe and Asia are upholding the multilateral trade system based on rules - free and fair trade,' she told reporters.The informal meeting, which is held every two years, will also discuss peace moves on the Korean Peninsula, migration, cybersecurity, fighting extremism and combating climate change.On Friday afternoon, EU leaders will hold talks with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and sign a free trade deal with Singapore.Thursday's meeting came a day after U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross criticized the EU for moving too slowly in trade talks and warned that Trump's patience with the Europeans might soon run out.China knows how that feels. Trump has imposed punitive tariffs on about $250 billion of Chinese products amid U.S. accusations that China engages in cyber-theft and coerces foreign companies into handing over technology in return for access to the Chinese market. Trump is also angry over China's trade surplus with the U.S.The EU has similar concerns about creating a level playing field for European companies doing business in China, said Frans-Paul van der Putten of the Clingendael think tank in The Hague.On a visit to the Netherlands this week, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reasserted pledges to open up his country to foreign investment.'We will remove foreign equity restrictions to Dutch companies as well,' Li said.Van der Putten said Li will likely bring that message to Brussels, too.'I imagine at the EU level the Chinese government will have a similar message,' he said.Load-Date: October 19, 2018End of Document

PRC STATE-OWNED COMPANY, TAIWAN COMPANY, AND 3 INDIVIDUALS CHARGED WITH ECONOMIC ESPIONAGEUS Fed NewsNovember 1, 2018 Thursday 1:40 PM  ESTCopyright 2018 HT Media Ltd. All Rights ReservedLength: 1237 wordsBodyWASHINGTON, Nov. 1 -- The U.S. Department of Justice's Criminal Division issued the following news release:A federal grand jury indicted a state-owned enterprise of the People's Republic of China (PRC), a Taiwan company, and three individuals, charging them with crimes related to a conspiracy to steal, convey, and possess stolen trade secrets of an American semiconductor company for the benefit of a company controlled by the PRC government. All of the defendants are charged with a conspiracy to commit economic espionage, among other crimes. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, FBI Director Christopher Wray, Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers, Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division Brian A. Benczkowski, United States Attorney Alex G. Tse of the Northern District of California, and FBI Special Agent in Charge for the San Francisco Field Office John F. Bennett made the announcement.In addition, the United States filed a civil lawsuit seeking to enjoin the further transfer of the stolen trade secrets and to enjoin certain defendants from exporting to the United States any products manufactured by UMC or Jinhua that were created using the trade secrets at issue. The indictment was filed on September 27, 2018, and unsealed today. The civil lawsuit was filed today."I am announcing that a grand jury in San Francisco has returned a multi-defendant indictment alleging economic espionage on the part of a state-owned Chinese company, a Taiwanese company, and three Taiwan individuals for an alleged scheme to steal trade secrets from Micron, an Idaho-based semi-conductor company," said Attorney General Sessions. "Micron is worth an estimated $100 billion and has a 20 to 25 percent share of the dynamic random access memory industry-a technology not possessed by the Chinese until very recently. As this and other recent cases have shown, Chinese economic espionage against the United States has been increasing-and it has been increasing rapidly. I am here to say that enough is enough. With integrity and professionalism, the Department of Justice will aggressively prosecute such illegal activity.""The theft of intellectual property is not only unfair, but stifles technological innovation by disincentivizing investment in long-term research and development," said U.S. Attorney Alex Tse. "The theft of intellectual property on a continuing basis by nation-state actors is an even more damaging affront to the rule of law. We in the Northern District of California, one of the world's great centers of intellectual property development, will continue to lead the fight to protect U.S. innovation from criminal misappropriation, whether motivated by personal greed or national economic ambition.""No country presents a broader, more severe threat to our ideas, our innovation, and our economic security than China," said FBI Director Christopher Wray. "The Chinese government is determined to acquire American technology, and they're willing use a variety of means to do that - from foreign investments, corporate acquisitions, and cyber intrusions to obtaining the services of current or former company employees to get inside information. If China acquires an American company's most important technology - the very technology that makes it the leader in a field - that company will suffer severe losses, and our national security could even be impacted. We are committed to continuing to work closely with our federal, state, local, and private sector partners to counter this threat from China."According to the indictment, the defendants were engaged in a conspiracy to steal the trade secrets of Micron Technology, Inc. (Micron), a leader in the global semiconductor industry specializing in the advanced research, development, and manufacturing of memory products, including dynamic random-access memory (DRAM). DRAM is a leading-edge memory storage device used in computer electronics. Micron is the only United States-based company that manufactures DRAM. According to the indictment, Micron maintains a significant competitive advantage in this field due in large part from its intellectual property, including its trade secrets that include detailed, confidential information pertaining to the design, development, and manufacturing of advanced DRAM products.Prior to the events described in the indictment, the PRC did not possess DRAM technology, and the Central Government and State Council of the PRC publicly identified the development of DRAM and other microelectronics technology as a national economic priority. The criminal defendants are United Microelectronics Corporation ("UMC"), a Taiwan semiconductor foundry; Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit, Co., Ltd. ("Jinhua'"), a state-owned enterprise of the PRC; and three Taiwan nationals: Chen Zhengkun, a.k.a. Stephen Chen, age 55; He Jianting, a.k.a. J.T. Ho, age 42; and Wang Yungming, a.k.a. Kenny Wang, age 44. UMC is a publicly listed semiconductor foundry company traded on the New York Stock Exchange; is headquartered in Taiwan; and has offices worldwide, including in Sunnyvale, California. UMC mass produces integrated-circuit logic products based on designs and technology developed and provided by its customers. Jinhua is a state-owned enterprise of the PRC, funded entirely by the Chinese government, and established in February 2016 for the sole purpose of designing, developing, and manufacturing DRAM.According to the indictment, Chen was a General Manager and Chairman of an electronics corporation that Micron acquired in 2013. Chen then became the president of a Micron subsidiary in Taiwan, Micron Memory Taiwan ("MMT"), responsible for manufacturing at least one of Micron's DRAM chips. Chen resigned from MMT in July 2015 and began working at UMC almost immediately. While at UMC, Chen arranged a cooperation agreement between UMC and Fujian Jinhua whereby, with funding from Fujian Jinhua, UMC would transfer DRAM technology to Fujian Jinhua to mass-produce. The technology would be jointly shared by both UMC and Fujian Jinhua. Chen later became the President of Jinhua and was put in charge of its DRAM production facility.While at UMC, Chen recruited numerous MMT employees, including Ho and Wang, to join him at UMC. Prior to leaving MMT, Ho and Wang both stole and brought to UMC several Micron trade secrets related to the design and manufacture of DRAM. Wang downloaded over 900 Micron confidential and proprietary files before he left MMT and stored them on USB external hard drives or in personal cloud storage, from where he could access the technology while working at UMC.An indictment merely alleges that crimes have been committed, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. If convicted, the individual defendants face a maximum sentence of 15 years imprisonment and a $5,000,000 fine for economic espionage charges, and 10 years imprisonment for theft of trade secrets charges. If convicted, each company faces forfeiture and a maximum fine of more than $20 billion. However, any sentence following conviction would be imposed by the court only after consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal statute governing the imposition of a sentence, 18 U.S.C. section 3553.

Chinese intelligence officers charged in US aviation hackingAssociated Press Financial WireOctober 31, 2018 Wednesday 2:56 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 464 wordsByline: By BRIAN MELLEY, Associated PressDateline: LOS ANGELES BodyLOS ANGELES (AP) - Chinese intelligence officers and hackers working for them have been charged with commercial espionage that included trying to steal information on commercial jet engines, federal prosecutors said Tuesday.The indictments named two officers working for the Nanjing-based foreign intelligence arm of China's Ministry of State Security and six other defendants who allegedly conspired from 2010 to 2015 to steal sensitive turbofan engine technology used in commercial aviation.The hackers used spear phishing to deploy malware and other means to intrude into a French aerospace company that was developing the engines with a U.S. company, prosecutors said. The suspects also hacked into aerospace companies in Massachusetts, Oregon and Arizona that manufactured engine parts.A Chinese state-owned aerospace company was working at the time to develop a similar type of engine for use in commercial aircraft."This action is yet another example of criminal efforts by the (Ministry of State Security) to facilitate the theft of private data for China's commercial gain," U.S. Attorney Adam Braverman said in a statement. "The concerted effort to steal, rather than simply purchase, commercially available products should offend every company that invests talent, energy, and shareholder money into the development of products."The Justice Department in recent years has brought similar prosecutions against Chinese military or government officials accused of hacking into American corporations to steal secrets and prosecutors vowed to redouble those efforts.In 2014, for instance, the department announced an indictment against five military officers accused of breaking into the computer systems of big-name makers of nuclear and solar technology and stealing confidential business information, sensitive trade secrets and internal communications for competitive advantage.Earlier this month, an accused Chinese spy, was charged with attempting to steal secrets from several American aviation and aerospace companies and extradited to the U.S. Federal authorities said it was the first time that a Chinese Ministry of State Security intelligence officer had been extradited to the United States for trial.None of the eight defendants named in the indictment unsealed Tuesday in San Diego federal court were in custody and the U.S. doesn't have an extradition treaty with China.Prosecutors said the hackers had tried to infiltrate 13 companies, including two aerospace based in the United Kingdom.The indictment only named one of the companies targeted, saying the first alleged hack in January 2010 aimed at stealing data from Los Angeles-based Capstone Turbine, a gas turbine manufacturer.___Associated Press Writer Eric Tucker in Washington contributed to this report.Load-Date: October 31, 2018End of Document

This enormous data consumption, mainly driven by video streaming and internet browsing, requires high-speed networks.While traditional revenue sources, such as mobile voice and texts, reaching their maturity in a number of markets and witnessing a progressive decline in their profits, LTE and LTE-A are empowering fast data flow that is demanded by the new Digital Society.In developed regions, optical fiber technology is having good traction indeed in high dense populated areas; but the Fixed-LTE technology is aggressively challenging the fixed-line connectivity in those areas that lack fixed broadband infrastructure, such as rural areas.Further, a fierce demand for broadband is bolstering the significant growth in the fixed wireless access point (AP) shipments. However, network performance concerns are hampering the growth of the market.Growing Demand for High-Speed Broadband in Rural Areas Drive Market GrowthThe delivery of high-speed broadband to rural locations has been a challenging task service providers. One of the most daunting concerns is the unpredictability of the soil composition while building broadband fiber infrastructure as the densely populated forests and tall trees can interfere with fixed wireless broadband connectivity.Further, the recent fixed LTE solutions are equipped to address these variables as they serve as a cost-effective alternative to drop, distribution and/or feeder fiber, providing a whole new set of deployment models to the traditional FTTx deployment models.One of the most significant markets for fixed LTE in rural areas is the United States. According to the Federal Communications Commission, 20 million people living in rural areas, do not have access to land-based internet communications, applications, and services at 25 Mbps.According to the World Bank, a 10% increase in broadband penetration can lead to a 1.21% growth in GDP in developed economies and a 1.38% growth in developing economies. Thus, pushing developed economies such as United States to tackle this issue in its rural areas.Asia-Pacific is Expected to Have Highest Market ShareAsia-Pacific has the highest volume of fixed LTE connections, which can be attributed to a large population using internet and the focus of governments to upgrade the existing infrastructure. The Chinese government's Broadband China Plan aims to provide nationwide broadband access with speeds of at least 50 Mbps in urban areas and 12 Mbps in rural areas, by 2020.Another major reason in China is the ongoing smart city developments, the construction of wireless cities, and the provision of faster broadband speeds by ISPs. Rapid growth in IP traffic and increasing demand for web-enabled devices like smartphones are further expected to drive the market.The growing IT expenditure and increasing government initiatives are further fuelling the growth of the Indian fixed LTE market.Developments in the Market• Apr 2018 - Huawei launched SingleRAN Pro to tackle 5G challenges.

Sharing Economy International Reports Third Quarter 2018 ResultsPR NewswireNovember 13, 2018 Tuesday 4:30 PM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 4040 wordsDateline: WUXI, Jiangsu Province, China, Nov. 13, 2018 BodyPR NewswireSharing Economy International Inc. ("SEII" or "the Company") (SEII), a clean technology and sharing economy company that designs, manufactures and distributes of proprietary high and low temperature dyeing and finishing machinery to the textile industry, and is engaged in the development of sharing economy platforms and rental related businesses, today announced its financial results for quarter ended September 30, 2018."In the third quarter of 2018, our textile customers in China continued to face challenging conditions such as tight credit, rising raw materials costs and forced closures by the Chinese government which depressed sales and margins during the quarter. This environment also led to our decision to record a $1.9 million impairment on the ozone-ultrasonic patent technology we acquired in August 2016, as we do not believe our customers will be in a position to buy next-generation dying machines based on this technology in the foreseeable future. Our quarterly financial results were also impacted by an $8.9 million loss on our solar farm equity method investment following the Chinese government's halt on new solar farm installations and reduced subsidies for solar farms already under construction," said Mr. Jianhua Wu, Chairman and CEO of SEII.  "As we look to the future, we are seeking to identify new revenue drivers in both our traditional manufacturing business and, more importantly, our sharing economy businesses.  We are moving forward in developing new businesses in fast growing industries such as coworking spaces, online rental sharing and peer-to-peer errand services. We are also making good progress with our initiatives in 3D virtual tours, online advertising and see strong potential in our latest acquisition, Gagfare."  Mr. Parkson Yip, Vice President of SEII, commented, "Our sharing economy business units are all gaining momentum.  During the quarter, BuddiGo, our sharing platform that provides on-demand delivery of items including packages, flowers, cakes and food delivery by 'buddies' who can spare idle time to run errands in the Hong Kong market, began online promotions featuring KOLs, driving increases in both buy-side and sell-side users. Our flexible workspace offering, Anyworkspace, saw a 44% increase in website traffic from the second quarter of 2018 and successfully extended its footprint to India with the addition of space providers in New Delhi and Gurgaon. Anyworkspaces' website rebuild is expected to be completed by year-end, which should help us better monetize advertising opportunities and attract more users in the year ahead."Our 3D Discovery business unit currently has contracts totaling approximately $278,000 which are expected to be completed by year end, and Autocap, a mobile application which allows users to create a virtual tour of a physical space on their own without the help of specialized 360 camera equipment, is on track to launch its iOS version in Australia by mid-2019. At EC Advertising, our inhouse online advertising unit that supports Buddigo, Anyworkspace and 3D Discovery, we established a new wholly-owned subsidiary in Mainland China and expect to sign new clients and launch marketing campaigns toward the end of 2018 and in early 2019. Finally, we continue to develop our peer-to-peer rental sharing economy in Asia through our license agreement with ECrent. During the quarter, our sublicensee in South Korea, PTI Corporation, commenced prelaunch activities to develop the platform and we hope to enter other Asian countries in the year ahead," Mr. Yip concluded. Third Quarter 2018 ResultsRevenue for the third quarter of 2018 decreased by 4.3% to $2.5 million, compared to $2.6 million in the third quarter of 2017.  The Company's dyeing and finishing business generated substantially all revenue in the third quarter of 2018 since the forged rolled rings and related products and petroleum and chemical equipment businesses were discontinued in 2016 and the new sharing economy businesses are still in an early stage.  Revenues from the dyeing and finishing business declined due to an anticipated slowdown in shipments of low-emission airflow dyeing machines as many companies in the dyeing industry had already upgraded to new models and did not require additional equipment, and orders for new low-emission airflow dyeing machines continued to slow down in 2018 as potential customers did not have the financial resources or credit to purchase equipment.  In addition, apparel factories and other factories have been shut down throughout the last year by China's environmental bureau, which has been cutting electricity and gas supply to determine compliance with China's environmental laws, which contributed to the decline in revenues. Revenues from the sharing economy businesses were $73,000 in the third quarter of 2018, compared to $24,000 in the third quarter of 2017.Gross loss for the third quarter of 2018 was $1.7 million compared to gross loss of $446,000 for the same period in 2017.  Gross margin was negative 68.6% during the third quarter of 2018 compared to negative 17.0% for the same period in 2017. The gross margin for the third quarter of 2018 was impacted by the reduced scale of operations resulting from lower revenues, which is reflected in the allocation of fixed costs, mainly consisting of depreciation, to cost of revenues, and an increase in labor and raw material costs.Operating expenses increased to $7.8 million, compared to $3.7 million in the third quarter of 2017.  The increase was due to $4.4 million in professional fees in the form of stock-based compensation related to implementing a new business plan with the objective of improving long-term growth. In addition, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $1.9 million related to a patent purchased in August 2016 that covers ozone-ultrasonic textile dyeing equipment. Due to the challenging conditions facing its customers, increasing raw materials prices and labor costs, it is unlikely that customers will purchase new equipment based on the patent and therefore the patent is not expected to yield significant value to the Company. Other expense was $9.1 million, compared to other expense of $68,000 in the third quarter of 2017. The increase was due to an $8.9 million loss in equity investment in Shengxin, a developer and designer of solar farms in China. In April 2018, Shengxin secured and invested in a large solar PV project in GuiZhou province, paid RMB40.0 million for the project rights and also engaged a local contractor to proceed with building the project. However, on June 1, 2018, the Chinese government halted installation of new solar farms for the remainder of the year and reduced subsidies for projects already under construction. Due to significant doubt about the status of this project and recoverability of the Company's investment, the Company fully impaired the value of its investment during the third quarter of 2018.Loss from continuing operations was $18.6 million, or $(2.56) per basic and diluted share, compared to loss from continuing operations of $4.2 million, or $(2.10) per basic and diluted share in the third quarter of 2017.Loss from discontinued operations (Refer to "Discontinued Operations" discussion below) was $385, or $0.00 per basic and diluted share.  This compares to $71,339 or $(0.04) in the third quarter of 2017.Net loss attributable to common shareholders was $18.2 million, or $(2.56) per basic and diluted share, compared a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $4.3 million, or $(2.14) per basic and diluted share in the third quarter of 2017.Basic and diluted earnings per share were based on 7,100,416 and 1,988,794 weighted average shares outstanding, respectively, for the quarters ended September 30, 2018 and 2017. The increase in weighted average shares was due to shares issued as stock-based compensation, common stock issued for acquisitions, conversion of a convertible note and the sale of common shares during the quarter. All share and per share information has been adjusted to reflect a 1-for-4 reverse stock split effective March 20, 2017.Nine Month ResultsFor the nine months ended September 30, 2018, revenue was $7.7 million compared to $11.0 in the first nine months of 2017. Gross loss was $2.8 million, compared to gross profit of $582,000 in the first nine months of 2017. Gross margin was negative 36.7%, compared to 5.3% in the first nine months of 2017.  Loss from continuing operations was $29.5 million, or $(8.00) per basic and diluted share, compared to a loss from continuing operations of $4.8 million, or $(2.96) per basic and diluted share for the same period in 2017. Gain from discontinued operations was $16,000 for the first nine months of 2018, compared to a loss from discontinued operations of $71,000 for the first nine months of 2017. Net loss attributable to common shareholders for the first nine months of 2018 was $28.8 million, or $(7.99) per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $4.9 million, or ($3.00) per basic and diluted share, in the first nine months of 2017. Basic and diluted earnings per share were based on 3,598,265 and 1,635,223 weighted average shares outstanding, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, and 2017. Financial ConditionAs of September 30, 2018, SEII held cash and cash equivalents of $707,000 compared to $1.0 million at December 31, 2017.  Accounts receivable were $4.8 million compared to $9.1 million at December 31, 2017.  Inventories were $5.3 million compared to $4.6 million at December 31, 2017.  The Company had $3.0 million in short-term bank loans payable and short-term convertible debt at September 30, 2018, down from $3.2 million at December 31, 2017. Working capital was $17.6 million at September 30, 2018, compared to $13.5 million at December 31, 2017. Stockholders' equity was $50.3 million at September 30, 2018. In the first nine months of 2018, the Company used $3.2 million in cash flow from operations. The Company used $72,000 in cash flow from investing activities, primarily due to cash used for the purchase of property and equipment in Wuxi, China. The Company generated $3.1 million in cash flow from financing activities, primarily due to proceeds from a convertible promissory note, the sale of common stock and an advance from a related party.Discontinued OperationsOn December 30, 2016, the Company sold and transferred 100% of the stock of Wuxi Fulland Wind Energy Equipment Co., Ltd. ("Fulland Wind") to an unrelated party and discontinued the Company's forged rolled rings and related components business. Additionally, the Company's management decided to discontinue its petroleum and chemical equipment segment due to significant declines in revenues and the loss of its major customer. As such, the assets and liabilities of these two segments have been classified on the consolidated balance sheet as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 and the operating results have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for all years presented.Recent EventsOn August 17, 2018, SEIL has entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement with the shareholder of Gagfare Limited ("Gagfare"), to acquire 60% ownership of Gagfare. SEIL will acquire 60% of Gagfare for US$3.6 million, which shall be satisfied by the allotment and issuance of 1,176,087 preferred shares of the Company at a price of $3.061 per share. Gagfare is an online platform enabling travelers to search flights directly with over 500 airlines globally, allowing them to get the best-value airfare for their desired flight and secure a confirmed, impartial best airfare on their desired flight instantly.  The acquisition has not yet been completed subject to certain conditions as stipulated in the Agreement, and the expiration date has been extended from October 18, 2018 to January 18, 2019 by mutual agreement of both parties.On October 8, 2018, the Company received a staff deficiency notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market ("Nasdaq") informing the Company that it has failed to comply with Nasdaq's shareholder approval requirements set forth in Listing Rule 5635(c) (the "Rule").

Continue reading Sharing Economy International Reports Third Quarter 2018 ResultsWUXI, Jiangsu Province, China,   Sharing Economy International Inc. ( SEII  or  the Company ) (SEII), a clean technology and sharing economy company that designs, manufactures and distributes of proprietary high and low temperature dyeing and finishing machinery to the textile industry, and is engaged in the development of sharing economy platforms and rental related businesses, today announced its financial results for quarter ended September 30, 2018. In the third quarter of 2018, our textile customers in China continued to face challenging conditions such as tight credit, rising raw materials costs and forced closures by the Chinese government which depressed sales and margins during the quarter. This environment also led to our decision to record a $1.9 million impairment on the ozone-ultrasonic patent technology we acquired in August 2016, as we do not believe our customers will be in a position to buy next-generation dying machines based on this technology in the foreseeable future. Our quarterly financial results were also impacted by an $8.9 million loss on our solar farm equity method investment following the Chinese government's halt on new solar farm installations and reduced subsidies for solar farms already under construction,  said Mr. Jianhua Wu, Chairman and CEO of SEII.   As we look to the future, we are seeking to identify new revenue drivers in both our traditional manufacturing business and, more importantly, our sharing economy businesses.  We are moving forward in developing new businesses in fast growing industries such as coworking spaces, online rental sharing and peer-to-peer errand services. We are also making good progress with our initiatives in 3D virtual tours, online advertising and see strong potential in our latest acquisition, Gagfare.   Mr. Parkson Yip, Vice President of SEII, commented,  Our sharing economy business units are all gaining momentum.  During the quarter, BuddiGo, our sharing platform that provides on-demand delivery of items including packages, flowers, cakes and food delivery by  buddies' who can spare idle time to run errands in the Hong Kong market, began online promotions featuring KOLs, driving increases in both buy-side and sell-side users. Our flexible workspace offering, Anyworkspace, saw a 44% increase in website traffic from the second quarter of 2018 and successfully extended its footprint to India with the addition of space providers in New Delhi and Gurgaon. Anyworkspaces' website rebuild is expected to be completed by year-end, which should help us better monetize advertising opportunities and attract more users in the year ahead. Our 3D Discovery business unit currently has contracts totaling approximately $278,000 which are expected to be completed by year end, and Autocap, a mobile application which allows users to create a virtual tour of a physical space on their own without the help of specialized 360 camera equipment, is on track to launch its iOS version in Australia by mid-2019. At EC Advertising, our inhouse online advertising unit that supports Buddigo, Anyworkspace and 3D Discovery, we established a new wholly-owned subsidiary in Mainland China and expect to sign new clients and launch marketing campaigns toward the end of 2018 and in early 2019. Finally, we continue to develop our peer-to-peer rental sharing economy in Asia through our license agreement with ECrent. During the quarter, our sublicensee in South Korea, PTI Corporation, commenced prelaunch activities to develop the platform and we hope to enter other Asian countries in the year ahead,  Mr. Yip concluded. Third Quarter 2018 ResultsRevenue for the third quarter of 2018 decreased by 4.3% to $2.5 million, compared to $2.6 million in the third quarter of 2017.  The Company's dyeing and finishing business generated substantially all revenue in the third quarter of 2018 since the forged rolled rings and related products and petroleum and chemical equipment businesses were discontinued in 2016 and the new sharing economy businesses are still in an early stage.  Revenues from the dyeing and finishing business declined due to an anticipated slowdown in shipments of low-emission airflow dyeing machines as many companies in the dyeing industry had already upgraded to new models and did not require additional equipment, and orders for new low-emission airflow dyeing machines continued to slow down in 2018 as potential customers did not have the financial resources or credit to purchase equipment.  In addition, apparel factories and other factories have been shut down throughout the last year by China's environmental bureau, which has been cutting electricity and gas supply to determine compliance with China's environmental laws, which contributed to the decline in revenues. Revenues from the sharing economy businesses were $73,000 in the third quarter of 2018, compared to $24,000 in the third quarter of 2017.Gross loss for the third quarter of 2018 was $1.7 million compared to gross loss of $446,000 for the same period in 2017.  Gross margin was negative 68.6% during the third quarter of 2018 compared to negative 17.0% for the same period in 2017. The gross margin for the third quarter of 2018 was impacted by the reduced scale of operations resulting from lower revenues, which is reflected in the allocation of fixed costs, mainly consisting of depreciation, to cost of revenues, and an increase in labor and raw material costs.Operating expenses increased to $7.8 million, compared to $3.7 million in the third quarter of 2017.  The increase was due to $4.4 million in professional fees in the form of stock-based compensation related to implementing a new business plan with the objective of improving long-term growth. In addition, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $1.9 million related to a patent purchased in August 2016 that covers ozone-ultrasonic textile dyeing equipment. Due to the challenging conditions facing its customers, increasing raw materials prices and labor costs, it is unlikely that customers will purchase new equipment based on the patent and therefore the patent is not expected to yield significant value to the Company. Other expense was $9.1 million, compared to other expense of $68,000 in the third quarter of 2017. The increase was due to an $8.9 million loss in equity investment in Shengxin, a developer and designer of solar farms in China. In April 2018, Shengxin secured and invested in a large solar PV project in GuiZhou province, paid RMB40.0 million for the project rights and also engaged a local contractor to proceed with building the project. However, on June 1, 2018, the Chinese government halted installation of new solar farms for the remainder of the year and reduced subsidies for projects already under construction. Due to significant doubt about the status of this project and recoverability of the Company's investment, the Company fully impaired the value of its investment during the third quarter of 2018.Loss from continuing operations was $18.6 million, or $(2.56) per basic and diluted share, compared to loss from continuing operations of $4.2 million, or $(2.10) per basic and diluted share in the third quarter of 2017.Loss from discontinued operations (Refer to  Discontinued Operations  discussion below) was $385, or $0.00 per basic and diluted share.  This compares to $71,339 or $(0.04) in the third quarter of 2017.Net loss attributable to common shareholders was $18.2 million, or $(2.56) per basic and diluted share, compared a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $4.3 million, or $(2.14) per basic and diluted share in the third quarter of 2017.Basic and diluted earnings per share were based on 7,100,416 and 1,988,794 weighted average shares outstanding, respectively, for the quarters ended September 30, 2018 and 2017. The increase in weighted average shares was due to shares issued as stock-based compensation, common stock issued for acquisitions, conversion of a convertible note and the sale of common shares during the quarter. All share and per share information has been adjusted to reflect a 1-for-4 reverse stock split effective March 20, 2017.Nine Month ResultsFor the nine months ended September 30, 2018, revenue was $7.7 million compared to $11.0 in the first nine months of 2017. Gross loss was $2.8 million, compared to gross profit of $582,000 in the first nine months of 2017. Gross margin was negative 36.7%, compared to 5.3% in the first nine months of 2017.  Loss from continuing operations was $29.5 million, or $(8.00) per basic and diluted share, compared to a loss from continuing operations of $4.8 million, or $(2.96)per basic and diluted share for the same period in 2017. Gain from discontinued operations was $16,000 for the first nine months of 2018, compared to a loss from discontinued operations of $71,000 for the first nine months of 2017. Net loss attributable to common shareholders for the first nine months of 2018 was $28.8 million, or $(7.99) per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $4.9 million, or ($3.00) per basic and diluted share, in the first nine months of 2017. Basic and diluted earnings per share were based on 3,598,265 and 1,635,223 weighted average shares outstanding, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, and 2017. Financial ConditionAs of September 30, 2018, SEII held cash and cash equivalents of $707,000 compared to $1.0 million at December 31, 2017.  Accounts receivable were $4.8 million compared to $9.1 million at December 31, 2017.  Inventories were $5.3 million compared to $4.6 million at December 31, 2017.  The Company had $3.0 million in short-term bank loans payable and short-term convertible debt at September 30, 2018, down from $3.2 million at December 31, 2017. Working capital was $17.6 million at September 30, 2018, compared to $13.5 million at December 31, 2017. Stockholders' equity was $50.3 million at September 30, 2018. In the first nine months of 2018, the Company used $3.2 million in cash flow from operations. The Company used $72,000 in cash flow from investing activities, primarily due to cash used for the purchase of property and equipment in Wuxi, China. The Company generated $3.1 million in cash flow from financing activities, primarily due to proceeds from a convertible promissory note, the sale of common stock and an advance from a related party.Discontinued OperationsOn December 30, 2016, the Company sold and transferred 100% of the stock of Wuxi Fulland Wind Energy Equipment Co., Ltd. ( Fulland Wind ) to an unrelated party and discontinued the Company's forged rolled rings and related components business. Additionally, the Company's management decided to discontinue its petroleum and chemical equipment segment due to significant declines in revenues and the loss of its major customer. As such, the assets and liabilities of these two segments have been classified on the consolidated balance sheet as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 and the operating results have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for all years presented.Recent EventsOn August 17, 2018, SEIL has entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement with the shareholder of Gagfare Limited ( Gagfare ), to acquire 60% ownership of Gagfare. SEIL will acquire 60% of Gagfare for US$3.6 million, which shall be satisfied by the allotment and issuance of 1,176,087 preferred shares of the Company at a price of $3.061 per share. Gagfare is an online platform enabling travelers to search flights directly with over 500 airlines globally, allowing them to get the best-value airfare for their desired flight and secure a confirmed, impartial best airfare on their desired flight instantly.  The acquisition has not yet been completed subject to certain conditions as stipulated in the Agreement, and the expiration date has been extended from October 18, 2018 to January 18, 2019 by mutual agreement of both parties.On October 8, 2018, the Company received a staff deficiency notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market ( Nasdaq ) informing the Company that it has failed to comply with Nasdaq's shareholder approval requirements set forth in Listing Rule 5635(c) (the  Rule ). During the period from May 11, 2017 to date, the Company entered into approximately one hundred arrangements resulting in the issuance or potential issuance of more than three million shares to officers, directors, employees, and consultants ( Equity Compensation Grants ). The Company did not receive shareholder approval for the Equity Compensation Grants, and the shares were not issued from a shareholder approval equity compensation plan.

Analysts Increase Bullishness on Apple Heading Into EarningsRealMoneyNovember 1, 2018 Thursday 12:57 PM EDTCopyright 2018 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 846 wordsByline: Kevin CurranHighlight: Apple's long-term thesis is emboldening analysts.BodyWall Street's confidence in Apple's  ability to grow amid a tough time for tech is increasing.Analysts bullishness is prompting widespread price target hiking. According to FactSet, 10 of 14 analysts providing price targets in the past month have raised their estimates, with some targets reaching as high as $300, as Apple's earnings results approach post-market on Thursday."Apple had not only the lowest P/E multiple amongst the large technology companies, it also offered one of the lowest Price-to-earnings multiple for every point of growth making it a strong value pick," J.P. Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee wrote in his preview. "We continue to rate Apple Overweight and with a $272 Dec 2019 price target."Services Segment Sets Up FutureMuch of the growth that analysts expect toward their bullish price in the long term is driven by the services segment.The services category includes iTunes, the App Store, the Mac App Store, Apple Music, iCloud, Apple Pay, and AppleCare."Current ~16x PE is a slight premium to historic 15x but still makes Services look undervalued," Jefferies analyst Tim O'Shea said in his initiation of coverage on Oct. 26.O'Shea explained that the value of the services business is being underestimated as the core of the business migrates toward the segment."As the business rapidly mix-shifts towards this more recurring revenue model, we see upside to gross margin estimates over time with our 2022 estimates, 100 bps higher than the Street," he speculated. "Applying a higher 5-8x sales multiple to our 2022 estimate implies Services could be worth $111 to $177 per share over time, a significant opportunity."To be sure, Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan sees possible deceleration in App Store performance, particularly in China, which would dampen O'Shea's bullish thesis.He nonetheless set a "Buy" rating for the stock based on mitigating circumstances.eSports ExcitementA tangential market that the company might be able to seize upon is eSports, which can help drive performance outside of services.DA Davidson analyst Tom Forte told Real Money that he was recently convinced on the emerging growth engine in eSports by researching and visiting events."We are increasing our price target on AAPL to $265 from $230," DA Davidson analyst Tom Forte explained. "The $35 increase is a reflection of raising our long-term sales growth rate and margin projections on greater confidence in its ability to generate higher hardware and services (App Store) sales rates due to the emerging secular shift of eSports."  is slated to head over $1 billion next year and advance toward $2 billion in just a few short years, backing Forte's bullish take.Forte added that Apple's dominance across multiple platforms will mean that eSports should allow for multi-segment growth."Fortnite is the best example of this," he told Real Money. "People aren't just playing it on a console, but on mobile, on iPad, whatever."  impact eSports as well, however."With mobile esports being so big in China and the Chinese government recently putting limits on new game content, there is some concern that it could pressure Services revenue, especially out of Asia,"  told Real Money. (Apple is a holding in the Action Alerts PLUS portfolio.)Investors will hope that a tweet from President Trump Thursday morning means that China fears could dissipate soon enough.Just had a long and very good conversation with President Xi Jinping of China. We talked about many subjects, with a heavy emphasis on Trade. Those discussions are moving along nicely with meetings being scheduled at the G-20 in Argentina. Also had good discussion on North Korea! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)  Watching WearablesWearables, given the increased popularity of the Apple Watch and Airpods, will be a pivotal part of earnings as well."With the September launch event standing out relative to the upgrade to the Apple Watch, we believe the momentum of the Series 4 Apple Watch will be in focus on the earnings call," J.P. Morgan's Chatterjee noted. "We believe investors will fully realize the acceleration in Apple Watch shipments [by January 2019] with the Series 4 watch likely featuring as a top grossing holiday gift item."Analysts also keyed in on the ability of the company to capitalize on expanding its offerings into health demographics and beyond."AirPods and Watch should account for $13 billion in revenue (+48% year over year) in 2018," Jefferies' O'Shea said. "Over time AAPL could launch other products like AR/VR glasses, hearing aids, and health/fitness trackers, etc."Fitness trackers have made Fitbit  a $1.5 billion company, so it could be a profitable venture if a tech giant like Apple branches out or adds more functionality to its Watch offering to squelch Fitbit's competition.Investors in Fitbit and Apple might need to listen in to Tim Cook's comments, in that case.Apple shares are seesawing Thursday. Cook will look to deliver on the positivity Wall Street has laid out on earnings. Keeping estimates at their currently lofty heights might depend on it.Load-Date: November 2, 2018End of Document

THE FIRST CHINA-JAPAN THIRD-PARTY MARKET COOPERATION FORUM HELD IN BEIJINGStates News ServiceOctober 28, 2018 SundayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 630 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: BEIJING, China BodyThe following information was released by the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China:On October 26, the first China-Japan Third-Party Market Cooperation Forum was successfully held in Beijing. Premier Li Keqiang and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe attended the forum and delivered speeches. Director of the Development and Reform Commission He Lifeng, Minister of Commerce Zhong Shan and Japanese Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Hiroshige Seko also attended the forum and delivered speeches.Minister Zhong Shan said that this year marks the 40th anniversary of the signing of the China-Japan Treaty of Peace and Friendship. The pragmatic cooperation between the two sides has embraced new opportunities. President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe reached an important consensus on carrying out third-party market cooperation under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative. During Prime Minister Li Keqiang's visit to Japan in May this year, the two sides signed a memorandum on the third-party market cooperation between Chinese and Japanese enterprises. The China-Japan third-party market cooperation will open up new paths for the pragmatic cooperation between the two countries, bring opportunities to the two countries and third parties, and make new contributions to promoting prosperity in this region and to world economic stability.Zhongshan made three suggestions on China-Japan third-party market cooperation. First, we should innovate the model of open and win-win cooperation. We should follow the principle of "enterprises playing the key role, market-based operation, government guidance, and mutual trust and benefit" to explore the prior areas and key fields of the third-party market cooperation. Second, we should implement policies and measures on trade connectivity. We should build more trade promotion platforms, guide strong enterprises to conduct trade and investment cooperation in host countries, and develop new trade modes such as cross-border e-commerce. Third, we should establish a long-term support and promotion mechanism. We will give play to the role of economic organizations and trade promotion agencies of the two countries, build information sharing platforms and training mechanisms, and bridge the cooperation between the two countries by organizing meetings, fairs and joint exhibitions.Minister Hiroshige Seko said that Japan-China economic and trade relations are in a critical period of transiting from competition to cooperation, and this forum will become a new starting point for Japan-China economic cooperation and development. In the future, Japan is willing to work together with China to promote high quality cooperation projects that meet international standards, and to discuss projects with cooperative potential such as the Eastern Economic Corridor.The China-Japan Third-Party Market Cooperation Forum is co-hosted by China's Ministry of Commerce, China's National Development and Reform Commission, Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, and Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It provides a platform for the governments and the private sectors of the two countries to conduct exchanges on third-party market cooperation. More than 1,000 representatives from the Chinese and Japanese governments, economic organizations and enterprises attended the forum. The two sides held theme discussions through four sub-forums on transportation and logistics, energy and environmental protection, industrial upgrading and financial support, and regional development to promote pragmatic cooperation and projects matchmaking between enterprises. During the forum, the two sides signed 52 cooperation agreements, including infrastructure, finance, logistics, and information technology.Load-Date: October 30, 2018End of Document

Honeywell And Sichuan Airlines Group Collaborate to Promote Education in China's Liangshan AreaTargeted News ServiceNovember 15, 2018 Thursday 1:17 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 651 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: SHANGHAI, China BodyHoneywell Aerospace, a division of Honeywell International, issued the following news release:Volunteers from Honeywell (NYSE: HON) Aerospace and Sichuan Airlines Group have created two new high-tech learning centers as part of Honeywell's Hometown Solutions Program. Located in the hinterlands of Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province, the two multi-purpose learning centers feature 50 computers, projectors and other digital teaching equipment. The beneficiaries of this new technology will be 4,600 students from the Wayan Village Central School and Yuexi County Wenxing Elementary School.As a part of the project, volunteers installed and revamped the schools' electric circuit and network facilities, providing the students in the Greater Liangshan area with the tools needed to advance their education and connect them with students from around the world."Since 2015 Sichuan Airlines Group has been meticulously executing plans for poverty-alleviation and education-assistance in Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture in line with its master plan and the circumstances in Yuexi County," said Li Haiying, president of Sichuan Airlines Group. "We are pleased to see an increasing number of enterprises like Honeywell who are willing to fulfill their corporate social responsibility by participating in poverty-alleviation work in Liangshan Prefecture."For a decade, Honeywell has been fulfilling its corporate social responsibility in China through its Hometown Solutions Program, and this latest collaboration with Sichuan Airlines comes in response to a rallying call for poverty-alleviation efforts from the Chinese government. Both companies elected to improve education in one of China's poorest regions by providing modern teaching equipment. The multi-purpose learning center will provide local students with a modern learning environment that can help them acquire skills for operating computers and accessing the Internet.Since its incorporation more than 32 years ago, Sichuan Airlines Group has grown to become one of the leading airlines in China. The business has been meticulously undertaking poverty-alleviation work in fulfillment of its responsibility as a state-owned enterprise, and with Honeywell, has agreed to explore new options and platforms for social benefit."We are motivated by Sichuan Airlines Group in its efforts and contributions in the Sichuan Province, and are honored to partner with them to provide quality teaching resources to children in the Greater Liangshan region," said Steven Lien, president of Honeywell Aerospace Asia-Pacific. "With our common ideals, collaboration between Honeywell and Sichuan Airlines will no doubt expand from our business-related partnership to regional benefits that expose those in rural areas to the opportunities to learn and bring the world a little bit closer each day."Honeywell's Hometown Solution program in China is focused on bringing educational resources to rural areas and encouraging children to pursue a lifelong path of education and learning. During the past 10 years, employees of Honeywell Aerospace have traveled to places such as Mianyang (Sichuan), Lhasa (Tibet), Shuangjiang (Yunnan) and Erdos (Inner Mongolia), donating nearly 31,000 books and over 150 computers to numerous schools. Over 23,700 local students have benefited from Honeywell's contributions.Honeywell Hometown Solutions is the company's corporate citizenship initiative, which focuses on five areas of vital importance: Science &#38; Math Education, Family Safety &#38; Security, Housing &#38; Shelter, Habitat &#38; Conservation, and Humanitarian Relief. Together with leading public and non-profit institutions, Honeywell has developed powerful programs to address needs in the communities it serves.

US restricts Chinese chipmaker from buying American partsCNN WireOctober 29, 2018 Monday 8:48 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 374 wordsByline: By Julia Horowitz, CNN BusinessDateline: NEW YORK (CNN Business) BodyNEW YORK (CNN Business) --  The United States is restricting exports to a state-backed Chinese company that makes semiconductors, the latest escalation in Washington's trade fight with Beijing.On Monday, the US Commerce Department said Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Company would not be able to buy components from American companies without a special license.The export ban was put in place because Fujian Jinhua "poses a significant risk of becoming involved in activities that are contrary to the national security interests of the United States," the agency said."When a foreign company engages in activity contrary to our national security interests, we will take strong action to protect our national security," Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement.Ross said the ban will limit the company's ability to "threaten the supply chain for essential components in our military systems."The move comes as the United States and China are locked in a standoff over trade, market access and the transfer of technology secrets. It could add strain to an already tense bilateral relationship. Negotiations have reportedly stalled ahead of a planned meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the upcoming G20 summit in Argentina.Earlier this year, the Trump administration put an export ban on ZTE, one of China's biggest tech companies. The agency said that ZTE (ZTCOF) lied to American officials about punishing employees who violated US sanctions against North Korea and Iran. The ban, which became a flashpoint between the two nations, was lifted in July after ZTE paid a $1 billion fine and agreed to oversight measures.The Commerce Department action comes after Micron Technology, a memory chip maker in Idaho, accused Fujian Jinhua of stealing its trade secrets in a federal lawsuit last December. Fujian Jinhua filed a countersuit against Micron in Chinese court in January.Fujian Jinhua, based in East China's Fujian province, was founded in 2016 and has financial backing from the provincial government, according to Chinese state media. It's building a $5.7 billion chip factory in the region.TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved.Load-Date: October 30, 2018End of Document

The students will spend 12 days in China, also traveling to Shanghai and Chengdu. They will see The Great Wall, Tiananmen Square, the Forbidden City, the Jade Buddha Temple and more. Some Vikings basketball players from King will practice with and play against the basketball teams from schools in Shanghai and Beijing.Last summer, Dr. Chosson, Director of Global Education, Micah Hauben, Dean of Athletics, and Siying Ma, World Languages Faculty, went to Beijing to prepare for our students March trip. The group visited domestic Chinese and International schools in Shanghai and Beijing to research for the program.erin.kayata@stamfordadvocate.com___ (c)2018 The Advocate (Stamford, Conn.)

Global market rout; Blaming the Fed; BMW ups its China stakeCNN WireOctober 11, 2018 Thursday 9:02 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 481 wordsByline: By Ivana Kottasová, CNN BusinessDateline: LONDON (CNN Business) BodyLONDON (CNN Business) --  1. Markets head for more losses: US stock futures were lower, pointing to another day of losses on Wall Street.Tech stocks including Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL), Snap (SNAP) and Amazon (AMZN) were among the biggest losers in premarket trading. Meanwhile, a sharp drop in US stocks on Wednesday spread to global markets. The pain was most severe in Asia, where benchmark indexes in Hong Kong and Tokyo shed over 3.5%. The Shanghai Composite closed down 5.2%.European markets opened with losses of roughly 1%.On Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 832 points, or 3.2%. The S&P 500 was down 3.3% and the Nasdaq tumbled 4.1%.2. The blame game: Analysts say a combination of factors, including higher interest rates and worries about the trade war, were responsible for the sell-off.US rates have risen rapidly, which led to spiking bond yields. As bonds become more attractive to investors looking for returns, stocks suffer. Some think the Federal Reserve is too aggressive in its approach. President Donald Trump is one of them He blasted the cent on Wednesday as "crazy." "The Fed is making a mistake," Trump told reporters as he arrived for a rally in Erie, Pennsylvania. "They're so tight. I think the Fed has gone crazy."However, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he didn't think the Federal Reserve triggered the rout in US stocks.He called the market drop "a normal correction.""I don't think there was any new news that came out of the Fed today that wasn't there beforehand," Mnuchin said Thursday morning in an interview in Bali, Indonesia.3. BMW in China: BMW (BAMXF) is taking control over its business in China, the first international carmaker to do so since the Chinese government moved earlier this year to relax ownership restrictions.The German company said it will pay (EURO)3.6 billion ($4.2 billion) to take control over its joint venture with Brilliance China Automotive Holdings.Its stake will increase by 25% to 75%, and the deal is expected to close in 2022.4.
