JUSTICE NEWSStates News ServiceDecember 20, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 961 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, D.C. BodyThe following information was released by the U.S. Department of Justice:Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein Announces Charges Against Chinese HackersWashington, DCUnited States~Thursday, December 20, 2018I am honored to be joined by FBI Director Chris Wray, National Security Division Assistant Attorney General John Demers, and Southern District of New York U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman.Today, the Department of Justice is announcing a criminal indictment of two computer hackers associated with the Chinese government. The charges include conspiracy to commit computer intrusions against dozens of companies in the United States and around the world. As with all American criminal charges, individual defendants are presumed innocent unless proven guilty in a court of law.This case is significant because the defendants are accused of targeting and compromising Managed Service Providers, or MSPs. MSPs are firms that other companies trust to store, process, and protect commercial data, including intellectual property and other confidential business information. When hackers gain access to MSPs, they can steal sensitive business information that gives competitors an unfair advantage.The indictment alleges that defendants worked for a group known to cyber security experts as APT-10. These groups are designated as APTs, or Advanced Persistent Threats, because they use malware to gain access to computer networks and exfiltrate data over an extended period of time.These defendants allegedly compromised MSP clients in at least a dozen countries. The victims included companies in banking and finance, telecommunications and consumer electronics, medical equipment, packaging, manufacturing, consulting, healthcare, biotechnology, automotive, oil and gas exploration, and mining.The defendants allegedly committed these crimes in association with a Chinese intelligence service known as the Ministry of State Security.This is not the first time the Department of Justice has accused Chinese state actors and associates of stealing commercial information. Since the indictment of five uniformed members of the People's Liberation Army in 2014, our Department has repeatedly cast a spotlight on Chinese state-sponsored criminal activity targeting U.S. companies.More than 90 percent of the Department's cases alleging economic espionage over the past seven years involve China. More than two-thirds of the Department's cases involving thefts of trade secrets are connected to China. In the last few months of this year, our Department has announced charges in three cases alleging crimes committed at the behest of a branch of the Chinese Ministry of State Security.It is unacceptable that we continue to uncover cybercrime committed by China against other nations. In 2015, China promised to stop stealing trade secrets and other confidential business information through computer hacking "with the intent of providing competitive advantages to companies or commercial sectors." The activity alleged in this indictment violates the commitment that China made to members of the international community.We want China to cease illegal cyber activities and honor its commitment to the international community, but the evidence suggests that China may not intend to live up to its promises.For example, the Chinese industrial policy, known as "Made in China 2025," lists ten strategic advanced manufacturing industries that the nation has targeted for promotion and development. Many of the companies allegedly targeted recently by Chinese defendants operate in sectors identified by that official policy. Whether through computer hackers operating from China, or Chinese nationals recruited to steal trade secrets from companies in other countries, the goal is the same: to dominate production in strategically important industries by stealing ideas from other nations.Today's charges mark an important step in revealing to the world China's continued practice of stealing commercial data. Responding to that conduct requires a strategic approach to the threats that China poses. That is why the Department of Justice recently announced an initiative to address the full range of threats. One tactic is to increase our enforcement efforts. Another is to conduct foreign investment reviews to protect against China improperly acquiring sensitive information. A third is to find ways to better protect our telecommunications networks.China stands accused of engaging in criminal activity that victimizes individuals and companies in the United States, violates our laws, and departs from international norms of responsible state behavior. Exposing these actions through the criminal justice system is a valuable tool. Faced with the detailed factual allegations released today, and the corroborating statements of other victimized nations, China will find it difficult to feign ignorance.America and many allies know what China is doing. We know why they are doing it. And in some cases, we even know which individual people are doing it in association with the Chinese government.The alleged criminals in this case are named Zhu Hua and Zhang Shilong. We hope the day will come when the defendants face justice under the rule of law in a federal courtroom.Until then, they and other hackers who steal from our companies for the apparent benefit of Chinese industries should remember: there is no free pass to violate American laws merely because they do so under the protection of a foreign state. The Department of Justice and the FBI will continue to use all available tools to respond to China's economic aggression and the threat that these actions pose to the prosperity and security of the United States and other nations that respect the rule of law.Load-Date: December 20, 2018End of Document

Sens. Cortez Masto, Markey, Brown Demand Answers From Administration Over Reports of Chinese Manipulation of U.S. TechnologyTargeted News ServiceOctober 12, 2018 Friday 5:53 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1129 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe office of Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nevada, issued the following news release:Senators Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) called on the Trump Administration to look into reports of Chinese government efforts to secretly manipulate U.S. technology. According to a October 4 Bloomberg Businessweek report, the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) "designed and manufactured" microchips to be surreptitiously planted within the motherboards of servers assembled by Super Micro Computer Inc. (also known as Supermicro). Elemental Technologies, which has contracts to sell technology to U.S. national security agencies, installed these motherboards in servers eventually used by the Central Intelligence Agency and the Department of Defense. This Chinese government effort also is alleged to have affected at least 30 companies.Noting the severity of the reports, the senators stated, "If true, the U.S. government servers, networks, and the sensitive information they contain could be compromised by a country that poses a significant strategic challenge to the United States. Additionally, any malicious PLA effort could have severe implications for the privacy of data for American consumers purchasing products from American technology firms."In their letter, the senators ask the Trump Administration to provide timely answers on the extent of U.S. government ownership of technology with Chinese government microchips, whether such devices are still in use, and any information concerning these microchips being implanted in technology that is utilized by U.S. companies.A copy of the letter is below:President Donald J. TrumpThe White House1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.Washington, D.C. 20500Dear President Trump:We write to express our serious concern regarding recent reports of Chinese government efforts to physically manipulate computer servers used in the United States to allow illicit access. Given the seriousness of the alleged activities, it is the responsibility of the administration to ensure that hardware in use throughout the U.S. government does not contain devices capable of infiltrating networks containing sensitive information. If the problems raised in this report are true, this raises important questions about what steps the government should take to protect commercial servers used by American companies. When reviewed in light of the full range of Chinese government activities to compromise U.S. national security, these reports demand a strong response by the administration.According to Bloomberg Businessweek, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) "designed and manufactured" microchips to be surreptitiously planted within the motherboards of servers assembled by Super Micro Computer Inc. (also known as Supermicro).[1] Elemental technologies, which has contracts to sell technology to U.S. national security agencies, installed these motherboards in servers eventually used by the Central Intelligence Agency and the Department of Defense. This Chinese government effort also is alleged to have affected at least 30 companies.We are concerned that the PLA tampering could have effects more extensive than has been reported. According to the media report, a former U.S. intelligence official familiar with the Supermicro case said that "attacking Supermicro motherboards is like attacking Windows. It's like attacking the whole world."[2] If true, the U.S. government servers, networks, and the sensitive information they contain could be compromised by a country that poses a significant strategic challenge to the United States. Additionally, any malicious PLA effort could have severe implications for the privacy of data for American consumers purchasing products from American technology firms.To better understand this ongoing issue, we respectfully request your response to the following questions by November 2, 2018.* Does the U.S. government own and operate any computers, servers, or other information technology hardware or systems that contain Supermicro motherboards?- As the Bloomberg report named the Central Intelligence Agency and the Department of Defense as government agencies that conducted business with Supermicro and Elemental, do those organizations continue to operate equipment from these companies? If so, what steps have been taken or are being taken to identify risk posed by hardware implants, and ultimately mitigating risk, including by removing affected equipment?- Are there other agencies that have purchased, or are planning to purchase, equipment that contain servers with Supermicro motherboards? If so, do the agencies continue to either use this equipment or proceed with the purchases?* If equipment from those companies are operating within U.S. agencies and private technology firms, what efforts has the U.S. government taken to ensure that they do not contain illicit microchips capable of compromising sensitive information about either the government, companies, or citizens?- When did the government become aware of the illicit microchips, and what steps did the government take to alert U.S. agencies and private technology firms?- Has the U.S. government conducted thorough investigations of motherboards and hardware from other companies that could also contain illicit microchips or other technologies designed to penetrate networks?- If not, what steps is the government taking to ensure that such devices do not make it into U.S. agencies, offices, or other official locations?- Recognizing the difficulty of detecting "hardware hacks," what is the U.S. government's long-term strategy to protect hardware from being penetrated by illicit microchips or similar technologies?* Do you know of other similar instances of the Chinese government infiltrating technology manufactured for end users in the United States?* If so, and given the implications this might have on hundreds of millions of Americans, what steps is the U.S. government taking regarding the findings of previous investigations - or plans for investigations responding to this report - and what effect this would have on private citizens' data?Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter.***[1] https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-america-s-top-companies?srnd=businessweek-v2&#38;utm_source=newsletter&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosam&#38;stream=top[2] https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-america-s-top-companies?srnd=businessweek-v2&#38;utm_source=newsletter&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosam&#38;stream=topCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6480458 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: October 13, 2018End of Document

AHEAD OF G-20 SUMMIT, BROWN JOINS SENATE DEMOCRATS IN URGING PRESIDENT TRUMP TO NOT BACK DOWN ON FURTHER ACTION AGAINST CHINA FOR SAKE OF WEAK AND MEANINGLESS AGREEMENTStates News ServiceNovember 28, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 742 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown:U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) today joined Senators Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) in releasing a new letter urging President Trump to stay aggressive in his approach should China fail to make meaningful concessions at the G-20 summit this week. The letter comes following recent news reports that despite the United States' efforts to raise tariffs and challenge China on the international stage, China has not offered to make any structural reforms to their trade practices regarding the use of government subsidies to boost its emerging industries, technology transfers, and espionage that result in the theft and extortion of U.S. intellectual property, flooding the American market with cheap dumped goods, and allowing United States companies to compete freely in their market.Furthermore, a report released this month from U.S. Trade Representative Lighthizer highlights that China has continued its predatory trade practices, which include the Chinese government's efforts to steal and extort U.S. intellectual property and rising incidences of Chinese state-sponsored cyber-attacks despite diplomatic agreements to cease such attacks. In light of China's behavior, the senators stress the importance of continuing to apply pressure on China and not relenting in order to reach an agreement at the G-20. The Senators noted that should China fail to make meaningful concessions, a G-20 agreement will give way to long-term consequences for American jobs, innovation, and long-term economic prosperity.The Senators' letter to President Trump can be found below:November 28th, 2018President Donald TrumpThe White House1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NWWashington, DC 20500Dear President Trump:For years, we have called for a tougher approach with China on trade.

However, we have seen disturbing reports that you may be considering backing down on further action against China in order to reach an agreement at the G-20. We urge you to stand firm against China if meaningful concessions are not made. American jobs, American innovation, and long-term American economic prosperity are at stake.News reports indicate that in recent trade negotiations China has not offered to make structural reforms that are necessary for the U.S. to alter our current trade enforcement efforts. China has not made concessions on its use of massive government subsidies to boost its emerging industries. They do not allow U.S. companies to freely compete in their markets. They dump cheap, and too often dangerously shoddy, goods into our markets. They continue the abusive practice of technology transfers and trade espionage that threaten our intellectual property and know-how.As highlighted in a report this month from U.S. Trade Representative Lighthizer, China has not fundamentally altered its predatory trade practices that were the impetus for the initial 301 tariffs. Notably, the report highlights that China's government continues its efforts to steal and extort U.S. intellectual property. The report finds rising incidences of Chinese state-sponsored cyber-attacks in spite of years of diplomatic agreements to stop such attacks. In light of this activity, it is important that the U.S. not make any deal that fails to meaningfully address this predatory behavior.U.S. industries are poised to produce good-paying jobs by selling to consumers around the world, but they will increasingly rely on the protection of their intellectual property abroad and a level global playing field to compete. China's predatory practices are the biggest threat to these industries and American jobs. As China's economy continues to grow, these problems will only become more difficult to address.Again, while we hope that talks with China will achieve meaningful results for U.S. workers, we urge you to not back down for the sake of a weak and meaningless agreement should China fail to make real concessions.Sincerely,Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY)U.S. Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR), Ranking Member, Senate Committee on FinanceU.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs###Load-Date: November 28, 2018End of Document

Huawei is the driving force behind China's technological ambitionsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 16, 2018 SundayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 573 wordsBody       Huawei closed the third quarter of the year with a market share of 15%, surpassed only by Samsung. Just two years earlier, it had about 9% of the market.  The surprising arrest of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies, set off a political bomb in the company and heightened a key risk: that more and more countries put their "switches", "routers" and blacklisted phones because of growing fears that they can be kidnapped by foreign spies.  However, within the Huawei headquarters in Shenzhen, a stealthy group of engineers works without worrying about these risks. Engineers are focused on the following: a series of artificial intelligence, cloud computing and chip technologies that are crucial to China's national priorities and the future of Huawei. As the trade war unfolds, China's government is pushing to create an industry less dependent on semiconductors and cutting-edge US software.  Meng's arrest, far from diminishing these ambitions, will accelerate the fall of this "silicon curtain" when the US and China will no longer supply chips to each other, Gus Richard, an analyst at Northland Capital Markets, wrote in a recent report. "Huawei is the icon of the rise of China's industrial power," wrote the same analyst.  Although a Canadian court has granted bail to Meng, the manager is expected to remain in the Vancouver area pending a possible extradition to the US on charges of fraud.  The company is investing great resources in state-of-the-art technology in an attempt to replicate the success it has had in other areas. Over the past decade, the privately held company has quietly become a titan in networking and telecommunications equipment, now behind only Cisco Systems, headquartered in San Jose, California.  Next, Huawei entered the smartphone market and, surprising most analysts, outperformed Apple's market share earlier this year. In the third quarter of the year, the Chinese company had 15% of the world's share, behind only Samsung Electronics, according to IDC data. Just two years earlier, it had about 9% of the market.  Huawei's technical expertise, coupled with its ties to top-level companies and the Chinese government, could create another surprise in a field that many consider to be the backbone of future technology.  These ambitions fit the government's goals. President Xi Jinping wants China to be a self-sustaining leader in semiconductors - and Huawei is showing that this is possible. Xi wants China to have a global presence - and Huawei has. Xi wants China to move from basic production to more profitable industries, with benefits for the country - and Huawei as well.  Huawei's Enterprise Business Group, which sells smartphones and networks, sells components and services for Internet-connected devices, smart cities and cloud products. The company will bill more than $ 10 billion this year, about a tenth of the company's overall total, Qiu Heng, the division's marketing director, said in an interview in November.  The company expects corporate sales to double every two years. This means that the unit would bill $ 100 billion in 2025, a year set by the Chinese government to achieve independence in technology production. And these projections do not contemplate US business - Qiu saidEstimates for its division exclude the US, where Huawei is a political outcast.  (Original text: Inside Huawei: The Driving Force of China's Tech Aspirations) Load-Date: December 16, 2018End of Document

GROWING EVIDENCE FORCED CHINA TO ACKNOWLEDGE XINJIANG POLITICAL 'RE-EDUCATION CAMPS': RESEARCHERStates News ServiceOctober 31, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1195 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:After more than a year of denying the existence of political "re-education camps" in northwest China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), a vast buildout of a system housing as many as a million Uyghurs has forced Beijing to acknowledge the facilities and justify them to the international community, according to a camp researcher based in Canada.Beginning in April 2017, Uyghurs accused of harboring "strong religious views" and "politically incorrect" ideas have been jailed or detained in re-education camps throughout the XUAR, where members of the ethnic group have long complained of pervasive discrimination, religious repression, and cultural suppression under Chinese rule.While Beijing initially denied the existence of such camps, the Uyghur chairman of Xinjiang's provincial government, Shohrat Zakir, told China's official Xinhua news agency earlier this month that the facilities are an effective tool to protect the country from terrorism and provide vocational training for Uyghurs.According to Zakir, Uyghurs and other ethnic Muslims in the region are taught Mandarin at the camps, as well as important vocational skills and lessons on Chinese law, all while being provided with free meals in comfortable living conditions, and that they are free to come and go as they like.Reporting by RFA and other media organizations, however, has shown that those in the camps are detained against their will, routinely face rough treatment at the hands of their overseers, and endure poor diets and unhygienic conditions in the often overcrowded facilities.Shawn Zhang, a law student at the University of British Columbia, has compiled a blog list of 59 re-education camps he confirmed the existence of by researching government tenders and using information found in the documents to locate the facilities through satellite imagery on Google Maps. He has also identified 16 sites he believes to be camps, but is seeking additional documentation that confirms them as such.Speaking to RFA's Uyghur Service, Zhang said that growing evidence of the camps, which are believed to hold or have held more than 1 million people, have made Chinese authorities "see that they can't hide it" from the international community, and led Beijing to change its tune in mid-October."It's different than 30 or 40 years ago when there was no internet and no satellite images, whereas now you have so many satellite images and the Chinese government also published so many documents that have descriptions of these camps," he said."They see that it is very difficult to hide all this information now, so I think they find that denying it maybe makes them look even more suspicious because they [appear to] want to hide the facts. For the Chinese government, maybe it is more effective to admit to these camps but to use some excuses such as counter-terrorism to justify it." Tracking camps Zhang told RFA that he became interested in tracking down re-education camps in late April, after reading about Uyghurs living overseas whose family members had gone missing back in the XUAR, but said he was initially skeptical."So I did some research myself, searching for keywords through Google, and I found some tender notices about this kind of camp," he said."Some of [the notices] had locations, so I followed the information and I found some of the camps ... Usually in Xinjiang's rural areas, there aren't very large construction sites, so when you see that you can tell it is a camp. In most of them there are wire fences inside the camps in front of buildings. It's very rare in Xinjiang that these kinds of buildings will have wire fences surrounding ... the entrances."Zhang noted that according to China's official explanation, there are only re-education camps at the county level and above in the XUAR, but he said that through his research he had found that "even villages and small towns" have detention and political indoctrination centers."You need to pay good attention to detail, because there isn't much information in government documents," he said, adding that the camps can be difficult to locate."The Chinese government often builds the camps in the suburbs. These suburbs are often newly built, so the streets have no names on Google Maps ... You need to find the names of the streets from the government documents."But while Zhang has located dozens of camps since he began documenting them earlier this year, he said the facilities are becoming much more difficult to find."The problem is that the Chinese government is deleting all information about the re-education camps from the internet, so I haven't been able to find a tender notice since at least August or so," he explained. Growing scrutiny Western governments have increasingly drawn attention to the camp network, where Adrian Zenz, a lecturer in social research methods at the Germany-based European School of Culture and Theology, has said that some 1.1 million people are or have been detainedequating to 10 to 11 percent of the adult Muslim population of the XUAR.U.S. State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert recently said the U.S. government was "deeply troubled" by the crackdown on Uyghurs, while U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley described it earlier this month as "the largest internment of civilians in the world today" and "straight out of George Orwell," during a speech at the Chiefs of Defense Conference Dinner in Washington.Next week in Geneva, China is likely to face a grilling on the Uyghur camps from some Western countries at the UN Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of its human rights record.According to Zhang, by acknowledging the existence of the camps, but portraying them in a way that suggests they have been established to help improve the lives of ethnic Uyghurs in the XUAR, the government is putting on a "performance to convince outsiders."But Zhang said that according to what he has uncovered in his research, "it is almost impossible to provide such activities" as vocational training, because the camps lack the infrastructure to do so.Instead, he said, the camps serve as indoctrination centers that the Chinese government is using to achieve its "ultimate goal" of "fully assimilating Uyghurs into the Chinese identity.""The Chinese government thinks that separatism in Xinjiang is a result of Uyghurs' own identity," he said."When one [minority] group keeps their own identity apart from the Chinese people, the Chinese government may think it is very dangerous. They think it will lead to separatism. So I think their ultimate goal is to transform Uyghur people into ordinary Chinese."But Zhang cautioned against the approach of forcing Uyghurs to conform to Chinese culture."In my opinion, this kind of coercion hasn't succeeded in the past, because it is impossible to convince a group of people when they aren't voluntarily taking part," he said."It may lead to more instability or even more violence because when so many people suffer this kind of tragedy, some become more extremist."

China Expands Its Surveillance Model By Training Other GovernmentsUSNEWS.comNovember 1, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 U.S. News & World Report All Rights ReservedSection: CIVIC; Best Countries; Vol.; No.Length: 1013 wordsByline: Sintia RaduHighlight: Beijing faces new criticism for being the world's worst abuser of online freedom and for training other nations on regulating the internet.BodyThe past year has witnessed increasingly severe tests for online privacy and freedom. From the Cambridge Analytica scandal to numerous other data breaches affecting millions of people worldwide, the internet has increasingly become a power playground for numerous individuals, companies and governments trying to corrupt democratic principles and manipulate information to their own advantage. While democracies around the world are struggling with how to balance online free speech and data privacy, authoritarian governments investing heavily in technology seem to be capitalizing on the West's concerns. China is ranked as the world's worst abuser of internet freedom, according to a new report by Freedom House, a Washington-based think tank conducting research on advocacy and democracy. And now other countries are turning to Beijing to seek guidance on how to conduct online censorship and surveillance, according to the report, which evaluates personal freedom on the internet and digital authoritarianism. A total of 36 countries, including            Thailand, the            Philippines,            Saudi Arabia and the            United Arab Emirates, have undergone training sessions and two- to three-week seminars with Chinese officials on topics such as new media and information management. "This year, Beijing took steps to propagate its model abroad by conducting large-scale trainings of foreign officials, providing technology to authoritarian governments, and demanding that international companies abide by its content regulations even when operating outside of China," says the 2018 "Freedom of the Net" report that was released on Thursday. The countries that have sought training from Chinese officials stretch from Asia to South America, from Africa to the Middle East and into Eastern Europe. They include: Bangladesh, Cambodia,  India,            Indonesia,            Myanmar,            Pakistan, the Philippines,            Singapore,            Sri Lanka, Thailand,            Vietnam,            Belarus, Georgia,            Russia,            Brazil, Venezuela,            Egypt,            Iran,            Jordan,            Lebanon, Libya,            Morocco,            Saudi Arabia, Syria, United Arab Emirates,             Angola, Ethiopia, The Gambia,            Kenya, Malawi,            Nigeria, Rwanda,            South Africa, Sudan, Zambia, Zimbabwe. "While it is not always clear what transpires during such seminars, a training for Vietnamese officials in April 2017 was followed in 2018 by the introduction of a cybersecurity law that closely mimics Chinese law characterized by extreme censorship and the heavy use of automated surveillance systems," say the report's authors. In addition, Chinese companies supplied telecommunications hardware, advanced facial-recognition technology, and data-analytics tools to various governments accused of human rights violations. This is particularly concerning, say the authors of the report, because China routinely violates individual online freedom through censorship and surveillance systems. In 2018, the country has been singled out for using facial recognition techniques in order to monitor one of its religious minorities in the West, as well implementing a so-called            social credit score based on data that the government collects about its citizens and uses to rank them for potential benefits or opportunities. "The internet can be a real tool for repression and we are seeing this in China," says Michael Chertoff, chairperson of the board of trustees at Freedom House. As China expands its military strength and economic and political clout beyond its borders, questions arise over whether the government will one day leverage its international influence for more surveillance. [ MORE:Countries' actions on internet spark growing privacy worries.] "Companies like Huawei are now helping to build large parts of the IT infrastructure in Latin America, Asia, and even in the EU," Chertoff says. "The concern here is that this opens up the potential for exploiting information in these countries by having technological backdoors which can then be used by the Chinese government to collect intelligence." Internet Freedom Declines WorldwideOf the 65 countries that the annual "Freedom of the Net" study examines, internet freedom declined in 26 nations from June 2017 to May 2018. With China in the lead, a series of nations reported problems related to internet access, freedom of expression and privacy issues, including Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Russia. In 12 of those nations, the declines were related to elections, disinformation, censorship, technical attacks, or arrests of people critical of the governments before elections. Countries such as the Philippines and Kenya have been downgraded from "free" to "partly free" due to content manipulation and cyberattacks. "The internet, once seen as a liberating technology, is increasingly being used to disrupt democracies as opposed to destabilizing dictatorships," says Michael Abramowitz, president of Freedom House. [ MORE:Confusion over Europe's data privacy law.] Internet freedom also declined in the United States, after the Federal Communications Commission            repealed net neutrality rules that would have prevented internet providers from prioritizing traffic based on type, source and destination. At the opposite end of the spectrum, 19 nations registered improvements in internet freedom, including Armenia and the Gambia. Armenia is now considered a free country, moving up from the "partly free" category thanks to political changes prompted by mobile applications, media platforms and live-streaming services during the April "Velvet Revolution."Gambia jumped to "partly free" from "not free" after the ousting of dictator Yahya Jammeh in early 2017 that lifted a series of restrictions.Sintia Radu covers international affairs and technology for U.S. News & World Report.

If they find him guilty of corruption he will be executed. Meanwhile, in Venezuela they "kill" an opposition councilor.  Meng Hongwei disappeared on September 25. The last thing that was learned about him is that he landed in China, coming from France. His wife received two text messages from her husband before losing contact. In the first, Meng attached the image of a knife, in sign that he was in danger of death, and in the second he told him to wait for a call that he never received.  The wife reported Meng's disappearance to the French authorities last Thursday. Then, the woman began to receive threats, reason why she and her children had to benefit from a program of protection of the Police.  Now, after a statement issued at midnight on Sunday, it is known that the Chinese government has held him and is being investigated for "violations of the law", specifically corruption. Interpol confirmed through its Twitter account to have received, also on Sunday, the resignation with immediate effect of Meng as its president.  The head of Interpol has been held by the Chinese government for more than two weeks, he is incommunicado, he writes to his wife that he is in danger of death, his family is threatened, but the International Police only refers to the fact that Meng resigned and they already have a date to appoint a new president. No one is going to condemn the Chinese government's actions?  Meanwhile, in Venezuela the tyranny of Maduro ensures that on Monday Councilman Fernando Albán threw himself from a tenth floor. Albán had been arrested on Friday accused of having participated in what the tyranny has called "attempted assassination against Maduro."  Yesterday in the afternoon the illegal tax imposed by the Constituent, Tarek William Saab, reported that the councilman "committed suicide" by launching from the tenth floor of the headquarters of the Bolivarian Intelligence Service (Sebin), after requesting permission to go to the bathroom.  In the News of the Day, we comment on the kidnapping of the Interpol chief and the "suicide" of the opposition councilor, two facts that show the brutality with which the governments of China and Venezuela, now very friendly, terrorize their population.  The head of Interpol was missing, now China confesses that it has retained it.

CHINA'S NEW CHALLENGE: MAINTAINING THE TRADE TRUCEStates News ServiceDecember 12, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1332 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Center for the National Interest (former the Nixon Center):A full-blown trade war between the world's two largest economies would likely produce an unpredictable and disruptive an outcome.by Dean ChengOne of the storied elements of World War I is the Christmas truce of 1914. Along the Western Front from Switzerland to the English Channel, forces from the two sides called informal truces, bringing a temporary halt to the fighting. In many places, the two sides exchanged mementoes and rations. In a few cases, there were even football (soccer) matches.In the ongoing trade clashes between the United States and the People's Republic of China (PRC), President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping have called a similar, short-term truce. At the G-20 summit in Argentina, the United States agreed that it would suspend, temporarily, the next iteration of tariffs, scheduled for implementation by January 1. China, meanwhile, made nonspecific promises of substantial increases in purchases of American agricultural, energy, and industrial products.Most importantly, the two sides agreed to engage in negotiations toward more systemic improvements over the next ninety days. Could this truce mark the end of the burgeoning trade war, and bring tariffs and other obstacles back down?Not necessarily.First, it remains to be seen just what the Chinese commitments will actually entail. According to Larry Kudlow, a key advisor to President Trump, the Chinese have committed to purchasing some $1.2 trillion in additional goods. In addition, China could immediately reduce both tariff and non-tariff barriers to accelerate sales of American goods.Another element would seem to be an end to PRC opposition to certain corporate deals. For example, Chinese officials indicated that Beijing would likely cease opposing the acquisition of Dutch microchip manufacturer NXP by the American company Qualcomm. Chinese opposition had led to the cancellation of the proposed merger in July (and there is no indication that the end of Chinese opposition would revive the deal).But nearly a week after the G-20 summit, specifics remain sparse. Past Chinese behavior should serve as a cautionary tale. The 2015 Xi-Obama summit saw the two sides ostensibly reach two agreements. One was that China would not militarize the South China Sea region. The other was that China would cease economic cyber espionage. Three years later, it is quite clear that Beijing's interpretation of "not militarizing" differs radically from the United States or the rest of the region, as there are now surface-to-air missiles and artillery emplacements, as well as military radars, on a number of Chinese-occupied features. Similarly, while there was a noticeable reduction in cyber economic espionage by the Chinese People's Liberation Army, it now appears that many of these efforts are sustained by different Chinese entities.Thus, the lack of specific Chinese commitments, as well as the problems of reconciling what the Chinese mean versus what the American side believes was promised, should limit optimism about the eventual outcome.Indeed, even the Chinese announcement regarding Qualcomm and NXP highlights that Chinese opposition was due to political, rather than economic, considerations. This bodes ill for the prospect of reaching a long-term solution by the end of the announced ninety days. Many of the differences between the United States and the PRC that have precipitated the current trade clash are rooted in similar political, rather than economic, factors. Resolving them, then, will involve more than just having China purchase more American goods. Rather, it will require significant changes to Chinese policywhich in turn will likely require more than ninety days, even if Beijing is amenable.This problem is evident in the charges laid out by the U.S. Trade Representative's office, for example, in its recent 301 filing . The main American complaints are:- Chinese use of joint ventures and other foreign ownership restrictions to compel technology transfer from American companies,- Chinese employment of nonmarket pressures to compel American companies to license their technology to Chinese firms on a disadvantageous basis,- Chinese government direction of investment and other forms of acquisition of American technologies and companies, in order to access American technology and intellectual property, and- Chinese government support for the acquisition of technology, intellectual property, sensitive commercial information, and trade secrets through computer network exploitation.At base, these complaints are consistently about the Chinese government's policies that support acquisition of American technology. But these are neither local whims nor the product of individual bureaucratic satrapies. Instead, as the charges note, these are broad policies, undertaken with central direction, i.e., the policies of the overall Chinese government, as part of their broader trade and industrial policies.These policies are part of a concerted, longstanding Chinese effort to catch up with the West. Every major Chinese leader since Deng Xiaoping has made it clear that he wants to improve China's scientific, industrial, and general economic capacities. Deng Xiaoping, for example, authorized "Plan 863," also known as the "State High-Tech Development Plan," in 1986 to promote investment and growth in key technology areas such as aerospace, advanced materials, and telecommunications. Hu Jintao made the phrase "indigenous innovation" a hallmark of his leadership era, and authorized the creation of the "Medium and Long-Term Plan for Development of Science and Technology." Xi Jinping's "Made in China 2025" is therefore a continuation of longstanding Chinese efforts, rather than a new effort.Xi himself, at the 19th Party Congress, noted that China by 2020 will have already improved the overall state of its economic and technological base, to the point where it is a "moderately prosperous society." For the next three decades, his goals include:- By 2035, to realize socialist modernization, to make China a major source of innovation and advance its economy to the first tier of nations;- By 2049 (the hundredth anniversary of the founding of the PRC), to make China a leading nation in terms of most aspects of national power and global impact (including military capability).Xi is hardly likely to halt any of the policies implemented in pursuit of these goals. Even if he were inclined to modify them, it is unlikely that the Chinese bureaucracy and state could be shifted in ninety days. If the Chinese are going to maintain their economic and technology development focus, yet actually respect intellectual property and refrain from ferreting out sensitive commercial and other information, then this will require alternative approaches that can hardly be formulated overnight.Nonetheless, the establishment of this ninety-day truce period offers the hope that both sides, but especially the PRC, will take steps to de-escalate the situation. The Chinese need to recognize that their rapacity will no longer be toleratednot by the United States, and not by other key partners such as Europe. The growing interest in creating local counterparts to the American Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) is a reaction to consistent Chinese violations of the norms associated with the international trading system.The United States, meanwhile, needs to sustain pressure on the Chinese, but not go so far as to precipitate a full-blown trade war. Beijing is able to make major purchases of American agricultural and industrial goods, in part because it is not a market economy. It is therefore in the American interest to push for systemic changes (at a minimum, greater respect for global intellectual property rights), rather than settle for momentary increases in sales to China that ultimately do not shift Chinese policy.Load-Date: December 13, 2018End of Document

Trump caves in to China's demands on tariffs during G20 meetingStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeDecember 5, 2018 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: WORLD-NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 637 wordsByline: Steven ClarkeBodyUnited States exports of cars and light trucks to China were worth US$9.5 billion in 2017 and have dropped off significantly since China imposed its retaliatory tariffs over the summer that gave exporters in Europe and Japan a significant advantage. "Farmers, I LOVE YOU!"US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Saturday agreed to suspend any new tariffs in the escalating trade war between the world's two largest economies. Trump said, however, "We are dealing from great strength, but China likewise has much to gain if and when a deal is completed".Trump alluded - possibly inadvertently - to the "Great Leap Forward", Mao Zedong's disastrous campaign to rapidly industrialize China's agrarian economy, which historians believe led to the deaths of tens of millions of people in the Great Chinese Famine. China also agreed to boost its purchases of agricultural and industrial goods to reduce its trade imbalance with the US, she said. First off, China and the USA have a lot of disagreements, and three months is not a lot of time to solve them - especially since the two countries have been at it for over a year.China's official statement underlines that no higher tariffs will be imposed on January 1, 2019, but it does not mention the 90-day deadline.But stark differences in the language used byWashington and Beijing in announcing the deal could spell trouble as both countries begin negotiations aimed at striking a permanent end to trade tensions. BMW, Tesla, and Ford were among the firms hit hard as collateral damage in the trade war.That's surely good news, and it's the first indication since the U.S.Trump agreed to hold off on his threat to slap 25 per cent tariffs on Dollars 200 billion worth of Chinese goods from January 1, leaving them at the current 10 per cent rate.But the White House also said the existing 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods would be lifted to 25 percent if no deal was reached within 90 days, once again setting the clock ticking. And the threat to slap tariffs on everything China exports to the USA will presumably be back on the table as well.Sixers' Markelle Fultz diagnosed with physical injuryThoracic outlet syndrome involves compression or irritation in the thoracic outlet (area between lower neck and upper chest). In a follow-up tweet, Wojnarowski mentioned that the syndrome effecting Fultz is treatable with physical therapy.The US president did not send any subsequent tweets Sunday explaining which auto tariffs would be removed, and which would be reduced.Xi's government has offered to alter details but rejects pressure to discard blueprints such as "Made in China 2025", which calls for creation of champions in artificial intelligence, electric cars and other industries. If Trump wants a win from this battle, he'll need to understand that Xi won't give in easily.Still, Kuijs said Chinese leaders might have hinted to the Americans of possible concessions. Xi's government complains Chinese companies are treated unfairly in American security reviews of proposed corporate acquisitions, even though almost all deals are approved unchanged."I think the Chinese are hoping that political and economic factors will converge to convince the Trump administration to lower the bar somewhat so that China can meet some of the requirements", Glaser said.Cui put the odds of an agreement at "higher than 50 percent" but said he had no idea how long that might take.Resolving the tariff war between the US and China is seen as crucial for American agriculture, particularly soybeans, America's largest export to China, which accounted for $12.4 billion in sales previous year. They have to open up China to the United States.Without that, hardliners inWashington "will urge Trump to resume escalation", they said.Load-Date: December 5, 2018End of Document

SEN. CRUZ TO GOOGLE CHIEF PRIVACY OFFICER: IS THERE A PROJECT DRAGONFLY?States News ServiceOctober 1, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1001 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Texas Senator Ted Cruz:Directs line of questioning to Google Chief Privacy Officer on a secret Google project for mainland ChinaOctober 1, 2018202-228-7561WASHINGTON, D.C. U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation participated in a hearing last week focused on how leading technology companies handle American consumers privacy and security. During the hearing, Sen. Cruz questioned Keith Enright, Googles Chief Privacy Officer, to uncover the truth regarding Googles Project Dragonfly, which has been reported in the press to be a search engine designed to censor search results at the demands of the Chinese government.After a cyberattack compromised the Gmail accounts of dozens of Chinese human rights advocates, Google decided in March of 2010 to shut down its operations in China, Sen. Cruz said. At the time Google released a statement that said quote: We want as many people in the world as possible to have access to our services, including users in mainland China, yet the Chinese government has been crystal clear throughout our discussions that self-censorship is a non-negotiable legal requirement. Despite taking this principled stand in 2010, its been reported last month that Google has been secretly developing a search engine for China as part of a project known as Dragonfly. Are those reports accurate?Several news outlets covered Sen. Cruzs line of questioning at the hearing. Selected new coverage is below:WIRED: Congress Challenges Google On China. Google Falls ShortGoogles first public attempt to explain its reported interest in entering the Chinese market failed to appease critical members of Congress at a Senate Commerce Committee hearing on Wednesday. [] Googles chief privacy officer, Keith Enright, came to the hearing prepared to give a carefully scripted explanation addressing these reports, remarks that would neither confirm nor deny their accuracy. [] Enright repeated the term not close to launching several more times throughout the hearing, before Senator Ted Cruz of Texas finally stopped him short. Youre saying youre not close to launching. Im asking [...] is [Project Dragonfly] a project to develop a search engine in China? I didnt ask timing of launch. I asked what it is, the Republican said. Enright only went so far as to confirm that Project Dragonfly does in fact exist. But he declined to expound upon its purpose, insisting he was not clear on the contours of what is in scope or out of scope for that project. That, of course, is the problem. Its not just that Enright came off as cagey. The far bigger issue is that his claims about taking privacy seriously and not knowing much about the project can't peacefully coexist. If Google's chief privacy officer isn't actively engaged in these conversations, it undermines the idea that Google is carefully considering the ramifications of this work.BBC News: (VIDEO) Googles privacy chief quizzed on China plan by Ted CruzGoogle's privacy chief has confirmed that work on Project Dragonfly is ongoing but has denied that the firm is close to launching a search engine in China as a result. Keith Enright was quizzed about the effort by Senator Ted Cruz towards the end of a Senate Committee hearing into data privacy. Leaks about the effort have raised concerns that the tech firm might help the Chinese state censor its citizens' online activities, with Google's own employees among those to have raised concern.Venture Beat: Google confirms Dragonfly project in Senate hearing, dodges questions on China plansDuring a Wednesday Senate hearing, Googles chief privacy officer Keith Enright confirmed that the company has a project codenamed Dragonfly reported to be a censored search engine thats being prepared to launch in China but didnt say what the project covers. I am not clear on the contours of what is in scope or out of scope for that project, Enright said in response to a question from Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX). It appears to be the first time that someone from Google has confirmed that the company has a project codenamed Dragonfly, after nearly two months of speculation about it. [] Senator Cruz also asked Enright if in your opinion, does China engage in censoring its citizens, to which Enright responded, As the privacy representative for Google, Im not sure that I have an informed opinion on that question.CNN Tech: Google grilled over 'Project Dragonfly' at Senate hearing on data privacyGoogle has finally admitted that a Project Dragonfly is indeed in the works. But that's about all a Google executive was willing to divulge Wednesday about the codenamed plan, which has been widely reported to be a search product the company is developing for China one that would need to comply with government censorship. [] Enright did not link Dragonfly to the reports about developing a Chinese search engine. He name-dropped it only when pressed about the existence of a Project Dragonfly by Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican. I am not clear on the contours of what is in scope or out of scope for that project, Enright added. When Cruz prodded Enright for more information, the privacy officer would only reiterate what CEO Sundar Pichai has already said about the rumored product.The Wall Street Journal: Tech Executives Warn of Overregulation in Privacy PushGoogle, which was chided by senators when it declined to appear at a hearing earlier this month, also was grilled Wednesday on the companys reported plans to develop a search engine adhering to Chinas internet censors. [] Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Tex.) pressed Mr. Enright on whether there is any truth to reports that the China project, known internally as Project Dragonfly, is working towards developing a censored search engine. There is a Project Dragonfly, Mr. Enright said. My understanding is that we are not close to launching a search product in China and whether we eventually would or could remains unclear.###Load-Date: October 1, 2018End of Document

SolarWorld Americas Testifies Before ITC on Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic CellsTargeted News ServiceNovember 27, 2018 Tuesday 5:47 PM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1313 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe U.S. International Trade Commission issued the following testimony by John Boken, CEO of SolarWorld Americas on crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells:"Good Morning. I am John Boken, CEO of SolarWorld Americas, Inc. For the last decade, SolarWorld has been the largest solar manufacturer in North America, with more than 40 years of experience in the industry. While this is my first time before the Commission, SolarWorld has appeared here before, seeking relief from dumped and subsidized solar imports from China and other countries. I appreciate the opportunity to be here today to explain why the antidumping and countervailing duty orders on solar cells and modules from China remain absolutely critical for the U.S. solar industry."I should start by noting that I am not a solar industry expert. My experience is in restructuring and turning around companies in a variety of industries. I was hired as an adviser to SolarWorld in October 2017, which was right around the time that this Commission recommended relief for the domestic industry in the solar safeguards case. I then became a board member of SolarWorld in January 2018, and became CEO effective May 14 of this year. I have worked on more than 75 corporate restructurings throughout my career, in a variety of industries. I have certainly seen my share of troubled companies and distressed industries. However, I can say with certainty that I have never seen a situation where imports from China and other countries have had such a significant negative impact on an entire domestic industry as they have had in this industry -- solar cells and modules."These should be boom times for the domestic solar industry. The United States is installing solar energy at an impressive rate. We are in the midst of a solar, green technology revolution. SolarWorld prepared very carefully for this explosion in demand, spending tens of millions of dollars to expand and upgrade its production facilities, and was poised to take advantage of the growth in the U.S. market. I understand that several Commissioners, and many members of the Staff, have had the opportunity to tour our facilities in Hillsboro, Oregon as part of prior investigations, and have seen these investments in action. Among other steps, we added a new 72-cell module production line, built an extensive installer network, and invested in cutting-edge monocrystalline capability -- the exact kind of solar cells that the market is strongly demanding. To assure consumers that solar power is an intelligent investment, SolarWorld was the first company in the industry to offer a 25-year, and then a 30-year, warranty on our products. We have done everything possible to establish ourselves as the industry leader in the United States."But -- at least until trade relief was imposed -- we were unable to reap the benefits of our investments because of unfairly traded imports. For example, I mentioned the new investment in the Hillsboro facility to produce 72-cell modules. Even with demand in the U.S. surging, we were never able to operate this production line at anywhere near full capacity. Import volumes have been too high and prices are simply too low for us to compete. The import surge resulted from the severe global overcapacity in solar manufacturing, principally centered in China and heavily subsidized by the Chinese government. Chinese overcapacity and the surge in U.S. imports led to a total collapse in U.S. solar prices in recent years. Solar prices have become totally decoupled from raw material costs, as producers in China tried frantically to keep all this capacity in production."SolarWorld struggled to compete for years with unfair imports, especially those from Chinese producers. The company's former corporate parent -- SolarWorld AG in Germany -- had to file for insolvency as a result of these market pressures. Even one of the oldest and most respected solar producers in the world could not compete with the Chinese government and a global race to the bottom. But these trade remedy orders -- as well as another set of orders in the Solar II case and recent safeguard duties -- were instrumental in SolarWorld Americas' survival. Without these orders, the volumes of Chinese imports would have been significantly higher, and their prices would have been substantially lower. And now, with the discipline of the orders in place, the manufacturing assets of SolarWorld were acquired in October (less than two months ago) and are now known as SunPower Manufacturing Oregon -- who you will also hear from today. SunPower is in the process of upgrading the Hillsboro, Oregon facility, and is transferring production equipment from Mexico to the United States. I am extremely encouraged by the level of activity and investment going on right now -- as we speak. With continuing trade relief, this acquisition will allow Sunpower Manufacturing Oregon to continue manufacturing solar products in the United States. I can tell you that while it will not be easy, these domestic solar manufacturing operations have a real opportunity not just to survive but to re-emerge as an industry and global leader."A variety of other companies have also recently announced investments in new U.S. solar cell and module manufacturing facilities. For example, new module production facilities are being planned in Alabama, Florida and Georgia, as well as capacity expansions in Texas and a shuttered plant restarting in Minnesota. We are seeing the beginning of a real recovery for this important, 21st century industry. But if these orders were revoked, Chinese solar imports would likely overtake the U.S. market once again, and any chance for industry recovery would be destroyed."Indeed, while recovery is on the horizon, the domestic industry remains highly vulnerable to injury if the orders are revoked. While the orders have allowed SolarWorld Americas to get through this difficult period, the Hillsboro manufacturing operations remain in a precarious state. Without the orders, there will be nothing to stop Chinese producers from sending higher volumes of dumped and subsidized solar products to the United States. While Chinese cell and module producers have massive excess capacities, the Chinese government is reducing installation incentives and slowing solar demand in China. At the same time, the U.S. solar market is one of the most attractive markets in the world. If the antidumping and countervailing duty orders were revoked, it is highly likely that Chinese producers would immediately increase their shipments here, and U.S. imports from China would skyrocket. Given current market conditions, any increase in Chinese solar imports would immediately impact the Hillsboro operations and quickly devastate the industry once again."The solar safeguard duties imposed this February, while helpful and also extremely important for the domestic industry, are not sufficient alone to prevent a renewed surge in Chinese solar imports. The safeguard tariffs are in place for a limited amount of time and will decrease by five percentage points each year. The first 2.5 gigawatts of solar cells annually are completely exempt from the tariffs. In other words, the only trade relief that we have on solar cells is the antidumping and countervailing duty cases. While the safeguard remedies are helpful, they do not give our industry the same level of relief as the antidumping and countervailing duty orders under review. These orders are fundamental aspects of the trade relief benefiting U.S. solar producers."As a result, on behalf of SolarWorld Americas, I urge the Commission to leave in place the antidumping and countervailing duty orders on solar cells and modules from China. Together, we can help ensure the recovery of the U.S. solar manufacturing industry."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6544809 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: December 9, 2018End of Document

Bush, who died Friday.Trump boarded Air Force One late Saturday en route to Washington.___6:15 p.m.President Donald Trump is meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping as the countries look for ways to ease an escalating trade war.Trump suggested to reporters just before the sit-down that at "some point" it could yield "something that will be good for China and good for the United States." He didn't elaborate.Trump and Xi were set to talk over dinner Saturday at a summit of world leaders in Argentina.The two are trying to negotiate the end to a trade conflict that is rattling financial markets and threatening the world economy. Both sides have raised tariffs on billions of dollars of each country's goods.Trump said they would also discuss the opioid crisis. He said he hopes China will criminalize fentanyl, the synthetic form of opioids largely shipped from China.___3:50 p.m.A senior White House official says a joint G-20 statement meets many U.S. objectives, most importantly reforming the World Trade Organization.President Donald Trump and the other leaders signed the document at the end of a two-day summit of rich and developing nations held in Argentina.The U.S. supported the language on the WTO but did not sign on to a commitment to support the Paris Climate Accord, which Trump is exiting.All the other countries agreed to support the statement.The White House official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, also noted language on workforce development and women's economic development and said China committed to doing infrastructure financing on "transparent terms."-By Catherine Lucey___3:20 p.m.President Donald Trump is meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan amid a global outcry over the death of a U.S.-based columnist who was killed at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.Erdogan has sought to keep international pressure on Saudi Arabia over the slaying in October of Jamal Khashoggi. Trump has said there is no definitive evidence that Saudi Arabia's crown prince is complicit in the killing. He says the kingdom is an important ally that has helped keep oil prices low.U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that the crown prince must have at least known about the plot to kill Khashoggi.The two leaders are meeting at the Group of 20 rich and developing nations in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The meeting is closed to reporters.___2:40 p.m.President Donald Trump held an "informal conversation" with Russian President Vladimir Putin Friday.That's according to White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who says the chat occurred during the dinner program at the Group of 20 summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina.Sanders says that as is typical at multilateral events, the president and first lady had several informal conversations with world leaders at the dinner, including Putin.Trump and Putin were supposed to have a formal bilateral meeting Saturday at the summit, but Trump called it off Thursday amid spiking tensions over Russia's seizure of three Ukrainian naval vessels and their crews last weekend.___2:15 p.m.President Donald Trump is talking trade and other hot-button international issues with German Chancellor Angela Merkel - a leader he says is "highly respected by everybody, including me."They are meeting during the Group of 20 summit of rich and developing nations being held in Argentina.Trump and Merkel will discuss trade, the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, and Moscow's violations of a landmark nuclear arms treaty that Trump plans to exit.Many in Europe have looked to Merkel as Trump has called into question traditional trans-Atlantic ties with his announcements of trade tariffs, repeated criticism of European contributions to NATO and other issues. Merkel has walked a fine line, criticizing some of Trump's decisions while emphasizing that a good relationship with Washington is central to her government.___2:10 p.m.President Donald Trump says he expressed his "best wishes" to the Bush family after the death of former President George H.W.

Thank you so much. We will see you in a little bit. Good morning, everyone. Thank you so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is, Wednesday, December 12th. Your top stories right now just before 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.There's a leadership challenge to report British Prime Minister Theresa May facing a no-confidence vote today. We will take you to London live for the very latest on what's next. And what the vote could mean for the future of Britain's exit from the European Union coming up this morning right here. Markets are rallying ahead of all of that. Rally mode right now, Dow Industrials up almost 200 points right now, almost one percent higher. And S&P 500 also up 22 points, almost one percent, and the NASDAQ with the 72- point rally this morning, up better than one percent this morning. Very strong, firm tone on stocks.After a choppy session yesterday in Wall Street, take a look, Dow Industrials, at the end of the day, gave up 53 points. The major indices finishing little change, but the Dow swung 570 points between the high and the low of the day. So, even though we ended up with just a 53-point decline, look at where this market was yesterday. It was wild once again. Another volatile session with the Dow Industrials coming off of the lows by the close.In Europe this morning, gains across the board. Take a look. FT-100 up better than one percent, 70 points higher, CAC Quarante in Paris up one and two-thirds percent, and the DAX Index in Germany up better than one percent, as you can see, a hundred and seven points higher in Germany. In Asia overnight, markets posted gains. Take a look. Best performer was Japan. Nikkei Average up better than two percent overnight. Meanwhile, rising China tensions to report, a Canadian court granting Huawei CFO bail. But now, a Former Canadian Diplomat is in detention in Beijing. Is this a tit for tat?President Trump says he will step in over Huawei if needed. What it means for the trade truce coming up right here. Shutdown showdown, a fiery meeting at the White House yesterday. Oh, gosh. Did you see it? It was over the border wall, President Trump doubled down on his calls to shut down the government next week if he does not get that $5 billion to build the wall.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I'll tell you what.SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER: We disagree.TRUMP: I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck, because the people of this country don't want criminals and people that have lots of problems and drugs pouring into our country.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Oh, yes. It was fiery, all right. The fallout coming up later this hour. Then there's this, Tencent Music making its market debut. The company raised more than $1 billion in an IPO, but pricing, at the bottom of the range in the face of really wild volatile markets. We'll get into all of that. All those stories coming up this morning. And joining me to break it all down, FOX Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the Wall Street Journal's Global Economics Editor, Jon Hilsenrath, and Benchmark Managing Partner, Kevin Kelly. Great to see everybody this morning.KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK: Yes. Great to be here. The tenant thing, I think, is pretty interesting. They're IPO, they're coming out at the bottom of the range, but they're still trading at 43 times last quarter earnings when their competitors, which are trading on the NASDAQ, are trading at 14 times, so we'll see how it ends trading because it's been really tough for a lot of these streaming services, including Spotify that have had a really rough quarter. Spotify is down 30 percent from their peak.BARTIROMO: So this is really a streaming story, not a IPO story?KELLY: Yes. Actually. So, Tencent already owns -- Tencent owns the company. They IPO'ed this. Spotify actually own nine percent of the company, and it's coming out of the valuation at about $21.3 billion, but 90 percent of the revenue comes from live streaming tips, which is pretty interesting where it's different than the Spotify model, where people watch performers live and then top them. And so with the --BARTIROMO: Ah.KELLY: -- slowdown in China, earnings have come down pretty significantly.BARTIROMO: All right. We'll be -- we'll be watching that. Meanwhile, markets as volatile as ever.JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: We have a lot of news, on Brexit, on trade, on a potential government shutdown.BARTIROMO: Right.HILSENRATH: And the markets are trying to digest all that. It seems these days --DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: And -- but you're here because of the Fed, Jon. We book you because of the Federal Reserve. I'm just joking.HILSENRATH: And --MCDOWELL: That's another big tent-pole worry.BARTIROMO: Of course. Of course.HILSENRATH: I forgot that one. We forgot the Fed.MCDOWELL: Sorry.HILSENRATH: And we're going to -- they're raising interest rates.BARTIROMO: You didn't -- you didn't put that in the headlines.MCDOWELL: Yes. Exactly.HILSENRATH: And we actually had the -- we had the President again yesterday saying it would be a mistake for Jerome Powell to go ahead and raise interest rates next week. He's probably going to do it. Powell earns his independent stripes when he defies the President.BARTIROMO: And that meeting next week, the 17th.HILSENRATH: Yes. The 19th.BARTIROMO: the 19th.HILSENRATH: The 19th.BARTIROMO: All right. The Fed meeting next week. That's really baked into the cake in terms of another rate hike at this point. Joining the conversation coming up, White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley is hear, Kentucky Congressman and Financial Services Committee member, Andy Barr joining us. Former FDIC Chairman, Sheila Bair, is with us this morning, along with Former Philadelphia Federal Reserve President, Charles Plosser, is here. He's going to give us his insight on the Fed, plus FOX News Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano as well. Don't miss a moment of it. We got a big three hours coming up.We kick it off right here with our top story, and that is chaos in the U.K. Lawmakers from British Prime Minister Theresa May's party triggering a no- confidence vote to oust her from power. Ashley Webster on the ground in London right now with the very latest there. Ashley, good morning to you.ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: Yes. Good morning, Maria. I think this had been coming and after Theresa May delayed that vote on the meaningful vote on her Brexit deal Monday. It was pretty much writing on the wall. So, about six hours from now, Conservative Party members will report to Committee Room 14 in the House of Commons in between 6:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. U.K. time will cast their ballots. Three hundred and fifteen Conservative Party members, meaning that Theresa May has to secure a minimum of a hundred and fifteen-eight votes to keep her job. She spoke outside Downing Street earlier this morning and said, "If you change me as the leader of the party, you're going to have to push back the timetable for Brexit. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)THERESA MAY, PRIME MINISTER OF THE UNITED KINGDOM: The new leader wouldn't have time to renegotiate a withdrawal agreement and get the legislation through parliament by the 29th of March. So, one of their first acts would have to be extending or rescinding Article 50, delaying or even stopping Brexit when people want us to get on with it.(END VIDEO CLIP)WEBSTER: Well, the latest betting numbers and you know the Brits love to bet, Paddy Power reporting 2-1 on the Theresa May wins this vote. We've seen a long line of Tory MPs come out this morning, Maria, saying they back the Prime Minister. Of course, what they say in public and what they do in private could be another thing, but she is expected by some to survive this confidence vote.BARTIROMO: Wow. But it is close. I mean she's hanging on by her fingernails at this point, Ashley.WEBSTER: Yes.BARTIROMO: Thanks very much. Ashley Webster is on the ground in London.WEBSTER: Sure.BARTIROMO: And, Dagen, her speech, pretty much, is an outright acknowledgment that she's on the brink here.MCDOWELL: Right, and the -- and the big question in terms of business is what will businesses do in Britain preparing for the -- literally the unknown in terms of Britain leaving the E.U. Wall Street Journal, two days ago, wrote editorial about the Brexit. It was called "The road to a Bad Brexit" and the problem is, is that kind of people were hoping, when Britain's voted to leave the E.U., that there would be this kind of Margaret Thatcher renaissance of reform in terms of the economy, and Britain, and it didn't happen. And so if businesses lose trade benefits of E.U. membership that offset some of the efficiency losses produced by bad domestic policy, so in some ways, for the time-being, this is a lose-lose for businesses in Britain.KELLY: Well, the interesting aspect -- it was in the Journal yesterday so you -- maybe you can touch base on this, but she highlighted the March 29th date, which is critical because their economy is dependent on professional services, mostly in the financial realm. And if they -- if they're not able to get something done by the March 29th deadline, they're going to have a real problem on their custody side of their business and so there's a lot of clearing that happens over there when you think about commodities, as well as a lot of options.BARTIROMO: Oh, that's a good point. Yes.KELLY: Right. So think of the (INAUDIBLE) so the problem is, is that you're going to have a complete disruption in the supply chain of the commodities market, that's why she highlighted that within. She's like, "A new deal with have to happen. We're going to lose all this business to Frankfurt and Paris.HILSENRATH: You know, so Dagen and I were talking before the opening about, like, why should Americans should care about this?BARTIROMO: Right.HILSENRATH: They've been hearing about it for months and months and months now. I want to talk about Theresa's why. First of all, the global economy is slowing right now and there's a lot of -- there are a lot of problems bubbling up in Europe. It looked like the beginning of the year like Europe was on an upturn, but Italy's got a lot of fiscal problems now. The U.K. is having a lot of problems with Brexit. Germany is slowing down. It's a big exporter to China. You know, for the viewer out there, what does this mean for me, the global economy is slowing, and that's one of the reasons why stocks are so turbulent.BARTIROMO: Yes.HILSENRATH: The other thing is --MCDOWELL: And France is literally on fire.HILSENRATH: Fire, that's right, yeah.MCDOWELL: And you have Emmanuel Macron, the global elitist trying to now be a populist and say, "I'm going to meet with mayors across the country," which is what you should have been doing in the first place.BARTIROMO: Right. Right.MCDOWELL: So -- and I want to point out, there's -- there was the terror attack as well.HILSENRATH: Right. Right.BARTIROMO: Yes.HILSENRATH: And then the other thing I'd say is there's this -- around the world right now, leaders are rewriting the rules of globalization and Donald Trump is kind of the leader of that movement. What we're seeing in the U.K. is that rewriting the rules of globalization is hard and turbulent. Politically turbulent, economically turbulent, and financially turbulent on the entire system.BARTIROMO: Yes.HILSENRATH: This is case in point.BARTIROMO: You're absolutely right. And the last time I checked, there was coupling. You know, people would say, "Oh, you know, there's the decoupling, and even though Europe is under pressure, the U.S. won't get hit," no, it just doesn't work that way. The U.S. would get hit if we're seeing this kind of turmoil in Europe.HILSENRATH: And this is the really big question for 2019, because in 2018, our economy charged ahead while Europe slowed down, but a lot of economists that we talked to -- and people at the Fed that we talked to are saying, "We might not be able to keep this up, we might see the U.S. following the rest of the world in the slowdown in 2019." That changes the whole narrative for the markets.BARTIROMO: Particularly when you've got this trade turmoil. I mean, you know, China has agreed to reduce auto tariffs and purchase more American products like soybeans and other products. We knew this was coming, the agriculture products, but key differences between Washington and Beijing still remain.A Canadian court has granted bail to the CFO of Huawei, freeing her after more than a week in detention. This comes after as China detains Michael Kovrig, a Former Canadian Diplomat. So, China is detaining this Canadian diplomat. Kevin, is this a tit for tat?KELLY: It appears that way. We've certainly had a lot of companies issue letters to their executives telling them to be careful. You even had an accidental issue in Spy Cisco telling everybody to get out of China, which was pretty fascinating. This goes back to what's happening with ZTE, with Huawei, with the governments, too, where they're not wanting the equipment from these companies because there is spyware. So, the U.S., New Zealand, as well as Australia, are not going to be using Huawei equipment because of their conduct, as well as the technology, and then furthermore, SoftBank's even thinking about pulling out using Huawei's equipment in their (INAUDIBLE)MCDOWELL: But we have a rally that's in the making this morning.BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes.MCDOWELL: Why is that front page, The Wall Street Journal? It's their top story. China moves to soothe tensions. So, despite what's going on with Huawei and the problems there --BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.MCDOWELL: -- China is making a number of steps, according to the Washington -- The Wall Street Journal's reporting, reducing the auto tariffs and boosting purchases of soybeans and other crops. And that auto tariff is an issue. So it went -- it went down to 15 percent earlier this year. The tariffs on auto imports into China, and then it went back up to 40 percent as a retaliation on the U.S. It looks like right now that Lou Jiwei is saying that Beijing would reduce tariffs on U.S. autos back down to 15 percent. This is a big deal.BARTIROMO: Big deal.MCDOWELL: And you shouldn't overlook that.KELLY: Well, with the soybeans in there, they haven't addressed I.P. issues and corporate theft, so --HILSENRATH: Well, so this is --BARTIROMO: I know, but --MCDOWELL: This is baby steps.KELLY: These are easy moves. These are easy moves.BARTIROMO: Yes. One of the things --HILSENRATH: This is -- no, but this is what I was going to say, is this report by my colleagues, Bob Davis and Lingling Wei, who've been killing it on this story --MCDOWELL: Yes.HILSENRATH: -- suggests that the Chinese are starting to take that seriously, that they're starting to talk about, "All right, here's ways that we could tighten up --MCDOWELL: Right.HILSENRATH: on intellectual --BARTIROMO: That's a big deal.HILSENRATH: That, I think, was one of the most important things in this story to look at.BARTIROMO: Definitely.HILSENRATH: But what I don't understand is, on the one hand, we're pushing the Chinese to do that, on the other hand, the President is cutting China breaks first on ZTE and now he's talking about doing it on Huawei when it seemed like that was such an important front in this confrontation with China.BARTIROMO: One of -- one of the things that J.P. Morgan said yesterday in its morning note in terms of where this market is going is that they were positive on the stock market because they believe that the Huawei situation is separate from the trade situation. These are on separate tracks. I mean if that's the case, that his is a separate situation, then this sounds promising.KELLY: Right.HILSENRATH: Right.MCDOWELL: I've been -- I've just been a -- I'm critical of the way that some -- a lot of the trade issues have been handled, so I want to point out this morning that this is a -- it might be a baby step, Kevin, but it's an important one.BARTIROMO: Yes, it is.MCDOWELL: And it's one that will lift these markets right now.HILSENRATH: And it looks like the Chinese are starting to move from -- for most --MCDOWELL: Right.HILSENRATH: -- of 2018. They made a lot of promises and didn't move. It looks -- and I agree with you --KELLY: That's what we said on the WTO, right?HILSENRATH: -- on this skepticism.BARTIROMO: Yes.KELLY: Right? I mean they -- and they keep infringing -- there's all talk and then they do something different.HILSENRATH: Right.KELLY: Actions are different than the words.MCDOWELL: Listen, I'm Negative Nancy, and if I'm optimistic at least for the next three hours, then, you know what, the sun is shining and we're (INAUDIBLE) adults.HILSENRATH: I mean I think -- I think we do we have --BARTIROMO: There's no doubt about it.HILSENRATH: -- to be skeptical, but --BARTIROMO: This is positive development and that's why markets are rallying right now. The markets are seeing this. All right. We're going to talk more about this for sure. Then there's this, Google on the heel yesterday. Lawmakers grilling CEO Sundar Pichai yesterday over privacy concerns, alleged conservative bias, all of that coming up after this short break. And the Tencent, low-balling its IPO despite raising more than a billion dollars. More on the Chinese music sharing company's rock road toward going public, all right here next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A manhunt is underway this morning after the suspected terror attack in France. Cheryl Casone with the headlines now, Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, Maria, the gunman is still at large right now after killing three people in, yes, a suspected terror attack that happened at a Christmas market, in Strasbourg. Twelve more were wounded when the gunman opened fire on crowds at the famous market near the historic Strasbourg Cathedral. It's a very popular area this time of year. The gunman hijacked a taxi to escape and French officials say they have identified him, 29-year-old man is responsible. They add that this guy's got a criminal record. He was on a watch list for radicals, five others have been detained in connection with the shooting, but still the main gunman is still at large this morning.Well, back here at home, Google's CEO, Sundar Pichai survived a day of tough questions on Capitol Hill in his first public appearance before the House Judiciary Committee. Pichai defended his company against lawmakers that were skeptical about how Google handles privacy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. TED POE (R), TEXAS: Does google track my movement? Does Google, through this phone, know that I have moved here and moved over to the left? It's either yes or no.SUNDAR PICHAI, CEO, GOOGLE: Not by default. There may be a Google service which you've opted to use and if --POE: So Google knows that I am moving over there. It's not a trick question.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: That was one line of questioning. Pichai also denied allegations that Google has an anticonservative bias. Taking a look at Alphabet, the parent company of Google, the stock is actually pretty much flat for the year.Well, Verizon's media company oath, which includes Yahoo, AOL, and the Huffington Post, is worth almost nothing. Verizon has cut the value of Oath by $4 and a half billion. Verizon spent about $9 billion to create the Oath business and hoped the acquisitions of AOL and yahoo would make it a more powerful force in digital advertising. Taking a look at Verizon, the stock is up 11 percent year to date.And Tencent makes its market debut today. The Chinese music streaming company pricing the IPO at 13 bucks per share, but that is at the low end of the 13 to 15-dollar range that was expected. Still, this values the FBO at $21.3 billion, this makes it one of the largest IPO'S in the U.S. since Alibaba went public back in 2014. The stock is going to trade under the ticker TME on the New York Stock Exchange, Maria.BARTIROMO: All right.CASONE: That's all (INAUDIBLE)BARTIROMO: Cheryl, thank you so much. A lot going on this morning.MCDOWELL: Yes.BARTIROMO: What a busy morning. That Google hearing yesterday, got to get your take. When Jerry Nadler first came up and gave his opening statements, I think it was very clear that it was so partisan. I mean he really was basically saying there's nothing here in terms of conservative censorship, which is absolutely incorrect.MCDOWELL: No, based on The Wall Street Journal's reporting, among the many stories, Google workers discuss tweaking the search function to counter the travel ban. That was just one of the stories that The Journal has broken about what's going on at Google. Now, it didn't happen, but to say that there's no bias there, that Jerry --BARTIROMO: Oh, remember when -- remember the California Primary, Dagen, when you would Google California GOP and what would you come up with? Nazism in terms of one of the tenants of the GOP.MCDOWELL: Nadler called, said in his statement, "I must dispense with a completely illegitimate issue, which is the fantasy dreamed up by some conservatives at Google and other online platforms, have anticonservative bias. Who is the biggest donor to Jerry Nadler's campaign in 2018? Alphabet, parent company of Google.BARTIROMO: OK. All right.MCDOWELL: I checked that this morning.BARTIROMO: Very important point that you're making.MCDOWELL: Yes.BARTIROMO: These are incredibly huge donors for these guys.MCDOWELL: Oh, yeah.BARTIROMO: How are they going to be straight? How are they going to be, you know, not on one side if they're getting all this money from Google?MCDOWELL: Exactly. At least tell us -- at least tell us where the money is coming from.BARTIROMO: That should have been said yesterday.MCDOWELL: Yes.BARTIROMO: That's actually a good point. Coming up, global energy, how one company manages to provide power to more than a dozen countries across the world, next up.BARTIROMO: Well, the big business of power, AES Corporation operates in 15 countries, showing signs of growth. The company announcing it's raising its dividend this week, and the stock is up 45 percent so far this year. Joining me right now on a FOX Business exclusive is the CEO of AES, Andres Gluski. Good to see you, sir. Thanks so much for joining us. What is driving the stock right now?ANDRES GLUSKI, CEO, AES: Well, I think we've had a good year in terms of delivering on our results, on our forecast, but also we're growing. And one of the things that's unique about our company, not only is it one of the few international U.S. energy companies, but the fact that we're really combing what I call capacity with energy. Renewables provide you with energy, but they're not here 24/7. So, it's very important for consumers, for everyone, is how do you provide electricity with twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week?So what we're doing is really combing renewables with traditional sources of energy, and also with lithium ion batteries, the world leader in this technology, which allows you to put more renewables on the grid, but also have a better grid.BARTIROMO: I'm glad you mentioned battery, because we've been talking about this battery-growth story for a long time.GLUSKI: Uh-hmm.BARTIROMO: And I'm wondering if it is in fact resonating with businesses. I mean is that what you're seeing --GLUSKI: Right.BARTIROMO: -- in terms of the acceptance? I mean when you look at, for example, the electric car, we have been talking about the electric car for a long time.GLUSKI: Uh-hmm. Sure.BARTIROMO: And yet people are not buying it. They're buying SUVs, they're being -- buying the big cars. So, what's the story on battery technology?GLUSKI: Well, we started using lithium ion batteries for energy storage on a grid scale. So, this would not be something the consumer sees about 10 years ago, and so we today have more than 200 megawatts. We'll be building out to 500, we have it in 16 countries. So, for us, it's a proven technology. So, what you can do with the energy storage is that you can store, for example, you have a lot of solar during the middle of the day, you save it up and inject it when you need it.BARTIROMO: That's huge in terms of being able to --GLUSKI: Yes.BARTIROMO: -- inject it when you need it.GLUSKI: Yes. And it's going --BARTIROMO: And that's easy to do?GLUSKI: Yes. I mean that's what they do. It actually does it better than regular gas plants, because there you have a gas plant trying to do the speaking. It has to heat up. It takes a few, you know, minutes to heat up. This is instantaneous, and it's cheaper. So, it's actually competing in many places with -- well, actually competing without any subsidiaries for this. So, today, this is markets growing at a hundred percent a year. And this should be a very large market within five years.BARTIROMO: Fantastic. Earlier this year, you announced that you were teaming up with Siemens. Let's talk about that.GLUSKI: OK.BARTIROMO: You wanted to team up with Siemens to take on Tesla, which is - -GLUSKI: Right.BARTIROMO: -- which is important here because you're doing Tesla energy in the storage space. How's that going? Tell me about the growth story there.GLUSKI: Sure. Well, that's going very well. This year, we will hit several hundred million dollars of sales. It's a very good combination, Siemens and us, because we've been -- we really were out ahead of this curve. We were doing it, again, 10 years ago, we have proven models. We're on our fifth design today and so Siemens has the ability to sell in a hundred and sixty countries, is a hundred-year-old company with an excellent reputation. So, the combination of the two of us, we're in 16 countries today, but we have the capability to deliver this in a hundred and sixty countries.BARTIROMO: Wow.GLUSKI: So, that's going very well and I think we're both very happy with the JV.BARTIROMO: What is your reaction to what's gone on in the energy market in terms of oil prices dropping --GLUSKI: True.BARTIROMO: -- natural gas prices on the rise.GLUSKI: Right.BARTIROMO: What's behind these moves?GLUSKI: Well, it's very interesting. I think that the, you know, effects of the oil sector on our economy I think have changed very much. Certainly, in the electric sector in the States, it has almost no effect. But natural gas had been the big story the previous decade. So, we, for example, you know, have a lot of natural gas plants, we just inaugurated a new LNG Regasification Terminal in Panama, which will drastically change the energy sector of that country because it was very dependent on rainfall. And now with cheap natural gas from the U.S., years of drought, energy prices won't spike. It's also very good for the U.S. because it means hundreds of millions of dollars of annual exports of U.S. LNG.BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm. OK. So then that story is becoming increasingly important?GLUSKI: Yes, absolutely.BARTIROMO: It sure is. Andres, it's great to have you on the program.GLUSKI: Thank you very much, Maria,BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us.GLUSKI: OK.BARTIROMO: And I know that we met first 22 years ago.GLUSKI: That's right, when I was doing an IPO. I do.BARTIROMO: It's been a great story. Congrats. I -- so I interviewed you 22 years ago when you first went public.GLUSKI: That's right.BARTIROMO: There you go. Oh, Andres, it's great to see you. Thank you so much.GLUSKI: Thank you. Thank you.BARTIROMO: Andres Gluski joining us there, AES Corporation. Coming up, a tense sit-down yesterday at the White House, watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: If we don't get what we want, one way or the other, whether it's through you, through a military, through anything you want to call, I will shut down the government.SCHUMER: OK.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Whoa. Details on the showdown yesterday for the border wall funding between President Trump, Nancy Pelosi, and Chuck Schumer. It was quite the moment. And then the China connection, new details now on how China may be behind the recent Marriott data breach. We're looking at Marriott, Boeing, real china fingerprints on all of this, back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, good Wednesday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us this morning. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Wednesday, December 12th, your top stories right now, 6:32 a.m. on the East Coast.There is trouble for Theresa May this morning, the embattled British Prime Minister facing a confidence vote, no confidence vote, later today, over the U.K.'s plan to exit the European Union. Markets this morning in Europe are reacting, take a look.

We're going to tell you all the latest there.President Trump says he would intervene in the Huawei case, if it would help close a trade deal with China. Meanwhile, Wall Street is seeing these two stories on separate tracts, which has been a positive.Plus, caravan crisis, a migrant group demanding President Trump either let them in, or they say, we want $50,000 each, for us to turn around. So, either let us in the country, or we want the money, the President standing by the importance of funding the border wall in a meeting with Democratic leaders, yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: It's something the country needs, it's common sense. The country needs it. We need protection. We need border security. We need security from drugs that are pouring into our country. They're coming in right through that southern border.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: President Trump says that he is proud to shut down the government, in the name of border security.No Instagram filter here. Take a look, NASA's InSight lander, taking a selfie, from the surface of Mars, coming up. First selfie that you're going to see from Mars, we've got that story coming up, as well.But first, our top story this half an hour, shutdown showdown, President Trump in a heated exchange yesterday, in the Oval Office, with House and Senate Democratic leaders, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), MINORITY LEADER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: The fact is, you do not have the votes in the House.TRUMP: Nancy, I do. And we need border security. Nancy --PELOSI: Let's take the vote and we will find out.TRUMP: Nancy, we need border securities, very simple.SCHUMER: We have solutions that will pass the House and Senate, right now, and will not shut down the government, and that's what we're urging you to do, not threaten to shut down the government --TRUMP: But you don't want to shut down the government, Chuck.(CROSSTALK)SCHUMER: Because you can't get your way.TRUMP: The last time you shut it down, you got killed. When you look at these numbers of the effectiveness of our border security, and when you look at the job that we are doing --SCHUMER: You just said it is effective.TRUMP: Can I be -- can I tell you something?SCHUMER: Yes. You just said it's effective.TRUMP: Without a wall -- these are only areas we have the walls.SCHUMER: We want to do --TRUMP: When you have walls, Chuck, it's effective. Where you don't have walls, it is not effective. You can't have very good border security without the wall, no.PELOSI: That's not true. That is a political promise. Border security is a way to effectively honor our responses.SCHUMER: And the experts say you can do border security without a wall, which is wasteful and doesn't solve the problem.TRUMP: It totally solves the problem. Nancy, we've gained in the Senate. Excuse me, did we win the Senate? We won the Senate.SCHUMER: When the President brags that he won North Dakota and Indiana, he's in real trouble.TRUMP: I did.PELOSI: Let me say this --TRUMP: We did win.PELOSI: We're entering into a -- this kind of discussion in the public view.TRUMP: But it's not bad, Nancy. It's called transparency.SCHUMER: We disagree.TRUMP: I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck, because the people of this country don't want criminals and people that have lots of problems, and drugs pouring into our country.(END VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: Well, some of that was just for the cameras, basically. They knew the cameras were there. Joining us right now to talk more about that is Kentucky Congressman House Financial Services Committee Member, Andy Barr. Congressman, it's good to see you this morning, thanks so much for joining us.REP. ANDY BARR (R) KENTUCKY: Good morning, Maria.BARTIROMO: And that exchange, a little bit of a test for the rest of us, to see how the Democrats are going to be working with President Trump, in the coming two years, your reaction to what took place yesterday?BARR: I can -- I can tell you, House Republicans stand 100 percent with the President on this. We have a crisis at the southern border. The caravan that we recently saw, come to the southern border of the United States contained a verified number of 600 criminal migrants, including a special interest aliens.And clearly, we have a huge problem at the southern border with respect to the drug flows that are coming through the southern border of the United States, 80 percent of all of the heroin that is interdicted by the customs in border protection agency, comes from Mexico.Mexico remains the number one supplier of heroin into the United States. And we have seen a surge in Fentanyl, as well.So this is a -- this is a national security issue, it's a homeland security issue, it's a border security issue, and it's refresh to see a president and a political leader in Washington, take political accountability for putting border security and national security ahead of politics.BARTIROMO: Yes, but, I mean -- you know, the cameras were rolling, maybe Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer were aware of that and wanted to just say, you know, try to look tough, but you've got this caravan crisis going on. Lawmakers are discussing funding for the border wall. The migrant caravan is still trying to enter the United States with some members trying to bargain with the President.There is a report this morning, Congressman that says a group of migrants entered the United States consulate in Tijuana yesterday and with a message for the President. They said, either let us in, or you owe us $50,000 to turn around. Give us $50,000 and then maybe we'll turn around and go back home.BARR: That's ridiculous. We do not operate U.S. immigration law based on ransoms. That's not how we enforce U.S. immigration or protect the American people for that matter. The President is keeping his promise to the American people. The American people want border security, they want homeland security. They want to stop the flow of illegal drugs into our communities.In Kentucky, we have a serious problem. We have the fifth highest overdose mortality rate in the country. The Kentucky attorney general tells that a lot of this has to do with an unsecure southern border, and so does law enforcement in Kentucky. They want us --BARTIROMO: Yes.BARR: -- to secure the border and tactical infrastructure, like border barriers, physical barriers, they work, we know they work. But let me tell you what's going on here politically --BARTIROMO: OK.BARR: -- in Washington.BARTIROMO: Please do.BARR: What's going on, politically, is that Nancy Pelosi doesn't have the votes for speaker right now. What's going on is that the far extreme left- wing of the Democrat Party, the open-borders group, the abolish ICE group, they are in the ascendancy within the caucus, within the Democratic caucus.At the same time, there were a number of suburban Democrats who were recently elected, new Democrats, Blue Dog Democrats, who have pledged to support someone other than Nancy Pelosi. She does not have the votes to be speaker. And what's happening right now--BARTIROMO: Wow.BARR: -- is she and Senator Schumer are prioritizing Nancy Pelosi's political ambitions over national security. So we need to move on with this.BARTIROMO: She doesn't want to get anything done, because she doesn't want to make a bad move, because she needs the votes. Who are they supporting other than Nancy Pelosi, Congressman?BARR: Well, they don't have an alternative.BARTIROMO: OK.BARR: The Democratic caucus right now, is in political paralysis.BARTIROMO: Yes.BARR: Because Nancy Pelosi, obviously, has the majority of the support, but she will not, she's totally inflexible on border infrastructure and border security.BARTIROMO: Sure. Why would she want to do anything, Dagen?BARR: Correct.BARTIROMO: She doesn't have the votes for speakership. We're not going to know if she's a speaker until January.BARR: Right. And we need -- we should not operate government this way.BARTIROMO: Yes.BARR: This is a dysfunctional way to operate government. We shouldn't be prioritizing the political ambitions of one member of Congress over --BARTIROMO: Right. Yes, but how do you see it, Dagen?(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: The Republicans have done this President, zero favor --BARTIROMO: That's right.MCDOWELL: -- in terms of immigration, you did not pull funding from sanctuary cities in the omnibus spending bill, number one, and it was a $23.4 billion in border security. It was in a compromised immigration bill that basically was defeated, according to Journal, beneath the weight of a Republican Party feuding over the details.Now, the President has left scrambling for 5 billion for the wall. That's a Republican failure.BARR: Dagen, I do agree with you. It's frustrating for me as someone who voted for both versions of the Goodlatte McCaul bills, one that provided $25 billion for border security and another that provided $30 billion in authorization --BARTIROMO: Yes.BARR: -- for border security, so it's frustrating that it -- that it failed, but I can tell you this right now --BARTIROMO: Yes, real quick.BARR: -- in the waiting days of this Congress -- and the waiting days of this Congress, the Republicans are prepared to fully fund the remainder of the government. And by the way, it's not a government shutdown.BARTIROMO: I don't know if that goes with the Senate. I don't know if that goes with the Senate, Congressman.BARR: Well, but the House is prepared to pass a bill that funds the remainder of the government, including the $5 billion for the border wall infrastructure.BARTIROMO: All right, a lot of big decisions here. Congressman, it's good to see you this morning, thanks so much.BARR: Good to see you.BARTIROMO: Andy Barr.BARTIROMO: OK, the massive Marriott hack reportedly tied to China. Cheryl Casone with the details now, what a story, Cheryl.CASONE: Timing is everything, right, Maria? Investigators have reportedly traced the cyber-attack on the Marriott Hotel chain to hackers working on behalf of the Chinese government. The Wall Street Journal is reporting that personal information on 500 million guests at Marriott Starwood chain were obtained as part of Chinese intelligence gathering effort. Now, this comes that the Trump administration plans to target China's trade, cyber and economic policies possibly within the next few days. Shares of Marriott down 18 percent so far this year -- half a billion people caught up in that hack.And if a picture is worth a thousand words, what's the selfie taken on Mars worth, too, yet? Check this out: NASA's InSight lander taking its first selfie on the red planet. The selfie actually made up of 11 separate images since it landed on Mars on November 26th after travelling nearly seven months from Earth. It was a huge event for NASA. They hoped to get the lander to be able to study the internal structures of Mars and how the planet was actually formed, Maria. Back to you.BARTIROMO: All right. Cheryl, thank you so much. Quick break, and then wedding day luxury for a lot less than you think. We will introduce you to a pair of moms who help make a groomsmen suit shopping a little easier. Wait until you see this; great start-up, stay with us.BARTIROMO: All right, I want to show you this start-up right now. Luxury suits for men for less, The Groomsman Suit, founded by two moms offer stylish and high-quality suits and tuxedos for less than the cost of rentals. This is about weddings and beyond. It's projecting $8 million in sales. I spoke with Co-Founders, Jeanne Foley and Diana Ganz, they told me the inspiration came from Jeanne's own wedding. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)JEANNE FOLEY, FOUNDER, THE GROOMSMAN SUIT: We're planning a New Year's Eve wedding and we just decided tuxedos are the way to go and gave that task for my husband and said, make it happen. And so, he went to a big box store and went the rental route. And it wasn't really until after the wedding that I actually realized how much the guys had spent.DIANA GANZ, FOUNDER, THE GROOMSMAN SUIT: Yes, and Jeanne was the one that was returning the items the day after her own wedding. Which is like so --(LAUGHTER)GANZ: The logistics are poor on this rental option.FOLEY: But I'm so thankful I got the opportunity to do that and go through it because I realized there's this huge hole in the market for, really, affordable wearing wear, the guys can keep and own.GANZ: I mean, when you think about what women have, bridesmaids have the ultimate experience. You know, it's exciting -- you know, they get to go and group shop and they have so many options. And men -- for men, it's always been more of this, like, daunting, inconvenient and expensive process to get suited up for weddings. But really, suiting is not rocket science; I mean, that's really where Jeanne's background came into play. You know, she has a fashion design background and so, when she was outfitting her wedding and starting to see the price tag, it was like sticker shock.FOLEY: Yes, yes.BARTIROMO: Tell us what set you apart from other suit manufacturers?GANZ: Like, we have built the brand and the company as just -- not only having great product but being that reliable resource to couples when it comes time to planning the day.FOLEY: We're just making it really easy. The process, it's no-brainer. You visit our Web site, you pick out the option you like, set up your wedding group.GANZ: Coordinate your group.FOLEY: We take care of everything.BARTIROMO: And it's better than renting something that you have to go -- you don't know who was in it and -- you know, how old it is.FOLEY: Right. You're the first one to wear it.GANZ: Well, at The Groomsman Suit, too, our tuxedos are $194. So, often times, there are less than what you would pay for rental anyway, they're going to fit better because we carry one of the largest size ranges of any brand and you get to keep it.BARTIROMO: I love the baby jackets that I see.(LAUGHTER)FOLEY: Yes.BARTIROMO: We have these lined up, and some of the little baby jackets for little boys. It's so cute.FOLEY: Those are new to our line. We're actually launching those today. A junior line, kids' line from 2-T to 8 and we just realized that there are other brands weren't doing this. Guys -- people were having trouble outfitting the ring bearers.BARTIROMO: Look at that little jacket for a ring bearer, it's so suit. Actually, you also have this new brand of new colors.GANZ: Yes, that's exactly right.BARTIROMO: Yes, so you're getting -- expanding here.GANZ: Yes. We started with a very focused selections of suit in four colors. But now as we're getting bigger, we wanted to expand the product line a little bit, so we're adding charcoal gray -- right there -- and our light blue, which will be great for destination wedding season.BARTIROMO: Yes, the summer and warmer climates, what about accessories? It's not just suits, you've got accessories.FOLEY: Yes, so to not grow too fast and get too involved in accessories, we've partnered with some really, really amazing niche brands like J.J. Suspenders, for our suspenders. They do an awesome job. For our shoes, we actually were recently connected with a great company called Mark Nolan, and we're collaborating to do our own line of shoes through (INAUDIBLE), so those will be available very soon as well.GANZ: And throughout the process of expanding our catalog, we have really remained focused on keeping everything affordable. You know, we have -- we do not want to start adding these luxury items, our goal is to really help men look like a million bucks for a fraction of the cost.BARTIROMO: I love it. Congratulations, ladies, we love entrepreneurial stories and you guys are just knocking the cover off the ball.FOLEY: Thank you.GANZ: Thank you so much.BARTIROMO: Congrats. And the company is The Groomsman Suit. Check it out.(END VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: Jean Foley, Diana Ganz, check it out. Thank you so much for joining us. We're going to check futures right here because we are looking at a pretty good rally. Underway for markets this morning, we're expecting a gain at the start of trading this morning to the tune of 150 points or better, 168 points higher on futures on the Dow right now, two-thirds of a percent; S&P500 up three quarters of a percent for the gain of 20 points and the NASDAQ for the 62-point move higher, up almost one percent right now on NASDAQ.

Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MAY: I will contest that vote with everything I've got. A change of leadership in the Conservative Party now, will put our country's future at risk and create uncertainty when we can least afford it.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: We are taking you to London this morning for the very latest out of the U.K. What this vote could mean for the future of Britain's exit from the European Union and how does that impact the rest of the world?

Sen. Cruz to Google Chief Privacy Officer: Is There a Project Dragonfly?Targeted News ServiceOctober 1, 2018 Monday 8:16 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1001 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe office of Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, issued the following news release:U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation participated in a hearing last week focused on how leading technology companies handle American consumers' privacy and security. During the hearing, Sen. Cruz questioned Keith Enright, Google's Chief Privacy Officer, to uncover the truth regarding Google's 'Project Dragonfly,' which has been reported in the press to be a search engine designed to censor search results at the demands of the Chinese government."After a cyberattack compromised the Gmail accounts of dozens of Chinese human rights advocates, Google decided in March of 2010 to shut down its operations in China," Sen. Cruz said. "At the time Google released a statement that said quote: 'We want as many people in the world as possible to have access to our services, including users in mainland China, yet the Chinese government has been crystal clear throughout our discussions that self-censorship is a non-negotiable legal requirement.' Despite taking this principled stand in 2010, it's been reported last month that Google has been secretly developing a search engine for China as part of a project known as 'Dragonfly.' Are those reports accurate?"Several news outlets covered Sen. Cruz's line of questioning at the hearing. Selected new coverage is below:WIRED: Congress Challenges Google On China. Google Falls Short"Google's first public attempt to explain its reported interest in entering the Chinese market failed to appease critical members of Congress at a Senate Commerce Committee hearing on Wednesday. [...] Google's chief privacy officer, Keith Enright, came to the hearing prepared to give a carefully scripted explanation addressing these reports, remarks that would neither confirm nor deny their accuracy. [...] Enright repeated the term 'not close to launching' several more times throughout the hearing, before Senator Ted Cruz of Texas finally stopped him short. 'You're saying you're not close to launching. I'm asking [...] is [Project Dragonfly] a project to develop a search engine in China? I didn't ask timing of launch. I asked what it is,' the Republican said. Enright only went so far as to confirm that Project Dragonfly does in fact exist. But he declined to expound upon its purpose, insisting he was 'not clear on the contours of what is in scope or out of scope for that project.' That, of course, is the problem. It's not just that Enright came off as cagey. The far bigger issue is that his claims about taking privacy seriously and not knowing much about the project can't peacefully coexist. If Google's chief privacy officer isn't actively engaged in these conversations, it undermines the idea that Google is carefully considering the ramifications of this work."BBC News: (VIDEO) Google's privacy chief quizzed on China plan by Ted Cruz"Google's privacy chief has confirmed that work on Project Dragonfly is ongoing but has denied that the firm is close to launching a search engine in China as a result. Keith Enright was quizzed about the effort by Senator Ted Cruz towards the end of a Senate Committee hearing into data privacy. Leaks about the effort have raised concerns that the tech firm might help the Chinese state censor its citizens' online activities, with Google's own employees among those to have raised concern."Venture Beat: Google confirms Dragonfly project in Senate hearing, dodges questions on China plans"During a Wednesday Senate hearing, Google's chief privacy officer Keith Enright confirmed that the company has a project codenamed Dragonfly -- reported to be a censored search engine that's being prepared to launch in China -- but didn't say what the project covers. 'I am not clear on the contours of what is in scope or out of scope for that project,' Enright said in response to a question from Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX). It appears to be the first time that someone from Google has confirmed that the company has a project codenamed Dragonfly, after nearly two months of speculation about it. [...] Senator Cruz also asked Enright if 'in your opinion, does China engage in censoring its citizens,' to which Enright responded, 'As the privacy representative for Google, I'm not sure that I have an informed opinion on that question.'"CNN Tech: Google grilled over 'Project Dragonfly' at Senate hearing on data privacy"Google has finally admitted that a 'Project Dragonfly' is indeed in the works. But that's about all a Google executive was willing to divulge Wednesday about the codenamed plan, which has been widely reported to be a search product the company is developing for China -- one that would need to comply with government censorship. [...] Enright did not link 'Dragonfly' to the reports about developing a Chinese search engine. He name-dropped it only when pressed about the existence of a 'Project Dragonfly' by Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican. 'I am not clear on the contours of what is in scope or out of scope for that project,' Enright added. When Cruz prodded Enright for more information, the privacy officer would only reiterate what CEO Sundar Pichai has already said about the rumored product."The Wall Street Journal: Tech Executives Warn of Overregulation in Privacy Push"Google, which was chided by senators when it declined to appear at a hearing earlier this month, also was grilled Wednesday on the company's reported plans to develop a search engine adhering to China's internet censors. [...] Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Tex.) pressed Mr. Enright on whether there is any truth to reports that the China project, known internally as 'Project Dragonfly,' is working towards developing a censored search engine. 'There is a Project Dragonfly,' Mr. Enright said. 'My understanding is that we are not close to launching a search product in China and whether we eventually would or could remains unclear.'"Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6465655 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: October 2, 2018End of Document

ZoZo Go Study: China Auto Investments of $15B in US; A comprehensive list of 100+ Chinese firms currently operating in U.S.PR NewswireNovember 8, 2018 Thursday 12:27 PM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 404 wordsDateline: SAN DIEGO, Nov. 8, 2018 BodyPR Newswire ZoZo Go, the auto advisory group (http://www.zozogo.com) has released a survey of Chinese auto companies operating in the U.S. The database, the first of its kind, was published this week by Automotive News as part of a special feature titled "China's U.S. Ambitions."  (http://www.autonews_database.comnote: data behind paywall.)Exclusive: China's extensive penetration into the US auto industry Focus: Parts manufacturing, R&D centers, electric and autonomous vehiclesBased on research compiled since 2015, investments are focused in two areas: 1) Auto parts, engineering and production, concentrated in the Midwest.  2) Advanced R&D centers for electric and autonomous cars, primarily in Silicon Valley.  The data further indicates there are:105 Chinese-funded auto companies 190 facilities stretching from California to South Carolina Tens of thousands of employees"Chinese companies started investing in the U.S. during the global financial crisis, when they could buy distressed assets at good prices," says ZoZo Go CEO Michael Dunne. "Investments accelerated again after 2015 when the Chinese government encouraged its companies to go global, as part of the Made In China 2025 initiative."China's entry into U.S. markets contrasts with that of Japan and South Korea, both of whom exported to the U.S. before investing in local production.  By first developing a supply-chain, manufacturing and advanced auto tech, China is laying the groundwork before introducing their car brands in 2020. Major Chinese automakers, such as Guangzhou Automotive, Shanghai Automotive and Geely, already operate R&D centers in the U.S., preparing future vehicles for American consumers. Current trade tensions have slowed the pace of investments. "But Chinese firms are determined to compete globally, obstacles be damned," says Dunne.  "For those still wondering when the Chinese will arrive on American shores, the reality is they are already here in force."ZoZo Go is a global auto advisory firm with expertise in China and auto tech: electric, autonomous and connected vehicles.  The company operates in Hong Kong, Shanghai and San Diego. For more about ZoZo Go, visitzozogo.comContact: Bill Endemann - ZoZo GoPh: 310-562-1233Email:bill.endemann@zozogo.com View original content to download multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/zozo-go-study--china-auto-investments-of-15b-in-us-300746884.htmlSOURCE ZoZo GoLoad-Date: November 9, 2018End of Document

Good morning to you. It is Jobs Day. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Friday, December 7th. Your top stories right now 6:00 a.m. on the button East Coast, stocks are under pressure again this morning. Take a look at Futures indicating a decline at the start of trading despite the fact that the markets did close off of the lows yesterday. It was a wild one on Wall Street yesterday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged earlier in the session on the arrest of Huawei's CFO and the worries over the China-U.S. relationship.But then a report from The Wall Street Journal on the Federal Reserve taking a wait and see approach on raising interest rates, lifted stocks from the lows, the market actually ended lower, but well-off of the lows of the session. At the end of the day, it was mixed. Take a look at the numbers. Dow Jones Industrial Average at the close yesterday, down almost 80 points, just about a third of a percent. The S&P was also negative, but just by that four points, and the NASDAQ turned positive by the close, up almost 30 points, almost one-half of one percent higher on the NASDAQ.So, there was some buying momentum at the close yesterday. Global markets, this morning, are also bouncing. Take a look at the FT-100, up 112 points right now, that's one and two-thirds percent. The CAC Quarante in Paris is points, one and a half percent, and the DAX Index in Germany up 80 points, that's three quarters of one percent. In Asia overnight, mixed performances at the close. Take a look at the Asian Indices. Nikkei Average up almost one percent, the Hong Kong Hang Seng down, the others higher.The CFO of Huawei set to appear in a Canadian court today. She awaits possible extradition to the United States.

OPEC uncertainty, now no final decision yet from the cartel's meeting, even though yesterday, the Saudis were sure we were going to get output cut. We're following the very latest developments out of Vienna. There was some pushback from Russia and, of course, there's a open question about Iran's oil as well. So, that is causing some uncertainty there. We'll see if we actually do get a production cut.Plus it is Jobs Day in America. The government releasing its November numbers in terms of job creation. We are expecting the numbers to be 200,000 new jobs added to the economy in the month of November. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.7 percent. We've got everything you need to watch for in the report, all hands-on deck on jobs coming up. Then playing favorites, a new report alleging that the New York Stock Exchange gave special treatment to a Morgan Stanley broker allowing Morgan to trade afterhours. There's backlash about it this morning and we've got it.All those stories coming up this Friday morning here in Washington. Joining me to talk about all of the above, Townhall.com Political Editor, Guy Benson, is here on set with me, along with The Wall Street Journal's Global Economics Editor, Jon Hilsenrath, in New York, FOX Business Network's Dagen McDowell. Dagen, good morning to you. What a wild day yesterday on stocks.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: A wild day. I don't want to diminish what is going on with the arrest of the Huawei Chief Financial Officer, but I said on this program yesterday morning, it is about the Federal Reserve and the direction of interest rates, and investors' concern that the Fed is going to overdo it, and I think that that proved to be true yesterday afternoon when that Wall Street Journal article came out about the Fed now taking a wait and see approach. And, boom --BARTIROMO: Yes, you --MCDOWELL: -- you have this amazing comeback in the stock market.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's true. I mean all of a sudden now, you've got more voices than just President Trump saying, you know what, let's reassess and look again and make sure that the data is confirming three rate hikes in 2019. Jon Hilsenrath is with us this morning and we want to get his commentary on that as well, Jon.JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Yes. Yes, absolutely. And you used the keyword "data," it's really about the data for the Fed right now and what the Fed has observed over the last couple of months is that inflation isn't rising as much as the models say it would, and now we have oil prices falling so it looks like the inflation numbers are going to soften even more --MCDOWELL: Uh-hmm.HILSENRATH: -- over the next couple of months.BARTIROMO: Yes.HILSENRATH: So what the Fed is saying, "All right, let -- let's see what the data show, maybe we don't need to go with a rate hike every quarter, maybe we can just kind of see how things play out. You know, they're getting -- they've already moved rates up over two percent, so they've already done a lot of the work they --BARTIROMO: Yes.HILSENRATH: -- felt they had to do and so maybe they don't have to work so hard over the -- in 2019 as they did in 2018.BARTIROMO: Yes. We'll see about that. But of course, we're watching greats, and as Dagen has been mentioning for weeks now, that's really the big driver of this market. But China is no small story --MCDOWELL: Yes.BARTIROMO: -- Guy Benson. I mean when you saw what happened yesterday with the arrest of the CFO of Huawei, you really started to pay attention, just say, "You know what, Donald Trump is not backing down on this fight against China."GUY BENSON, TOWNHALL.COM POLITICAL EDITOR: That's right. So, some of the struggles of the market recently have been tied into the whole issue of trade and jitters about, are they actually going to hammer anything out, or is this trade war going to escalate. And then, yes, this huge story breaks where, at the direction of U.S. authorities, the Canadians arrested this woman, it's interesting to watch the reaction here in Washington --BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.BENSON: -- because it seemed like one of the few things that everyone agreed on, right, left, and center, was the intellectual property theft was a huge, huge problem. Here we are doing something concrete about it and everybody's scurrying to their corners.BARTIROMO: Yes, you're right. Well, we'll talk --HILSENRATH: You know, I think for the markets, the other thing that's really important here is not just the trade war, but the fact that America multinationals have so many bodies, so much investment in China.BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.HILSENRATH: How are the Chinese going to respond? Are we going to start seeing --BARTIROMO: Yes.HILSENRATH: -- American executives or (INAUDIBLE) for the --BARTIROMO: Well, that's the point. Yes, a lot of people mentioned that yesterday.HILSENRATH: -- retaliation.BARTIROMO: CEO of American Technology Company, watch your back if you're in China post what happens. We had the President of Microsoft on yesterday though and he really laid it out in terms of the importance and the cost of the intellectual property from China to U.S. corporations and it is big. Steve Ballmer told us it's $10 billion a year in lost profits when it comes to Microsoft.We're going to talk about all that this morning. Joining the conversation, Texas Congressman and House Financial Services Committee Chairman, Jeb Hensarling, is with us this morning. Arizona Congressman and House Judiciary Committee Member, Andy Biggs, is with us. Big meeting, of course, Jim Comey, is testifying today in a closed-door meeting. We're going to get into that. He is talking with John Ratcliffe and Trey Gowdy of oversight and judiciary.But first, our top story right now and that is markets. Futures down again this morning after a wild ride for the market yesterday. The Dow, the S&P 500, and the NASDAQ finishing mixed. A sharp turnaround after The Wall Street Journal reported that the Federal Reserve may take a wait and see approach when it comes to future interest rate increases. This is the U.S. ramping up its efforts to curb the Chinese tech industry with the arrest of Huawei's Chief Financial Officer, Sabrina Meng. Meng is expected to appear in court later today for her bail hearing.Here now is Vision 4 Fund Distributors Vice President, Heather Zumarraga, joining us to talk more about that. And, Heather, it's good to see you. Thanks for being here.HEATHER ZUMARRAGA, VICE PRESIDENT, VISION 4 FUND DISTRIBUTORS: Good to see you.BARTIROMO: Your thoughts on markets and whether or not we're going to see this nervousness's continue even though now we've got a little more clarity on where the Fed might be going.ZUMARRAGA: Yes, sure, absolutely. I think the markets will continue to be volatile, but it was just such an amazing move to bounce off the lows of 780-point decline on the Dow yesterday and the markets were telling us maybe it's not about trade and the -- and the arrest of Huawei's CFO, that maybe it's all still about the Fed because after we go the report from The Wall Street Journal, the wait and see approach, that's when the markets really came off the low. So, that's telling me it may still be about the Fed.HILSENRATH: And now this brings us to the jobs numbers today because the fed is saying we're data-dependent, our -- they're going to raise rates in December, by the way.BARTIROMO: Yes.HILSENRATH: But after that, you know, our moves are going to depend on how the economy does. If we get a gangbuster number today, then maybe --BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.HILSENRATH: -- the Fed says game on, we keep raising interest rates.BARTIROMO: Yes.HILSENRATH: But if the number's a little on the soft side then that, you know, that confirms the economy's starting to see some headwinds and --ZUMARRAGA: Well, if it's on the soft side --BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.ZUMARRAGA: -- I think markets will fall out of bed again because the fact is, look, the Fed might be out of the way based on what came out of yesterday as a -- as a wait and see approach.BARTIROMO: Yes.ZUMARRAGA: So, the better the data in terms of wage growth and unemployment, give me over 200,000 number --BARTIROMO: Yes.ZUMARRAGA: -- that's what I want to see.BARTIROMO: Well --ZUMARRAGA: I think that'll be okay for the markets.BARTIROMO: But let's not forget --HILSENRATH: I think -- I think for the market, it's right down the middle number that it's looking for because --BARTIROMO: So, 200,000.HILSENRATH: It's --BARTIROMO: Around?HILSENRATH: -- 150, 200,000, but if it's a gangbuster number, then --ZUMARRAGA: You think the Fed's back in play?HILSENRATH: -- the market's going to have to start pricing in a, you know, the Fed keeps going.BARTIROMO: Yes. And they're going to have to probably say the fact that, "Well, look, the economy is running strong and maybe the Fed is going to --HILSENRATH: Really does.BARTIROMO: -- have to be real vigilant. But Dagen, let's not forget that the Fed has this enormous balance sheet right now and another form of tightening is unwinding that balance sheet. Remember earlier this week, we heard buzzing about Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary, bringing up this issue to bankers saying, "Would you rather see the Fed unwind that $4 trillion balance sheet or would you rather see interest rate hikes? Because they're both forms of tightening.MCDOWELL: They are, and you're actually starting to see the results. We've been saying all year that you don't know how this will play out in terms of the balance sheet reduction. You don't know what the knock-on effects are through the economy and even the markets because this this is an unprecedented unwinding of an unprecedented building of the balance sheet.BARTIROMO: Right.MCDOWELL: So, what you were seeing yesterday is diminish liquidity, it's making it harder to buy and sell stocks bonds and even oil futures.BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.MCDOWELL: That you have some exchange-traded bond funds that the price of these exchange-traded funds is actually trading below the net asset value, which in a regular ETF, you do not see. And so a lot of people are blaming the liquidity problems you're seeing in the market on the balance sheet reduction, which is $50 billion per month.BARTIROMO: Right.MCDOWELL: The balance sheet now below $4 trillion.BARTIROMO: Right.HILSENRATH: I just want to say --BARTIROMO: Yes.HILSENRATH: -- something about the balance reduction. The Fed is pretty committed to continuing that.BARTIROMO: It's got to.HILSENRATH: But because it's continuing that, that's another reason for this wait and see approach that they're looking towards the 2019.BARTIROMO: Right. That's why I'm -- that's why I brought it up --HILSENRATH: That's --BARTIROMO: -- because it's another form of tightening and so, you know --HILSENRATH: Right. Because that tightening is going on, they're saying, "Well, maybe we don't need to be so aggressive --BARTIROMO: Exactly.HILSENRATH: -- on interest rates because that's also going on on the side.BARTIROMO: And you have -- I think that's what Steven Mnuchin was trying to, sort of, you know, allude to. I mean he was -- he was saying, "Look, you've already got this going on."HILSENRATH: Right.BARTIROMO: "Maybe you want to recheck that in terms of the rate increases. Let's get to trade because that's another issue. The Assistant to the President for Trade and Manufacturing Policy, Peter Navarro, was on FOX Business last night. He weighed in on this Huawei arrest.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)PETER NAVARRO, ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT FOR TRADE AND MANUFACTURING POLICY: Neither the President or Ambassador Bolton were aware of the Justice Department action prior to the dinner. We were not informed of that by the Justice Department, there's nothing wrong with that. Justice Department does these things independently on its own and that's what happens.(END VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: And then, of course, overnight, we get that tweet from the President of China basically saying all teams are working and we are sure we're going to get a deal in the next 90 days. Donald Trump tweets back saying, "I agree." We'll see.BENSON: Yes. And there are a lot of people in this town and up in New York who are hanging on every word, but a very dramatic development. I actually tend to believe that the very top officials at the White House didn't know this was coming, but there has been pressure from this administration overall on the issue of Chinese malfeasance, perhaps the largest component of which has been I.P. theft and this is a high-profile arrest.BARTIROMO: It's high-profile also because of the espionage factor. You know, The Journal reported in the piece yesterday, Jon, that this is a company, along with ZTE, that has been looked at for a long time in terms of the Chinese government using these companies as tools to spy on foreigners including Americans.HILSENRATH: You know, there's so many factors here, there's the espionage factor, there's the sanctions factor, you know. Allegedly, they were involved in evading Iran sanctions. And then there's just the competition factor. The Chinese are doing everything they can to build up in the high- tech industries and they're challenging, you know, America's stronger --BARTIROMO: Right.HILSENRATH: -- most important industry. That's a trifecta.BARTIROMO: They want to be number one in -- yes.HILSENRATH: That's a trifecta right there.BARTIROMO: Yes.HILSENRATH: If you want to justify this arrest, you just went through all three big reasons to really lower the bill.ZUMARRAGA: Well, you have to remember, we had our trade truce at the time or right after this happened, meaning that China already knew, I think, that this was -- that this arrest happened in Canada, went back after the G20 Summit and then said that there was some form of trade truce after this happened.BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.ZUMARRAGA: And Huawei has been investigated for a long time.BARTIROMO: That's what -- exactly.ZUMARRAGA: So, it shouldn't be a surprise.BARTIROMO: That's what I'm saying.HILSENRATH: What this tells me is the idea of some grand reset of American-Chinese economic relations seems a little excessively hopeful to me. The -- you know, there's some very deep-seated disagreements here, deep-seated rivalries that I don't think are going to go away in six -- in 90 days.BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.MCDOWELL: But maybe it's time that the U.S. started enforcing our laws and standing up for American corporations --BARTIROMO: Right.MCDOWELL: -- that have been robbed by the Government of China.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: That is as The Wall Street Journal Editorial today points out, trade negotiations and enforcing our laws, those aren't incompatible.BARTIROMO: Right,MCDOWELL: And everybody can prosper as long as we all get on the same page.BARTIROMO: Which is why many people from both sides of the aisle agree that President Trump was right to poke and push China --MCDOWELL: Yes.BARTIROMO: -- and demand change. Real quick, Heather, you going to put new money to work in this market or are you too afraid you want to be on the sideline because of the volatility? Where do you stand?ZUMARRAGA: I think you have to stay the course right now. The markets will remain volatile. But I think we'll get a positive day today given the trade disputes this morning.BARTIROMO: Heather Zumarraga, good to see you this morning as always. Please stay with us for a full coverage of the November Jobs report. It begins at 8:00 a.m. Eastern. We will identify where the job creation is in the economy right now. We got all hands-on deck for jobs in America and the jobs numbers coming out this morning. First though, crude awakening, oil in focus this morning after OPEC delays a decision over the level of output cuts.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well, the New York Stock Exchange is accused of allowing Morgan Stanley to make afterhours trade when nobody else could. Cheryl Casone with the details now in headlines. Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: This is something, Maria. Good morning to you. The New York Post is reporting that the New York Stock Exchange gave special treatment to a Morgan Stanley broker who asked to trade large blocks of stocks for several minutes after markets closed. The Post says that Exchanged officials gave the broker until 4:08 p.m. to complete a number of big transactions last Friday. Remember, that's a day before President Trump's meeting with China's Xi Jinping. Neither Morgan Stanley or the NYSE has made a comment on this story yet. Taking a look at shares of Morgan Stanley, down 18 percent so far this year.Well, other automakers may be scaling back, but Fiat Chrysler plans to open a new vehicle factory in Detroit. Reports say the new plant's going to build the latest jeep sport utility vehicle. It's going to be the first new U.S. assembly plant built by a major carmaker in at least decade. Remember just last week, General Motors announced they were ending production at plants in Ohio and Michigan, laying off nearly 15,000 people. Shares of Fiat Chrysler are down eight percent for the year.Well, America saying its final goodbyes to President George H.W. Bush yesterday. His casket on board the special 4141 Train that carried him to his final resting place. He got a big Texas welcome home yesterday. At his Texas A&M Presidential Library in College Station, Texas, he is now laid to rest. The navy performed a record 21 jet flyover to honor the 41st President. Bush enlisted in the navy, remember, at 18 years old. He was finally laid to rest after a private service with just family attending, Maria. It was a beautiful ceremony.BARTIROMO: It really was. It was absolutely beautiful.CASONE: Uh-hmm.BARTIROMO: A great tribute to a great man, Cheryl.CASONE: Yes.BARTIROMO: Thank you. Coming up, oil slick, oil extending its losses as OPEC talks end with no deal in sight. The latest coming up. And we still do not know if we will see a production cut. And then comedy cut, Kevin Hart pulls out of being the Oscar's host after backlash over decades old tweets. The fallout coming up. We'll tell you what happened overnight, stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. No deal yet for OPEC. Members of OPEC are meeting again today, mulling over cuts to production, prices bounce back this morning over some optimism that Russia may contribute a larger production cut first Russia was pushing back.Joining us right now is the Schork Report Publisher, Stephen Schork, and Steven, it's good to see you this morning. Your thoughts on --STEPHEN SCHORK, SCHORK REPORT PUBLISHER: You, too.BARTIROMO: -- what OPEC may do in the face of this big selloff in oil over the last two months down 20 percent.SCHORK: Right, Maria, and what we're seeing, actually, is a re-ignition of the rep between the Sunni side of OPEC and the Shia side of OPEC. Let's keep in mind that the only thing -- well, I mean, let's be honest here, Sunni Arab, you know, the only thing they hate more than a Shia Persian is a Shia Persian with a nuclear-tipped ICBM. So, this is Groundhog Day in the oil markets. This is November 2014. If we remember back then, oil prices, like today, had come off 30 percent from their summer highs.We were going in to the OPEC meeting and Iran, like today, was suffering from sanctions given its transience with regard to pursuing nuclear weapon, so like 2014, the Saudis did nothing at the November OPEC meeting and they allowed the market to tank. I think we're at that situation right now. I think the rhetoric coming out of Saudi Arabia, the nonchalance of, "Well, let's have a one million barrel cut when the market expectation was for 1.5 or even 2 million barrel cut." They are actually daring the market to go lower right now. I'm not optimistic we'll get any sort of meaningful deal out of OPEC today.HILSENRATH: Stephen, that 2014 episode hurt in some ways the U.S. economy because when prices fell, it really knocked out a lot of U.S. fracking in places like Texas and North Dakota. What's at stake here for the U.S. energy industry with these talks that OPEC is going through?SCHORK: In the short-term, not much, because we've had ample opportunity the entire summer, the producer that is, to lock in future production two years at well over $70.00 a barrel. So, the industry recognized the opportunity they had over the last few months and took advantage of it so we are well hedged at this point. Also, in 2014, you're correct, it absolutely hurt the economy, it really hurt the oil economy, but OPEC, at the end of the day, really did the industry a favor. They did all of the Fed's heavy-lifting. Remember, the industry really got fat because of the artificial cost of capital.So, the pullback in oil prices in '14 and '15 really forced the industry to retrench. Margins are much higher. So, these companies, the frackers, so forth, can make money at lower prices so we're not nearly as vulnerable as we were four years ago.BARTIROMO: Yesterday, we heard from the CEO of Marathon Petroleum, I interviewed Chairman and CEO, Gary Heminger, about the recent selloff in crude. Listen to what he said. I got to get your reaction.SCHORK: Sure.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: I know that this could be an indicator of slowdown in global growth. That, sometimes, is indicative in the price of oil or maybe it's telling us something only about the oversupply situation. To what do you attribute this sharp selloff?GARY HEMINGER, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, MARATHON PETROLEUM: I really look at the oversupply situation. If you look at the Permian, continues to grow rapidly, the Balkan has, you know, come back strong, as well as the foreign markets, the Middle East Production and the Middle East Production coming into the U.S. has put pressure on the supply here in the U.S.(END VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: Your thoughts.SCHORK: Yes. I don't disagree with that, Maria, and we see this in the forward curve in pricing. Six months ago, the spot price -- the price for oil today as opposed to the price of oil next month, two months, three months hence, the price -- spot price six months ago was at premium. So, when you're spot pricing any commodities at a premium, that's telling you that demand is overwhelming supply. But over the six months, we've had that inversion now where the spot price is cheaper than price out into the future.So, this is clearly at the best a market that is well supplied, at the worst as far as industry is concerned, it's a sign that the market is oversupplied. So, OPEC should, the Saudis should cut, but --BARTIROMO: Yes.SCHORK: -- should, would, could are the most useless verbs out there. So, we have the situation, the Saudis aren't do -- going to do anything --BARTIROMO: Right.SCHORK: -- without the Russians and also, keep in mind, we have the Iranians, and Iranians have a point.BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.SCHORK: They're under sanctions now, they're not going to jump onboard with any sort of sanctions. So, we're really at --BARTIROMO: Real quick, Steve.SCHORK: -- loggerheads at this point.BARTIROMO: Stephen, real quick.SCHORK: Yes.BARTIROMO: What's the level that really cuts into the Shell producers' profitability, is it below 50?SCHORK: It's going to be below 50, it's a psychological number. There's - - there are a lot more plays that can make depending on the location, make money at $50.00, but we're really at that kind of DY over DX moment, that inflection point.BARTIROMO: Yes.SCHORK: If we go much lower, and the models suggest we can go to the mid- 40s, then you're going to start to see some pain in the industry.BARTIROMO: Yes. And then we can start seeing layoffs in the oil sector. We saw that the last time this happened.SCHORK: Oh, absolutely.BARTIROMO: Stephen, good to see you this morning.SCHORK: It's not a good time.BARTIROMO: Thanks very much. Stephen, thanks for joining us.SCHORK: Thanks, Maria. Take care.BARTIROMO: Coming up, Paris is closed. French officials shutting down popular tourist destinations as they look to curb the slew of violent protests. Wait until you see what's going on there. And then jobs in America, we are bringing you full coverage of the November Jobs Report, beginning at 8:00 a.m. this morning. Stay with us. MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live this morning from Washington, D.C. All morning back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Friday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is jobs Friday, December 7th, your top stories right now 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast. Markets this morning are under selling pressure, again. Futures pointing to a decline of about 100 points right out of the gate on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The NASDAQ down 35 points, that's one-half of one percent lower. This after a volatile session on Wall Street yesterday with the momentum was on the upside by the close.The Dow plunged early in the day after the arrest of the CFO of Huawei as investors concluded this only must mean more upset between China and the U.S. Then, a report from the Wall Street Journal hit on the Fed, is taking a wait-and-see approach on interest rates and raising rates. That lifted stocks from the lows. At the end of the day, it was a mixed session where the market did end of the worst levels of the day: Dow Industrials down 80 points at the close a third of a percent; S&P was down just four point and the NASDAQ actually went positive, it picked up 30 points at the close, almost one-half of one percent.In Europe this morning, markets are rallying. Take a look, across the board gains with the FTSE100 up 90 points, 1-1/3 percent. The CAC Quarante in Paris is up 65 points, that 1-1/3 percent and the DAX Index in Germany also up 65, two-thirds of one percent higher in Germany. In Asia overnight, markets closed mostly higher, as you see, with the exception of Hong Kong, it was down just a fraction.Jobs in America, today, economists are expecting 200,000 jobs added to the economy last month with the unemployment rate holding steady at 3.7 percent. We're breaking down the expectations; we will see what it means for the fed and for markets when the numbers hit. Join us for a special coverage. But first, mourning the loss of two sports greats, as well; the very latest after two former professional baseball players are killed in a car accident.Then chaos in Paris; the outrage in France as officials prepared to close the Eiffel Tower and other sites after violent protests took place. Plus, Kevin Hart stepping away; why the comedian will not be hosting the upcoming Academy Awards after all? We will tell you what happened overnight. But first, the future of technology; the Trump administration sitting down with top technology executives yesterday at the White House. CEOs from Microsoft, Alphabet, Oracle, Qualcomm among those attending, it's all about ways to ensure American dominance in innovation.Joining us right now is Endpoint Technologies Associates Founder and Technology Analyst Roger Kay. Roger, good to see you this morning, thanks you so much for joining us.ROGER KAY, FOUNDER AND TECHNOLOGY ANALYST, ENDPOINT TECHNOLOGIES ASSOCIATES: Good morning, Maria, how are you? So, what is the answer to holding on to dominance and innovation in the United States? We know that China wants to be number one in A.I., wants to be number one in block chain technology, robotics, et cetera, how does the U.S. continue to innovate and keep that number one spot?KAY: Yes, I don't think the Trump administration is going to like the answer much because it has to do with things like science, which is the underpinning of technology, things like immigration, letting in people who can actually help the industry and promoting the -- you know, basically, the education, the basic education that will lead to the kind of workforce that we need here in the United States. So, you know, those aren't what have been promoted by this administration. And I think that, you know, you can't just stand at the bum of the goose and say, hey, where's my golden egg? You have to actually feed the goose.BARTIROMO: This is an issue that technology executives bring up all the time, that they want to be able to hold on to the people that they train, whether they are foreign or not and they don't want to be able to have a scientist or an engineer come from Russia, come from China working their company but then be forced to leave.KAY: Right, so, exactly. So, there needs to be a little bit more welcoming stance here on the part of our government. If you look at Silicon Valley, you know, it is a very diverse place and that is how this industry has thrived here in the United States; we have always been the beacon for other countries. I mean, the smartest people in other countries who want to come in and make a difference in technology.BARTIROMO: Yes, but you know, there are some tech executives out there who see regulation coming and they want it. Microsoft, for example, asking governments for laws that would govern the use of facial recognition. Microsoft specifically addressed privacy concerns with regards to technology. Earlier this week, I sat for an exclusive interview with the president of Microsoft, Brad Smith, joined me and I asked him about regulation coming.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Brad, what are your thoughts on potential regulation coming to technology and how we could see the industry change as a result?BRAD SMITH, PRESIDENT, MICROSOFT: Well, I don't think necessarily a bad thing. If you look at the last two or three decades, technology has raised forward and, frankly, we do need government to catch up. And I think we need a world where the U.S. government and state governments are actually moving a big faster and even doing a bit more. When we look at a field like privacy, Europe has been leading the way in that field for two decades. We called 13 years ago for privacy legislation in Washington D.C. and in Congress, and it's a good thing that we're seeing in 2018 other companies like Apple and Salesforce step forward to endorse this as well. If we have the right level of regulation, if it is balanced, if it's forward-looking, I think you can give public confidence in its use of technology and that's going to be good for the tech sector itself.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Don't forget, this from the guy who runs the company that was under the government's gun pretty aggressively back in the 90s. Now, Microsoft is out of the spotlight in that regard but regulation it feels, is coming. Guy Benson, let me get you in here. What's your take on what Roger is saying in terms of immigration, in terms of some of these barriers to keeping America number one in innovation dominance?BENSON: Yes, and I agree with the point Roger is making about the importance of prioritizing some of these, keeping them here, people who are high skilled workers who can help our economy. I just think the slight push back to Roger would be the president's proposal that he's put forward has focused on prioritizing merit and skill which I think would be a healthy thing for the economy.BARTIROMO: Well, that's thing, Roger -- I mean, the president doesn't -- he doesn't not like immigration. He wants it to be legal immigration given the fact that we have a structure to get into this country legally.KAY: Right. Well, H-1B1 visas are the ones that the tech companies want to take advantage of. And so, in as much as the administration can smooth that process, then the tech companies will tend to be happy, you know, without even addressing the rest of the immigration issue.HILSENRATH: I would just say, we have fewer foreign students coming here right now, fewer people coming here to graduate schools for PhDs, so the administration talks a lot about illegal immigration, but legal immigration is being squeezed too.BENSON: Which is unhealthy, in my view.HILSENRATH: Right.BARTIROMO: I think we all agree there. Roger, good to see you this morning, thanks so much.KAY: Great. Super. Thanks again.BARTIROMO: Roger Kay, joining us. It was a busy week certainly for markets and certainly for the economy. We have a busy show here as well; take a look at the top moments from MORNINGS WITH MARIA.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY: I think President Xi made some very strong commitments on changing structural and nonstructural issues. And if we can get this negotiated and get a real agreement, I think this is the single biggest opportunity for U.S. business and U.S. workers. Our expectation is that phase one will be implemented immediately. And when I say immediately, that's part of the 90-day negotiation.STEPHEN HARPER, FORMER PRIME MINISTER OF CANADA: When I was in government, we were increasingly concerned about the penetration of Huawei and ZTE into western democratic telecommunication networks. My personal view is that is something that western countries should be doing in terms of our own long- term security issues.SMITH: The economic relationship between China and the United States, let's face it, one of the most important economic relationships in the world. We'd like to see a successful conclusion over the next 90 days to these discussions. A successful conclusion would ensure market access for American products including technology products in China.

CHINA SHUTTERS WECHAT ACCOUNT LISTING HISTORICAL GRIEVANCES AGAINST MOSCOWStates News ServiceOctober 4, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 507 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Chinese government censors on Thursday shut down a social media account known for its criticism of Russia and bilateral ties between the two countries.A public account on the social media platform WeChat titled "Russia and the Soviet Union's history of aggression against China and their international relations" was shut down by the authorities.A number of its posts were also deleted, mainly those describing Russian incursions into Chinese territory in the first part of the 20th century.The ruling Chinese Communist Party's powerful propaganda department typically intervenes to curb criticism of its key allies, and the censorship of the account highlights ever-closer ties between Beijing and Moscow, analysts said.Independent scholar and historian Zhang Lifan said the account drew on Chinese histories of the bilateral relationship with the Soviet Union written when ties were at their worst during the 1970s."Now that they want to improve their relationship with Russia, we're not allowed to post these things," Zhang said, adding that Beijing's relationship with Moscow has been a roller-coaster ride in the past century or so."After [the founding of the People's Republic of China in] 1949, we copied the Soviet Union in everything: they could do no wrong," Zhang said. "After the Sino-Soviet split in the 1960s, they were regarded as revisionists, and we even went to war.""The propaganda back then paid no attention to the reality of the situation; everything served the political agenda of the time," he said.Politically sensitiveLiang Yunxiang, a scholar of international relations at Beijing's prestigious Peking University, said the study of history in China is always politically sensitive."Pretty much all history that is [accepted and taught] under the current system has been entirely subsumed by politics," Liang told RFA. "There have been a lot of unofficial voices speaking out in recent years about Soviet/Russian invasions of China.""The government doesn't want anyone mentioning these things, now that bilateral ties are in a fairly good state," he said.Liang said there is a difference to the way in which the ruling Chinese Communist Party manages public commentary and opinion about Japan."With Sino-Japanese relations, some of the issues have actually been resolved, legally speaking, although they keep bringing up historical grievances all the same," he said. "With Sino-Russian ties, they haven't ever really been resolved, if the truth be told."Last week, China and Russia both called on the United Nations security council to end economic sanctions against North Korea.In July, China delivered two power generators to the isolated Stalinist state in defiance of international sanctions punishing the country for its illicit nuclear weapons program, sources told RFA.The generators were transported to North Korea by ship in late June, a source in Pyongyang told RFA's Korean Service, citing information obtained from workers involved in the transfer.Load-Date: October 4, 2018End of Document

Huawei: which countries banned Huawei technology, the second largest cellphone producer in the worldCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 29, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 890 wordsBody Huawei continues to accumulate prohibitions in different countries. New Zealand became the last country on Wednesday to block a proposal to use telecommunications equipment manufactured by the Chinese company Huawei due to national security concerns.  The telecommunications company Spark wanted to use Huawei equipment in its 5G mobile network in New Zealand, but a government security agency said the agreement would carry significant risks.  The move is part of a growing push against the participation of Chinese technology companies in security matters.  What is 5G and what will it mean for you and your mobile phone? What are the fears?  Several governments distrust Chinese technology because they fear Beijing will force companies like Huawei to helpauthoritiesgain access to industrial secrets and other confidential information .  The companies Huawei and ZTE represent a high risk of espionage, warn some experts.  In particular, there is concern about the risk of espionage by China , some experts allege.  Tom Uren, visiting member of the International Center for Cybernetic Policy at the Institute of Strategic Policy of Australia, said the Chinese government "clearly demonstrated the intention to steal information for many years."  "The Chinese state has been involved in a large number of types of espionage including the cybernetic and in the theft of intellectual property," he said. Close ties between business and government also fueled concerns that China may try to "use state-linked companies to allow its spying operations," Uren added.  The United States and China race to install the 5G network of mobile devices first  Those concerns were exacerbated by new laws introduced last year that require Chinese organizations to collaborate in national intelligence efforts.  The combination of these laws and the history of espionage increased the perceived danger for countries to use companies like Huawei and ZTE in critical national infrastructure.  "It's hard to argue that they do not represent a high risk," Uren added.  Because right now?  5G networks are being built in several countries and this technology will form the next important wave of mobile infrastructure.  And since Huawei is the world's largest producer of telecommunications equipment, the telecommunications firm Spark New Zealand planned to use Huawei's technology in its 5G network.  But the New Zealand Government's Communications Security Office (GCSB) told Spark that the proposal "if implemented, would increase significant national security risks ," the company explained.  New Zealand Intelligence Services Minister Andrew Little said Spark can work with the agency to reduce that risk.  Huawei stated:"As the GCSB has pointed out, this is a continuous process. We will address any concerns and we will work together to find the right path. "  Why the US intelligence agencies? recommend not using the phones of the Chinese giants Huawei and ZTE Which countries banned Huawei?  The decision of New Zealand to block Huawei for reasons of national security is not isolated. Australia did the same with Huawei and ZTE so that they do not provide 5G technology to the country's wireless networks for the same reasons.  For its part, Huawei defended its independence and said it is a private company. He also offered to build an "evaluation and testing" center in which his 5G team can be reviewed by the Australian government.  Why Australia banned the operations of the Chinese company Huawei, the world's largest cellphone producer  Earlier this year, the United States announced restrictions for Huawei and ZTE to bid for contracts in their territory and later banned government or military officials from using Chinese companies' phones. Last week, The Wall Street Journal reported that the US government tried to persuade wireless service providers to avoid using Huawei equipment.  For its part, in the United Kingdom, the government says it is still working with Huawei.  "This government and the British telecom operators are working with Huawei at home and abroad to ensure that the UK can continue to benefit from the new technology while managing cybersecurity risks," a British government spokeswoman told the BBC.  But a security committee warned that it has "a limited guarantee" that the Chinese company's telecommunications equipment does not pose a threat to national security. Canada is also conducting security tests since 2013 on telecommunications equipment sold in the country by the Chinese giant Huawei.  Similarly, the firm was put under evaluation in Germany, Japan and SouthKorea .  "The United States wants to leave Huawei out because we are too strong"  But there is only one country that is on Huawei's side: Papua New Guinea. The Pacific nation said this week it will go ahead with an agreement for Huawei to build its internet infrastructure.  The country received a significant increase in China's investment in the last decade.  Since its founding in 1987, Huawei has become one of the leading suppliers of telecommunications equipment worldwide.  The company has about 180,000 employees and operates in 170 countries and regions, according to its website.  Huawei entrance: which countries banned Huawei's technology, the second largest mobile producer in the world was first published in La Tercera. Load-Date: November 29, 2018End of Document

New Zealand intelligence bans China's Huawei from 5G rolloutMetro VarthaNovember 28, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 Vartha News Network Pvt Ltd All Rights ReservedLength: 481 wordsDateline: Wellington BodyWellington, Nov. 28 -- New Zealand's largest telecoms carrier Spark said Wednesday that the country's intelligence agency had barred it from using equipment provided by China's Huawei in its 5G network as it posed "significant national security risks".The move follows reports the United States is urging its allies to exclude the Chinese telecoms giant from 5G rollouts over cybersecurity fears.Spark said in a statement that it was legally obliged to inform the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) about its 5G plans.It said GCSB chief Andrew Hampton had raised concerns about the use of Huawei Radio Access Network (RAN) in the new network and declined the proposed rollout."The director-general has informed Spark today that he considers Spark's proposal to use Huawei 5G equipment in Spark's planned 5G RAN would, if implemented, raise significant national security risks," Spark said.The firm called the decision "disappointing" and said it would decide its next action after examining the detailed reasoning behind Hampton's conclusion.It still expected to complete its 5G network by July 2020.Hampton confirmed Spark's announcement in a brief statement."The GCSB under its (legislative) responsibilities, has recently undertaken an assessment of a notification from Spark. I have informed Spark that a significant network security risk was identified," he said.Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang expressed "deep concern" over the ban."The Chinese government encourages Chinese enterprises to follow market principles and international regulations, and develop overseas economic partnerships on the basis of abiding by local laws," he said."The economic and trade partnerships between China and New Zealand are mutually beneficial. We hope that New Zealand will offer a level playing field for Chinese enterprises operating in New Zealand, and do more to benefit mutual trust and partnerships." Huawei -- one of the world's largest telecommunications equipment and services providers -- has been under scrutiny in some countries, including the United States and Australia, over its alleged close links to Beijing authorities.China has long disputed accusations of security risks and the firm's links to state intelligence services.New Zealand is a member of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, which also includes the United States, Britain, Canada and Australia.China is one of its main trading partners but Wellington has become increasingly concerned about Beijing's influence in the Pacific recently.In response, New Zealand has boosted its Pacific aid programme to reinforce its presence in a region it considers its own sphere of influence.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from MetroVaartha English.

How the US-China hacker war reached Europe and beyondCNN.comDecember 19, 2018 Wednesday 7:14 PM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: ASIALength: 1897 wordsByline: Analysis by James Griffiths, CNNDateline: Hong Kong BodyThe email looked innocuous enough.It contained a link to access a shared document relating to a project the staffer was working on. Once clicked, they were asked for their login details, which they provided -- just one of dozens of times a day they had to type them out.The moment the staffer pressed Enter, a notification was triggered on the other side of the world. A cascading series of actions then kicked into gear, which would eventually compromise the staffer's entire computer network and expose huge quantities of sensitive documents and information.According to an explosive new report out this week, the above scenario played out hundreds of times in recent years as Chinese state-sponsored hackers allegedly targeted and compromised government entities around the world, including the European Union's diplomatic communications network.Sensitive cables from that network were released by Area 1 -- a cybersecurity firm founded by former US National Security Agency employees -- including communications that revealed deep concerns within the EU about the Trump administration's negotiations with China, Russian relations with Western Europe and Iran's nuclear program.The revelations, which were followed Thursday by new indictments of alleged Chinese hackers by the US Justice Department, expose that the cyber cold war between the US and China, which reached boiling point in the mid 2010s before a landmark agreement was signed by Washington and Beijing, is once again ramping up.In a statement Friday, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs reacted forcefully to what it described as "groundless accusations," saying the US had "fabricated facts out of thin air" and "seriously violated the basic norms of international relations and severely harmed bilateral cooperation."New startUS President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping stood side by side, facing a gaggle of reporters in the White House's Rose Garden.It was September 2015. After months of escalating tensions and accusations, the two leaders announced that they had reached a "common understanding" on cyber espionage and security."We've agreed that neither the US or the Chinese government will conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential business information for commercial advantage," Obama said.Xi added that both governments would "not be engaged in or knowingly support online theft of intellectual properties," and would "establish a high-level joint dialogue mechanism on the fight against cybercrimes and related issues."The announcement was seen as a major diplomatic win for Obama, coming after escalating tensions between the US and China over cyber espionage.In 2014, the US Justice Department filed charges against five People's Liberation Army (PLA) officers, accusing them of the widespread targeting of US companies and entities. While there was little chance of prosecuting the men, all of whom were based in China, the charges were a major shot across Beijing's bow, and sparked outrage in the Chinese capital.The US ambassador was summoned to meet with Foreign Ministry official Zheng Zeguang, who told him "the Chinese government and military and its associated personnel have never conducted or participated in the theft of trade secrets over the internet," and accused the US government of having an "overbearing and hypocritical" attitude to cybersecurity, according to state media.Despite Beijing's denials, US officials allege that around this time Chinese hackers pulled off their most daring hack ever, breaking into the Office of Personnel Management and stealing the personal data of tens of millions of current and former government employees.Nevertheless, while the Obama-Xi deal was limited and full of compromises, it still served as a much-needed reset just as tensions were threatening to boil over.Limited successWhile initial assessments of the 2015 deal were good, and there appears to have been a drop in breaches of US entities by Chinese-linked groups, the problem did not go away.A report this year from the US government's National Counterintelligence and Security Center said that China "continues to use cyber espionage to support its strategic development goals -- science and technology advancement, military modernization, and economic policy objectives.""The Intelligence Community and private sector security experts continue to identify ongoing Chinese cyber activity, although at lower volumes than existed before (the 2015 deal)," it added.On Thursday, the US Department of Justice indicted two Chinese nationals -- Zhu Hua and Zhang Shilong -- it said were members of a hacking group operating in China known within the cybersecurity community as Advanced Persistent Threat 10 (APT10). Contrary to the original rosy assessments of the deal, the DOJ claims that Zhu and Zhang began their operations in 2014 and continued through 2018."The indictment alleges that the defendants were part of a group that hacked computers in at least a dozen countries and gave China's intelligence service access to sensitive business information," Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said. "This is outright cheating and theft, and it gives China an unfair advantage at the expense of law-abiding businesses and countries that follow the international rules in return for the privilege of participating in the global economic system."Back to normalAs tensions rise once again -- amid an ongoing US-China trade war and a diplomatic tussle over the detention of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou -- the broad outlines of Beijing's capabilities and motivations are fairly well known. What remains unclear are Washington's.In the statement Friday, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was an "open secret that relevant US government agencies have long engaged in large-scale and organized cyber theft and surveillance against foreign governments, companies and individuals.""The 'cyber theft' accusations against China by the US are purely groundless counter-charges and can deceive no one but itself. China will never accept such charges," the statement added.China has long insisted it is also a victim of cyber attacks, but it does not usually go public about incidents like the US does. Nor do Chinese companies routinely reveal breaches or accuse other countries of carrying out campaigns against them.The US vociferously objects to any allegation it carries out cyber attacks for commercial or trade purposes, as China has been accused of doing.What is undeniable is that the US has an advanced cyber operation carrying out traditional espionage, defensive and even offensive actions. Many observers suggested at the time of the Obama-Xi deal that it was confined to commercial issues precisely because the White House did not want to limit its own intelligence-gathering capabilities.Earlier this year, the Pentagon issued new guidelines encouraging the building of a "more lethal force" of first-strike hackers able to "disrupt or halt malicious cyber activity at its source, including activity that falls below the level of armed conflict." Washington has in the past been linked to alleged cyber attacks against Iran and North Korea.In 2017, Wikileaks dumped thousands of computer files it said belonged to the Central Intelligence Agency, including sophisticated hacking tools and cyber weapons capable of compromising smartphones, computer networks and numerous other targets.And while the targets of Washington's cyber warriors may be different to Beijing's, their techniques are likely to be similar -- especially when it comes to intelligence gathering.Human weaknessBoth the Area 1 report and the latest DOJ indictments show that for well-resourced hackers like those working for state-sponsored groups, cyber espionage can sometimes be absurdly simple.While the campaign described in the recent DOJ indictments is more sophisticated, the method used to break into the European Union communication network relied far more on human engineering -- and human sloppiness -- than ultra-sophisticated software.In both cases the potential for damage, and the amount of information the attackers were able to acquire, was huge.Area 1 documented a coordinated phishing campaign against dozens of government agencies, think tanks, NGOs and trades unions. Phishing, the report's authors said, remains the number one way for attackers to breach a network, used in nine out of 10 incidents.It is also one of the hardest tactics to guard against, relying more on human engineering rather than coding. In a phishing attack, a target receives an email which appears to be trustworthy, encouraging them to click on a link or open a file.The genius of a well-run phishing campaign is how the attackers can work their way up an organization. Rather than going straight after the ultimate target -- such as an employee with access to sensitive data, who may be more on guard -- the hackers look for the weak links. Once they have compromised one account, even if it provides no information, it can be used to launch new phishing attacks from directly within the company's network.Few people who work within a big corporate network question links and attachments sent from a trusted colleague. Even if employees are suspicious, if their colleague's account is thoroughly compromised the attacker will have access to emails and instant messages they can use to make their phishing attack as realistic-looking as possible."Very little about cyber attacks is cutting-edge computer science," wrote the authors of the Area 1 report. "Cyber actors continually use their imagination to find the weakest links in the digital chain, breaching their intended targets through open side doors instead of breaking the locks down on the front door."Increasingly, those side doors don't even belong to the targeted company. According to the DOJ release, APT10 targeted managed service providers (MSPs), "companies that remotely manage the information technology infrastructure of businesses and governments around the world."Once the hackers had broken into an MSP, they were able to access the data of numerous companies and government bureaus at once. In once instance, the hackers "obtained unauthorized access to the computers of an MSP that had offices in the Southern District of New York and compromised the data of that MSP and certain ... clients involved in banking and finance, telecommunications and consumer electronics, medical equipment, packaging, manufacturing, consulting, healthcare, biotechnology, automotive, oil and gas exploration, and mining."How to stop such attacks remains unclear. State-sponsored groups have potentially unlimited resources -- not only unknown computer exploits which cannot be guarded against, but also the time and patience to constantly probe companies and government entities for weaknesses."Because the cybersecurity doom narrative has become so embellished, we've lost our nerve to take action to prevent future damages," the Area 1 report said. "Our democracy remains susceptible to cybersecurity attacks; our computing infrastructure is permeated with deep vulnerabilities; major corporations entrusted with the safeguarding of information continue to be compromised; and we as individuals have adopted a laissez-faire attitude towards the whole thing."Load-Date: December 22, 2018End of Document

After months of escalating tensions and accusations, the two leaders announced that they had reached a "common understanding" on cyber espionage and security."We've agreed that neither the US or the Chinese government will conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential business information for commercial advantage," Obama said.Xi added that both governments would "not be engaged in or knowingly support online theft of intellectual properties," and would "establish a high-level joint dialogue mechanism on the fight against cybercrimes and related issues."The announcement was seen as a major diplomatic win for Obama, coming after escalating tensions between the US and China over cyber espionage.In 2014, the US Justice Department filed charges against five People's Liberation Army (PLA) officers, accusing them of the widespread targeting of US companies and entities. While there was little chance of prosecuting the men, all of whom were based in China, the charges were a major shot across Beijing's bow, and sparked outrage in the Chinese capital.The US ambassador was summoned to meet with Foreign Ministry official Zheng Zeguang, who told him "the Chinese government and military and its associated personnel have never conducted or participated in the theft of trade secrets over the internet," and accused the US government of having an "overbearing and hypocritical" attitude to cybersecurity, according to state media. Despite Beijing's denials, US officials allege that around this time Chinese hackers pulled off their most daring hack ever, breaking into the Office of Personnel Management and stealing the personal data of tens of millions of current and former government employees.Nevertheless, while the Obama-Xi deal was limited and full of compromises, it still served as a much-needed reset just as tensions were threatening to boil over.Limited successWhile initial assessments of the 2015 deal were good, and there appears to have been a drop in breaches of US entities by Chinese-linked groups, the problem did not go away. A report this year from the US government's National Counterintelligence and Security Center said that China "continues to use cyber espionage to support its strategic development goals -- science and technology advancement, military modernization, and economic policy objectives." "The Intelligence Community and private sector security experts continue to identify ongoing Chinese cyber activity, although at lower volumes than existed before (the 2015 deal)," it added.On Thursday, the US Department of Justice indicted two Chinese nationals -- Zhu Hua and Zhang Shilong -- it said were members of a hacking group operating in China known within the cybersecurity community as Advanced Persistent Threat 10 (APT10). Contrary to the original rosy assessments of the deal, the DOJ claims that Zhu and Zhang began their operations in 2014 and continued through 2018."The indictment alleges that the defendants were part of a group that hacked computers in at least a dozen countries and gave China's intelligence service access to sensitive business information," Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said. "This is outright cheating and theft, and it gives China an unfair advantage at the expense of law-abiding businesses and countries that follow the international rules in return for the privilege of participating in the global economic system."Back to normal As tensions rise once again -- amid an ongoing US-China trade war and a diplomatic tussle over the detention of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou -- the broad outlines of Beijing's capabilities and motivations are fairly well known. What remains unclear are Washington's. In the statement Friday, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was an "open secret that relevant US government agencies have long engaged in large-scale and organized cyber theft and surveillance against foreign governments, companies and individuals.""The 'cyber theft' accusations against China by the US are purely groundless counter-charges and can deceive no one but itself. China will never accept such charges," the statement added.China has long insisted it is also a victim of cyber attacks, but it does not usually go public about incidents like the US does. Nor do Chinese companies routinely reveal breaches or accuse other countries of carrying out campaigns against them.The US vociferously objects to any allegation it carries out cyber attacks for commercial or trade purposes, as China has been accused of doing. What is undeniable is that the US has an advanced cyber operation carrying out traditional espionage, defensive and even offensive actions. Many observers suggested at the time of the Obama-Xi deal that it was confined to commercial issues precisely because the White House did not want to limit its own intelligence-gathering capabilities.Earlier this year, the Pentagon issued new guidelines encouraging the building of a "more lethal force" of first-strike hackers able to "disrupt or halt malicious cyber activity at its source, including activity that falls below the level of armed conflict." Washington has in the past been linked to alleged cyber attacks against Iran and North Korea.In 2017, Wikileaks dumped thousands of computer files it said belonged to the Central Intelligence Agency, including sophisticated hacking tools and cyber weapons capable of compromising smartphones, computer networks and numerous other targets. And while the targets of Washington's cyber warriors may be different to Beijing's, their techniques are likely to be similar -- especially when it comes to intelligence gathering. Human weaknessBoth the Area 1 report and the latest DOJ indictments show that for well-resourced hackers like those working for state-sponsored groups, cyber espionage can sometimes be absurdly simple. While the campaign described in the recent DOJ indictments is more sophisticated, the method used to break into the European Union communication network relied far more on human engineering -- and human sloppiness -- than ultra-sophisticated software.In both cases the potential for damage, and the amount of information the attackers were able to acquire, was huge. Area 1 documented a coordinated phishing campaign against dozens of government agencies, think tanks, NGOs and trades unions. Phishing, the report's authors said, remains the number one way for attackers to breach a network, used in nine out of 10 incidents. It is also one of the hardest tactics to guard against, relying more on human engineering rather than coding. In a phishing attack, a target receives an email which appears to be trustworthy, encouraging them to click on a link or open a file.The genius of a well-run phishing campaign is how the attackers can work their way up an organization. Rather than going straight after the ultimate target -- such as an employee with access to sensitive data, who may be more on guard -- the hackers look for the weak links. Once they have compromised one account, even if it provides no information, it can be used to launch new phishing attacks from directly within the company's network.Few people who work within a big corporate network question links and attachments sent from a trusted colleague. Even if employees are suspicious, if their colleague's account is thoroughly compromised the attacker will have access to emails and instant messages they can use to make their phishing attack as realistic-looking as possible."Very little about cyber attacks is cutting-edge computer science," wrote the authors of the Area 1 report. "Cyber actors continually use their imagination to find the weakest links in the digital chain, breaching their intended targets through open side doors instead of breaking the locks down on the front door."Increasingly, those side doors don't even belong to the targeted company. According to the DOJ release, APT10 targeted managed service providers (MSPs), "companies that remotely manage the information technology infrastructure of businesses and governments around the world."Once the hackers had broken into an MSP, they were able to access the data of numerous companies and government bureaus at once. In once instance, the hackers "obtained unauthorized access to the computers of an MSP that had offices in the Southern District of New York and compromised the data of that MSP and certain ... clients involved in banking and finance, telecommunications and consumer electronics, medical equipment, packaging, manufacturing, consulting, healthcare, biotechnology, automotive, oil and gas exploration, and mining."How to stop such attacks remains unclear. State-sponsored groups have potentially unlimited resources -- not only unknown computer exploits which cannot be guarded against, but also the time and patience to constantly probe companies and government entities for weaknesses. "Because the cybersecurity doom narrative has become so embellished, we've lost our nerve to take action to prevent future damages," the Area 1 report said. "Our democracy remains susceptible to cybersecurity attacks; our computing infrastructure is permeated with deep vulnerabilities; major corporations entrusted with the safeguarding of information continue to be compromised; and we as individuals have adopted a laissez-faire attitude towards the whole thing."TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Futures indicating a sharp selloff at the start of trading to the tune of 420 points lower on the Dow, one and two-thirds percent. The S&P is down 44 points, another one and two-thirds percent. And the Nasdaq down 143 points, better than 2 percent lower right now. At these levels, the Dow and the S&P 500 will fall back into negative territory for 2018.Investors were rattled by the arrest of the chief financial officer of Huawei. She was arrested in Canada. The news sparking fears about the trade truce between the U.S. and China getting worse.That is what is behind this market selloff this morning. Remember, it's coming after Tuesday's big selloff. The major averages all dropped better than 3 percent on Tuesday, down 800 points on the Dow Tuesday at the close.The markets, of course, were closed yesterday for the funeral of President George H.W. Bush. So this is the first time the markets opened after that closing and Tuesday's big selloff.Global markets this morning are also lower. In Europe, the major indices down better than 2 percent on the session. The FT 100 and the DAX index down 2.5 percent right now.In Asia overnight, declines across the board; worst performer was Hong Kong, down 2.5 percent with even Japan down almost 2 percent as well.Breaking news, Lyft confidentially filing for an IPO, the shares and the pricing still to be determined. We'll tell you about that.Decision day for OPEC, oil prices are sliding as well amid uncertainty over a possible production cut. A you can see crude oil right now down 2.5 percent, Brent down 2.25 percent.Plus, a final emotional farewell to President George H.W. Bush.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GEORGE W. BUSH, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Through our tears, let us know the blessings of knowing and loving you -- a great and noble man. The best father a son or daughter could have.And in our grief, let us smile knowing that Dad is hugging Robin and holding mom's hand again.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Did anyone not cry?DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: I'm also -- I'm losing it right now.BARTIROMO: It was so emotional yesterday. We're going to take you to Texas later this hour with the very latest on today's funeral proceedings.All these stories coming up this Thursday morning. And joining me to break it all down -- Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; the "Wall Street Journal's" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman; and 32Advisers CEO and former economic advisor to President Obama, Robert Wolf. It is good to see everybody this morning.ROBERT WOLF, CEO, 32ADVISERS: Good to be here.BARTIROMO: And it is a really serious selloff once again this morning on the heels of this arrest of the CFO of Huawei -- this is the, you said earlier, telecom company out of China.Markets are looking at this as a further crack in the he relationship, James.JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, "WALL STREET JOURNAL": Yes, I think it's important not to simply assume that this is Trump's China policy. You have long-standing deep bipartisan concern in Washington about the strategic threat posed by Huawei and ZTE.These are -- Huawei, the largest telecom infrastructure company in the world now, for years we have been essentially blocking them from the U.S. market because of the threat they pose, the concern that they would be used by the Chinese government as a spying tool.And you also have the sanctions issues. This is not just a Donald Trump issue, you had the issue with ZTE violating sanctions according to our government that were placed on Iran and North Korea. So there may be a lot more to this than a trade negotiation.BARTIROMO: Right. So to be clear, the speculation is that this is because they went against the Iran sanctions, that they did business with Iran.But we know that this has been an issue for a long time with Huawei, Robert Wolf. In fact, even others, America's closest allies have followed the nation's lead in terms of pointing out that Huawei has potential espionage issues, that they use this company to spy on America, on Britain.WOLF: Listen, when I was advising the president, this came up a lot.BARTIROMO: When you were advising President Obama.WOLF: President Obama -- 2011, 2012, there was real issues between himself and the president of China at that time. The House Intel Committee actually viewed both ZTE and Huawei as national security threats. They turned down the expansion of Huawei near military bases.I know Dagen was commenting before, you can't even buy Huawei phones near any military base.MCDOWELL: They're banned on all military bases worldwide.(CROSSTALK)WOLF: They're banned around the globe.MCDOWELL: That's an exclamation point.WOLF: And so this is going back six years ago. And then during the campaign in 2012, this is something that candidate Romney used to bring up a lot -- the whole idea of economic espionage and threats going on.BARTIROMO: Yes.WOLF: So this is not just an issue that took place the last 24 hours.BARTIROMO: Here's the way the Journal writes it. The Journal -- this is a page one story in the "Wall Street Journal" this morning. "For years, Washington has alleged the Chinese government could compel Huawei to tap into the hardware it sells around the world to spy or to disrupt communications.U.S. officials say they are intensifying efforts to curb Huawei because wireless carriers worldwide are about to upgrade to 5G.MCDOWELL: Right. And there -- a Justice Department investigation, the criminal probe into Huawei's dealings in Iran started in April. So this is not something that's new. This is ongoing and has been a problem literally for years.But the market reaction is clear. I still think it's about interest rates and about what the U.S. economy looks like next year.The trade issue plays into that. Was the tariff man tweet from President Trump a couple of days ago -- did that send the market down? People pointed to that. I say nay. It's part of the problem.The bigger problem is the Federal Reserve, quite frankly, and the kind of communication out of the fed and as we wait for the meeting, the final meeting of the year.BARTIROMO: Yes. I agree that it's about interest rates. But no doubt the market wants some kind of a resolution with China. And, you know, we left Tuesday thinking ok, they had a good meeting and maybe we'll come up with some deals or agreements in the next 90 days and now this.There's also oil. Oil is in bear market territory. Take a look at the price of oil right now, because it is down this morning another 2.5 percent. This is off of the lows. The OPEC meeting is happening, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, meeting in Vienna today. And on the docket is a decision to cut oil production between OPEC and Russia by 1 million to 1.4 million barrels a day.President Trump tweeted about the cut, writing this. "Hopefully OPEC will be keeping oil flows as is, not restricted. The world does not want to see or need higher oil prices.Joining us right now in Chicago is Price Futures Group senior account executive, author of "The Energy Report", Phil Flynn. Phil -- good to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.PHIL FLYNN, SENIOR ACCOUNT EXECUTIVE, PRICE FUTURES GROUP: Good morning -- Maria. Great to be here. Boy.BARTIROMO: What's troubling oil today? I mean, you know, square that circle in terms of what the market's doing ahead of this OPEC meeting.FLYNN: I think there's three main things. Obviously concerns about economic growth. I mean that is a concern when we saw the stock market get worried, the Huawei news, concerns that we're going to have a big trade war. That sent the market really reeling.But also too, uncertainty coming out of this OPEC cartel meeting today. You know, the trade was pretty much assuming that a production cut was a done deal, you know, that we would see probably at least a million barrels from OPEC, maybe as much as 175,000 from Russia up to 300,000 barrels a day.But we heard from the Saudi energy minister today Khalid al-Falih, that says hey, not so fast. We really haven't agreed to anything yet and we're going to kind of wait to see what Russia is going to come to the table with.You know, the Russians have been playing a little bit coy right now. The Russian energy companies can still make money at these lower prices, Saudi Arabia cannot, and they're a little bit reluctant to cut production. So this deal that we thought was in the bag 24 hours ago may not be in the bag at all. And we might not get a cut or if we do get a cut, it might be smaller than we originally assumed.WOLF: Phil, one question. Now, you mentioned a lot about Russia and Saudi. But two things. What about Qatar leaving OPEC? And how do you view the whole situation with Iran, you know, needing the money to sell more oil?FLYNN: Yes, I think there was a lot of concerns that that could be the breakup of the OPEC cartel. Now, Qatar is basically coming back and saying listen, it's not about that we're upset with Saudi Arabia or we've become marginalized in the cartel. It's more about our focus on natural gas production.But a lot of market watchers are saying wait a minute, there's a lot of people in the cartel that are very upset with the way Saudi Arabia and Russia are basically dictating oil policy for the world that everybody else in the cartel really doesn't matter what they think, because it's only what these two countries think.So there is concern that Qatar could be the first of other members that may leave the cartel in the future. Some people are speculating that either Iran and Iraq want out because they're not getting what they want out of Saudi Arabia. But, you know, right now the focus is more on what they're going to do in the next 24 hours.MCDOWELL: I just want to point out. Qatar produces less oil that New Mexico. So in terms of its overall production, it's irrelevant.FLYNN: Right. There you go.But are you saying New Mexico should join OPEC? I don't know. I didn't get that but yes, that's true.MCDOWELL: We are -- you know what, we are a counter as a nation, with our great oil producing states, we are a counter to OPEC, stronger than OPEC in some regards.FREEMAN: Well, related to that --(CROSSTALK)FREEMAN: we used to generally think cheap oil is good for the U.S. economy. Obviously since so much energy production has moved to the U.S. We now look at cheap oil when a lot of people say that's going to reduce business investment.President Trump with his tweet obviously is still in the cheap oil is good camp. Do you have a view on the overall economic impact? Do we want it cheap or expensive for the good of the economy.FLYNN: I think you have to be careful what you tweet for. Because, you know, Donald Trump has been tweeting lower that lower oil prices are good but crashing oil prices aren't good for anybody.You know, in the U.S. we've seen what has happened to the U.S. shale industry when prices have gone sub-$50. We've seen bankruptcies. We've seen hold-backs in production. And even though the U.S. shale producers are stronger than they ever have been before, what I'm hearing from the shell patch (ph) right now is they don't like Donald Trump tweeting about lower oil prices.They're getting to their point of pain. And if prices fall any further you are going to see a major pullback in the U.S. shale industry.MCDOWELL: Yes. Every time the President tweets about lower oil prices, the people who watch this program who live in Texas, tweet the show going "Wait a minute, buddy".FLYNN: Sure. Wait a second.(CROSSTALK)FLYNN: You are a pro-energy guy, yes.BARTIROMO: We had the CEO of Marathon Petroleum on yesterday and he said we were about at the level now that shale companies are going to start seeing pressure if oil prices go any lower. And we could very well see production slow down as a result of where we are right now, from the shale producers. So he was actually really worried in terms of what this current price means right here for shale.FLYNN: And I think he's absolutely right. Listen, you know what, we've heard in the past that shale oil producers have been more efficient. They do a much better job. They can do things more efficiently.BARTIROMO: Yes.FLYNN: And that's absolutely true. But at the same time a lot of these companies, especially the smaller ones, are buried deep in debt. They've spent a lot of money to get this oil out of the ground. And there are actually -- many of these companies are actually paying more money per barrel than they can get by selling it right now. So that's not a win-win for anybody.BARTIROMO: All right. Phil -- we will keep watching that. Thanks so much, Phil Flynn for weighing in here --FLYNN: Thank you.BARTIROMO: -- during this OPEC meeting.Coming up, remembering an American patriot, the latest as mourners gather in Texas to remember President George H.W. Bush.Plus, a potential risk to your children. See what common household medicine is being recalled this morning.Back in a moment.BARTIROMO: And a final farewell for President George H.W. Bush. Sports teams are paying a special tribute. William La Jeunesse is in College Station, Texas this morning covering this. William -- good morning to you.WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning -- Maria.Anyone who has lost someone knows you just try get through that funeral service without breaking down. Imagine what an emotional roller coaster it has been for the Bush family. And then later this morning they'll have a eulogy from James Baker as well as the President's grandson.But are at Texas A&M University. What you see behind me is the Bush Presidential Library which celebrates as a portrait of his accomplishments in this life. But it is also, nearby, the home of the Bush School of Public Service. That is his living legacy, 70 percent of the graduates go into public service.Now, the rest of the year A&M teams will wear this presidential logo, including the football team at the upcoming Gator Bowl in honor obviously of the President.Now A&M originated as a military college. It's one of the reasons that the president chose to put his library here back in 1990 when he was still in office. And it is also his final resting place.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He could be in Arlington National Cemetery but he's going to be at Texas A&M which says a lot about his heart being a lot like the heart of us. It means a lot to us.(END VIDEO CLIP)LA JEUNESSE: So there's a church service this morning in Houston at 10:00 a.m. Following that, there will be a funeral train leaving at 1:00 p.m. for the 70-mile trip here to College Station. No stops, it will go slow but also sides of the actual funeral car will be plexiglass allowing people along the route to say farewell to the President.It kind of recalls a whole another era, right, going back to Abraham Lincoln, Garfield -- also the last one in 1969 with President Eisenhower but it was mentioned yesterday in this speech from Jon Meacham comparing the President with President Lincoln.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JON MEACHAM, PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN: And George H.W. Bush's "thousand points of light" are companion verses in America's national hymn. For Lincoln and Bush both called on us to choose the right over the convenient, to hope rather than to fear, and to heed not our worst impulses but our best instincts.(END VIDEO CLIP)LA JEUNESSE: So the train will arrive here at 3:25 local time. The family will depart from the passenger cars, followed by the casket. They'll be met by a chorus of cadets, military cadets as well as the Aggie Marching Band.The navy will have a 21-jet salute and also perform that missing man maneuver where the third jet will streak to the heavens signaling or amplifying if you will the passing of the President.The familiar will be on camera here until they go over bridge into a tree- lined area where the actual burial plot is for the President where he will join or be next -- laid next to wife Barbara, as well as their daughter Robin who died at age three of leukemia.Then we will hear that final volley of three shots to exemplify that the President has indeed gone to the ages and his passing -- Maria.BARTIROMO: All right. William -- thank you. We'll be watching. William La Jeunesse joining us there in Texas.And yesterday was such an emotional day. I mean I cried but I also laughed. Alan Simpson was so funny and to see President Bush, 43, you know, making a joke about Alan Simpson, I mean, there was so much love and support in the room.And then when G.W. took the podium, I didn't cry until G.W. took the podium. But then, I mean it was so emotional, wasn't it? You cried too, right?MCDOWELL: I cried a lot. You used the humor to show the world and remember President H.W. Bush for who he was, a man who, as they said, loved a good joke but could never remember a punch line.BARTIROMO: That was very funny.MCDOWELL: But it's also a device that you use wisely to keep it from getting overly emotional. And if you noticed in President Bush's eulogy to his father, just when he would start to kind of get very emotional, you throw in a joke. You get -- and so kind of the dam broke open at the very end of that eulogy, rightfully so, when he was talking about hugging Robin and holding Barbara's hand again.BARTIROMO: So much to talk with that. We didn't even mention the shot of President Trump and our first lady, Melania, with the Obamas and the Clintons and the Carters. That was some shot, wasn't it?FREEMAN: Yes, it was a nice kind of moment of grace and comity, civility. We've been missing some of that in our politics.BARTIROMO: It's true. It's true.(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: Can I just quickly point out though, I got an alert on my phone during the funeral, while it was still going on, from the daily mail, talking about the frosty moment that stone-face Hillary ignores Trump and Melania at the funeral. And it was during the funeral, apparently they deleted the article.But come on, can we all have some civility and show respect and grace to the family.WOLF: I will just say that the thing that really stuck in me was it was all about family and service.BARTIROMO: Yes.WOLF: Just it felt like continually about what an amazing man.BARTIROMO: It's true.And business is continuing. Zuckerberg is under the microscope. The CEO of Facebook facing new scrutiny. We've got that after this.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.China concerns are weighing on global markets this morning. The future of a trade truce now worrying investors after the arrest of the CFO of Huawei.The market is down but off of the lows. The Dow Jones Industrial Average right now expected to be down 386 points, that's 1.5 percent lower at the opening of trading. the Nasdaq down 130 points, almost 2 percent.Joining us right now to talk more about privacy and technology, espionage, Global Payments CEO Jeff Sloan. Jeff -- it's good to see you. Thank you so much for joining us this morning.JEFF SLOAN, CEO, GLOBAL PAYMENTS: Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: One of the important components to Global Payments is your financial technology related to privacy. Tell us about that.SLOAN: Sure. So the most important thing to remember about our business is that our customers' the merchant, not the consumer. So the health of our business is really driven by the health of the merchant and really the health of the consumer. The higher GDP, the more people stand, the better our business is.But unlike many of our financial technology peers, we don't actually collect the data on the consumer. Instead, we're focused on the transaction.BARTIROMO: The cyber security as, you know, as a subject has been a real concern for the mobile pay industry. How do you counter that? What do your products do in terms of keeping this information safe?SLOAN: Sure, it's a great question. Our business is actually very highly- regulated already. So for example, in Europe we comply with the GDPR, the Global Data Privacy Regulation. In the United States we're audited and reviewed by the Federal Reserve for purposes of cyber security and otherwise.So actually it's a technology company and we spend about half a billion dollars a year in our business in technology, security is actually a core strength. All of our data is encrypted and tokenized. As I mentioned a minute ago, our customer's really the merchant, not the consumer. So unlike some of the folks who have had more notable privacy issues recently, we're not trying to monetize consumer data.WOLF: So for our viewers, who are your competitors? Are they the banks or are they more like Stripe and PayPal?SLOAN: So historically, Robert, they are really the banks because many of our businesses came out of financial institutions. A great example is JPMorgan, who is still in the business. But as technology has gone on, if you went back and looked five years ago, Apple was not in payments. Google was not in payments. Square didn't exist. Today, all those things do exist. So today our competitors are Square, Stripe, PayPal actually is one of our customers, but certainly in certain markets PayPal competes with us.So we have a much broader technology group of peers today than you would have had in banks many years ago.FREEMAN: And what do you specifically do as a company, if anything, to prevent your intellectual property, your software, your copyrights from being violated in China?SLOAN: So the way we go about our business is in certain markets, both by policy as well as regulation, and China is actually one of them. Our data has to reside within the four walls of that country.So for example, in Russia, coming now in India with their most recent regulatory moves and also in China, that data cannot leave the four walls of China. As a result, we have largely isolated our technology environments in those markets.We're not going to get the economies of scale as a technology matter and bringing it out anyway. That data needs to reside within the four walls of China so those businesses are largely hived off from a technology point of view from the rest of Global Payments making it therefore more secure within the walls of China and globally.WOLF: How many countries are you in.SLOAN: So Robert, we are physically in 31 countries. It's going to be 32 in January as we go into Mexico with HSBC. But 31 countries today. We do business tho9ugh cross border in 58. So we have the broadest group of technology services if you go back to the folks that you mentioned before - - Stripe, Square and the like. We're the broadest group of anywhere in the world.BARTIROMO: Did you have to transfer your technology to your Chinese counterparts or the Chinese government in order to operate there?SLOAN: No, we're regulated in those markets, in China in particular by the local governments. But no, in general, those are local instances with local technology providers in that market. And it's not the same technology that we use elsewhere around the world.MCDOWELL: Which of the countries in which you operate is the most difficult to deal with?SLOAN: Well, the most important thing in our business is just really the health of the consumer. So the way I think about your question is how well is the consumer doing.MCDOWELL: I'm talking about the government.SLOAN: From a regulatory --MCDOWELL: Yes, from a regulatory and government pressure point of view.SLOAN: Well, we're regulated in every market we're in. There's really no one that's better or worse. I would say as time has gone on, increasingly having to keep all of our data and technology within a given market in China, Russia, in India presents a bit of a scale challenge to our business because we prefer to be able to do that centrally here in the United States.But that's been true for a number of years. And that's not specific to any one country. All three of those countries, for example, have that regulation today.BARTIROMO: So Jeff -- let's get into e-commerce a bit because the worry in this market as we look at interest rates where they are and as we look at the market selloff related to worries over the global slowdown -- what are you seeing in terms of e-commerce?SLOAN: So the consumer is very healthy in our business. We just reported in November for our September quarter, our second best quarter ever and was pretty much tied with the second quarter which was our best quarter ever. And our outlook for this holiday season and the fourth quarter is a continuation of the best quarters that we've seen the last couple quarters.So our e-commerce business, Maria, for example just grew in the high teens in the most recent quarter and has doubled in the last three years. We're the second largest provider of e-commerce acquiring service in the world.So we are very optimistic in our business as e-commerce not grows just with GDP but takes increasing share from physical store presence.BARTIROMO: Well, what about on the horizon? I mean the worry really is in the next two years that things are slowing down. Do you have any indications of a slowdown in the two year horizon ahead.SLOAN: NO, we do not. The only place that you really see that, Maria, is in foreign exchange rates. As I mentioned, in answer to Robert's question, we operate in 58 countries around the world. The U.S. is our home market and three quarters of our business. But we have a billion dollars of revenue that's outside the United States. And you guys can see what's happening in F.X. daily. Putting that aside, for example, we have not seen any impact from the tariffs and the other trade things that you've seen in the -- in the press. That can change going forward but that's where we are today.FREEMAN: So, are people actually using Bitcoin or is it still kind of a promising technology and a curiosity for hobbyists?SLOAN: So we've enabled Bitcoin acceptance since 2014 in global payments or technology company. But there's really no volume on it. The reason for that is it's much more of a commodity today than it is a currency. Until the volatility settles down on Bitcoin, it's very hard for our merchants to accept that as a method of payment. For example, groceries might have a wholesale -- grocery wholesales by one and two percent margin. If the thing moves four points a day, it's very hard for a grocer to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's a good --WOLF: So, you're in payments in 30 plus countries. What's the underlying capital that you have to put into each country? Is it capitalized, all your businesses in? Because you know, I've been in -- you know, When I ran UBS, you know, our biggest concern was you have a global business and then you get ring fenced on your capital.SLOAN: So, that's really not true in our business. 85 percent of what we do Robert is really run right here at the United States as a technology matter. Now, we do spend a lot in capital. It's a technology company. This year we'll spend $200 million on capital, the vast majority which is going right into technology. But that's driven at scale, it means scale economy --BARTIROMO: Well, FinTech has been the hottest thing. I know you've been doing your fair share of acquisitions. More consolidation you think for technology and financial services?SLOAN: Absolutely, Maria. It's scale in a scale business. More scale in a scale business is a good thing, so I expect that to continue.BARTIROMO: Jeff, it's good to have you on the show today.SLOAN: Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Jeff Sloan, joining us there, Global Payments CEO.Coming up, Lyft confidentially filing for an IPO, the number of shares and pricing still to be determined. We're going to have any details there when we come back.And then, parents beware, a massive recall of infant ibuprofen to tell you about. That's next. Back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.

We will tell you all about it coming up.But first, our top story this half an hour, markets are sliding again amid China concerns. And for many investors there's a worry about an economic slowdown, even a recession on the horizon.On "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES", former vice president Dan Quayle weighed in about the state of the economy right ahead of the president's reelection campaign.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DAN QUAYLE (R), FORMER VICE PRESIDENT UNDER GEORGE H.W. BUSH, UNITED STATES: I don't know what the state of the economy will be in 2020. It's good now. We're a long way away. Nobody can really predict what it's going to be in 2020. And the economy is obviously key. President Trump ran on that, bringing jobs back to America, increasing wages for the workers. It's all good right now. What's it going to be in 2020?If the economy slips, then it will be a real challenge for President Trump.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Our next guest has his own warning for President Trump in a new op-ed today title this: A Trump slump would sink the president. And he writes the biggest political boogeyman is the very real fear that 2019 may be the year the U.S. economy goes into a Trump slump.Joining us right now is the author, "THE FIVE" co-host, Juan Williams, he's also the author of the book, What The Hell Do You Have to Lose?Juan, it's good to see you. Thank you so much for being here.JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Good chilly morning.BARTIROMO: Yes, chilly morning. Well, the president ran on economy, on jobs, and we did see a better growth as a result of his policies but now we've got all these worries about growth coming down.WILLIAMS: We sure do. And this week is the week of tariff man, which was the tweet that I think sent the market into its slide. And that now we have the arrest of that Chinese national that again, antagonizes a difficult relationship. So I think that initially the thought was President Trump's a business man and he's doing business here, he's negotiating with the Chinese in hopes of getting a better deal. But the tariffs have had a real negative impact, not only in terms of agriculture in the middle of the country, Rust Belt areas that he would rely on for re- election. But I think it's impacted the global economy in a way that he probably had not anticipated.MCDOWELL: I want to push back on something though. Don't the Democrats need to be real careful that they don't talk down the economy, that they come across maybe like you, Juan, as if you're hoping for a recession, because it benefits whoever is a Democratic nominee.WILLIAMS: You think I'm coming across like I'm hoping for a recession?MCDOWELL: No, I think --BARTIROMO: Are you?WILLIAMS: No. I think it's very --MCDOWELL: I think that you got to be careful, though. That's all I'm saying politically.WILLIAMS: I just think -- I think in fact in the column, what I said was that people like Rush Limbaugh who said he hoped Obama failed or Bill Maher who said you know, you can recover from a recession but it's hard to recover from a president like Trump, I think that kind of stuff is negative because I'm so pro American. But I do think that you have to look at the realities. What you hear from President Trump supporter is markets adjust, go up and down, we've been going so well.But now that we've lost most of the gains for the year, you just have to look at harsh realities, try to move away from the tribal response and just say what's going on with this economy. And I think the markets as we can see over the last few days are saying this looks like housing markets down, it looks like what we're seeing in terms of investment, the bond markets, the attacks the president has had on Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve saying that he's a bigger threat than China defending negative --BARTIROMO: Last time I checked you had a GDP of 3-1/2 percent.WILLIAMS: Correct and so I think this is what you just heard from Dan Quayle in your very good interview Maria, that in fact, you know, look, things have been going pretty well. But when you see the market going down as it has been and when you see the kind of convulsions we've seen this week in response to tariff now, I think you'd be foolish not to say there's some dark clouds on the horizon.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's a fair comment.MCDOWELL: I said all along that the president ran the risk talking about the market over and over and over again as it is running up and hitting new records that you own it -- you try to own it on the way up, then you're going to own it on the way down. And I've said that all along. Do what Ronald Reagan did and say on the day of the 1987 crash, markets go up, markets go down, don't weigh in on it.I'm saying that politically if you're running for the Democratic nomination, if you're running against President Trump in less than two years, then you ought to be careful too, you meaning Democrats ought to be careful talking about the market. Emphasizing when the market goes down, emphasizing when there's a bad piece of economic data because, again, people turn on that. They will turn away from that.WILLIAMS: Well, I mean, don't forget that it was President Trump who said you know, that President Obama couldn't run an economy. If you want to just go in terms of Republican, Democrat, I mean, President Trump comes in and says look at all the jobs I created. President Obama comes back and says actually in the last 20 months of my term we created more jobs than the first 20 months of your incumbency.So, I mean, we can play the tribal game. What I'm saying, I don't think it takes us anywhere. I'm just saying from a heart analysis -- political analysis from my perspective there's a real problem here in terms of the prospect of this economy.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: But let's just say one thing. You want to make an omelet, you've got to crack some eggs. I mean, it's messy right now because the president is going up against people that nobody else has done before. I mean, what president has actually poked China and said stop stealing our intellectual property. What president just looked at the NAFTA deal and said, you know what, this actually doesn't work for our workers. So yes, these tariffs are troubling now. We don't know what the situation's going to be right before the election.WILLIAMS: You know, we just had George H.W. Bush's funeral. George H.W. Bush remember got punished in terms of re-election once he said read my lips, no new taxes. But in terms of governance, what he said was I'm putting the country first, we want to reduce deficits. And what did he produce, a very prosperous economy for the 1990s. What we see now is huge increase in deficit that's an added weight and prompting the Fed to think about interest rates.(CROSSTALK)FREEMAN: Deficit was at a record but I think part of this idea that there might be a Trump slump is you do have to acknowledge there's been a Trump bump. I think some people have trouble with that. But the other underlying theory of the Trump slump is tax cuts don't matter. It's just like government spending, it's stimulus. The long-term incentive to invest in the U.S. is not that important. It's all a question of how much the government is giving up.BARTIROMO: See, but I don't agree, that's the thing. Tax cuts do matter. Deregulation does matter.FREEMAN: I agree but --WOLF: Maria, let me just chime in.FREEMAN: And this is not just --WOLF: James, let me just chime in first --(CROSSTALK)WOLF: Politics aside, it does not feel that good right now going into 2019. That's a fact.WILLIAMS: Right.WOLF: OK, we have an inverted yield curve which Dagen broke up -- brought up numerous times. We have oil down, OK, near bear territory. We have a situation there is going to be no tax 2.0. We will have a dysfunctional congress, OK, going into 2019 because it is going to be incredibly polarizing where you know that very little is going to get done. Also, there's a lot of situations here that to Juan's point, that it doesn't feel --BARTIROMO: Is there -- is there a --FREEMAN: We're talking about a lot of signs, a lot of soft data. So far, the hard data is pretty good.WOLF: The market is down 10 percent off the highs, the markets telling you something.BARTIROMO: By the way, is there a Democrat who has a plan for the economy?WILLIAMS: Yes, I think --BARTIROMO: Who?WILLIAMS: In fact, what they're talking about even --BARTIROMO: Who is it?WILLIAMS: -- even in this congress, they're talking about looking at ways in which to address income equality.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Lyft is filing its initial documents to go public next year. Cheryl Casone with the details, Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Well Maria, Lyft has filed its IPO registration statement confidentiality with the security -- confidential, excuse me, with the Security and Exchange Commission, SEC. The company says it's not determined the number of shares to offer or what the price range is going to be. Lyft has recently been valued at about $15 billion, we should say. Rival Uber is also planning an IPO next year. Big news though in ride sharing.OK this, Facebook's board defending a request by COO Sheryl Sandberg to ask for the George Soros (INAUDIBLE) the company stock after he called Facebook a mess. Board says the request was quote, entirely appropriate. Separately for Facebook British lawmakers have released internal e-mails at Facebook that show the company discussed the possibility of selling access to user data to third party developers. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says the company considered charging developers access to its platform to cover their cost but Facebook never sold anybody's data at the end of the day. Well, here's the data for Facebook, it's lower in the premarket, down almost three percent right now.Well, there is a major recall of liquid ibuprofen for infants. Tris Pharma is recalling bottles of the medicine because they may contain high levels of ibuprofen, too high in fact for infants. The medication is sold under the brand names equate, CVS Health and Family Wellness at Wal-Mart, CVS and Family Dollar stores. Tris Pharma says it has not received any reports of adverse reactions to the medications but they just want to be -- well, careful.And then there is this, a free promotion at Cheese Cake Factory turned into chaos. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What just happened here?(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Police as you can see here handcuffing a DoorDash delivery driver after a fight broke out at a Cheesecake Factory in Virginia. Tensions running pretty high. The restaurant got backed up. They were trying to fill all the orders. The chain gave away 40,000 slices of cheesecake. It was the 40th birthday. So it was a celebration for Cheesecake Factory that ended in like a nice little arrest that you see on television. Back to you.BARTIROMO: My God. Cheryl, thank you.CASONE: You bet.BARTIROMO: Coming up, a real-life Saint Nick in the NFL. The owner of the New Orleans Saints playing Santa Claus for Wal-Mart shoppers. That's up next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. USA Gymnastics files for bankruptcy. Jared Max with the very latest. Jared, good morning.JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: Maria, the leadership of USA Gymnastics has proven itself to be both morally and financially bankrupt. So says Attorney John Manly who represents many of the young women who were sexually abused by Larry Nassar, former USA Gymnastics medical coordinator. Now because of hundreds of lawsuits against the organization, USA Gymnastics files for bankruptcy and this could very well halt the civil suits. The filing says USA Gymnastics has 50 to $100 million in assets, same amount of liabilities. So it's time they save for a reorganization.Kathryn Carson chair for USA Gymnastic says while considerable changes have been made, substantial work still remains. Today's filing will allow us to continue on this path, restore the organization to one of which we can all be proud of.And now to the best of humanity. 'Tis the season of giving. New Orleans Saints, New Orleans Pelicans Owner Gayle Benson recently played the role of secret Santa. She went into a Wal-Mart in New Orleans, picked up the tab for around 400 items that people had on lay-away, cost around $93,000. The Saints confirm Gayle Benson indeed was the secret Santa.Speaking of Santa, you think the jolly bearded fat guy would be seen dead wearing these? These are the new Christmas sweater version Levitate 2 sneakers by Brooks. They cost $150 and they're available at Brooks and also Zappos. What do you think?BARTIROMO: Ugly Christmas sweaters.WOLF: I think -- I think they're going to do well.MAX: Do you remember fashion of the '80s, you look at how you know, in the 80s up bet, you know really big hair and those types of costumes and stuff that we used and we laughed at it. I wonder what we're going to look at in fashion today, because it's become like this acceptable thing, these goofy sweaters.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: What's that company Mike Murphy with the shoe company that Mike --MCDOWELL: Allbirds.BARTIROMO: Allbirds, they look like Allbirds to me.MCDOWELL: These shoe -- I run in these shoes, not the Levitate but another version of the Brooks shoe and they are awesome. They're the best running shoes that I ever had. So again, you get the technology with the --BARTIROMO: Would you wear it with the ugly sweater?MAX: Outside of December 25th --MCDOWELL: I would buy a pair of those in a heartbeat. I would absolutely buy those. And I don't know what would compare to a bi-level sholo girl mullet with a permanent. There's nothing that will ever be as bad as that. Jared Max.MAX: It's like you remember those Frankie Goes to Hollywood shirts kind of thing, right? Remember that in the 80s, big hair. You look back at your high school year book. This is the version of it. 20 years from now we're going to look back and say what is going down on our world?MCDOWELL: No way, I think yoga pants in public might be the version of that.BARTIROMO: Jared, thank you.(CROSSTALK)WOLF: I was just going to say, great with the New Orleans Saints. I mean, she's taking right after her dad.MAX: I love that -- I love that, Tom Benson, Gayle Benson, great stuff.BARTIROMO: Catch Jared's sports reports on Fox News headlines, 24/7 or on radio Sirius XM 115.Still ahead, the major arrest hitting Chinese telecom giant Huawei, the news sparking fears about the trade fight between the U.S. and China, next hour, right here, MORNINGS WITH MARIA, stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.

CHINESE NATIONAL CHARGED WITH COMMITTING THEFT OF TRADE SECRETSUS Fed NewsDecember 21, 2018 Friday 11:31 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 HT Media Ltd. All Rights ReservedLength: 561 wordsBodyWASHINGTON, Dec. 21 -- The U.S. Department of Justice issued the following press release:Hongjin Tan, a 35 year old Chinese national and U.S. legal permanent resident, was arrested on Dec. 20 and charged with theft of trade secrets. Tan is alleged to have stolen the trade secrets from his employer, a U.S. petroleum company.The announcement was made by Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers, U.S. Attorney Trent Shores for the Northern District of Oklahoma, and Special Agent in Charge Kathryn Peterson of the FBI Oklahoma City Field Office."Hongjin Tan allegedly stole trade secrets related to a product worth more than $1 billion from his U.S.-based petroleum company employer, to use for the benefit of a Chinese company where he was offered employment," said Assistant Attorney General Demers. "The theft of intellectual property harms American companies and American workers. As our recent cases show, all too often these thefts involve the Chinese government or Chinese companies. The Department recently launched an initiative to protect our economy from such illegal practices emanating from China, and we continue to make this a top priority.""The United States filed a criminal complaint against a Chinese national alleging the theft of intellectual property from a company with significant operations in Oklahoma," said U.S. Attorney Shores. "The value of the trade secrets in this case is estimated to be more than $1 billion dollars. Theft of critical research, development, and other intellectual property harms the economic prosperity and security of the United States. My office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation will utilize all tools available to respond to these types of threats. We will protect Oklahomans and Oklahoma businesses by prosecuting those who violate the law."Tan made an initial appearance Thursday before U.S. Magistrate Judge Jodi F. Jayne. A preliminary and detention hearing has been set for Dec. 26.According to the criminal complaint, Tan allegedly stole trade secrets from a U.S.-based petroleum company regarding the manufacture of a "research and development downstream energy market product." The company's methods of developing the product are of great value, both economically and to competitors. Until recently, Tan worked for the petroleum company and allegedly downloaded hundreds of files, including files related to the manufacture of the product. Investigators allege that Tan was offered a job at a company in China where he planned to use these files to benefit his new employer. Tan has been residing in the United States for the past 12 years.A criminal complaint is merely an allegation, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.The FBI conducted this investigation.Assistant U.S. Attorney Joel-lyn A.

REPORTS OF CHINA HACKING 'CREDIBLE' AS NEW ZEALAND PROFESSOR REPORTS CAR-TAMPERINGStates News ServiceNovember 20, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1221 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Chinese experts living in Australia say recent reports that China's state security police hacked and spied on Australian businesses are "credible," as a New Zealand academic researching Beijing's overseas influence said her car had been sabotaged in a potentially life-threatening manner.China's ministry of state security is overseeing a "massive hacking operation" of large Australian businesses with the code name "Operation Cloud Hopper," which has been detected by the Australian Signals Directorate, a partner in the Five Eyes intelligence grouping, according to a Fairfax Media/Nine News investigation.The report cited a senior Australian government source as saying that the operation was "a constant, significant effort to steal our intellectual property" by "hopping" from outsourced cloud storage services into a company's internal computer network.And it quoted police and intelligence officials as saying that Australian companies and universities had failed to heed repeated warnings to improve their information security in the face of advanced persistent threats by state actors.Meanwhile, New Zealand media reported that police investigation into a campaign of harassment against prominent China researcher Anne-Marie Brady has widened to include apparent efforts to sabotage her car.Brady, who researches the overseas influence campaigns of the Chinese Communist Party's United Front Work department, has been subjected to a series of mysterious break-ins at her home and campus office in February, the New Zealand Herald reported last Friday.The "burglaries" had targeted Brady's electronic media including phones, computers and USB drives, while her car had failed a recent annual safety check owing to "unusual defects," the paper said."The vehicular sabotage represents an escalation for the case, coming on the heels of recent vitriolic editorials in local Chinese-language media describing the professor and New Zealand-Chinese democracy activists as 'anti-Chinese sons of bitches,'" it said, citing auto experts as saying that the tampering with the car's tires was almost certainly deliberate and could be life-threatening if the brakes were used suddenly.Brady has been an outspoken critic of Chinese influence overseas, calling on governments to carry out in-depth probes into the Chinese Communist Party's activities, and to devise a strategy to counteract them.China's "meddling" in the internal affairs of other nations should be defined as a national security issue and treated accordingly, she has said, suggesting updates to laws governing the funding of elections, protocols around conflicts of interest for serving and retired public servants and politicians, and sales of strategic infrastructure.'More and more barbaric'Chen Weijian, the New Zealand-based editor-in-chief of the political magazine Beijing Spring, said the targeting of Brady has escalated to the level of a threat to her personal safety."The Chinese Communist Party has continued to move against Professor Brady, with the 'warnings' now escalating to the level of a threat against her personal safety," Chen told RFA."The crux of the matter is that the New Zealand government isn't taking the burglaries at her home and office seriously enough," he said. "Why? Because the New Zealand government has been infiltrated to such an extent that the Chinese Communist Party is getting more and more barbaric."Meanwhile, the Australian hacking allegations are the latest in a string of reports of state-sponsored cyberattacks originating in China in recent years, and come after China and Australia signed a cybersecurity agreement last year not to support the theft of each other's intellectual property.John Hu, spokesman for the Australian Values Alliance, which campaigns against the Chinese Communist Party's influence in Australia, said the Fairfax/Nine News report seemed credible."Cyberattacks have been going on for some time now, both by individuals and organizations," Hu said. "But regardless of whether they are motivated by commercial interests, if they are carried out under the direction of another state, then they are malicious, without a doubt.""For example, a cyberattack on our power supply would be considered an act of war, so if these attacks are really coming from the Chinese government, they are a serious violation of our national sovereignty," he said.Feng Chongyi, an associate professor in China Studies at Sydney's University of Technology, agreed."China is using economic interdependence [between China and Australia] to conduct a very particular aspect of United Front work," Feng said, in a reference to the Chinese Communist Party's United Front Work Department, which is tasked with making allies to further party interests."It already has its agents and its so-called 'friends of China' embedded in the [Australian] government in companies and in educational establishments," Feng said. "And that human network is only going to get bigger."He said the commercial information garnered from hacking Australian companies could be highly valuable to state-owned Chinese companies' business interests, but also to China's strategic national interests."It's not just technology [they want], it's their pricing strategy, their negotiating strategies, how they fix their prices, how they negotiate with various different companies," Feng said."By hacking into their networks, [the hackers] can gain a monopoly on all of the information before negotiations take place, and improve their own position," he said.Measures against espionageThe report comes after Australia last December tightened rules on foreign lobbying and political donations, while broadening the definition of treason and espionage, while the United States has legislated to make it easier for the government to block certain kinds of investment.Last month, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence accused Beijing of interfering in the political and economic life of the U.S. by "rewarding or coercing American businesses, movie studios, universities, think tanks, scholars, journalists, and local, state and federal officials."Meanwhile, the Five Eyes nations confirmed they have been exchanging classified information on China's foreign activities with other like-minded countries since the start of the year, Reuters reported in October.Officials told the agency that the enhanced cooperation amounted to an informal expansion of the Five Eyes group on the specific issue of foreign interference, with expanding Chinese influence as the main focus.China has rejected accusations that it is seeking to influence overseas governments and that its investments are politically driven.Last month, a New Zealand lawmaker accused the opposition National Party leader of corruption, claiming that he sought to hide the source of a donation from a Chinese businessman.Party donor Zhang Yikun, who was awarded an "Order of Merit" by the New Zealand government in June for "services to New Zealand-China relations and the Chinese community," had been clearly linked by Brady to the Chinese Communist Party's United Front Work Department.Reported by Ng Yik-tung and Lau Siu-fung for RFA's Cantonese Service, and by Gao Feng for the Mandarin Service.

China issues 5G spectrum licenses amid iPhone banFierceWirelessDecember 10, 2018 Monday 12:28 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Questex Media Group LLC All Rights ReservedSection: ARTICLELength: 763 wordsByline: Mike DanoBodySignificant and dramatic developments involving the wireless industry in China continue to roll over the globe's business markets. The latest: Per Qualcomm's request, a Chinese court has agreed to issue injunctions against the sale of some of Apple's iPhones in the country. And, separately, the Chinese government has issued 5G spectrum licenses to the country's three main wireless network operators.Those developments—when combined with the ongoing saga of the arrest of Huawei's CFO in Canada—help underscore the key role that China plays in the global wireless industry as well as the increase in tensions that the brewing U.S.-China trade war is placing on the global business environment.Leading the headlines coming out of China is Qualcomm's request for preliminary injunctions against Apple. According to a Qualcomm press release, a Chinese court ordered Apple to “immediately cease infringing upon two Qualcomm patents” related to a range of iPhones, though not Apple's newest iPhone XS, XS Max and XR.“Apple continues to benefit from our intellectual property while refusing to compensate us. These court orders are further confirmation of the strength of Qualcomm's vast patent portfolio,” Qualcomm's Don Rosenberg said in a release.Apple immediately blasted the action, noting that its products will remain on Chinese store shelves."Qualcomm's effort to ban our products is another desperate move by a company whose illegal practices are under investigation by regulators around the world," Apple said in a statement, according to CNBC. "All iPhone models remain available for our customers in China. Qualcomm is asserting three patents they had never raised before, including one which has already been invalidated. We will pursue all our legal options through the courts."This latest skirmish between the two tech giants—playing out in China—stems from the ongoing patent-licensing dispute between Qualcomm (the world's largest purveyor of silicon for smartphones) and Apple (one of the world's largest smartphone vendors). At the core of that battle is Apple's argument that Qualcomm overcharges for access to its patent portfolio. Likely in response, Apple has recently shifted its silicon purchasing to Qualcomm rival Intel.But sitting beneath the Apple-Qualcomm noise is a potentially more significant development: The Chinese government's issuance of mid-band spectrum to China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom.According to MWL, both China Telecom and China Unicom received 100 MHz of 3.5 MHz spectrum (also known as the C-band), while China Mobile scored 260 MHz of spectrum in the 2.6 GHz and 4.8 GHz bands.That spectrum will allow China's state-run wireless providers to begin building out what most analysts believe will quickly grow into the world's biggest 5G network.Although some analysts had expected the Chinese government to engineer a merger between China Telecom and China Unicom as part of the build-out of 5G, that didn't happen—at least not yet. The Wall Street analysts at Jefferies said though that such a merger could still be on the table when the Chinese government decides to issue 700 MHz spectrum licenses.But the analysts also said that the ongoing turmoil around the arrest of Huawei's CFO could affect the situation.“While the extradition case could go on for months, we believe the U.S. has serious intentions to put Ms. Meng [Wanzhou] behind bars and sue Huawei as well as impose a U.S. export ban on Huawei. If that happens, it will be a serious setback to China's 5G timeline, and it will also significantly weaken China's bargaining position in the trade negotiations,” the analysts wrote in a report this morning. “China will unlikely want to build 5G without Huawei, and to get Huawei out of any potential U.S. export ban, the U.S. will likely ask for concessions in China's tech subsidy and "Buy China" policy in various industries including telecom. The likely purpose is to cut the scale of Huawei and ZTE (assuming Huawei will already lose substantial business outside of China) and China's supply chain. This could raise the cost of China's effort to build 5G, and may make merging CT and CU even more sensible/urgent than before.”Canadian officials arrested Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou—the daughter of the company's founder—last week as as part of a U.S. investigation into Huawei's alleged use of the global banking system to evade U.S. sanctions against Iran. Bail hearings on the matter continue today.The extraordinary situation sits atop ongoing negotiations between the United States and China over trade policies.Load-Date: December 14, 2018End of Document

Huawei exec's arrest opens a new front in the US-China trade warCNN WireDecember 6, 2018 Thursday 2:35 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 920 wordsByline: Analysis by Jethro Mullen, CNN BusinessDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  The conflict between the United States and China over trade and technology is expanding.The arrest of a top executive at Chinese tech giant Huawei at the request of the US government has angered Beijing, alarmed investors and raised new doubts about the fragile truce that the leaders of the world's top two economies reached just days ago."You have to see this as a significant escalation in the trade war," said Christopher Balding, a China expert at the Fulbright University Vietnam in Ho Chi Minh City.Viewed by US intelligence agencies as a national security threat, Huawei is one of China's most prominent tech companies. It sells more smartphones than Apple (AAPL) and builds telecommunications networks in countries around the world.Canadian authorities said late Wednesday that Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, had been arrested in Vancouver and that the United States is seeking her extradition. The US and Canadian governments haven't specified what charges Meng faces, but her arrest follows reports this year that the US Justice Department was investigating whether Huawei violated American sanctions on Iran."Under the Obama administration, the US indicted Chinese personnel on similar charges, but was reluctant to take more drastic action such as arresting the individuals in third countries, over fear that Beijing would retaliate against US interests in China or in other countries," Eurasia Group political risk analysts wrote in a note.Meng's arrest "suggests that the gloves are now fully off in this arena," the analysts said.What happens next to Meng, the daughter of Huawei's reclusive founder, could have huge repercussions for the US-China relationship and Huawei's business.What does it mean for the trade war?The arrest comes as the US and Chinese governments are discussing ways to tackle problems that led to their trade conflict, which has resulted in new tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of goods."This type of action will affect the atmosphere around the negotiations --- making them less likely to bring a sustainable settlement," the Eurasia Group analysts said.China's Commerce Ministry said Thursday it was confident a trade agreement with the United States could still be reached in time to hit a 90-day deadline set by President Donald Trump. But the Chinese government is clearly angry about Meng's arrest. The Foreign Ministry called on the United States and Canada to "immediately correct the wrongdoing" and restore her "personal freedom."The big question is what Beijing and Washington do now. Analysts suggest China could retaliate, and the Trump administration may be preparing other moves against Chinese interests.The stakes are extremely high."This case is like a sharp tug on a loose thread that could be part of an unraveling of the relationship," said Scott Kennedy, an expert on the Chinese economy at the Center for Strategic & International Studies in Washington. "Both sides need to proceed with abundant caution and a clear sense of their long term interests."Technology is at the heart of the trade war. The Trump administration says the huge waves of tariffs it has slapped on Chinese goods are part of an effort to stop China from getting its hands on American technology unfairly through practices like cybertheft and forcing companies to hand over trade secrets.The return to the negotiating table follows a ceasefire reached at a dinner between Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, on Saturday.Balding pointed out that the deal was reached the same day that Meng was arrested in Canada."That is very politically embarrassing to Xi," he said. "It has to be considered an escalation."What does it mean for Huawei?The arrest is one of the strongest moves yet against Huawei by US authorities. The company is largely shut out of supplying telecommunications equipment to US carriers. American officials have repeatedly alleged that the Chinese government could use Huawei products for espionage --- claims the company denies.Meng's case "could be a prelude to further action against the firm and its senior officials," Eurasia Group analysts said.Huawei's smaller rival, ZTE (ZTCOF), provides an example of how the US government could go further. The Chinese company was crippled for months after the US Commerce Department blocked it from buying vital parts from American companies. The ban threatened to put ZTE out of business and highlighted China's continued reliance on American technology, a vulnerability Beijing is eager to reduce. ZTE eventually got a reprieve after Xi personally asked Trump for help. But the crisis caused disruption for telecommunications carriers ZTE supplies around the world.A similar ban on Huawei would have a bigger impact because its equipment is more widely used.Huawei said in a statement about Meng's arrest that it "has been provided very little information regarding the charges and is not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms. Meng." "Huawei complies with all applicable laws and regulations where it operates, including applicable export control and sanction laws and regulations of the UN, US and EU," it added.The next moves in Meng's case are key."There is a lot of legal and diplomatic wrangling ahead," Balding said. "The US and Canada would not have taken this move lightly and it puts everything in a brand new light."Daniel Shane and Sherisse Pham contributed to this report.TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

China demands Canada release executive of tech giant HuaweiAssociated Press InternationalDecember 6, 2018 Thursday 9:46 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 1344 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD and ROB GILLIES, Associated PressDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - China on Thursday demanded that Canada release an executive of Chinese tech giant Huawei who was arrested in a case that compounds tensions with the U.S. and threatens to complicate trade talks.Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies Ltd., faces possible extradition to the United States, according to Canadian authorities. The Globe and Mail newspaper, citing law enforcement sources, said she is suspected of trying to evade U.S. trade curbs on Iran.Huawei, the biggest global supplier of network gear used by phone and internet companies, has been the target of deepening U.S. security concerns. Under President Donald Trump and his predecessor, Barack Obama, Washington has pressured European countries and other allies to limit use of its technology.The U.S. sees Huawei and smaller Chinese tech suppliers as possible fronts for spying and as commercial competitors.

Meng was detained in Vancouver on Saturday, the day Trump and Xi Jinping met in Argentina and announced their deal.U.S. national security adviser John Bolton told NPR that he knew of the pending arrest in advance. He declined to talk about the specifics of the case and said he didn't know if Trump knew about before it happened but added that there has been enormous concern about the practice of Chinese firms like Huawei allegedly using stolen U.S. intellectual property. He said that would be a major subject of negotiations with China.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he was given a few days advance notice of the intention of Canadian authorities to arrest her but said it was the decision of law enforcement and there was no political interference."I can assure everyone that we are a country of an independent judiciary and the appropriate authorities took the decisions in this case without any political involvement or interference," Trudeau said.He also said he could not comment further because of a publication ban. A spokesman for Canada's justice department said Meng requested the ban and the department could not comment further.Stock markets tumbled on the news, fearing renewed U.S.-Chinese tensions that threaten global economic growth. Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 2.5 percent and the DAX in Germany sank 1.8 percent. In the U.S., stocks knocked more than 780 points off the Dow Jones Industrial Average before the Dow rallied to finish just 79 points down.A Chinese government statement said Meng broke no U.S. or Canadian laws and demanded Canada "immediately correct the mistake" and release her.Beijing asked Washington and Ottawa to explain the reason for Meng's arrest, said a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang. He said arresting her without that violated her human rights.But the Ministry of Commerce signaled that Beijing wants to avoid disrupting progress toward settling a dispute with Washington over technology policy that has led them to raise tariffs on billions of dollars of each other's goods.China is confident they can reach a trade deal during the 90 days that Trump agreed to suspend U.S. tariff hikes, said a ministry spokesman, Gao Feng.Trump's tariff hikes on Chinese imports stemmed from complaints Beijing steals or pressures foreign companies to hand over technology. But U.S. officials also worry more broadly that Chinese plans for state-led creation of Chinese champions in robotics, artificial intelligence and other fields might erode U.S. industrial leadership."The United States is stepping up containment of China in all respects," said Zhu Feng, an international relations expert at Nanjing University. He said targeting Huawei, one of its most successful companies, "will trigger anti-U.S. sentiment.""The incident could turn out to be a breaking point," Zhu said.Last month, New Zealand blocked a mobile phone company from using Huawei equipment, saying it posed a "significant network security risk." The company was banned in August from working on Australia's fifth-generation network.On Wednesday, British phone carrier BT said it was removing Huawei equipment from the core of its mobile phone networks. It said Huawei still is a supplier of other equipment and a "valued innovation partner."The Wall Street Journal reported this year U.S. authorities are investigating whether Huawei violated sanctions on Iran. The Chinese government appealed to Washington to avoid any steps that might damage business confidence.Huawei's biggest Chinese rival, ZTE Corp., was nearly driven out of business this year when Washington barred it from buying U.S. technology over exports to North Korea and Iran. Trump restored access after ZTE agreed to pay a $1 billion fine, replace its executive team and embed a U.S.-chosen compliance team in the company.Huawei is regarded as far stronger commercially than ZTE. Based in Shenzhen, near Hong Kong, Huawei has the biggest research and development budget of any Chinese company and a vast portfolio of patents, making it less dependent on American suppliers.Its growing smartphone brand is among the top three global suppliers behind Samsung Electronics and Apple Inc. by number of handsets sold.Meng was changing flights in Canada when she was detained "on behalf of the United States of America" to face unspecified charges in New York, according to a Huawei statement."The company has been provided very little information regarding the charges and is not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms. Meng," the statement said.A U.S. Justice Department spokesman declined to comment.Huawei said it complies with all laws and rules where it operates, including export controls and sanctions of the U.N., the U.S. and European Union.Meng's arrest also threatened to inflame disagreements over Iran and Trump's decision to break with other governments and re-impose sanctions over the country's nuclear development.Geng, the foreign ministry spokesman, said China objects to unilateral sanctions outside the United Nations. China has said it will continue to do business with Iran despite the possible threat of U.S. penalties.Meng is a prominent member of China's business world as deputy chairman of Huawei's board and the daughter of its founder Ren Zhengfei, a former Chinese military engineer.Despite that, her arrest is unlikely to derail trade talks, said Willy Lam, a politics specialist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong."I think too much is at stake for Xi Jinping. He desperately wants a settlement," said Lam.Longer term, however, the case will reinforce official Chinese urgency about developing domestic technology suppliers to reduce reliance on the United States, said Lam.Trump has "pulled out all the stops" to hamper Chinese ambitions to challenge the U.S. as a technology leader, Lam said. That includes imposing limits on visas for Chinese students to study science and technology."If the Chinese need further convincing, this case would show them beyond doubt Trump's commitment," said Lam.Gordon Houlden, director of the China Institute at the University of Alberta, said Canada and the U.S. have an extradition treaty and Canada has obligations that not even the prime minister can change."The prime minister cannot call up the judge and say 'please free this person.' Short of abrogating the treaty, this will roll on," Houlden said. "This is a really tough one for Canada. Our hands are largely tied by the extradition treaty."David Mulroney, a former Canadian ambassador to China, said U.S. and Canadian business executives could face reprisals in China."That's something we should be watching out for. It's a possibility. China plays rough," Mulroney said.

China demands Canada release executive of tech giant HuaweiAssociated Press Financial WireDecember 6, 2018 Thursday 9:46 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 1344 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD and ROB GILLIES, Associated PressDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - China on Thursday demanded that Canada release an executive of Chinese tech giant Huawei who was arrested in a case that compounds tensions with the U.S. and threatens to complicate trade talks.Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies Ltd., faces possible extradition to the United States, according to Canadian authorities. The Globe and Mail newspaper, citing law enforcement sources, said she is suspected of trying to evade U.S. trade curbs on Iran.Huawei, the biggest global supplier of network gear used by phone and internet companies, has been the target of deepening U.S. security concerns. Under President Donald Trump and his predecessor, Barack Obama, Washington has pressured European countries and other allies to limit use of its technology.The U.S. sees Huawei and smaller Chinese tech suppliers as possible fronts for spying and as commercial competitors. The Trump administration says they benefit from improper subsidies and market barriers.The timing of the arrest is awkward following the announcement of a U.S.-Chinese cease-fire in a trade war that has its roots in Beijing's technology policy. Meng was detained in Vancouver on Saturday, the day Trump and Xi Jinping met in Argentina and announced their deal.U.S. national security adviser John Bolton told NPR that he knew of the pending arrest in advance.

SEN. CRUZ: 'CHINA IS GAINING ACCESS TO AMERICAN SECRETS USING NON-TRADITIONAL APPROACHES TO CONDUCT ESPIONAGE AGAINST OUR ALLIES'States News ServiceDecember 12, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 856 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, D.C. BodyThe following information was released by Texas Senator Ted Cruz:U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today questioned administration officials on the threats of China's non-traditional espionage against the United States. There, he expressed his concerns of China's espionage activities stating, "I'm increasingly concerned that China is gaining access to American secrets using non-traditional all-of-nation approaches to conduct espionage against our allies." Sen. Cruz directed his line of questioning to address concerns of Chinese espionage, as well as the threat it imposes to the United States' safety and security.Watch Sen. Cruz's full line of questioning here. A full transcript is below. Sen. Cruz: Good morning, thank you for being here gentlemen. Thank you for your service. I'm increasingly concerned that China is gaining access to American secrets using non-traditional all-of-nation approaches to conduct espionage against our allies. Chinese company Huawei has maneuvered itself into a dominant position providing communication infrastructure across the globeincluding to major allies like Canada. For each of the witnesses, can you assess the risks presented by such practices, especially as they relate to Huawei? Hon. Christopher Krebs: So, when it comes to Huawei specifically[but] Chinese technology companieswe kind of break things down in terms of hardware, gear, and things like that but also information access. So, itsthe challenge is obviously broader than Huawei, it would also include China Mobile, China Telecom, China Unicom, who has access to the data, and then how do they access that data. I would say that globally, when you think about the exposure that China hasits Huawei-like companiesit is fairly broad. There is an awakening though and I wouldn't take away from the fact that a company in a country has done a deal with Huawei as that country accepting risk of working with Huawei. I think the risk tolerance needle is shifting. Here section 889 of the National Defense Authorization Act, which deals with Huawei and others, I think is a step forward in progress beyond the work we've already done. As we shift into 5G it is important that we communicate the risks associated with advancing technology. With our technology companies throughas we've talked about with our Five Eyes partners. I think we do have increasing common understanding of those risks looking forward, but yes there is work to be done here. Mr. Bill Priestap: The Chinese government does not share our government's values. To me a great example of that is their cyber security laws that they enacted over the last few years which provides their government access to user data from any of their telecommunications or cyber companies. When they want it, whatever they want, they can do whatever they want with that. They basically can exploit that data however they want. With China'swith Huawei's let's call it 'growing position globally' and other telecommunications, we have to understand that then means the company, the data, the user data that those companies possess can be utilized by the Chinese government again in whatever manner possible. To me, that's extremely worrisome. I'll leave it at that. Sen. Cruz: Let me raise a related issue, which is I've spoken a number of times to leadership of a major research institute in Texas that is facing ongoing challenges of Chinese espionage. In particular, Chinese nationals being paid by the Chinese government working at that institution, working on sensitive research projects. Then they suddenly discover projects that they are in midst of working, companies out of China are filing U.S. patent applications and seeking to get U.S. intellectual property in the midst of the research. How widespread is this problem, is the threat of industrial espionagetheft of intellectual property by Chinese nationalsworking here in the United States? And, what are we doing about it? What should we be doing about it? Mr. Bill Priestap: Sir, I can't quantify for youI wish I couldthe level of the threat. But what I can tell you is this: I'm waiting for the time that somebody reports to me, comes into my office and says, 'We have concerns about some activity here relating to China,' in which again might be up toor might be engaged in for nefarious purposes and they'll ask my permission to go take a look. We then go take a look. I am waiting for the time that they come back to say, 'It wasn't there. We didn't find it. We looked and it didn't exist.' Every rock we turned over, every time we looked for it, it's not only there but it's worse than we anticipated. Sen. Cruz: And give us an order of magnitude, how widespread are these complaints? Are we talking a handful? Are we talking dozens? Are we talking hundreds? What's the breadth of complaints and investigations you're seeing in these issues? Mr. Bill Priestap: Just say, extremely voluminous. Sen. Cruz: Hundreds? Thousands? I just want to get an order of magnitude in terms of how broad this challenge is. Mr. Bill Priestap: Thousands. Sen. Cruz: Thousands. Okay, thank you.Load-Date: December 13, 2018End of Document

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION VETTING CHINESE STUDENTSStates News ServiceDecember 3, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 620 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Accuracy in Academia (AIA):Malcolm A. KlineChinese students often come to the United States to seek an American education, which provides a significant chunk of enrollment numbers and tuition revenue for many American higher education institutions. However, national security officials are concerned that some Chinese students take advantage of their studies to spy on the U.S. Reuters reported that the Trump administration, spearheaded by the State Department, is considering tightening visa terms for Chinese nationals who come to the United States as college students.The proposed restrictions include additional background checks such as checking student phone records, investigating social media platforms of Chinese students on American- or Chinese-based platforms, and unearthing potential ties to government organizations and affiliates. The reason behind these proposed restrictions are spying and intellectual property theft by Chinese nationals, who study at American universities and colleges.At risk is the $14 billion higher education windfall from Chinese students who attend American universities and colleges, numbering about 360,000 students a year. Higher education officials are concerned that the potential policy change could push Chinese students to go to higher education institutions in other countries, which would hurt their employers' bottom line.Back in June 2018, the State Department cut down the time that Chinese students studying robotics, advanced manufacturing and aviation could stay here from five years down to one over national security concerns. The proposed changes come on the heels of a trade dispute between the U.S. and China, which have announced tariffs and counter-tariffs on products such as washing machines, steel, aluminum, and farming products like soybeans.The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, led by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, has held negotiations with the Chinese government on curbing intellectual property theft of American corporation's technologies and patents. In exchange, the U.S. government would agree to lower tariffs on Chinese imports, but the Chinese government has not budged during the on-and-off negotiations.The Chinese ambassador to the U.S. dismissed American concerns about spying, "Why should anybody accuse them as spies? I think that this is extremely unfair for them," Ambassador Cui Tiankai told Reuters.However, U.S. national security officials bring up specific examples of intellectual property theft and spying at American higher education institutions, such as Duke University, Louisiana State University, and Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago.Yet, some higher education officials claim that these recent moves do not address the bigger picture of catching up to Chinese innovation. For example, MIT President L. Rafael Reif penned an opinion column in the New York Times, where he argued that these anti-espionage tactics are near-sighted. Reif wrote:"Expert, decisive action is needed to stop these practices in defense of fair international competition and America's strategic and commercial interests. But it would be a mistake to think that an aggressive defense alone will somehow prevent China's technological success or ensure America's own."Nowhere in Reif's column did he address national security concerns, nor note the degree to which China has pirated American technology, but Reif instead pivoted to talking points about federal funding directed to universities to unearth innovations in technology.In short, higher education officials are more worried about revenue sources than national security concerns and theft of intellectual property.Load-Date: December 4, 2018End of Document

LexinFintech: Consumer Finance to Further Benefit from Regulatory SupportPR NewswireNovember 29, 2018 Thursday 6:05 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 721 wordsDateline: GUANGZHOU, China, Nov. 29, 2018 BodyPR NewswireChina's consumer finance industry will experience accelerating growth in the coming years, as the industry stands to benefit from regulatory support to drive domestic consumption, said CEO of LexinFintech Holdings Ltd. ("Lexin" or the "Company") (Nasdaq: LX), a leading online consumer finance platform for educated young adults in China."The industry has experienced enormous growth in the past few years and we expect this trend to continue," said Mr. Jay Wenjie Xiao, Lexin's CEO, at CNBC's East Tech West conference in Guangzhou, China.The Chinese government said in September that it will encourage innovation in consumer finance and broaden the development of consumer loans, as the government increasingly looks to make consumption the driving force of economic growth.China's consumer finance market is projected to grow to US$1.6 trillion by the end of 2020, which is equivalent to the GDP of Mexico, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18%, according to market research company Oliver Wyman. The niche sector of online consumer finance is estimated to grow even faster, reaching US$417 billion by the same period, with a CAGR of 62%."It is not only smartphones, but also smaller ticket items like a T-shirt or even a pair of shoes, that people have started to pay with an installment payment service," said Mr. Xiao.The concept of installment payment is increasingly seen not only as a way to satisfy an urgent need, but also as a normal method of shopping, according to a January report published by Lexin, with support from its e-commerce partners including Apple, Dell, L'Oreal, and P&G.In the third quarter of 2018, Lexin saw the gross merchandise volume of its e-commerce platform Fenqile increase by 33.8% year-on-year, while China's retail consumer sales grew at only 9.3% year-on-year in the first nine months of 2018, according to official data.Mr. Xiao attributed the growth of consumer financial services in China to a large untapped market and advanced technologies that enable fintech players to meet burgeoning demand, with risk management and a streamlined loan application process as the keys to success.In risk management, Lexin has adopted a forward-looking approach by using a combination of big data and artificial intelligence (AI) to assess a customer's credit worthiness, which allows the Company to perform a more comprehensive credit analysis of its customers than traditional financial institutions.Lexin's proprietary risk management engine, "Hawkeye," processes more than 1,000 decision rules and over 7,500 data variables to generate an assessment within seconds, and automatically manages 98% of all loan applications. It can create in real-time a customer's latest credit profile and engage in predictive analytics to understand how this profile may change in the future.Through the strong use of AI and big data, Lexin is also able to streamline the traditional process of loan applications, making it possible for its customers to complete a credit application within just a few minutes without having to submit excessive paperwork or become mired in red tape.About LexinFintech Holdings Ltd.LexinFintech Holdings Ltd.is a leading online consumer finance platform for educated young adults in China. As one of China's leading financial technology companies, Lexin integrates its e-commerce-driven installment finance platform, Fenqile, with advanced risk management technologies, the Company's Dingsheng asset distribution technology platform, and the Company's Juzi Licai online investment platform for individual investors, to create a comprehensive consumer finance ecosystem. The Company utilizes technologies including big data, cloud computing and artificial intelligence to enable the near-instantaneous matching of user funding requests with offers from the Company's more than 30 funding partners, which include commercial banks, consumer finance companies, and other licensed financial institutions.For more information, please visithttp://ir.lexinfintech.com.To follow us on Twitter, please go to:           https://twitter.com/LexinFintech. View original content to download multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lexinfintech-consumer-finance-to-further-benefit-from-regulatory-support-300757533.htmlSOURCE LexinFintech Holdings Ltd.CONTACT: For media inquiries, please Limin Chen, LexinFintech Holdings Ltd, Tel: +86 (755) 3637-8888 ext. 6993, E-mail: liminchen@lexinfintech.comLoad-Date: November 30, 2018End of Document

How China could retaliate against US and Canadian companies over HuaweiCNN WireDecember 12, 2018 Wednesday 10:58 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 985 wordsByline: Analysis by Sherisse Pham, CNN BusinessDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  Canadian and US companies are bracing themselves for fallout from the arrest of a top executive at Chinese tech giant Huawei.Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer, is out on bail after sitting in a Canadian jail cell for more than a week. She faces extradition to the United States, where she is accused of helping Huawei dodge sanctions on Iran. Huawei is key to China's ambitions to become a global tech leader. It sells more smartphones than Apple (APPL) and is the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker. Meng is the daughter of the company's founder, Ren Zhengfei.Beijing is unlikely to let the arrest of a senior executive from an elite family go unanswered, experts say, and companies should prepare for possible blowback."There will be retaliation. Guaranteed," said Edo Naito, a Tokyo-based business lawyer and former executive for multinational companies including General Electric (GE). Naito has been doing business with China since the 1980s.Locking up execsOne risk is that Chinese authorities could detain a US or Canadian business executive in a tit-for-tat response. President Donald Trump's suggestion Tuesday that he could use Meng as a pawn in trade negotiations will likely only increase those fears. "If I was a Western CEO, I would not want to be in China," said Christopher Balding, a China expert at the Fulbright University in Vietnam. Several leading Silicon Valley executives are worried about the possibility of tit-for-tat arrests in China following the detention of Meng, according to an op-ed article by veteran tech reporter Kara Swisher in The New York Times. Adding to the jitters, the International Crisis Group said Wednesday that Chinese security services in Beijing have detained its northeast Asia senior adviser, who is also a former Canadian diplomat. The Chinese government has detained foreign employees of nongovernmental organizations in the past but infrequently. Nationalist backlashSome Chinese companies and business groups are already encouraging employees to boycott Apple (AAPL) and other US suppliers and buy Huawei products instead.If the Chinese government allows the nationalist outcry to intensify, it could lead to violent protests against US and Canadian interests in China, including well known brands. That's what happened in 2012 when Japanese businesses in China were targeted by demonstrations over a territorial dispute."If I was General Motors China or KFC, I would get prepared," Naito said.Other geopolitical flashpoints have left international companies exposed.Anti-US protestors targeted KFC, McDonald's (MCD) and other US brands in China in 2016 following an international tribunal's ruling over the South China Sea. Last year, South Korean companies like Lotte and Hyundai Motors (HYMTF) were caught in the middle of escalating tensions with China over the deployment of a controversial US missile defense system.Regulatory crackdownKimberly Kirkendall, president of International Resource Development, a company that helps US firms establish a presence in China, said she has heard from dozens of businesses since Meng's arrest, all of them worried about retaliation. If Meng is extradited to the United States, Kirkendall says US companies can expect retaliatory measures such as slower processing of visas and increased enforcement of regulations. The Chinese government "may choose to expend more resources auditing US and Canadian companies," she said. "It would be satisfying to them to showcase US companies who are breaking the law. Non-compliant companies need to get their business in order. Quickly." During the standoff with South Korea last year, Chinese authorities shut down dozens of Lotte stores, citing issues such as fire safety regulations. They also halted the construction of a Lotte theme park in northeastern China. China could also hold up major deals. Its decision to block American chipmaker Qualcomm's (QCOM) $44 billion takeover of Dutch rival NXP (NXPI) on antitrust grounds earlier this year was widely seen as a result of trade tensions with Washington.CyberattacksChina could also hit back at Canada and the United States through cyberattacks. "Unfortunately [cyberattacks] are always a possibility with China," former Canadian Ambassador to China David Mulroney said in an interview with Canadian broadcaster CTV last week."China plays it rough in these situations," he said. Canada's top cybersecurity official said the country is prepared for possible retaliation over Meng's arrest.Scott Jones, director of the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, declined to directly answer any questions last week in relation to Meng's case, but added: "We always have to be resilient no matter what the possible trigger could be, so we increase our resilience against any form of malicious activity that we could be facing as a nation."Play it coolSome China experts believe Beijing is reluctant to retaliate as it tries to negotiate a deal with the Trump administration to end the trade war."My sense is the decision makers are keeping cool heads on this," said William Zarit, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China."It really could get in the way of a resolution on the trade friction," he added. "I don't think the Chinese want to muddy the waters in this way."But Trump's suggestion that he could intervene in the Meng case if it would help get a trade deal with China have added a new unpredictable element."If I think it's good for what will be certainly the largest trade deal ever made --- which is a very important thing --- what's good for national security --- I would certainly intervene if I thought it was necessary," Trump told Reuters in an interview published shortly after Meng was granted bail. Ben Westcott and Yong Xiong contributed to this article. TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Huawei: More than a company, a symbol of the Chinese political-economic modelCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 7, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 862 wordsBody Any executive who has had to negotiate with Chinese analogs knows that the family factor is key to generating confidence. It is part of their culture. That is why the arrest of Huawei financial director, Meng Wanzhou, not only generated anger from his father, founder of the company, but also the Chinese government, which, following the same cultural logic, considers this company almost as part of the family clan of the Asian country's technological and economic success, comparable to others such as Lenovo, ZTE, Alibaba Group, Tencent and even, Baidu.  It is key to understand this relationship between a political system coming from communism and a commercial expansion of capitalism, an experiment hitherto economically successful, which generates a series of trust relationships between the public and business sectors.  So for the Chinese government, the arrest is stabbed in the back, days of having achieved a commercial truce with the US. In fact, that is the reason for the nervousness of all the markets in the world, including the Chilean one (see related note): the uncertainty before this confidence incision between both countries, just when a relative peace had been achieved within the commercial war .  And to aggravate it, the request for arrest had been made by the US administration. From connectivity to the Top 2 for sale of smartphones The Chinese government's support for Huawei is explained by its history. He was born at the end of the 80s with an initial capital of US $ 3,500 (from that time), a little before the North American dotcom era. But it did not emerge as a content or service company on the internet.  Quite the opposite. Its core was to provide the necessary connectivity for telecommunications to work. That is, the manufacture of PBXs to connect different points. Its main clients were the telecommunications companies.  Already entered the 90s followed the same path, technologically supporting the promising "network of networks" (internet), which gave its kindergarten first steps at a massive level. Huawei had the equipment and the back to do it, that's why, in 1996 he decided to leave the borders and in 1997 he launched products to connect GSM, CDMA and UMTS wireless networks.  In 2000, when the world was shaking from the false hangover of the "millennium bug" (Y2K), the problems with the United States began. This country claimed that Huawei had installed a telecommunications system in Iraq by turning a blind eye to UN sanctions. Then, the Chinese government denied it, supporting the local company. The US insisted.  It was the beginning of a tense relationship, which a decade later would not matter at all to the millions of North American users and the Western world who enthusiastically bought Huawei smartphones, for their great performance and price.  And that 18 years later, it would resurface with a new accusation by the Donald Trump government over the suspicion that the Chinese company would now be breaking trade sanctions in another Middle East country: Iran.  But it has also had problems with other technological giants, mainly because of accusations of copying products and letting others invest in R & D, and then delivering a cheaper technology offer.  In 2003, Cisco sued Huawei Technologies and its subsidiaries Huawei America Inc. and FutureWei Technologies Inc. for illegally copying the intellectual property of this Californian company.  And despite the fact that the Chinese firm has made alliances with IBM, Siemens or Symantec and other large companies, it has always been in the sights of technological giants who are jealous of their intellectual property.  Today, Huawei is the world's largest provider of telecommunications network equipment and the second largest smartphone manufacturer, withincome of about US $ 92,000 million last year.  Unlike other large Chinese technology companies, it carries out a large part of its business abroad and is a market leader in many countries in Europe, Asia and Africa. In other words, a true symbol of the political-commercial mix of the Chinese model.  Although in the Western world many have remained true to the apple brand, since Huawei broke into the world of smartphones after 2010, consumers have seen in their teams a more pragmatic and ideal acquisition to take selfies, browse internet and not worry about the blows to the device.  Something like the best of the worlds of Apple and Samsung, but in a new and young brand. On the other side, Huawei has put together a marketing strategy rarely seen in the history of advertising.  At the end of August of this year, Huawei achieved one of its most important goals. Outperform Apple in global smartphone sales, coming in second place after Samsung.  The Chinese manufacturer sold some 54 million phones last quarter, 40% more than in the same period of 2017, according to studies by IDC, Canalys and IHS Markit. A true success story of the development model of the People's Republic of China. An heir to the policy of "Open Doors" of the giant of the east.  The Huawei entry: More than a company, a symbol of the Chinese political-economic model was first published in La Tercera. Load-Date: December 7, 2018End of Document

China's Uighurs told to share beds, meals with party membersAssociated Press InternationalNovember 30, 2018 Friday 9:12 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWS; Only on APLength: 2191 wordsByline: By DAKE KANG and YANAN WANG, Associated PressDateline: ISTANBUL BodyISTANBUL (AP) - The two women in the photograph were smiling, but Halmurat Idris knew something was terribly wrong.One was his 39-year-old sister; standing at her side was an elderly woman Idris did not know. Their grins were tight-lipped, mirthless. Her sister had posted the picture on a social media account along with a caption punctuated by a smiley-face."Look, I have a Han Chinese mother now!" his sister wrote.Idris knew instantly: The old woman was a spy, sent by the Chinese government to infiltrate his family.There are many like her. According to the ruling Communist Party's official newspaper, as of the end of September, 1.1 million local government workers have been deployed to ethnic minorities' living rooms, dining areas and Muslim prayer spaces, not to mention at weddings, funerals and other occasions once considered intimate and private.All this is taking place in China's far west region of Xinjiang, home to the predominantly Muslim, Turkic-speaking Uighurs, who have long reported discrimination at the hands of the country's majority Han Chinese.While government notices about the "Pair Up and Become Family" program portray it as an affectionate cultural exchange, Uighurs living in exile in Turkey said their loved ones saw the campaign as a chilling intrusion into the only place that they once felt safe.They believe the program is aimed at coercing China's 10 million Uighurs into living secular lives like the Han majority. Anything diverging from the party's prescribed lifestyle can be viewed by authorities as a sign of potential extremism - from suddenly giving up smoking or alcohol, to having an "abnormal" beard or an overly religious name.Under Chinese President Xi Jinping, the Uighur homeland has been blanketed with stifling surveillance, from armed checkpoints on street corners to facial-recognition-equipped CCTV cameras steadily surveying passers-by. Now, Uighurs say, they must live under the watchful eye of the ruling Communist Party even inside their own homes."The government is trying to destroy that last protected space in which Uighurs have been able to maintain their identity," said Joanne Smith Finley, an ethnographer at England's Newcastle University.The Associated Press spoke to five Uighurs living in Istanbul who shared the experiences of their family members in Xinjiang who have had to host Han Chinese civil servants. These accounts are based on prior communications with their family members, the majority of whom have since cut off contact because Uighurs can be punished for speaking to people abroad.The Uighurs abroad said their loved ones were constantly on edge in their own homes, knowing that any misstep - a misplaced Quran, a carelessly spoken word - could lead to detention or worse. In the presence of these faux relatives, their family members could not pray or wear religious garbs, and the cadres were privy to their every move.The thought of it - and the sight of his sister, the old woman and their false smiles - made Idris queasy."I wanted to throw up," said the 49-year-old petroleum engineer, shaking his head in disgust."The moment I saw the old woman, I thought, 'Ugh, this person is our enemy.' If your enemy became your mother, think about it - how would you feel?"___Tensions between Muslim minorities and Han Chinese have bubbled over in recent years, resulting in violent attacks pegged to Uighur separatists and a fierce government crackdown on broadly defined "extremism" that has placed as many as 1 million Muslims in internment camps, according to estimates by experts and a human rights group.Uighurs say the omnipresent threat of being sent to one of these centers, which are described as political indoctrination camps by former detainees, looms large in their relatives' minds when they are forced to welcome party members into their homes.Last December, Xinjiang authorities organized a "Becoming Family Week" which placed more than 1 million cadres in minority households. Government reports on the program gushed about the warm "family reunions," as public servants and Uighurs shared meals and even beds.Another notice showed photos of visitors helping Uighur children with their homework and cooking meals for their "families." The caption beneath a photo of three women lying in bed, clad in pajamas, said the cadre was "sleeping with her relatives in their cozy room."A different photo showed two women "studying the 19th Party Congress and walking together into the new era" - a nod to when Xi's name was enshrined in the party constitution alongside the likes of Deng Xiaoping and Mao Zedong.Becoming Family Week turned out to be a test run for a standardized homestay program. The Xinjiang United Front Work Department said in February that government workers should live with their assigned families every two months, for five days at a time.The United Front, a Communist Party agency, indicates in the notice that the program is mandatory for cadres. Likewise, Idris and other interviewees said their families understood that they would be deemed extremists if they refused to take part.Cadres, who are generally civilians working in the public sector, are directed to attend important family events such as the naming of newborns, circumcisions, weddings and funerals of close relatives. They must have a firm grasp of each family member's ideological state, social activities, religion, income, their challenges and needs, as well as basic details on immediate relatives, the notice said.Families were to be paid a daily rate of 20 to 50 yuan ($2.80 to $7.80) to cover the cost of meals shared with their newfound relatives. Some families might be paired with two or three cadres at a time, according to the notice, and the regularly mandated house calls could be supplanted with trips to the local party office.A February piece on the Communist Party's official news site said: "The vast majority of party cadres are not only living inside villagers' homes, but also living inside the hearts of the masses."Overseas Uighurs said the "visits" to their relatives' homes often lasted longer than five days, and they were closely monitored the whole time. The cadres would ask their family members where they were going and who they were meeting whenever they wanted to leave the house."They couldn't pray," said Abduzahir Yunus, a 23-year-old Uighur originally from Urumqi, Xinjiang's capital. "Praying or even having a Quran at home could endanger the whole family."Yunus, who now lives in Istanbul, said his father used to lament to him about being visited three to four times a week by the administrator of his neighborhood committee, a middle-aged Han Chinese man. The surprise house calls began in 2016, and it was "impossible to say no," Yunus said. They often coincided with times traditionally designated for prayer."Their aim is to assimilate us," Yunus said. "They want us to eat like them, sleep like them and dress like them."After Yunus's parents and older brother were detained, only Yunus's sister-in-law and 5-year-old brother remained in the house. Around the beginning of 2018, the Han Chinese man started staying with them full-time.Uighurs said they were particularly repulsed by the thought of male visitors living under the same roof as their female relatives and children - a practice contrary to their faith. Women and kids are sometimes the only ones left at home after male family members are sent to internment camps.In recent years, the government has even encouraged Uighurs and Han Chinese to tie the knot.Starting in 2014, Han-Uighur spouses in one county were eligible to receive 10,000 yuan ($1,442) annually for up to five years following the registration of their marriage license.Such marriages are highly publicized. The party committee in Luopu county celebrated the marriage of a Uighur woman and a "young lad" from Henan in an official social media account in October 2017. The man, Wang Linkai, had been recruited through a program that brought university graduates to work in the southern Xinjiang city of Hotan."They will let ethnic unity forever bloom in their hearts," the party committee's post said. "Let ethnic unity become one's own flesh and blood."___Not all "Become Family" pairings involve Han Chinese visitors. A Uighur cadre named Gu Li said she regularly pays visits to a Uighur household, staying three to five days at a time."We've already started calling each other family," she said in a telephone interview from Xinjiang. "China's 56 ethnic groups are all one family."Gu said civil servants of many ethnicities - Uighur, Han and Kazakh - participate in the program.All government employees in the region are required to conduct such visits in order to better understand villagers' needs, according to Gu: "Because we're always sitting in our offices, we don't know what they really need. Only through penetrating the masses can we truly serve them."As with many of the government's other initiatives in Xinjiang, the "Pair Up and Become Family" program is presented as a way to rescue Muslim minorities from poverty. Public servants show up at homes bearing bags of rice and gallons of cooking oil, and their duties include helping with chores and farm work.Xu Jing, an employee at Turpan city's environmental bureau, recounted her shock after entering her assigned relative's home. Xu said the only light in the residence came from a small window, and she realized that Xasiyet Hoshur wasn't lying when she said she lived on 3,000 yuan ($433) a year."But it's OK, everything is getting better," Xu wrote in her reflection, published on Turpan's government site. Hoshur's daughter was attending university on a 5,000 yuan ($722) national scholarship.On the one hand, China maintains that employment and living standards are key to warding off the temptations of religious extremism. On the other hand, official descriptions of the visitation and homestay program are laden with suggestions that the ethnic minority families are uncivilized and that their way of life needs to be corrected.One notice, first highlighted by University of Washington ethnographer Darren Byler, focused on a Uighur family's use of a raised, cloth-covered platform for eating and working. In traditional Uighur culture, this setup is preferable to a table, but the testimonial published by the Xinjiang Communist Youth League said frequent use of the platform was "inconvenient" and "unhealthy."The post quoted a cadre saying: "Even though we already purchased a TV and rice oil for our relatives, after living with our relatives for a few days, we still insisted on using our own money to buy our relatives a table and lamp."In the People's Daily, a Uighur baker in Kashgar named Ablimit Ablipiz was quoted praising the party for improving his habits. "Ever since these cadres started living in my home, we've picked up a lot of know-how about food safety and hygiene," Ablipiz said.Uighurs must also conform culturally. Over the Lunar New Year, an important Chinese holiday not traditionally celebrated by Uighurs, cadres encouraged households to hang lanterns and sing "red songs," ballads honoring the party's revolutionary history. Byler said families could not ask whether the meat was halal and acceptable to Muslims when they had to make or eat dumplings for the festival.___Thousands of miles away, in Turkey, Uighur relatives in exile watch what is happening with dread.Earlier this year, Ablikim Abliz studied a photo of his uncle's family gathered around a table. Clad in thick winter jackets, his uncle and the smiling Han Chinese man beside him both held chubby-faced children in their laps.His uncle had posted the photo to his WeChat page along with the caption "Han Chinese brother."The 58-year-old Abliz said his entire extended family in China has been sent to internment camps. When he saw his uncle's photo, his first reaction was relief. If his uncle had been assigned a Han family member, Abliz thought, that meant he was safe.But the consolation was short-lived. A friend who tried to visit his uncle in Turpan this summer told Abliz that his uncle's front door was boarded up and sealed with police tape. Abliz has not been able to reach any of his family members since.As for Idris, he fears that his sister is living under immense pressure with her Han Chinese "mother." Shortly after her sister's first post about her new relatives, a friend responded on WeChat: "I also have one! You guys better be careful!"The same friend later posted photos of herself and a Han Chinese woman doing a Chinese fan dance, playing the drums and wearing traditional Han clothing.His sister would never have volunteered for such a program, Idris said. She and his younger sister had been trying to get passports to bring their children to Turkey and reunite with Idris, but their applications were not accepted.Last summer, both of his sisters deleted him on WeChat. A few months later, his aunt deleted him, too. For more than a year, Idris has not been able to communicate with his relatives. He wonders, with growing unease, how they're getting along with their new "family."Load-Date: December 1, 2018End of Document

CHINESE INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS AND THEIR RECRUITED HACKERS AND INSIDERS CONSPIRED TO STEAL SENSITIVE COMMERCIAL AVIATION AND TECHNOLOGICAL DATA FOR YEARSStates News ServiceOctober 30, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1388 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: SAN DIEGO, California BodyThe following information was released by the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of California:Chinese intelligence officers and those working under their direction, which included hackers and co-opted company insiders, conducted or otherwise enabled repeated intrusions into private companies' computer systems in the United States and abroad for over five years. The conspirators' ultimate goal was to steal, among other data, intellectual property and confidential business information, including information related to a turbofan engine used in commercial airliners.The charged intelligence officers, Zha Rong and Chai Meng, and other co-conspirators, worked for the Jiangsu Province Ministry of State Security ("JSSD"), headquartered in Nanjing, which is a provincial foreign intelligence arm of the People's Republic of China's Ministry of State Security ("MSS"). The MSS, and by extension the JSSD, is primarily responsible for domestic counter-intelligence, non-military foreign intelligence, and aspects of political and domestic security.From at least January 2010 to May 2015, JSSD intelligence officers and their team of hackers, including Zhang Zhang-Gui, Liu Chunliang, Gao Hong Kun, Zhuang Xiaowei, and Ma Zhiqi, focused on the theft of technology underlying a turbofan engine used in U.S. and European commercial airliners. This engine was being developed through a partnership between a French aerospace manufacturer with an office in Suzhou, Jiangsu province, China, and a company based in the United States. Members of the conspiracy, assisted and enabled by JSSD-recruited insiders Gu Gen and Tian Xi, hacked the French aerospace manufacturer. The hackers also conducted intrusions into other companies that manufactured parts for the turbofan jet engine, including aerospace companies based in Arizona, Massachusetts and Oregon. At the time of the intrusions, a Chinese state-owned aerospace company was working to develop a comparable engine for use in commercial aircraft manufactured in China and elsewhere.Defendant Zhang Zhang-Gui is also charged, along with Chinese national Li Xiao, in a separate hacking conspiracy, which asserts that Zhang Zhang-Gui and Li Xiao leveraged the JSSD-directed conspiracy's intrusions, including the hack of a San Diego-based technology company, for their own criminal ends."For the third time since only September, the National Security Division, with its US Attorney partners, has brought charges against Chinese intelligence officers from the JSSD and those working at their direction and control for stealing American intellectual property," said John C. Demers, Assistant Attorney General for National Security. "This is just the beginning. Together with our federal partners, we will redouble our efforts to safeguard America's ingenuity and investment.""State-sponsored hacking is a direct threat to our national security. This action is yet another example of criminal efforts by the MSS to facilitate the theft of private data for China's commercial gain," said U.S. Attorney Adam Braverman. "The concerted effort to steal, rather than simply purchase, commercially available products should offend every company that invests talent, energy, and shareholder money into the development of products.""The threat posed by Chinese government-sponsored hacking activity is real and relentless," said John Brown, FBI Special Agent in Charge of the San Diego Field Office. "Today, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, with the assistance of our private sector, international and U.S. government partners, is sending a strong message to the Chinese government and other foreign governments involved in hacking activities. We are working together to vigorously investigate and hold hackers accountable regardless of their attempts to hide their illicit activities and identities."On October 10, the Department of Justice announced that a JSSD intelligence officer was extradited to the Southern District of Ohio, on charges that he attempted to steal trade secrets related to jet aircraft engines, and in September, in the Northern District of Illinois, a grand jury indicted a U.S. Army recruit who is accused of working as an agent of a JSSD intelligence officer, without notification to the Attorney General.As the indictment in the Southern District of California describes in detail, China's JSSD intelligence officers and hackers working at their direction masterminded a series of intrusions in order to facilitate intrusions and steal non-public commercial and other data. The hackers used a range of techniques, including spear phishing, sowing multiple different strains of malware into company computer systems, using the victim companies' own websites as "watering holes" to compromise website visitors' computers, and domain hijacking through the compromise of domain registrars.The first alleged hack began no later January 8, 2010, when members of the conspiracy infiltrated Capstone Turbine, a Los-Angeles-based gas turbine manufacturer, in order to steal data and use the Capstone Turbine website as a "watering hole."China's intelligence service also sought, repeatedly, to hack into a San Diego-based technology company from at least August 7, 2012 through January 15, 2014, in order to similarly steal commercial information and use its website as a "watering hole."Chinese actors used not only hacking methods to conduct computer intrusions and steal commercial information, they also coopted victim company employees. From at least November 2013 through February 2014, two Chinese nationals working at the direction of the JSSD, Tian Xi and Gu Gen, were employed in the French aerospace company's Suzhou office. On January 25, 2014, after receiving malware from an identified JSSD officer acting as his handler, Tian infected one of the French company's computers with malware at the JSSD officer's direction. One month later, on February 26, 2014, Gu, the French company's head of Information Technology and Security in Suzhou, warned the conspirators when foreign law enforcement notified the company of the existence of malware on company systems. That same day, leveraging that tip-off, conspirators Chai Meng and Liu Chunliang tried to minimize JSSD's exposure by causing the deletion of the domain linking the malware to an account controlled by members of the conspiracy.The group's hacking attempts continued through at least May of 2015, when an Oregon-based company, which, like many of the other targeted companies, built parts for the turbofan jet engine used in commercial airliners, identified and removed the conspiracy's malware from its computer systems.Count Two of the indictment charges a separate conspiracy to hack computers in which Zhang Zhang-Gui, a defendant charged in Count One, supplied his co-defendant and friend, Li Xiao, with variants of the malware that had been developed and deployed by hackers working at the direction of the JSSD on the hack into Capstone Turbine. Using malware supplied by Zhang, as well as other malware, Li launched repeated intrusions that targeted a San Diego-based computer technology company for more than a year and a half. These intrusions caused thousands of dollars of damage to protected computers.Count Three of the indictment charges Zhang Zhang-Gui with the substantive offense of computer hacking a San Diego technology company, which was one of the targets of the conspiracies alleged in Counts One and Two.***The charges contained in the indictment are merely accusations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.The FBI, led by the San Diego Field Office, conducted the investigation that resulted in charges announced today. This case is being prosecuted by Alexandra Foster and Sabrina F ve of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of California and Jason McCullough of the National Security Division's Counterintelligence and Export Control Section. The Criminal Division's Office of International Affairs also provided assistance in this matter, and the Department appreciates the cooperation and assistance provided by France's General Directorate for Internal Security (DGSI) and the Cybercrime Section of the Paris Prosecutor's Office during the investigation of this matter.# # #13CR3132-HLoad-Date: October 31, 2018End of Document

Together with our federal partners, we will redouble our efforts to safeguard America's ingenuity and investment.""State-sponsored hacking is a direct threat to our national security. This action is yet another example of criminal efforts by the MSS to facilitate the theft of private data for China's commercial gain," said U.S. Attorney Adam Braverman. "The concerted effort to steal, rather than simply purchase, commercially available products should offend every company that invests talent, energy, and shareholder money into the development of products.""The threat posed by Chinese government-sponsored hacking activity is real and relentless," said John Brown, FBI Special Agent in Charge of the San Diego Field Office. "Today, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, with the assistance of our private sector, international and U.S. government partners, is sending a strong message to the Chinese government and other foreign governments involved in hacking activities. We are working together to vigorously investigate and hold hackers accountable regardless of their attempts to hide their illicit activities and identities."On October 10, the Department of Justice announced that a JSSD intelligence officer was extradited to the Southern District of Ohio, on charges that he attempted to steal trade secrets related to jet aircraft engines, and in September, in the Northern District of Illinois, a grand jury indicted a U.S. Army recruit who is accused of working as an agent of a JSSD intelligence officer, without notification to the Attorney General.As the indictment in the Southern District of California describes in detail, China's JSSD intelligence officers and hackers working at their direction masterminded a series of intrusions in order to facilitate intrusions and steal non-public commercial and other data. The hackers used a range of techniques, including spear phishing, sowing multiple different strains of malware into company computer systems, using the victim companies' own websites as "watering holes" to compromise website visitors' computers, and domain hijacking through the compromise of domain registrars.The first alleged hack began no later January 8, 2010, when members of the conspiracy infiltrated Capstone Turbine, a Los-Angeles-based gas turbine manufacturer, in order to steal data and use the Capstone Turbine website as a "watering hole."China's intelligence service also sought, repeatedly, to hack into a San Diego-based technology company from at least August 7, 2012 through January 15, 2014, in order to similarly steal commercial information and use its website as a "watering hole."Chinese actors used not only hacking methods to conduct computer intrusions and steal commercial information, they also coopted victim company employees. From at least November 2013 through February 2014, two Chinese nationals working at the direction of the JSSD, Tian Xi and Gu Gen, were employed in the French aerospace company's Suzhou office. On January 25, 2014, after receiving malware from an identified JSSD officer acting as his handler, Tian infected one of the French company's computers with malware at the JSSD officer's direction. One month later, on February 26, 2014, Gu, the French company's head of Information Technology and Security in Suzhou, warned the conspirators when foreign law enforcement notified the company of the existence of malware on company systems. That same day, leveraging that tip-off, conspirators Chai Meng and Liu Chunliang tried to minimize JSSD's exposure by causing the deletion of the domain linking the malware to an account controlled by members of the conspiracy.The group's hacking attempts continued through at least May of 2015, when an Oregon-based company, which, like many of the other targeted companies, built parts for the turbofan jet engine used in commercial airliners, identified and removed the conspiracy's malware from its computer systems.Count Two of the indictment charges a separate conspiracy to hack computers in which Zhang Zhang-Gui, a defendant charged in Count One, supplied his co-defendant and friend, Li Xiao, with variants of the malware that had been developed and deployed by hackers working at the direction of the JSSD on the hack into Capstone Turbine. Using malware supplied by Zhang, as well as other malware, Li launched repeated intrusions that targeted a San Diego-based computer technology company for more than a year and a half. These intrusions caused thousands of dollars of damage to protected computers.Count Three of the indictment charges Zhang Zhang-Gui with the substantive offense of computer hacking a San Diego technology company, which was one of the targets of the conspiracies alleged in Counts One and Two.The charges contained in the indictment are merely accusations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.The FBI, led by the San Diego Field Office, conducted the investigation that resulted in charges announced today. This case is being prosecuted by Alexandra Foster and Sabrina Feve of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of California and Jason McCullough of the National Security Division's Counterintelligence and Export Control Section. The Criminal Division's Office of International Affairs also provided assistance in this matter, and the Department appreciates the cooperation and assistance provided by France's General Directorate for Internal Security (DGSI) and the Cybercrime Section of the Paris Prosecutor's Office during the investigation of this matter.Case Number: 13CR3132-HCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6499159 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: November 6, 2018End of Document

An 'atheist' empire? Trump aides rally evangelicals in China fightPolitico.comDecember 29, 2018 Saturday 4:10 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 1517 wordsHighlight: Religious freedom is a growing theme of President Donald Trump's confrontation with Beijing, and it's resonating with Christian leaders.BodyVice President Mike Pence infuriated Beijing when he gave a speech in October warning that China had become a dangerous rival to the United States. While he focused on familiar issues such as China's trade policies and cyber espionage, Pence also denounced the country's "avowedly atheist Communist Party." Citing a crackdown on organized religion in the country, Pence noted that Chinese authorities "are tearing down crosses, burning Bibles and imprisoning believers." "For China's Christians," Pence said, "these are desperate times." Pence's remarks, which also addressed the repression of Chinese Buddhists and Muslims, illustrated how religious freedom is a growing theme of President Donald Trump's confrontation with Beijing, which some foreign policy insiders warn could develop into a new Cold War. It is a subject that resonates in the U.S. heartland, some Christian leaders say - parts of which, including rural areas, are disproportionately at risk of fallout from Trump's trade fight with the Asian giant. The issue has gained new resonance with Beijing's arrest this month of a prominent Christian pastor and more than 100 members of his congregation. The arrests have drawn close coverage from evangelical outlets such as Pat Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN), whose website published an open letter by the jailed pastor, Wang Yi, declaring his "anger and disgust at the persecution of the church by this Communist regime." Days after the arrests, Trump's ambassador for international religious freedom, former Republican Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback, decried the crackdown and said that in the weeks since Pence's speech, religious freedom concerns "have only grown." While China's religious persecution draws less media attention than issues like soybean tariffs and cyber espionage, it is closely tracked by conservative Christian activists and outlets like CBN, where a typical headline recently reported: "Chinese Government Destroys Christian Church, Bills Pastor for Demolition." In September, Providence Magazine, which covers U.S. foreign policy from a Christian perspective, wrote that in 2018 China's religious repression has reached "a sustained intensity not seen since the Cultural Revolution." The Trump administration has repeatedly criticized China on such grounds. In a report on international religious freedom released earlier this year, the State Department noted that throughout China there were reports of "deaths in detention of religious adherents as well as reports the government physically abused, detained, arrested, tortured, sentenced to prison, or harassed adherents of both registered and unregistered religious groups for activities related to their religious beliefs and practices." Religious activists note that Pence, Brownback, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other top Trump aides are people of faith with genuine concerns about religious freedom. But even they acknowledge the subject happens to be a potent political message for religious conservatives and may help rally them behind Trump's confrontational China policy. Some religious leaders even hear an echo of history: Cold War-era denunciations of "godless" Soviet communism by past U.S. presidents, notably Ronald Reagan "In the great heartland of America, where there tend to be higher levels of people who care about faith, reminding people that a regime - whether then the Soviet Union or today's communist China - rejects God and has an official policy of atheism is helpful in getting them to understand why our government is taking certain actions in the foreign policy area," said Gary Bauer, a longtime conservative Christian leader whom Trump appointed to the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom. "Evil empire" was the famous label then-President Reagan applied to the Soviet Union in 1983. Less remembered is the fact that Reagan was addressing the National Association of Evangelicals. Reagan vowed at the time that the Soviets "must be made to understand: ... We will never abandon our belief in God." Trump himself rarely addresses religious freedom or human rights, and when it comes to China he focuses mainly on Beijing's trade practices. But his administration - backed by an evangelical base that stood for Trump in 2016 and continues to support him enthusiastically - has strongly emphasized international religious freedom. Earlier this year, for instance, the State Department hosted a first-ever gathering of foreign ministers devoted to the subject. (China was not invited and was targeted in a joint statement signed by a handful of countries, including the U.S.) "This administration is putting this in the matrix of all of our policy," said Tony Perkins, another prominent Christian conservative who serves on the religious freedom commission and is close to the White House. "It's more than just the throwaway line." Pompeo, a former Republican congressman from Kansas, has also assailed Beijing for religious persecution, including at a September speech at the Values Voter Summit in Washington, an event affiliated with the Perkins-led Family Research Council. During an appearance which some critics called inappropriately political, Pompeo decried "an intense new government crackdown on Christians in China, which includes heinous actions like closing churches, burning Bibles, and ordering followers to sign papers renouncing their faith." Like Pence, Pompeo also dwelled on the plight of China's Muslim population, particularly ethnic Uighurs from the Chinese province of Xinjiang. A State Department official recently testified before lawmakers that up to 2 million Muslims are now confined to special camps in China. "Their religious beliefs are decimated," Pompeo told Values Voter Summit attendees. The Chinese government, which often casts Uighur Muslims as potential terrorists, says the camps are designed to teach vocational and life skills. But the State Department official, Scott Busby, said the goal appears to be "forcing detainees to renounce Islam and embrace the Chinese Communist Party." While evangelical groups active in Washington tend to focus primarily on the persecution of Christians in China and elsewhere, some make sure to point out that they care about religious freedom for all faith groups, including Muslims. In a past interview with POLITICO, Brownback stressed that he also wants to protect people's right to have "no religion at all."The Trump administration may unveil a set of human rights-related sanctions targeting officials in a range of countries in the coming weeks. Some China observers are hopeful the list will include Chen Quanguo, a top Communist Party official said to have orchestrated the anti-Muslim crackdown and to have had a role in repressing Tibetan Buddhists. "It's a critical moment," said Bob Fu, a U.S.-based pastor and founder of ChinaAid, a group that advocates for religious freedom in China. Brownback did not offer comment for this story, and a spokesman for Pompeo did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A White House spokesperson said of Pence that "religious freedom throughout the world is a top priority for the vice president and the administration as a whole." Bauer predicted that evangelicals and other voters in the U.S. heartland will continue to support Trump even if he expands his trade war with China. The administration, cognizant of the potential pain for its supporters, has taken some steps to cushion the blow, such as offering farming subsidies.By retaliating against particular U.S. industries, such as soybean farmers, China is trying to pressure the administration. "I think China will fail in this effort and support for the Trump-Pence policies will remain strong," Bauer said. When it comes to pleasing the religious right, the Trump administration has been willing to make some dicey moves. This past summer, to the shock of the foreign policy establishment, Trump imposed economic sanctions on two Cabinet officials in Turkey - an important U.S. ally and fellow NATO member - due to the questionable imprisonment of an American pastor, Andrew Brunson. Brunson, whose cause was championed by evangelicals, was eventually freed and the sanctions lifted. How far the administration will push Beijing on religious freedom could come down to the president himself and what China is willing to do to assuage his concerns on trade. Trump, after all, has been willing to drop talk of human rights issues when it seems he's making progress on other fronts - that's what has happened in his dealings with North Korea. The Chinese in particular are highly sensitive to their global image, and, like the Soviet Union, China cannot be ignored. "If this tariff business gets really bad and the economy goes down, I wouldn't be surprised if [Trump officials] ramp up the 'evil empire' language," said a Senate Democratic aide. "It inoculates them from their base." But "if you start using the 'evil empire' language," the aide added, "it's harder to make up and kiss and be friends."Article originally published on POLITICO MagazineLoad-Date: January 2, 2019End of Document

ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR NATIONAL SECURITY JOHN C. DEMERS DELIVERS REMARKS REGARDING ECONOMIC ESPIONAGE BY THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINAStates News ServiceNovember 1, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 922 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the U.S. Department of Justice:Washington, DCUnited States~Thursday, November 1, 2018Remarks as prepared for deliveryThe case unsealed today is representative of the Chinese government's trade secret theft that we see across the country and across industries. Whether by co-opting employees, by computer intrusions or by a combination of both, agents of the Chinese government are systematically stealing our nation's intellectual property for the benefit of their own companies and their own country's strategic priorities. To counter this activity, the Attorney General has launched a nationwide initiative, and I am honored to lead it.To glimpse the scope of the problem, just look at the recent cases that we've charged. In the case we unsealed today, the defendants are alleged to have misappropriated the intellectual property of an American company and gone to a different company to use this privileged knowledge unlawfully, to clone a product to compete with the American product.All after the Chinese Central Government and the State Council publicly identified the development of that stolen technology as a national priority and funded a company to mass produce the cloned products. Then to add insult to injury, the company that stole and is working to clone the legitimate American product turned around and sued the American company for violating its patents rights---which were built on the stolen technology.In addition to the criminal charges, today, for the first time ever, we also bring a civil action to stop the export of the illegal goods and prevent the Chinese company from competing with the American product in America. And we commend the action by the Commerce Department to place the company on the Entity List, which means it won't be able to get the tools it needs to produce this product. As this case shows, we will continue to use all available legal tools to protect American workers and American companies from illegal activity.Just two days ago, in United States v. Zhang Zhang-Gui, et al., we charged ten defendants, including co-opted company insiders, working for or acting on behalf of the Jiangsu Ministry of State Security, also known as the "JSSD," an arm of the Chinese intelligence services. According to the charging documents from the Southern District of California, the defendants conspired to hack U.S. and European defense and aerospace contractors in order to steal information to develop a Chinese version of a commercial airplane turbofan engine.Just over three weeks ago, in the Southern District of Ohio, we obtained the extradition of a JSSD intelligence officer who was also alleged to have attempted to co-opt an employee of a defense contractor in order to steal trade secrets related to commercial airplane engines.In September, in the Northern District of Illinois, we charged an individual here in the United States who acted as a source for a JSSD intelligence officer, helping him, among other things, to assess engineers and scientists for recruitment.In August, in the Northern District of New York, we charged an individual with stealing turbine technology and sending it to China.And so it goes.Taken together, these cases, and many others like them, paint a grim picture of a country bent on stealing its way up the ladder of economic developmentand doing so at American expense. This behavior is illegal. It's wrong. It's a threat to our national security. And it must stop.The National Security Division has a variety of tools available to deal with this problem. First, as we've talked about, we can bring prosecutions. These prosecutions have raised the stakes for intelligence officers and their alleged co-optees here in the United States. If you work at an American company and you help the Chinese steal its trade secrets, we will find you and prosecute you.These charges, in all their specificity, also prevent China from hiding behind their long practiced, ritualized denials and feigned ignorance.These charges also serve to educate the American public and alert U.S. business to what the Chinese government is doing on all fronts, including their efforts to target commercial technology pursuant to insiders, computer intrusions, and computer intrusions enabled by insiders.And most important, through the criminal charges, a civil suit for an injunction, an entity listing and other economic tools, the U.S. government is making a coordinated, concerted effort to deprive the thief of the benefit of his crime.In addition, when the Chinese use their financial clout to buy or make strategic investments to gain access to American technology and personal data, the National Security Division will work with our partners on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to protect our sensitive technologies and data from national security risk.And when Chinese activity turns to the malign influence of American politics in order to further its economic and political agenda, we will use the Foreign Agents Registration Act and related criminal and civil tools to ensure full transparency.China wants the fruits of America's brainpower to harvest the seeds of its desired economic dominance. Preventing this from happening will take all of us, here at the Justice Department, across the U.S. government, and within the private sector. With the Attorney General's initiative, we will confront China's malign behaviors and encourage them to conduct themselves as the leading nation they aspire to be.Load-Date: November 2, 2018End of Document

UK AND ALLIES REVEAL GLOBAL SCALE OF CHINESE CYBER CAMPAIGNStates News ServiceDecember 20, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 697 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: LONDON BodyThe following information was released by the UK Government:The UK government and its allies are holding responsible elements of the Chinese government for an extensive cyber campaignFrom:Foreign and Commonwealth Office, National Cyber Security Centre, and The Rt Hon Jeremy Hunt MPAlong with its allies, the UK has announced that a group known as APT 10 acted on behalf of the Chinese Ministry of State Security to carry out a malicious cyber campaign targeting intellectual property and sensitive commercial data in Europe, Asia and the US.The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) assesses with the highest level of probability that the group widely known as APT 10 is responsible for this sustained cyber campaign focused on large-scale service providers. The group almost certainly continues to target a range of global companies, seeking to gain access to commercial secrets.This campaign shows that elements of the Chinese government are not upholding the commitments China made directly to the UK in a 2015 bilateral agreement. It is also inconsistent with G20 commitments that no country should conduct or support ICT enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential business information.Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt said:This campaign is one of the most significant and widespread cyber intrusions against the UK and allies uncovered to date, targeting trade secrets and economies around the world.These activities must stop. They go against the commitments made to the UK in 2015, and, as part of the G20, not to conduct or support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property or trade secrets.Our message to governments prepared to enable these activities is clear: together with our allies, we will expose your actions and take other necessary steps to ensure the rule of law is upheld.The UK is committed to upholding the rules-based international order, which underpins the peace, security and prosperity of the whole world. With its allies, the UK is once again demonstrating that the international community will not hesitate to call out state-sponsored cyber campaigns.The government will take forward further engagement with service providers to ensure they have robust protections in place against continuing and emerging cyber threats it is clear that in some cases basic cyber security measures are still not being taken, and this is not acceptable. In the New Year, there will be a roundtable hosted by the government and NCSC inviting a broad range of senior representatives from suppliers to government, including managed service providers and service integrators. Together the community will discuss the necessary step change that is required in contracting and security controls to tackle cyber threats to government and beyond.Notes to editorsThe UK's National Cyber Security Centre assesses that APT 10 was almost certainly responsible for a campaign of activity against global Managed Service Providers (MSPs) since at least 2016, widely known as Cloud Hopper. This targeted intellectual property and commercially sensitive information of the MSPs and their clients. It is highly likely that these accesses were used to engage in commercial espionage.The NCSC assesses that it is highly likely that APT 10 has an enduring relationship with the Chinese Ministry of State Security, and operates to meet Chinese State requirements. Given the high confidence assessment and the broader context, the UK government has made the judgement that the Chinese Ministry of State Security was responsible.This is the first time that the UK government has publicly named elements of the Chinese government as being responsible for a cyber campaign. It has previously attributed:the WannaCry ransomware incident to North Korean actors;a multi-year computer network exploitation campaign targeting universities around the world, including the UK, to the Mabna Institute based in Iran; anda series of attacks including NotPetya, the WADA hack and leak and BadRabbit to the GRU (Russian Military Intelligence).The NCSC published guidance to mitigate against this campaign targeting MSPs on 3 April 2017. This guidance is available here.Load-Date: December 21, 2018End of Document

Uninvited guests keep watch for China inside Uighur homesAssociated Press InternationalNovember 30, 2018 Friday 3:17 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWS; Only on APLength: 2188 wordsByline: By DAKE KANG and YANAN WANG, Associated PressDateline: ISTANBUL BodyISTANBUL (AP) - The two women in the photograph were smiling, but Halmurat Idris knew something was terribly wrong.One was his 39-year-old sister; standing at her side was an elderly woman Idris did not know. Their grins were tight-lipped, mirthless. Her sister had posted the picture on a social media account along with a caption punctuated by a smiley-face."Look, I have a Han Chinese mother now!" his sister wrote.Idris knew instantly: The old woman was a spy, sent by the Chinese government to infiltrate his family.There are many like her. According to the ruling Communist Party's official newspaper, as of the end of September, 1.1 million local government workers have been deployed to ethnic minorities' living rooms, dining areas and Muslim prayer spaces, not to mention at weddings, funerals and other occasions once considered intimate and private.All this is taking place in China's far west region of Xinjiang, home to the predominantly Muslim, Turkic-speaking Uighurs, who have long reported discrimination at the hands of the country's majority Han Chinese.While government notices about the "Pair Up and Become Family" program portray it as an affectionate cultural exchange, Uighurs living in exile in Turkey said their loved ones saw the campaign as a chilling intrusion into the only place that they once felt safe.They believe the program is aimed at coercing Uighurs into living secular lives like the Han majority. Anything diverging from the party's prescribed lifestyle can be viewed by authorities as a sign of potential extremism - from suddenly giving up smoking or alcohol, to having an "abnormal" beard or an overly religious name.Under Chinese President Xi Jinping, the Uighur homeland has been blanketed with stifling surveillance, from armed checkpoints on street corners to facial-recognition-equipped CCTV cameras steadily surveying passers-by. Now, Uighurs say, they must live under the watchful eye of the ruling Communist Party even inside their own homes."The government is trying to destroy that last protected space in which Uighurs have been able to maintain their identity," said Joanne Smith Finley, an ethnographer at England's Newcastle University.The Associated Press spoke to five Uighurs living in Istanbul who shared the experiences of their family members in Xinjiang who have had to host Han Chinese civil servants. These accounts are based on prior communications with their family members, the majority of whom have since cut off contact because Uighurs can be punished for speaking to people abroad.The Uighurs abroad said their loved ones were constantly on edge in their own homes, knowing that any misstep - a misplaced Quran, a carelessly spoken word - could lead to detention or worse. In the presence of these faux relatives, their family members could not pray or wear religious garbs, and the cadres were privy to their every move.The thought of it - and the sight of his sister, the old woman and their false smiles - made Idris queasy."I wanted to throw up," said the 49-year-old petroleum engineer, shaking his head in disgust."The moment I saw the old woman, I thought, 'Ugh, this person is our enemy.' If your enemy became your mother, think about it - how would you feel?"___Tensions between Muslim minorities and Han Chinese have bubbled over in recent years, resulting in violent attacks pegged to Uighur separatists and a fierce government crackdown on broadly defined "extremism" that has placed as many as 1 million Muslims in internment camps, according to estimates by experts and a human rights group.Uighurs say the omnipresent threat of being sent to one of these centers, which are described as political indoctrination camps by former detainees, looms large in their relatives' minds when they are forced to welcome party members into their homes.Last December, Xinjiang authorities organized a "Becoming Family Week" which placed more than 1 million cadres in minority households. Government reports on the program gushed about the warm "family reunions," as public servants and Uighurs shared meals and even beds.Another notice showed photos of visitors helping Uighur children with their homework and cooking meals for their "families." The caption beneath a photo of three women lying in bed, clad in pajamas, said the cadre was "sleeping with her relatives in their cozy room."A different photo showed two women "studying the 19th Party Congress and walking together into the new era" - a nod to when Xi's name was enshrined in the party constitution alongside the likes of Deng Xiaoping and Mao Zedong.Becoming Family Week turned out to be a test run for a standardized homestay program. The Xinjiang United Front Work Department said in February that government workers should live with their assigned families every two months, for five days at a time.The United Front, a Communist Party agency, indicates in the notice that the program is mandatory for cadres. Likewise, Idris and other interviewees said their families understood that they would be deemed extremists if they refused to take part.Cadres, who are generally civilians working in the public sector, are directed to attend important family events such as the naming of newborns, circumcisions, weddings and funerals of close relatives. They must have a firm grasp of each family member's ideological state, social activities, religion, income, their challenges and needs, as well as basic details on immediate relatives, the notice said.Families were to be paid a daily rate of 20 to 50 yuan ($2.80 to $7.80) to cover the cost of meals shared with their newfound relatives. Some families might be paired with two or three cadres at a time, according to the notice, and the regularly mandated house calls could be supplanted with trips to the local party office.A February piece on the Communist Party's official news site said: "The vast majority of party cadres are not only living inside villagers' homes, but also living inside the hearts of the masses."Overseas Uighurs said the "visits" to their relatives' homes often lasted longer than five days, and they were closely monitored the whole time. The cadres would ask their family members where they were going and who they were meeting whenever they wanted to leave the house."They couldn't pray," said Abduzahir Yunus, a 23-year-old Uighur originally from Urumqi, Xinjiang's capital. "Praying or even having a Quran at home could endanger the whole family."Yunus, who now lives in Istanbul, said his father used to lament to him about being visited three to four times a week by the administrator of his neighborhood committee, a middle-aged Han Chinese man. The surprise house calls began in 2016, and it was "impossible to say no," Yunus said. They often coincided with times traditionally designated for prayer."Their aim is to assimilate us," Yunus said. "They want us to eat like them, sleep like them and dress like them."After Yunus's parents and older brother were detained, only Yunus's sister-in-law and 5-year-old brother remained in the house. Around the beginning of 2018, the Han Chinese man started staying with them full-time.Uighurs said they were particularly repulsed by the thought of male visitors living under the same roof as their female relatives and children - a practice contrary to their faith. Women and kids are sometimes the only ones left at home after male family members are sent to internment camps.In recent years, the government has even encouraged Uighurs and Han Chinese to tie the knot.Starting in 2014, Han-Uighur spouses in one county were eligible to receive 10,000 yuan ($1,442) annually for up to five years following the registration of their marriage license.Such marriages are highly publicized. The party committee in Luopu county celebrated the marriage of a Uighur woman and a "young lad" from Henan in an official social media account in October 2017. The man, Wang Linkai, had been recruited through a program that brought university graduates to work in the southern Xinjiang city of Hotan."They will let ethnic unity forever bloom in their hearts," the party committee's post said. "Let ethnic unity become one's own flesh and blood."___Not all "Become Family" pairings involve Han Chinese visitors. A Uighur cadre named Gu Li said she regularly pays visits to a Uighur household, staying three to five days at a time."We've already started calling each other family," she said in a telephone interview from Xinjiang. "China's 56 ethnic groups are all one family."Gu said civil servants of many ethnicities - Uighur, Han and Kazakh - participate in the program.All government employees in the region are required to conduct such visits in order to better understand villagers' needs, according to Gu: "Because we're always sitting in our offices, we don't know what they really need. Only through penetrating the masses can we truly serve them."As with many of the government's other initiatives in Xinjiang, the "Pair Up and Become Family" program is presented as a way to rescue Muslim minorities from poverty. Public servants show up at homes bearing bags of rice and gallons of cooking oil, and their duties include helping with chores and farm work.Xu Jing, an employee at Turpan city's environmental bureau, recounted her shock after entering her assigned relative's home. Xu said the only light in the residence came from a small window, and she realized that Xasiyet Hoshur wasn't lying when she said she lived on 3,000 yuan ($433) a year."But it's OK, everything is getting better," Xu wrote in her reflection, published on Turpan's government site. Hoshur's daughter was attending university on a 5,000 yuan ($722) national scholarship.On the one hand, China maintains that employment and living standards are key to warding off the temptations of religious extremism. On the other hand, official descriptions of the visitation and homestay program are laden with suggestions that the ethnic minority families are uncivilized and that their way of life needs to be corrected.One notice, first highlighted by University of Washington ethnographer Darren Byler, focused on a Uighur family's use of a raised, cloth-covered platform for eating and working. In traditional Uighur culture, this setup is preferable to a table, but the testimonial published by the Xinjiang Communist Youth League said frequent use of the platform was "inconvenient" and "unhealthy."The post quoted a cadre saying: "Even though we already purchased a TV and rice oil for our relatives, after living with our relatives for a few days, we still insisted on using our own money to buy our relatives a table and lamp."In the People's Daily, a Uighur baker in Kashgar named Ablimit Ablipiz was quoted praising the party for improving his habits. "Ever since these cadres started living in my home, we've picked up a lot of know-how about food safety and hygiene," Ablipiz said.Uighurs must also conform culturally. Over the Lunar New Year, an important Chinese holiday not traditionally celebrated by Uighurs, cadres encouraged households to hang lanterns and sing "red songs," ballads honoring the party's revolutionary history. Byler said families could not ask whether the meat was halal and acceptable to Muslims when they had to make or eat dumplings for the festival.___Thousands of miles away, in Turkey, Uighur relatives in exile watch what is happening with dread.Earlier this year, Ablikim Abliz studied a photo of his uncle's family gathered around a table. Clad in thick winter jackets, his uncle and the smiling Han Chinese man beside him both held chubby-faced children in their laps.His uncle had posted the photo to his WeChat page along with the caption "Han Chinese brother."The 58-year-old Abliz said his entire extended family in China has been sent to internment camps. When he saw his uncle's photo, his first reaction was relief. If his uncle had been assigned a Han family member, Abliz thought, that meant he was safe.But the consolation was short-lived. A friend who tried to visit his uncle in Turpan this summer told Abliz that his uncle's front door was boarded up and sealed with police tape. Abliz has not been able to reach any of his family members since.As for Idris, he fears that his sister is living under immense pressure with her Han Chinese "mother." Shortly after her sister's first post about her new relatives, a friend responded on WeChat: "I also have one! You guys better be careful!"The same friend later posted photos of herself and a Han Chinese woman doing a Chinese fan dance, playing the drums and wearing traditional Han clothing.His sister would never have volunteered for such a program, Idris said. She and his younger sister had been trying to get passports to bring their children to Turkey and reunite with Idris, but their applications were not accepted.Last summer, both of his sisters deleted him on WeChat. A few months later, his aunt deleted him, too. For more than a year, Idris has not been able to communicate with his relatives. He wonders, with growing unease, how they're getting along with their new "family."Load-Date: November 30, 2018End of Document

China plans new IP law in bid to tackle key Trump trade issueCNN WireDecember 24, 2018 Monday 8:56 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 506 wordsByline: By Steven Jiang, CNNDateline: BEIJING (CNN) BodyBEIJING (CNN) --  Beijing is promising new measures to protect foreign companies operating in China, its latest apparent move to mollify US President Donald Trump.The Communist government on Sunday submitted a draft of a new law to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the country's rubber-stamp parliament, highlighting provisions aimed at better protecting foreign companies' intellectual property. The proposed law would prohibit forced technology transfer from foreign firms to their Chinese partners, a major grievance of Trump and other critics.The move was welcomed by Harley Seyedin, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in South China, who described it as "significant and the correct move by the Chinese government."But he cautioned that foreign companies in China would still face other obstacles even under the planned changes, including a lack of enforcement and "unfair treatment" by local governments.With an emphasis on "equal treatment" as well as "creating stable, transparent and predictable investment environment," the new law states that foreign companies shall enjoy all state policies "supportive of business development" and participate in government procurement, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency.Chinese government officials have previously rejected accusations that foreign companies are treated unfairly, arguing any tech secrets handed over were part of deals that had been mutually agreed upon.The new law appears to be the latest attempt by Beijing to appease Trump, who has repeatedly voiced his concerns around technology theft by the Chinese government.Negotiations are still ongoing between the US and China after both sides declared a 90-day ceasefire on the trade war following a face-to-face meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Argentina earlier this month."President Trump and President Xi have agreed to immediately begin negotiations on structural changes with respect to forced technology transfer, intellectual property protection, non-tariff barriers, cyber intrusions and cyber theft, services and agriculture," said the White House in a statement at the time.During a high-level phone call last Friday, Chinese and US trade negotiators exchanged views on the protection of intellectual property -- among other issues of mutual concern -- and made new progress, China's commerce ministry said in a statement released Sunday.Other recent moves by Beijing to help trade talks have included China resuming the purchase of American soybeans, as well as temporarily lifting retaliatory tariffs on US cars and auto parts.But amid the negotiations, Washington announced last Thursday the indictment of two Chinese hackers, allegedly working for the country's spy agency, who had stolen trade secrets from dozens of US companies, triggering a strong rebuttal from Beijing.A committee vote for the new foreign investment law is schedule to take place Saturday.TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

SASSE ON CHINESE SPYING: "WE CAN'T SLEEP ON THIS THREAT"States News ServiceDecember 12, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1203 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse:"Too many folks in Washington cling to an imaginary distinction between Chinese businesses and the Chinese Communist Party."Video of Senator Sasse's exchange is available here or by clicking on the image aboveAt today's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the threat of China's non-traditional espionage efforts, U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, who last week praised the arrest of a Chinese tech CFO at the request of the Department of Justice, pushed for more clarity, urgency, and accountability from federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies."Too many folks in Washington cling to an imaginary distinction between Chinese businesses and the Chinese Communist Party," said Senator Sasse afterward. "This is much, much bigger than corporate 'cheating' or old-school spy-vs-spy tactics. China wants to win a fight before it starts by leveraging every tool at Chairman Xi's disposal sometimes that means using the state and sometimes that means using Chinese citizens and businesses. We can't sleep on this threat. The Assistant Director for Counterintelligence at the FBI gets this and is trying to bring urgency to the challenge."Transcript of Senator Sasse's exchange with Christopher Krebs, the Director of Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency for the Department of Homeland Security, and Bill Priestap, the Assistant Director of the Counterintelligence Division for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, is found below:Sasse: Mr. Chairman. Thanks to the three of you for being here. Incredibly important topic and I applaud Chairman Grassley and Senator Feinstein for scheduling this important hearing. Director Priestap, you made a number of startling and really important comments in your opening statement. How does the Chinese government think about its diaspora? How do they think about students abroad? How do they think about corporate executives working in Silicon Valley?Priestap: In my opinion, they think of them as being beholden to them. They think of them as -- just simply an extension of their power, of their nation.Sasse: And, what is the range of understanding that Chinese nationals who are studying, getting PhD's in the U.S. or working in tech companies in the U.S., to what degree...what's the differentiation of understanding they have about how they are viewed as assets of the government?Priestap: You mean those individuals? Based on FBI interaction with some of those individuals, it really is a case-by-case basis. Some I think are not knowledgeable in the least and are completely unwitting of doing anything in furtherance of their government aims. And, others either through direct or other softly applied pressure understand that they have obligations to meet. But, it really runs a gamut is what I'm trying to say.Sasse: Is there clarity in the way we, the United States government communicate to folks who come into the U.S. though about our laws and about the expectations about what is and isn't appropriate forms of statecraft and spycraft?Priestap: No, I think that is a great question and, in my experience, there doesn't seem to be consistency, and frankly it is something I think we could do a much better job of, especially in regards to universities and other research institutions, standards of research, what is acceptable behavior and what is not. Is that spelled out for all of the people studying and conducting the research? So, that people know from day one what is right and what is wrong and that there will be consequences if they cross that line.Sasse: And, when you say - and Director Krebs, you and I have had a number of good briefings separate from this and I definitely appreciate your work and also agree with the congratulations on your new role - but when we say that there is coordination but there is not a coordinator, who would be responsible for what Director Priestap just said? Who in the U.S. government is responsible for thinking through this issue of strategic communications with Chinese nationals who come to the U.S., many of them not intending to break laws but ultimately having pressure on them to break our laws or be involved in corporate and economic espionage? And, who in the U.S. government is communicating with the tech companies about the hiring they are doing? Who is communicating with the universities about the often-nefarious effects of the Confucius Institutes? Where does that responsibility reside in the U.S. government?Krebs: I see those as counterintelligence and law enforcement roles and responsibilities that there is a substantial amount of coordination that happened through the National Security Council led in part by the Director of FBI and the Director of National Intelligence. Now, my job is principally cybersecurity and risk management is to carry the message they develop and then push it out through the public/private partnerships whether it's with industry or with academia.Sasse: Thanks. Director.Priestap: I'm sorry, Senator. If I may, because I think that just an absolutely critical question in what I'm seeing, not just across government, but across business, across academia, what have you, again there are pockets of great understanding of the threat we're facing and effective responses. But in my opinion, we've got to knit that together better. Our government somehow -- obviously we have three separate branches intentionally, but if we're facing a whole of government, some call it a whole of society -- not meaning every person in the society is posing the threat but people from all walks of life -- you can't effectively combat that threat with ad hoc responses. We need more people in government, more people in business, more people in academia pulling in the same direction to combat this threat effectively.Sasse: Going back to the point you made earlier about spy on spy, the Chinese clearly understand that this is not merely a spy on spy initiative anymore, and our system is the better system in the long-term. Decentralization is the better system for human flourishing and for innovation, but it certainly puts greater communication burdens on us to be able to respond to all of the asymmetric disadvantages that we face. Is there anything we can learn from the Five Eyes partners that we have about how they respond to these kinds of strategic threats.Priestap: I guess the only thing I would add because obviously the FBI and my division coordinates closely with them. We need them. If we think we've got a threat today and people are trying to steal things today, what we have to understand is if they can't get it from the U.S., you go to the place where... you know, somewhere else you could get it. In other words, you look for the soft underbelly. You need a coordinated response. We need as many allies in this fight as is possible.Sasse: I'm at time so, General Demers, I'll just flag for you that I'm going to send you a letter following up on some of the important comments you made about the intention of the department to continue the China Initiative from the Chinese Espionage Act and to ask some questions about how many cases we're currently pursuing. So, thanks for your work.Load-Date: December 16, 2018End of Document

CHINA HOLDS THIRD CANADIAN NATIONAL AMID ESCALATING DIPLOMATIC ROWStates News ServiceDecember 20, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 871 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:UPDATED at 3: 00 P. M. EST on 2018- 12- 20Canada on Wednesday confirmed that a third Canadian national has been detained by authorities in China in the wake of the arrest of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver."Global Affairs Canada is aware of a Canadian citizen detained in China. Consular officials are providing assistance to the family," spokeswoman Maegan Graveline said on Wednesday .A source who spoke on condition of anonymity said Canadian officials found out about the detention on Tuesday from someone who knows the detainee, not from Beijing.China's Foreign Ministry on Thursday identified the third detainee as Canadian teacher Sarah McIver and said has been given an "administrative punishment" for working illegally in China. Canada's National Post newspaper reported that arrangements were being made for McIver to return to Canada after she was detained over a visa irregularity.Last week, authorities in China confirmed that are already holding two Canadian nationals -- consultant Michael Spavor and former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig -- on suspicion of "harming national security," amid ongoing diplomatic tensions with Ottawa over Meng's arrest.Their detention came after Beijing called for Meng's release, warning that "grave consequences" could ensue if the Canadian authorities continued to hold her.Spavor is a China-based tourism consultant with contacts among high-ranking North Korean officials, while Hong Kong-based Kovrig had been working for the nongovernmental organization International Crisis Group (ICG).Chinese law allows police to detain those suspected of vaguely worded "national security" crimes and hold them under residential surveillance at a secret location for up to six months, with no access to lawyers or family visits.Extradition hearingMeng was granted bail, and is confined under curfew to her residence in Vancouver, and must wear an electronic GPS tag at all times.U.S. investigators must now file a formal extradition request by Jan. 8, 2019, after which Meng will appear at a hearing on Feb. 6, before the extradition hearing is scheduled.U.S. investigators allege that Meng, a Hong Kong passport-holder, set up a company called Skycom to re-sell U.S.-made computer equipment to Iran, bypassing sanctions, and then sought to cover up the company's links to Huawei through the alleged fraud.Her arrest came amid growing national security concerns over Huawei's bid to supply the next generation of 5G mobile technology to networks around the world.Beijing has hit out at Canada and the United States over her arrest, while Huawei has denied it has close ties to the ruling Chinese Communist Party, saying it is a private company.Benson Wong, a former politics professor at Hong Kong's Baptist University, said Canada would need to act carefully, as the detainees could be used as bargaining chips in the Meng case."There's one important factor that Canada needs to consider, and that is whether China will stop what it is doing even if they do make concessions," Wong said. "Any compromise will send out the wrong message, [that] China only needs to detain U.S. citizens to exert pressure on the U.S., or British citizens to exert pressure on the U.K.""This could lead to a kind of hostage diplomacy."Great Firewall, Golden ShieldMeanwhile, Huawei invited a number of Western media organizations to a news conference in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen on Tuesday , to insist that it has no links to the government."Huawei isn't a technical institution linked to the Chinese government, but a technology company," CEO Hu Houkun told journalists. "We have received no requests from the Chinese government."But an internet analyst surnamed Zhang said such comments don't reflect the reality of the relationship between technology companies and the ruling Chinese Communist Party."There's no way that Huawei has no ties to the Chinese government," Zhang said. "They were involved in a whole series of government initiatives, for example, they built the Great Firewall to ensure that people couldn't browse overseas websites.""They also helped to develop Project Golden Shield, a facial recognition system, which means that you can be recognized when you walk down the street, and within a few minutes, all your personal data is shown," he said. "Huawei smartphones are also preinstalled with censorship and deletion software, so you can't get onto overseas websites."Other commentators have cited China's National Intelligence Law that requires "any citizen or organization" to comply with requests for intelligence gathering on behalf of the Chinese state, or face "criminal accountability.""Any organization and citizen shall, in accordance with the law, support, provide assistance, and cooperate in national intelligence work, and guard the secrecy of any national intelligence work that they are aware of," Article 7 of the law states."The state shall protect individuals and organizations that support, cooperate with, and collaborate in national intelligence work."Reported by Wen Yuqing for RFA's Cantonese Service, and by Qiao Long for the Mandarin Service.

ATLANTIC FEDERAL MINISTERS, PREMIERS TO LEAD MISSION TO CHINAStates News ServiceNovember 5, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1765 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: MONCTON, New Brunswick BodyThe following information was released by the Government of Canada:From: Atlantic Canada Opportunities AgencyDelegation to support more than 70 Atlantic Canadian businesses and organizations as they explore opportunities in the countryGovernment of Canada and Atlantic ProvincesHelping innovative small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) grow their businesses and enter new markets is critical to fueling Atlantic Canada's economy and creating more well-paying jobs in the region. As Canada's second largest single country trading partner and Canada's third largest source of tourists, China presents enormous economic opportunities for Atlantic Canada and Atlantic Canadian businesses.To that end, federal ministers and Atlantic premiers are leading an Atlantic Growth Strategy (AGS) mission to China from November 8 to 13, 2018 to support the region's food, clean growth, education, and tourism sectors, and encourage new partnerships in the country.In parallel with this mission, more than 70 Atlantic Canadian businesses and organizations are participating in expositions and trade shows in China (including business-to-business matchmaking). The AGS leadership delegation will visit a number of these events to lend their support to businesses and promote Atlantic Canada's advantages.The official itinerary includes the China Fisheries and Seafood Expo (CFSE) 2018 in Qingdao, the China International Import Expo (CIIE) 2018 in Shanghai, and the Canada China Business Council (CCBC) 2018 Annual General Meeting in Beijing. It also includes meetings and events to promote Atlantic Canada's education, tourism and clean growth sectors; Atlantic educational organizations will share their research and development in renewable energy and technologies; ministers and premiers will meet with their counterparts to encourage tourism to the region.Atlantic Canadian goods exported to China totalled more than $1.5 billion in 2017 a 37 per cent increase over 2016. Opportunities exist to grow this number even further. Total Atlantic Canada food and beverage exports to China have more than doubled in the last five years, totalling just under $700 million in 2017.[1] Chinese tourism to Canada is rapidly increasing, reaching a record 695,000 arrivals in 2017, up 12 per cent over 2016.[2] These numbers are expected to grow, as the Government of Canada and the four Atlantic provinces continue to leverage the region's competitive advantages, such as its strong export potential, growing innovation ecosystem, world-class educational institutions, skilled workforce, and world-renowned tourism experiences.This mission is a result of cooperative actions through the Atlantic Growth Strategy, a federal and provincial initiative that directs targeted actions to stimulate the region's economy, support both innovative and resource-based industries, and increase job opportunities for Atlantic Canadians.--[1] Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, Trade Data Online. We look at domestic goods exports to China.

This will help spur economic growth that benefits everyone and create good middle-class jobs. I am pleased to be part of this mission to support Atlantic Canadian businesses and to promote Atlantic Canada as a tourism destination."Alaina Lockhart, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Tourism, Official Languages and La Francophonie"Prince Edward Island and China have developed a valuable relationship with one another over the years. It is one that we honour, respect and look to expand for economic, educational and cultural opportunities. I look forward to exploring the endless possibilities ahead of us with Island businesses, educational institutions and my fellow Atlantic Canadians."The Honourable Wade MacLauchlan, Premier of Prince Edward Island"China is an important trading partner for Nova Scotia and our region. Our exports to China have grown in recent years, and we look forward to continued engagement through trade missions like this one building on that success."The Honourable Stephen McNeil, Premier of Nova Scotia"Newfoundland and Labrador is open for business. I am pleased to lead the province's delegation to China with the goal of building relationships, attracting new investment and identifying opportunities for our ocean technology, mining, food and beverage, and seafood industries, as well as our post-secondary sector.

China: Repression of Christian Church IntensifiesTargeted News ServiceDecember 13, 2018 Thursday 7:30 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1007 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK BodyHuman Rights Watch issued the following news release:* * *- Protestant Pastor, Dozens of Congregants DetainedChinese authorities should immediately release the pastor and scores of members of an independent Protestant church in the southwestern city of Chengdu, Human Rights Watch said today. Authorities should also return church properties and allow the members to resume worship services.On December 9 and 10, 2018, police officers in Chengdu took into custody Pastor Wang Yi and more than 100 congregants of the Early Rain Covenant Church from the church premises or their homes. Early Rain is considered an "underground" church because it is not registered with the government."The shutdown of a Protestant church in Chengdu epitomizes the Xi Jinping government's relentless assault on religious freedom in China," said Yaqiu Wang, China researcher. "It makes a mockery of the government's claim that it respects religious beliefs."Authorities also ransacked and sealed Early Rain Covenant Church's properties, including its offices, a kindergarten, a seminary, and a bible college, and searched the homes of many congregants. The police forced church members to sign a pledge that they would not attend the church again and blocked them from going to the church schools. The church's accounts on China's social media platform WeChat were also removed.Some church members, who were later released, said the police had beaten them. One said he was tied to a chair and deprived of water and food for 24 hours. Dozens of church members remained in police custody. While some families of detainees said they have received police detention notices, others have not been given information regarding the whereabouts or well-being of their loved ones. Police criminally detained Wang Yi on suspicion of "inciting subversion of state power," according to the notice Wang Yi's mother received. The wife of church elder Li Yingqiang said police told her that Li was detained for "picking quarrels and provoking trouble."Wang Yi, a prominent member of China's Christian community and a former legal scholar, is known for his impassioned sermons and outspoken criticism of the Chinese Communist Party. Shortly before his arrest, Wang Yi had published an essay critical of the government's tight control over religion, and calling on China's Christians to carry out civil disobedience, such as resisting government orders not to preach outside of church premises or to prohibit children from attending church. Two days after Wang was taken into custody, a statement he had drafted in anticipation of being detained was posted online. In it Wang Yi vowed to "use peaceful means... to resist every and all governmental and judicial measures that persecute the church and interfere with Christian belief."In recent years, police have frequently harassed Wang Yi and key members of the Early Rain Covenant Church, an independent evangelical church with about 500 congregants. Early in 2018, the church organized a petition to protest the newly amended Regulations on Religious Affairs. The regulations ban "unauthorized" religious teaching and participation in overseas religious training or meetings and expand the role of local authorities in controlling religious activities. The regulations tighten existing religious controls in China, which already restrict religious practice to five officially recognized religions in officially approved premises, among other restrictions.Several church members believe that the petition, which drew signatures from over 400 pastors across China, might have prompted the mass arrests. In September, Chengdu authorities informed the church that its activities had violated the government's religious policy.Under President Xi, the government has further tightened control over Christianity in its broad efforts to "Sinicize" religion or "adopt Chinese characteristics" - in other words, to ensure that religious groups support the government and the Communist Party. Authorities have demolished hundreds of Christian churches or crosses on top of churches, evicted congregations, confiscated Bibles and other church materials, and installed surveillance cameras in the churches allowed to function. In April, the government banned online sales of the Bible. In September, Beijing authorities shut down the Zion Church, one of the city's largest Protestant underground churches.In March, Pastor John Sanqiang Cao was sentenced to seven years in prison for "organizing others to illegally cross the border" between China and Myanmar. Cao had been involved in educational projects for impoverished minority groups in Myanmar. In 2014, a court sentenced Pastor Zhang Shaojie to 12 years in prison for "fraud" and "gathering a crowd to disturb public order."In September, the Roman Catholic Church and China reached a deal designed to end a decades-long standoff over authority to appoint bishops in China. China's estimated 12 million Roman Catholics are divided between an underground community that pledges allegiance to the pope and a government-run association with state-appointed bishops. Under the accord, Beijing will propose names for future bishops and the pope will have veto power. Many had hoped the new accord would bring the persecution of bishops of underground churches to an end. However, in November, authorities in Zhejiang province forcibly disappeared Bishop Shao Zhumin, his fifth disappearance in his two years as bishop. Shao's current whereabouts are unclear.The Chinese government has also ratcheted up restrictions over Buddhism in Tibetan areas and imposed unprecedented control over religious practices in the predominantly Muslim region of Xinjiang, as Human Rights Watch has extensively documented."Pastor Wang Yi has said he would stand up for his faith if he were to be imprisoned," Wang said. "Everyone who supports religious freedom should stand with Wang Yi and speak out against the Chinese government's repression of religion."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6553477 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: December 15, 2018End of Document

Two Chinese intelligence officers accused of stealing US jet engine techCNN WireOctober 31, 2018 Wednesday 3:11 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 482 wordsByline: By Ben Westcott and Mary Kay Mallonee, CNNDateline: (CNN) Body (CNN) --  Two Chinese intelligence officers have been charged by the United States Justice Department with trying to steal the details for a type of jet engine technology from US-based companies.Zha Rong and Chai Meng, intelligence officers with the Jiangsu provincial branch of the Ministry of State Security (MSS) in China, are accused of attempting to hack and infiltrate private companies over the course of five years in an attempt to steal the technology."This action is yet another example of criminal efforts by the MSS to facilitate the theft of private data for China's commercial gain," US Attorney Adam Braverman said in a statement."The concerted effort to steal, rather than simply purchase, commercially available products should offend every company that invests talent, energy, and shareholder money into the development of products."The US Department of Justice statement does not explicitly state where Zha Rong and Chai Meng are presently located. The United States does not have an extradition treaty with China -- and if the men are in China, it would be unlikely the Chinese government would cooperate with the investigation. CNN has reached out to the Chinese Foreign Ministry for comment.The charges come at a time when pressure is building on Beijing to address US concerns over the widespread alleged theft of intellectual property by Chinese agents to fuel the country's economic rise.The new charges mark the third time since September that charges have been brought against Chinese intelligence officers for trying to steal US intellectual property.On October 11, the Department of Justice charged Chinese intelligence officer Yanjun Xu with attempting to commit economic espionage, including working to get aviation employees to reveal their trade secrets. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman dismissed the allegation as "pure fabrication" at the time.In an indictment released by the Justice Department Tuesday, the US Justice Department alleged Zha and Chai from January 2010 began to work with a team of hackers to steal the technology for the engine which was being developed jointly by a French and a US-based company."At the time of the intrusions, a Chinese state-owned aerospace company was working to develop a comparable engine for use in commercial aircraft manufactured in China and elsewhere," the statement said.Attempts to infiltrate the company weren't limited to hacking, according to the US statement.

15ft Cross to be Displayed at Prayer Vigil in Front of the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C. on SundayChristian NewswireDecember 22, 2018 Saturday 11:46 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Christian Communication, LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 459 wordsByline: By Christian Defense CoalitionBodyWASHINGTON, Dec. 22, 2018 /Christian Newswire/ -- The Christian Defense Coalition will be holding a Facebook Live prayer gathering on Sunday, December 23, at 2:00 p.m. EST.The Chinese Embassy is located at: 3505 International Pl NW, Washington, District of Columbia 20008.Here is a link to the event: www.facebook.com/events/540469416365337/The group will be praying for the persecuted Chinese Christian community that has faced a dramatic increase of attacks by the communist government over the past year.  See news article below:           www.forbes.com/sites/oliviaenos/2018/12/20/chinese-christians-face-intensifying-persecution-ahead-of-christmas/#33e9e7a025b4The display of the large cross at the Chinese Embassy is also a powerful public reminder that the American Christian community is standing in solidarity with the church in China and also affirming the principles of religious freedom and public expressions of faith in front of Chinese government officials.The prayer vigil will be led by Rev. Patrick Mahoney who is the Director of the Christian Defense Coalition in Washington, D.C.  Rev. Mahoney is a longtime advocate for human rights and religious freedom in China and with, two other activists, was arrested in China during the Beijing Olympics and threatened with a 6 month prison sentence for their peaceful public witness.Rev. Mahoney states;    "As we gather in prayer and public witness at the Chinese Embassy, we are fulfilling the teachings of Hebrews 13:3 which challenge us to remember those in prison as if we were in prison with them and those who are being mistreated as if we ourselves were suffering."The American Church cannot be silent or indifferent when it comes to the persecution and violence directed toward our brothers and sisters in China. We must continue to be a loud, prophetic and public voice for justice.  As we pray for their protection and safety, we also pray that Chinese government officials would end their brutal attacks against people of faith and embrace the universal principles of religious freedom and human rights for all.  It is especially troubling to see these increased attacks against Christians during the Advent and Christmas season."The cross is being displayed for several reasons.  The first is to remind us that the only hope for true freedom and justice is found through the power of Christ's work on the cross.  Next, we want to stand in solidarity with the persecuted Chinese Christians as we witness crosses and churches being destroyed on a regular basis in China.  Finally, we are celebrating the religious freedoms we enjoy here in America and praying that China will soon follow."For more information or interviewscall Rev.

DOJ officials said the indictment marks the first time a Chinese Ministry of State Security operative has been arrested and brought to the United States to face charges. He's charged with working to get aviation employees to inadvertently reveal trade secrets to the Chinese government."This unprecedented extradition of a Chinese intelligence officer exposes the Chinese government's direct oversight of economic espionage against the United States," said Bill Priestap, assistant director of the FBI's Counterintelligence Division, in a statement.Xu was one of several Ministry of State Security officials who, starting in 2013, allegedly identified aviation industry experts at at least three companies, including Cincinnati-based GE Aviation, and invited them to China under the guise of speaking at universities for an idea exchange, according to the Justice Departmen complaint.However, these presentations were purely for the benefit of the Chinese government, and often included highly technical discussions about a company's signature material design and manufacturing technology. According to the indictment, the Ministry of State Security officers worked to "protect and conceal the true nature of the information they were seeking" and paid for the experts' travel, lodging and stipends."Effectively Xu and his (Chinese Ministry of State Security) colleagues sought to groom experts to hand over trade secrets," Ben Glassman, the US attorney for the Southern District of Ohio, told reporters at a news conference."China has made clear that it has a program where it is seeking to acquire leading technological information in this industry and several others," he later added.Glassman stressed that while it was apparent that Chinese officials were using insider recruitment as well as online hacking to further their interests, perpetrators could be brought to justice when private companies and the federal government worked together. GE Aviation cooperated with the FBI throughout the investigation, Glassman said."Companies should see that Chinese officials are seeking to acquire their intellectual property, not only through hacking, but also through the recruitment of insiders," Glassman said. "Companies should also see that working together with federal law enforcement authorities, as in this case, those attempted thefts can be thwarted and foreign actors can be brought to trial for their actions."Xu made his initial appearance Wednesday afternoon in federal court in Cincinnati, Glassman said. Xu was arrested in Belgium in April and was extradited to the United States on Tuesday after losing his appeal.

CHINA INCREASING DOMESTIC REPRESSION AND EXPORTING AUTHORITARIANISMUS REPORTStates News ServiceOctober 10, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1359 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:China's human rights situation is on a "continued downward trajectory, by virtually every measure" under President Xi Jinping and Beijing is using its growing power to spread authoritarian practices outside its borders, a U.S. congressional advisory panel said on Wednesday.The Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) annual report catalogs perennial human rights concerns, including political prisoners, jailing of journalists, repression of religion, and internet censorship.The 2018 edition places special focus on the incarceration of Uyghurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang, growing Communist Party control over society and business, and the use of technology as a tool of repression."China's authoritarianism at home directly threatens our freedoms as well as our most deeply held values and national interests," said a statement by Senator Marco Rubio, CECC chairman, and Representative Chris Smith, cochairman of the CECC, opening the 244-page report."Additionally, the 'long arm' of the Chinese Communist Party extends beyond China's borders and is increasingly pervasive and multifaceted," the lawmakers wrote, warning that under Xi's assertive rule Chinese practices are being exported around the world."We see an ascendant and increasingly aggressive China, seeking to take center stage in the world, and in so doing, determined to shape new global norms on development, trade, the internet, and even human rights. All the while, the fundamental authoritarian character of China's political system remains the same," they wrote.'Dire" and going downwardHuman rights conditions inside China have been "dire" and on a "continued downward trajectory, by virtually every measure, since Xi Jinping became Communist Party General Secretary in 2012 and President in 2013," the statement said."Of particular concern is the mass, arbitrary, internment of as many as 1 million or more Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities in "political reeducation" camps in western China," it said.Beginning in April 2017, Uyghurs accused of harboring "strong religious views" and "politically incorrect" ideas have been jailed or detained in re-education camps throughout the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), where members of the ethnic group have long complained of pervasive discrimination, religious repression, and cultural suppression under Chinese rule. Beijing says it is fighting extremism and giving Uyghurs vocational training.The CECC cited reports that indicate that the round-up of Uyghurs is the largest mass incarceration since World War II, and said authorities used alarming political rhetoric that conjures up images of "formalized racism on the order of South African apartheid.""Detentions appear to be indefinite in most cases. Regional government authorities reportedly ordered officials in some XUAR jurisdictions to meet detention quotas, and local orphanages were reportedly overcrowded due to the number of children requiring care while both parents are held in the camps," said the report, which cited human rights groups and media reports, including from RFA.The CECC also cited reports of "Chinese authorities attempting to influence, intimidate, and otherwise harass other Uyghurs living abroad, including in the United States, to get them to return to China, or monitor and silence them while abroad."The mass repression in Xinjiang comes amid a dramatic expansion of Communist Party control under Xi, the report said."The purview of the Party continued to expand into many sectors of public life, eliminating the tenuous separation that previously existed between the Party and government agencies," it said, noting that the party had in the past allowed experimentation and varying degrees of autonomy in implementing policies."Under Party General Secretary Xi Jinping, that modicum of autonomy continues to shrink with the Party apparatus reasserting itself over the government," said the report. Party control was also extended into the business world, including in foreign joint ventures, it said.Under Xi, the Communist Party was using multiple methods to "export its authoritarianism," the lawmakers said.The Chinese practices included "interference in multilateral institutions; threatening and intimidating rights defenders and their families; imposing censorship mechanisms on foreign publishers and social media companies," it said.Other measures by the party included "influencing academic institutions and critical analysis of China's past history and present policies; and threatening American companies who do not conform with China's narrative on 'sensitive topics' like Tibet, Hong Kong, and Taiwan," they wrote.Skynet and Sharp EyesThe party's push for control and mass surveillance of the nation of 1.3 billion people has also deployed the latest technological developments, including the "Skynet" system that includes more than 27 million surveillance cameras nationwide, and a "Sharp Eyes" program designed to extend surveillance to rural areas."Consistent with the trend regarding the Party's expanding reach, the Commission observed the Party and government re-inserting itself into the private lives of Chinese citizens through expanded collection of biometric data, growing surveillance networks, and continued development of the social credit system," said the report.The social credit system aims to reward or punish a range of economic, social, and political conduct."Reports show that social and political management of the Chinese people was aided by smart technology and advances in artificial intelligence (AI) in new ways this past year," it added.The former British colony of Hong Kong, which in 2017 marked 20 years since it came under Beijing's rule, is losing the autonomy promised under the Sino-British agreement governing the 1997 handover, the report said.The CECC cited the banning of political parties and politicians in Hong Kong, the vetting of candidates and the narrowing of space for debate in the southern Chinese city, now governed as a Special Autonomous Region."The long-term viability of Hong Kong's 'one country, two systems' framework remained tenuous given the continued erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy, as guaranteed under the "one country, two systems" policy enshrined in Hong Kong's Basic Law," the report said.Magnitsky sanctionsTough Chinese policies in Tibet remained unchanged, it said."The Party and government continued implementing repressive policies in Tibetan autonomous areas, including extensive and intrusive surveillance, strict regulations and rules to restrict Tibetans' religious and cultural rights, and pervasive displays of police and military force," said the report.The CECC's recommendations to Congress stressed the need for a "readjustment" of U.S. policy toward China, in which human rights and the rule of law are no longer "tangential issues in bilateral relations," and instead are in the forefront.The U.S. government must advocate for and support political prisoners, prioritize religious freedom in diplomacy and hold officials accountable for abuses, it said.Specifically, the U.S. must call on the Chinese government to end the mass, arbitrary detention of Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Hui, and others in "political reeducation" centers, and release those currently detained, it said.Washington must also press Chinese officials to allow U.S. officials, diplomats from other countries, UN officials, humanitarian organizations, and international journalists to visit the XUAR and investigate reports of arbitrary detention, it said.The CECC also called for governments and international non-governmental organizations to compile information on specific XUAR officials responsible for the arbitrary mass detention and abuse in the camps for possible sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act.In August, Rubio, Smith and 15 other lawmakers wrote Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urging the application of Magnitsky sanctions on XUAR Communist Party secretary Chen Quanguo, who has spearheaded the harsh policies against Uyghurs.Comments (0)Load-Date: October 10, 2018End of Document

Sen. Sasse on Chinese Spying: 'We Can't Sleep on This Threat'Targeted News ServiceDecember 12, 2018 Wednesday 7:50 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1229 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe office of Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Nebraska, issued the following news release:At today's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the threat of China's non-traditional espionage efforts, U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, who last week praised the arrest of a Chinese tech CFO at the request of the Department of Justice, pushed for more clarity, urgency, and accountability from federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies."Too many folks in Washington cling to an imaginary distinction between Chinese businesses and the Chinese Communist Party," said Senator Sasse afterward. "This is much, much bigger than corporate 'cheating' or old-school spy-vs-spy tactics. China wants to win a fight before it starts by leveraging every tool at Chairman Xi's disposal - sometimes that means using the state and sometimes that means using Chinese citizens and businesses. We can't sleep on this threat. The Assistant Director for Counterintelligence at the FBI gets this and is trying to bring urgency to the challenge."Transcript of Senator Sasse's exchange with Christopher Krebs, the Director of Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency for the Department of Homeland Security, and Bill Priestap, the Assistant Director of the Counterintelligence Division for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, is found below:Sasse: Mr. Chairman. Thanks to the three of you for being here. Incredibly important topic and I applaud Chairman Grassley and Senator Feinstein for scheduling this important hearing. Director Priestap, you made a number of startling and really important comments in your opening statement. How does the Chinese government think about its diaspora? How do they think about students abroad? How do they think about corporate executives working in Silicon Valley?Priestap: In my opinion, they think of them as being beholden to them. They think of them as -- just simply an extension of their power, of their nation.Sasse: And, what is the range of understanding that Chinese nationals who are studying, getting PhD's in the U.S. or working in tech companies in the U.S., to what degree...what's the differentiation of understanding they have about how they are viewed as assets of the government?Priestap: You mean those individuals? Based on FBI interaction with some of those individuals, it really is a case-by-case basis. Some I think are not knowledgeable in the least and are completely unwitting of doing anything in furtherance of their government aims. And, others either through direct or other softly applied pressure understand that they have obligations to meet. But, it really runs a gamut is what I'm trying to say.Sasse: Is there clarity in the way we, the United States government communicate to folks who come into the U.S. though about our laws and about the expectations about what is and isn't appropriate forms of statecraft and spycraft?Priestap: No, I think that is a great question and, in my experience, there doesn't seem to be consistency, and frankly it is something I think we could do a much better job of, especially in regards to universities and other research institutions, standards of research, what is acceptable behavior and what is not. Is that spelled out for all of the people studying and conducting the research? So, that people know from day one what is right and what is wrong and that there will be consequences if they cross that line.Sasse: And, when you say - and Director Krebs, you and I have had a number of good briefings separate from this and I definitely appreciate your work and also agree with the congratulations on your new role - but when we say that there is coordination but there is not a coordinator, who would be responsible for what Director Priestap just said? Who in the U.S. government is responsible for thinking through this issue of strategic communications with Chinese nationals who come to the U.S., many of them not intending to break laws but ultimately having pressure on them to break our laws or be involved in corporate and economic espionage? And, who in the U.S. government is communicating with the tech companies about the hiring they are doing? Who is communicating with the universities about the often-nefarious effects of the Confucius Institutes? Where does that responsibility reside in the U.S. government?Krebs: I see those as counterintelligence and law enforcement roles and responsibilities that there is a substantial amount of coordination that happened through the National Security Council led in part by the Director of FBI and the Director of National Intelligence. Now, my job is principally cybersecurity and risk management is to carry the message they develop and then push it out through the public/private partnerships whether it's with industry or with academia.Sasse: Thanks. Director.Priestap: I'm sorry, Senator. If I may, because I think that just an absolutely critical question in what I'm seeing, not just across government, but across business, across academia, what have you, again there are pockets of great understanding of the threat we're facing and effective responses. But in my opinion, we've got to knit that together better. Our government somehow -- obviously we have three separate branches intentionally, but if we're facing a whole of government, some call it a whole of society -- not meaning every person in the society is posing the threat but people from all walks of life -- you can't effectively combat that threat with ad hoc responses. We need more people in government, more people in business, more people in academia pulling in the same direction to combat this threat effectively.Sasse: Going back to the point you made earlier about spy on spy, the Chinese clearly understand that this is not merely a spy on spy initiative anymore, and our system is the better system in the long-term. Decentralization is the better system for human flourishing and for innovation, but it certainly puts greater communication burdens on us to be able to respond to all of the asymmetric disadvantages that we face. Is there anything we can learn from the Five Eyes partners that we have about how they respond to these kinds of strategic threats.Priestap: I guess the only thing I would add because obviously the FBI and my division coordinates closely with them. We need them. If we think we've got a threat today and people are trying to steal things today, what we have to understand is if they can't get it from the U.S., you go to the place where... you know, somewhere else you could get it. In other words, you look for the soft underbelly. You need a coordinated response. We need as many allies in this fight as is possible.Sasse: I'm at time so, General Demers, I'll just flag for you that I'm going to send you a letter following up on some of the important comments you made about the intention of the department to continue the China Initiative from the Chinese Espionage Act and to ask some questions about how many cases we're currently pursuing. So, thanks for your work.Video of Senator Sasse's exchange is available here: https://outreach.senate.gov/iqextranet/iqClickTrk.aspx?&#38;cid=SenSasse&#38;crop=15497.11416459.5900562.7426128&#38;report_id=&#38;redirect=https%3a%2f%2fwww.youtube.com%2fwatch%3fv%3drnjt9E5ORtw%26feature%3dyoutu.be&#38;redir_log=559493251317447Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6550576 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: December 13, 2018End of Document

Dow plunges 700 points after arrest of Chinese tech execThe Acorn: Drew UniversityDecember 7, 2018 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 745 wordsByline: Eleanor HarrisonBodyChina reacted furiously Thursday after a top executive and daughter of the founder of Chinese telecom giant Huawei were arrested in Canada following a U.S. extradition request, threatening to rattle a trade war truce with the United States.Meng, who is one of the vice chairs on the Chinese technology company's board and the daughter of company founder Ren Zhengfei, was arrested on December 1 and a court hearing has been set for Friday, a Canadian Justice Department spokesman said, according to the Globe and Mail.Meanwhile, a clerk at the B.C. Supreme Court said Meng appeared in court Wednesday and a bail hearing is scheduled for Friday.Justice Department spokesman Ian McLeod says in an email that Meng was arrested Saturday, but further details can not be provided because a publication ban is in effect at her request. Meng was detained in Vancouver but is facing potential extradition to the USA, which had earlier opened an investigation into whetherHuawei sold equipment to Iran despite sanctions on exporting there.China has demanded the release of aHuawei executive who was arrested in Canada in a case that adds to technology tensions with Washington and threatens to complicate trade talks.The company also said it was "not aware of any wrongdoing" by Meng.Eric Harwit, an Asian studies professor at the University of Hawaii at Manoa who has written extensively on Chinese telecoms, said the arrest was not just about sanctions violations but the bigger picture of the U.S. worrying about Chinese hi-tech firms becoming rivals to American companies in the future.The Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Canada said that it resolutely opposes Meng's arrest and demands her immediate release.'China has already made solemn representations to the United States and Canada, demanding they immediately correct their wrong behavior and restore Ms Meng Wanzhou's freedom'.Meng Wanzhou's detention comes after American authorities reportedly launched an investigation into suspected Iran sanctions byHuawei, which was already under scrutiny by United States intelligence officials, who deemed the company a national security threat. "Huawei complies with all applicable laws and regulations where it operates, including applicable export control and sanction laws and regulations of the UN, US and EU",Huawei wrote in the statement.Meng is the daughter ofHuawei founder Ren Zhengfei, and also sits as the deputy chair of the global telco giant.Huawei is one of the world's largest telecoms companies, and is the world's second-largest smartphone manufacturer behind Samsung. -China relations. Though Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping announced a temporary truce in a tariffs war - with Trump agreeing to suspend USA tariff hikes for a period - a more permanent resolution is nowhere in sight.Details of the arrest have not been released but the United States has been investigatingHuawei over possible violation of sanctions against Iran. He said arresting her without that violated her human rights.The Pentagon has alleged the Chinese government could use the phones to spy. American officials have sought to persuade other nations to curb business ventures withHuawei because of security concerns."I do think.the timing has a bearing on those talks in particular becauseHuawei is perhaps the most successful global company in China", said Mr Campling.While Meng's arrest comes at a delicate time in U.S.Huawei's close ties with the Chinese government sparked fears that Beijing could gain access to their networks, enabling it to gather intelligence in their countries, despite repeated denials from the company.The probe ofHuawei is similar to one that threatened the survival of China's ZTE Corp, which pleaded guilty in 2017 to violating USA laws that restrict the sale of American-made technology to Iran."We are full of confidence that China and the USA can reach an agreement within 90 days", the spokesman said Thursday.The US began an investigation in 2016 to ascertain whether or notHuawei has violated American sanctions against Iran.It's hard to overstate the size and importance ofHuawei both within and outside of China, and how shocking this arrest is.Hong Kong-listed ZTE, which was subject to a U.S. banning order earlier his year over security fears before that was reduced to a massive fine, was nearly five percent down.- Espionage worries -Huawei is one of the world's largest telecommunications equipment and services providers.Load-Date: December 7, 2018End of Document

Economic Watch: statistics reveal resilience of Chinese economyCE Noticias Financieras EnglishOctober 10, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 921 wordsBody        Despite moderation in investment and growing trade protectionism, the Chinese economy has maintained a strong growth momentum, Chinese officials said.  In the first four days of the weekly holiday for the National Day that ended today, Chinese customers set new records in the daily data, with more than 100 million travelers within the country and around one million Chinese who made pleasure trips to the abroad, which represented tourist income of more than 100 billion yuan.  In a long-term perspective, the boost that consumption has given to the Chinese economy has been important. For example, in the first half of the year, consumption contributed 78.5 percent of the country's economic expansion, 14.2 percent more than in the same period last year.  From January to August, total retail sales of consumer goods exceeded 24 trillion yuan in China, and monthly consumption exceeded 3 trillion yuan for four consecutive months.  On the other hand, the country's online retail sales grew an amazing 28.2 percent to rise to 5.52 trillion yuan in the first eight months, while the summer box office from June to August rose to 17.4 billion yuan .  Lu Shan, a senior analyst at the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), said China's consumer market has expanded steadily.  The growth of investment in fixed assets, another important driver of the Chinese economy, also showed new positive trends.  In general, China's investment in fixed assets from January to August has grown at a slower rate of 5.3 percent, two percentage points less than in the same period last year.  But in a disaggregated analysis, NBS statistics showed that the slowdown was triggered mainly by investment in construction.  In fact, private investment has expanded 8.7 percent, 3.4 percent more than the national average, and manufacturing investment has increased for five consecutive months.  The decrease in investment in construction has been due mainly to the lack of capital and the Ministry of Finance has urged local governments to accelerate the issuance of special bonds for 1.35 trillion yuan to sustain the financing of projects under construction .  Mao Shenyong, spokesman for NBS, said that soon they will start several construction projects that involve infrastructure to make people's lives easier and expand the potential for economic development.  To stabilize investments, China wants to channel capital to where it is most needed, such as agriculture, the release of poverty and environmental protection.  In terms of exports, the third key driver of China's economic growth, China has become less vulnerable to external uncertainty.  Official statistics show that the country's degree of dependence on foreign trade, the proportion of total foreign trade in relation to the country's gross domestic product (GDP), has decreased from 64 percent in 2000 to 33.5 percent in 2017.  In 2017, only 19 percent of China's exports went to the United States. Chinese exports of 250,000 million dollars subject to the increase of US tariffs represent less than two percentpercent of China's total GDP.  Long Guoqiang, deputy director of the Development Research Center of the State Council, said the risks of trade frictions with the United States are "controllable" in China's total exports and China's economic growth.  Fu Ziying, Vice Minister of Commerce, said that despite trade frictions, stable progress has been made in China's foreign trade.  Up to now, Chinese products have been exported to 231 countries and regions. Five years after China proposed the Strip and Road Initiative, the country's foreign trade with the countries of the Strip and the Route has exceeded 5.5 trillion dollars.  In addition, China recorded a GDP growth of 6.8 percent in the first half of the year and the rate has remained between 6.7 and 6.9 percent for 12 consecutive quarters.  With more than ten million new jobs created in the first eight months, the country has registered a relatively low urban unemployment rate of five percent.  Consumer prices have remained moderate during the same period with a growth rate of two percent, while international reserves remain strong and at the end of September they were more than 3 trillion dollars.  With such good economic fundamentals, the Chinese government has ample room for maneuver to facilitate its economic transformation for high quality development.  The People's Bank of China (PBOC) decided on Sunday to cut the mandatory reserve ratio (RRR, for its acronym in English) for deposits in renminbi, the Chinese currency, by one percentage point from October 15 to optimize the structure of the liquidity of commercial banks and the financial market and reduce financing costs.  The PBOC will continue to implement a prudent and neutral monetary policy, avoid using excessive stimuli and focus on specific adjustments to maintain a solid and sufficient liquidity.  Part of the liquidity obtained with the measure will be used to repay the 450,000 million yuan of the medium-term loan facility (FPMP) that will expire on October 15.  The capital increase of 750 billion yuan will be injected into the market to support small and micro enterprises, private firms and innovative businesses to increase the vitality and resilience of the Chinese economy, strengthen the dynamics of endogenous growth and promote healthy development of the economy real, he said.  The Economic Observatory entry: statistics reveal resilience of Chinese economy was first published in Diario La República. Load-Date: October 10, 2018End of Document

FBI Issues Remarks Regarding Indictment of Chinese HackersTargeted News ServiceDecember 20, 2018 Thursday 1:19 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 849 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe FBI issued the following remarks by Director Christopher Wray regarding the indictment of Chinese hackers:"Thank you, Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein."As evidenced by this investigation, the threats we face have never been more pervasive or more potentially damaging to our national security. And no country poses a broader, more severe, and long-term threat to our nation's economy and cyber infrastructure than China."China's goal, simply put, is to replace the U.S. as the world's leading superpower--and they're breaking the law to get there. They're using an expanding set of non-traditional and illegal methods. And Chinese state-sponsored actors are the most active perpetrators of economic espionage against us."In short, they seek to strengthen themselves and weaken the United States. And while we welcome fair competition, we cannot and will not tolerate illegal hacking, stealing, and cheating."Now, we're not talking about the Chinese people as a whole. We're focused on state-sponsored actors engaged in illegal behavior. These aren't just Chinese officials, employed by the Chinese government. They can be hackers, businessmen, researchers, or front companies acting on behalf of state actors. And often they're recruiting or co-opting employees of American companies--people who are trusted insiders."As noted, the actors named in this indictment were members of a hacking group operating in China that is associated with the Chinese Ministry of State Security--a group known as APT 10. The members of APT 10 conducted major computer intrusion campaigns, targeting U.S. government agencies and companies both in the U.S. and around the world, and stealing hundreds of gigabytes of intellectual property and confidential business information.FBI Director Christopher Wray speaks at a December 20, 2018 press conference at the Department of Justice announcing charges against Zhu Hua and Zhang Shilong, both Chinese nationals and members of the APT 10 hacking group, as Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein looks on."FBI Director Christopher Wray speaks at a December 20, 2018 press conference at the Department of Justice announcing charges against Zhu Hua and Zhang Shilong, both Chinese nationals and members of the APT 10 hacking group, as Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein looks on."The list of victim companies reads like a "Who's Who" of the global economy--from biotechnology to agriculture to health care, and from oil and gas exploration to NASA."Healthy competition is good for the global economy. Criminal conduct is not. Rampant theft is not. Cheating is not."There's no light on this issue between the United States and our law-abiding international partners. We're all standing shoulder-to-shoulder to condemn this conduct."The scope of this investigation was broad, as you might imagine, including our FBI field offices in New Orleans, New York, Sacramento, San Antonio, and Houston."And we're incredibly grateful not only to our DOJ colleagues, but to our partners at the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, and the Department of Homeland Security for their work. We also appreciate our partners in the Department of Defense's Computer Forensic Laboratory, who worked with us as we analyzed hundreds of malware samples. With this malware, FBI and NCIS investigators found key links between major victims and APT 10's "command and control" infrastructure."After identifying additional victims here in the United States and around the world, the FBI's Cyber Action Team--our elite rapid deployment unit--and our cyber counterparts at DHS deployed to multiple locations to provide technical support and investigative assistance. And we worked with our counterparts in the NCIS to investigate APT 10's theft of personally identifiable information from more than 100,000 U.S. Naval service members."We're deeply concerned about American innovation ending up in the wrong hands, including by nation-states like China, intent on stealing the fruits of our research, our economic investment, our development, and our hard work for their own gain."This is conduct that hurts American businesses, American jobs, and American consumers. The Chinese government's not pulling any punches. They want what we have so they can get the upper hand on us. And they're highly strategic in their approach--they're playing the long game."But let me make it perfectly clear: No country should be able to flout the rule of law So we're going to keep tackling this illegal behavior with everything we've got--every investigative technique, every piece of intelligence, and every partnership, from our federal, state, local, and international partners, to our private sector, community, and academic partners."And we're going to keep calling out this state-sponsored behavior for what it is--illegal, unethical, and unfair."It's going to take all of us working together to protect our economic security and our way of life. The American people expect and deserve no less."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6573284 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: January 13, 2019End of Document

The Chinese phone giant that beat Apple to AfricaCNN WireOctober 11, 2018 Thursday 12:19 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1496 wordsByline: Story by Jenni Marsh, CNN Business Video by Luke Rotzler & Laurie Frankel, CNN BusinessDateline: ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (CNN Business) BodyADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (CNN Business) --  One of China's biggest smartphone makers has never sold a handset in the country. Yet thousands of miles away, it dominates markets across Africa. Unknown in the West, Transsion has left global players like Samsung and Apple trailing in its wake in a continent that's home to more than a billion people.In cities like Lagos, Nairobi and Addis Ababa, busy streets are awash with the bright blue shopfronts of Transsion's flagship brand, Tecno. In China, the company doesn't have a single store, and its towering headquarters in the southern megacity of Shenzhen goes largely unnoticed among skyscrapers bearing the names of more famous Chinese tech firms.The company took a different path to success from other top Chinese smartphone makers such as Huawei and Xiaomi, which started out in China before eventually expanding overseas. Transsion built its business in Africa. And it has no plans to come home.The perfect selfieIn Edna Mall on the bustling Bole Road in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, Mesert Baru poses for her Tecno Camon i. "This phone is seriously nice for selfies," says the 35-year-old shop assistant, admiring the picture she just took. Mesert's satisfaction is no accident. Tecno cameras have been optimized for African complexions, explains Arif Chowdhury, vice president of Transsion. "Our cameras adjust more light for darker skin, so the photograph is more beautiful," he says. "That's one of the reasons we've become successful."Transsion founder George Zhu had spent nearly a decade traveling Africa as head of sales for another mobile phone company when he realized that selling Africans handsets made for developed markets was the wrong approach. His timing could hardly have been better. By the mid-2000s, the Chinese government, under its "Going Out" strategy, was encouraging entrepreneurs to look abroad and forge stronger ties with African nations in particular. Cell phones were spreading rapidly in China, but in Africa --- which has a roughly similar population --- they were still a very rare luxury.Africa, in other words, could be the new China.Giving consumers what they wantIn 2006, Zhu launched Tecno in Nigeria, targeting Africa's most populous nation first. From the start, the company's motto was "think global, act local," which meant making phones that met Africans' specific needs."When we started doing business in Africa, we noticed people had multiple SIM cards in their wallet," Chowdhury says. They would awkwardly swap the cards throughout the day to avoid the steep charges operators would levy for calling different networks, says Nabila Popal, who tracks the use of devices in Africa for research firm IDC. "They can't afford two phones," says Chowdhury, "so we brought a solution to them." Zhu made all Tecno handsets dual SIM.More innovations followed. Transsion opened research and development centers in China, Nigeria and Kenya to work out how to better appeal to African users. Local languages such as Amharic, Hausa and Swahili were added to keyboards and phones were given a longer battery life.Extra juice was important. In Nigeria, South Africa and Ethiopia, for example, the government frequently shuts off electricity to conserve power, leaving people unable to charge their phones for hours. In less developed markets, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Chowdhury says, consumers might have to walk 30 kilometers to charge their phone at the local market -- and have to pay to do so. "For those kind of consumers, longer battery life is a blessing," he adds.  Sewedo Nupowaku, the Lagos-based CEO of entertainment company Revolution Media, says he switched from a Samsung S3 to a Tecno L8 for this reason. "I can spend 24 hours constantly talking, browsing on this phone, no problem. With a Samsung, no way." But perhaps Transsion's smartest move was its pricing. It has three main brands: Tecno, Infinix and Itel. Most of their feature and smartphones sell for between $15 and $200. Mesert says she bought her Tecno smartphone for 2,000 birr ($72). At a shop near her workplace, an iPhone 7 costs the equivalent of $906, and a Samsung Galaxy J7 around $360. Average monthly wages in Ethiopia range from 1,500 birr ($54) to 3,000 ($108) birr, and most vendors across Africa don't allow customers to pay in installments. "About 95% of Transsion smartphones cost under $200," says Mo Jia, an analyst at technology research firm Canalys. "They are the king of the budget smartphone."Tecno: 'We are African'Less than a decade ago, Chinese phones were barely on the radar in Africa. In 2010, Nokia and Samsung (SSNLF) dominated sales across the continent. By the first half of this year, Nokia's share of the market had collapsed and Samsung was selling only one in 10 phones. Transsion had come from nowhere to take more than 50% of the market, according to Canalys. For smartphones alone, it accounts for nearly a third of all sales in Africa, according to IDC.Apple (AAPL) has been complacent about African markets, Jia says, because it deemed the slim profit margins on low-cost phones not worth fighting for. Transsion, on the other hand, is happy to work with tight margins, he adds. Apple didn't respond to requests for comment.Transsion's rise reflects the wider role Chinese firms now play in providing the technology people across Africa use to communicate, including the high-speed internet networks on which smartphones rely. Despite security concerns in countries such as the United States and Australia about Huawei and ZTE, Jia expects demand for Chinese products to remain strong in Africa, where governments and consumers are so price sensitive.In its marketing, Transsion plays down its Chinese roots. "In Africa, we say that we are African," Chowdhury says, explaining why Tecno's stores carry no Chinese characters or signs of being a Chinese brand. In the 2017-2018 Brand Africa 100 report, published by African Business magazine, Tecno ranked as the 7th most admired brand in Africa. That was up from 14th the previous year, but it still lagged Samsung (2nd) and Apple (5th). The iPhone is still considered a luxury product that many Africans aspire to own. In Ethiopia, Transsion went a step further to assimilate. Since 2011, every phone it sells in Africa's second most populous nation has been assembled at its facilities in the suburbs of Addis Ababa. About 700 workers piece together Shenzhen-manufactured screens, circuit boards and batteries to churn out 2,000 smartphones and 4,000 feature phones a day.  Transsion says it has a total of 10,000 local employees in Africa, and 6,000 in China. Its low-cost African workforce helps it keep down prices, according to Jia. It also adds appeal for some consumers. "I like that my phone is made in Ethiopia," Mesert says.A homegrown rival to SpotifyNigeria, with its population of 186 million, is Transsion's biggest market. It has connected with consumers there through one of their biggest passions: music.Oye Akideinde, an amateur rapper turned software developer, was recruited by Tecno in 2015 to launch a music app called Boomplay, a homegrown rival to iTunes or Spotify. Most Nigerian internet users grew up illegally downloading music or streaming it for free on YouTube, according to Akideinde, a 40-year-old Lagos resident. Tecno's vision was to attract music lovers by uniting African and international artists on a single platform offering affordable downloads and streaming with advertising. It preloaded the app onto every Tecno smartphone and made it the default music player. The app now has 32 million users.Tecno spun off Boomplay and its apps division into a new company, TranssNet, last year. Backed by NetEase, a $30 billion Chinese internet company, TranssNet plans to introduce a suite of financial apps on smartphones made by Transsion. Chinese companies have been eager to use technology to tap into Africans' spending habits. In 2015, Kenyan mobile payments operator M-Pesa migrated all of its 12.8 million subscribers to Huawei's Mobile Money platform as it expanded across East Africa and beyond. The move increased the number of transactions M-Pesa could process, and the app's user base has more than doubled since then. Expanding in India and beyondFor Transsion, future growth is set to come from building its business outside Africa in other developing markets, such as Russia, Indonesia and Bangladesh. In 2017, it launched Tecno in India and within a year had claimed 5% of the huge market, according to IDC.How did Tecno make such rapid progress? Transsion's Chowdhury says another innovation tailored to local customs has helped. "Indian people use their hands to eat food," he says, "so their fingers get oily. What if you're having lunch and your boss calls? You try to take the call but your fingerprint won't work." The fix: screens that can read greasy fingers.TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

China plans new IP law in bid to tackle key Trump trade issueCNN.comDecember 24, 2018 Monday 8:57 AM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: ASIALength: 492 wordsByline: By Steven Jiang, CNNDateline: Beijing BodyBeijing is promising new measures to protect foreign companies operating in China, its latest apparent move to mollify US President Donald Trump.The Communist government on Sunday submitted a draft of a new law to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the country's rubber-stamp parliament, highlighting provisions aimed at better protecting foreign companies' intellectual property.The proposed foreign investment law would prohibit forced technology transfer from foreign firms to their Chinese partners, a major grievance of Trump and other critics.The move was welcomed by Harley Seyedin, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in South China, who described it as "significant and the correct move by the Chinese government."But he cautioned that foreign companies in China would still face other obstacles even under the planned changes, including a lack of enforcement and "unfair treatment" by local governments.With an emphasis on "equal treatment" as well as "creating a stable, transparent and predictable investment environment," the new law says that foreign companies shall enjoy all state policies "supportive of business development" and participate in government procurement, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency.Chinese officials have previously rejected accusations that foreign companies are treated unfairly, arguing any tech secrets handed over were part of deals that had been mutually agreed upon.The new law appears to be the latest attempt by Beijing to appease Trump, who has repeatedly voiced his concerns around technology theft by the Chinese government.Negotiations are still ongoing between the US and China after both sides declared a 90-day ceasefire on the trade war following a face-to-face meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Argentina earlier this month."President Trump and President Xi have agreed to immediately begin negotiations on structural changes with respect to forced technology transfer, intellectual property protection, non-tariff barriers, cyber intrusions and cyber theft, services and agriculture," said the White House in a statement at the time.During a high-level phone call last Friday, Chinese and US trade negotiators exchanged views on the protection of intellectual property -- among other issues of mutual concern -- and made new progress, China's commerce ministry said in a brief statement released Sunday.Other recent moves by Beijing to help trade talks have included China resuming the purchase of American soybeans as well as temporarily lifting retaliatory tariffs on US cars and auto parts.But amid the negotiations, Washington announced last Thursday the indictment of two Chinese hackers -- allegedly working for the country's spy agency -- who had stolen trade secrets from dozens of US companies, triggering a strong rebuttal from Beijing.A committee vote for the new foreign investment law is scheduled to take place Saturday.Load-Date: December 25, 2018End of Document

USA accuses China, Taiwan firms with stealing secrets from chip giant MicronStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeNovember 2, 2018 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: MARKETS; Pg. 1Length: 655 wordsByline: Jean GarciaBodyAmid unfulfilled Chinese government promises not to spy on USA companies, Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Thursday announced a major initiative to counter multi-billion dollar theft of American technology from Chinese economic espionage.The indictment released in the U.S. district court in San Jose, California alleges that Chinese state-owned Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co. and privately owned United Microelectronics Corporation of Taiwan, along with three UMC executives, conspired to steal Micron trade secrets to help UMC and Fujian Jinhua develop DRAM chips used in many computer processors."Chinese economic espionage against the United States has been increasing - and it has been increasing rapidly".On Thursday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions criticised China for violating an accord reached with the Obama administration, under which both governments agreed not to support cyberattacks to steal corporate secrets.The U.S. Commerce Department earlier this week also announced that it had put Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co Ltd on a list of entities that can not buy components, software and technology goods from U.S. firms. "But under President Donald Trump, the United States is standing up to the deliberate, systematic, and calculated threats posed, in particular, by the communist regime in China, which is notorious around the world for intellectual property theft"."Taken together, these cases and many others like them paint a grim picture of a country bent on stealing its way up the ladder of economic development and doing so at American expense", Sessions said.According to the DOJ, the value of the documents stolen by Chen, Ho, and Wang may be anywhere between US$400 million and US$8.75 billion dollars.The action also follows heightened trade tensions between the United States and China as the Trump administration has imposed tariffs on about US$250 billion of Chinese exports since July.The Justice Department said Thursday that prior to allegedly stealing from Micron, China did not possess DRAM technology-one that the Chinese Central Government said was a "national economic priority". China has retaliated with tariff increases on $110 billion of American products.Have you seen OnePlus 6T's shiny new avatar in 'Thunder Purple' hueThe full whack of 256GB of storage and 8GB RAM will set users back $629, directly from the official website . Even with that long list of deficiencies, the T-Mobile version will be the best choice for a lot of people.In a tweet Thursday, Trump said he had spoken with China President Xi Jinping and that they had talked about many topics, but mostly trade.United Microelectronics issued a response saying the allegations in the indictment and complaint are "virtually the same as allegations in a civil complaint previously filed against UMC by Micron".The justice department is now prosecuting five additional cases of economic theft and attempted theft that was meant "for the benefit of the Chinese government", Mr Sessions said.Sessions said the department's National Security Division, led by John Demers, along with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and a group of U.S. Attorneys will step up enforcement.The attorney general described it as a "brazen scheme" to steal and clone technology in order to compete with the US.Congress in August passed laws to expand the government's power to review foreign investments in the country.In recent yearsWashington has stepped up its fight against China's alleged ongoing economic espionage programme to obtain all sorts of advanced technologies, from agriculture to heavy manufacturing.The indictment was filed September 27 and unsealed Thursday, when the civil case was filed.In addition to the criminal case, the Justice Department filed a civil lawsuit seeking to prevent the two companies from exporting any products created using the trade secrets and blocking the further transfer of trade secrets.Load-Date: November 2, 2018End of Document

According to the indictment, the men are part of a group known as APT 10, which operates from China "in association with the Chinese Ministry of State Security," the United States Department of Justice said.  (You may be interested: What is behind the Huawei case)  Between 2006 and 2018, that group led "a global computer intrusion campaign" to steal confidential data and trade secrets from 45 companies in 12 countries, including the United States, France, Germany, Canada and the United Kingdom.  They pointed particularly to specialized service companies that manage remote IT services from other companies or organizations, which is also known as Managed Service Provider (MSP). Among its victims is a global financial institution, three telecommunications companies, a supplier of auto parts.  "It is simply deception and theft, and that gives China an unfair advantage at the expense of companies from countries that respect international rules," Rod Rosenstein, number two of the Justice Department, told a news conference.  "It will be difficult for China to ensure that it is not responsible" for these attacks, now that the United States has issued a very precise and detailed indictment, he added. No country represents "such a heavy and prolonged threat" as China, said FBI director Christopher Wray. According to him, China wants to replace the United States as the world's leading power. China answers The Asian giant called the allegations defamatory and filed a new formal complaint with the Trump government. "We urge the US to immediately correct these defamatory accusations, which severely violate the basic norms that govern international relations and are seriously damaging to bilateral ties," the spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry Hua said today. Chunying at a press conference in Beijing.  Also, Hua returned the accusation and assured that it is Washington that is behind multiple attacks of this type, before which China "will take the necessary measures" to safeguard its own cyber security and interests.  "It is an open secret that the United States is launching follow-up campaigns to observe governments, companies and individuals from other countries," Hua said, something China will "never accept." "A complicated relationship" Republican President Donald Trump made a remarkable rapprochement with Beijing and its president Xi Jinping at the start of his term in 2017, but since then bilateral relations have experienced ups and downs and have recently ceased their trade war.  In spite of that, Washington does not stop accusing Peking of having broken a pact of non-espionage signed in 2015 with former US President Barack Obama.  "Our relationship with China is complicated, they conduct espionage and influence operations here in the United States," Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently declared.  (You may be interested: The Huawei financial director asks for her release before a judge in Vancouver)  According to the US government, approximately 90% of the cases of economic espionage that have been under investigation the last sevenyears and two thirds of the affairs of theft of industrial secrets involve Beijing. The indictments of the two Chinese pirates, therefore, are nothing new.  At the end of October, ten Chinese citizens were accused by the US justice system of espionage against aviation companies in France and the United States.  But it was not a matter of economic espionage that has most compromised the relationship between the two countries recently: on December 1, the daughter of the founder of Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei was arrested in Canada at the request of the United States.  Meng Wanzhou, 46, is suspected of fraud to evade US sanctions against Iran. Released on bail, Washington asks for his extradition. Load-Date: December 21, 2018End of Document

Pence Accuses China Of "Malign" Efforts To Undermine TrumpThe FrontrunnerOctober 5, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 1198 wordsBodyReuters (10/4, Brunnstrom, Spetalnick) reports Vice President Pence "escalated Washington's pressure campaign against Beijing" on Thursday by accusing China of "malign" efforts to undermine President Trump ahead of next month's midterm elections. In "what was billed as a major policy address" to the Hudson Institute, Pence "sought to build on Trump's speech at the United Nations last week in which he alleged that China was trying to interfere in the pivotal Nov. 6 midterm elections." Reuters says that "neither Trump nor Pence provided hard evidence of Chinese meddling." Pence, Breitbart (10/4, Moons, 1.34M) reports, presented China's actions as evidence that "President Trump's leadership is working; and China wants a different American President."In what USA Today (10/4, Shesgreen, 11.57M) calls "a highly anticipated speech," Pence said, "China has initiated an unprecedented effort to influence American public opinion, the 2018 elections, and the environment leading into the 2020 presidential elections." Specifically, Pence said, "Beijing has mobilized covert actors, front groups, and propaganda outlets to shift Americans' perception of Chinese policies." He added that "a senior American intelligence official" told him "what the Russians are doing pales in comparison to what?China is doing across this country."The Washington Post (10/4, Gearan, 12.5M) characterizes Pence's speech as "sharply critical" and says it "marked another escalation in rising tensions between Washington and Beijing." Pence cast Beijing's efforts "as a highly coordinated, 'whole-of-government approach' to promote its interests around the world, including in the United States." In charging that "China is also growing more aggressive on the military front," the Washington Times (10/4, Mu?oz, 520K) reports Pence "pointed to the near crash in the South China Sea this week when a Chinese naval ship came dramatically close to the USS Decatur, as an example."The Wall Street Journal (10/4, Bender, Subscription Publication, 6.33M) reports Pence also called on Google to halt development of a project it said would accelerate censorship efforts in China. Said Pence, "Google should immediately end development of the Dragonfly app that will strengthen Communist Party censorship and compromise the privacy of Chinese customers." A spokeswoman for Google declined to comment. Axios (10/4, McCabe, 591K) also briefly reports his comments about Google.McClatchy (10/4, Ordo?ez, 20K) reports Pence "used Latin America as a pointed example of Beijing's aggressive moves." He "pointed directly at the economic and humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, where he said Beijing has given a 'lifeline' to the leaders there through $5 billion in questionable loans."Navarro: China Deliberately Trying To Put "Rest Of The World Out Of Business."National Trade Council Director Navarro said on Fox News' Special Report (10/4, 2.38M) that "as a matter of economic strategy...China likes to put the rest of the world out of business. ... From the military point of view, the report doesn't speculate on that. But we do no there's critical vulnerabilities, not just with China, but for a whole range of countries where we are relying on them."Perdue: US Food Producers Should Not Have Become So Dependent On China.Reuters (10/4) reports Agriculture Secretary Perdue said Thursday that the US "'probably made a mistake' becoming too trade dependent on China, and that the administration was pursuing new trade deals elsewhere." Speaking to the North American Meat Institute, Perdue said, "We probably made a mistake in becoming too dependent on the China market."Bannon: Trump "Won't Back Down" In Trade War With China.The Washington Times (10/4, Boylan, 520K) reports that in an interview published in Thursday's edition of Hong Kong's South China Morning, Steve Bannon said Trump plans to make the trade war with China "unprecedentedly large" and "unbearably painful" for Beijing. Bannon explained the sanctions Trump has levied on China "were not just to force Beijing to abandon its 'unfair trade practices' - but ultimately to 're-industrialize America.'" Bannon also insisted that Trump "will not back down."Ambassador: US, EU Should Reach Trade Deal In Order To Unite Against China.The Washington Post (10/4, Taylor, 12.5M) reports Gordon Sandlan, US Ambassador to the EU, "is offering a message to a continent that is frequently at odds with his boss: Let's get over our problems so that we can take on China together." According to the Post, Sandlan "told a group of reporters in Brussels that once the United States had an appropriate trade deal with Europe, they could form a unified front to take on China." Said Sandlan, "The jackpot is having what is about $40 trillion combined GDP working as a bloc in terms of dealing with Chinese growth, Chinese theft of intellectual property, Chinese malign activity, Chinese militarization in South China Sea and all the other things we've been calling out to China to stop doing. ... The sooner we conclude our business, the sooner we can both turn to the real opportunity, which is to deal with China."Tariff Supporter Graham Has Advocated For South Carolina Companies Hurt By China Tariffs.The New York Times (10/4, Tankersley, 16.73M) reports that Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) "has been one of the biggest proponents of President Trump's crackdown on China, welcoming tariffs on Chinese imports." According to the Times, at the same time, Graham "has been working to help chemical and textile companies in his home state avoid the pain of Mr. Trump's trade war" by "writing letters urging the Trump administration to remove materials they rely on from a list of goods subject to Mr. Trump's tariffs." The Times says Graham "has written seven letters to the United States trade representative on behalf of companies seeking tariff relief - more than any other member of Congress has penned" - and "four of those seven received at least some of the relief they were seeking."Apple, Amazon Challenge Report Their Servers Harbored Chinese Surveillance Chips.The Washington Post (10/4, Shaban, 12.5M) says that yesterday Bloomberg BusinessWeek reported China "secretly inserted surveillance microchips into servers used by major technology companies, including Apple and Amazon.com, in an audacious military operation likely to further inflame trade tensions between the United States and its leading source of electronics components and products." According to Bloomberg, "one affected company had its servers used by US government clients, including Department of Defense data centers, Navy warships and the CIA in its drone operations." However, throughout the day Thursday, "the Chinese government, Apple, Amazon and other involved companies disputed the report," while "several US officials...said they were uncertain about" Bloomberg's "accuracy."Reuters (10/4) reports that Apple "said it had refuted 'virtually every aspect' of the story in on-record responses to Bloomberg." Apple said it "has never found malicious chips, 'hardware manipulations' or vulnerabilities purposely planted in any server." Likewise, Amazon Web Services "said it found no issues."Load-Date: October 5, 2018End of Document

TAIWAN PRESIDENT DEFENDS DIRECTOR AFTER CHINA PULLS PLUG ON AWARDS FOOTAGEStates News ServiceNovember 20, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1150 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Chinese government censors recently issued an edict to state-run media outlets to pull the plug on all live coverage and livestreaming of Taiwan's Golden Horse Awards ceremony, after a winning director voiced her desire to see the democratic island become "an independent entity.""All websites are to cease livestreams and live broadcasts following the remarks on Taiwan independence at the Golden Horse Awards ceremony," the country's powerful propaganda department said in a Nov. 17 directive to editors leaked and published by the China Digital Times website.The order came after director Fu Yue, who won the award for best documentary for a film about Taiwan's 2014 Sunflower student protest movement, said during her acceptance speech in Taipei that her biggest hope was for "our country" to be regarded as an "independent entity."Taiwan has been ruled separately from China since the KMT nationalist government fled there in 1949 after losing a civil war on the mainland to Mao Zedong's communists, who have never ruled the island.Recent polls show that the majority of Taiwan's 23 million population identify as Taiwanese rather than Chinese, and that there is broad popular support for continued self-rule. But Beijing has threatened to invade, should the island seek formal nationhood.Taiwan president Tsai Ing-wen said via Facebook that her administration had never accepted Beijing's insistence that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China."We have never accepted the term 'Chinese Taiwan,'" Tsai said in a Facebook post on Sunday . "Taiwan is just Taiwan."She said Taiwan's annual Golden Horse Awards are emblematic of the freedoms that make the island different from mainland China."Nobody here will disappear or be silenced for expressing differing viewpoints," she wrote, "and we also don't have sensitive terms that are censored on the internet."Taiwan has been administered officially since 1949 by the 1911 Republic of China, an entity that few countries now recognize diplomatically.Beijing sees the island as one of its provinces awaiting "reunification" and has put pressure on its diplomatic partners to isolate Taipei on the international stage.Abusive comments from ChinaTaiwan's Sunflower student protest movement occupied the island's parliament, the Legislative Yuan, in 2014 to protest plans for closer ties with China under then KMT president Ma Ying-jeou, Tsai's predecessor.After a massive online backlash from internet users in China, Fu doubled down on her pro-independence comments via her Facebook page."I received more than 10,000 comments on my Facebook page, the majority of which came from China, including a lot of abusive and attacking ones, but I'm neither very angry nor sad after reading them," Fu wrote."My speech at the awards ceremony wasn't made on a whim, and neither was it made, as some Chinese netizens have said, at the instruction of the [ruling] Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government," she said."This is something I have been wanting to say all along with that film."Participants from mainland China later boycotted the banquet celebrating the awards in protest at Fu's speech, and Fu said she has been warned by many that she will never gain entry to the movie industry in mainland China now."Of course it's a shame that I won't be having contact with the best people working in the Chinese film industry now, but I am prepared for that outcome ... and I have no regrets," she said in her Facebook post.Entertainment industry figures in Taiwan and Hong Kong have routinely been blacklisted and had their work banned from mainland China after they expressed pro-independence or pro-democracy views.Gong Yujian, an exiled dissident from mainland China now based in Taiwan, said the administration of President Xi Jinping expects total submission to the party line from anyone working in its creative industries."Artists [in mainland China] are the guardians of the current system, because these so-called artists rely on the system to make their living," Gong said. "If they ever have an idea of their own, the only possible outcome would be for them to be shut down entirely.""Under the total suppression carried out by the Chinese Communist Party, there is no concept that there should be no politics in ... the film and entertainment industry," he said.'Anti-communist award'Writer Neil Peng, whose co-authoring of the screenplay for Ang Lee's The Wedding Banquet netted him a Golden Horse in 1993, said the awards date back to KMT rule on Taiwan under late Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, and refer not to horses, but to Taiwan's outpost islands of Kinmen and Matsu, which would be first in line in any invasion from across the Taiwan Strait."It's an anti-communist award," Peng said. "Anyone trying to redefine it today from their own perspective is really pretty ignorant."Peng said he had thanked "political dissidents" when he made his acceptance speech at the awards in 1993, and the then ruling KMT had cut off the live broadcast too."Back in the day, the KMT did the exact same thing that the Communist Party is doing now," he said.In July, an iconic statue of Chiang was splattered in blood-like stains after protesters filled egg-shells with red paint and hurled them at the Generalissimo's image, in protest at the use of public money to maintain symbols of authoritarian Chinese rule.Activists from the groups From Ethnos to Nation (FETN) and Chhengli-n ToÌkph i (Youth For Independence) also unfurled banners that read: "Eliminate Chinese tyranny: build our own Republic of Taiwan!"FETN said the red paint represented the blood of victims of 38 years of martial law under the authoritarian presidencies of Chiang Kai-shek and his son, Chiang Ching-kuo.A 2006 government-funded report found that Chiang Kai-shek bore the main responsibility for mass killings of civilians by KMT nationalist troops in Taiwan during a massacre on Feb. 28, 1947, prompting victims' groups and social activists to call for an end to public veneration of the late Generalissimo.The bloodshed was triggered after a fight broke out between government officials and an illegal cigarette vendor in Taipei on Feb. 27, 1947, sparking an uprising of native Taiwanese against the incoming KMT regime.Further violence followed as the KMT imposed decades of martial law, including several waves of political purges of government opponents that saw 140,000 tried by military courts in an era known as the White Terror, during which thousands were executed.Taiwan had been ruled as a Japanese colony in the 50 years prior to the end of World War II, but was handed back to the 1911 Republic of China as part of Tokyo's post-war reparation deal.Reported by Hsia Hsiao-hwa for RFA's Mandarin Service, and by Wong Siu-san and Lau Siu-fung for the Cantonese Service.

China limits freedom of speech on social mediaSpartan Daily: San Jose State UniversityOctober 25, 2018 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: OPINION; Pg. 1Length: 691 wordsByline: Huan Xun ChanBodySocial media surveillance in China has formed an alternative nationalism and shaped citizens to devote themselves to patriotism.Most internet users in China are aware of the censorship but still willingly take part by giving speeches on social media.I realized after years of being under surveillance that  internet users tend to voluntarily devote themselves to express and speak in ways that favor the central government.I do not see many spaces where the people in the country can voice their resentment. Holding a protest in the country is almost tagging individuals as the targets for the government. Having an online protest is not efficient either because of the censorship.General Secretary Xi Jinping's ultimate goal is to restore China from the loss of national greatness and achieve the "China Dream" of the country rising international influence. The national administration comes out with different approaches to repress the resentment of the people.According to P. W. Singer and Emerson T. Brooking, the writers for "LikeWar: The Weaponization of Social Media," there is a group of about 3 million people who are trained and accredited to monitoring and infiltrating political conversations on Chinese social media. The group is called the "50 Cent Army" and its role is to seed positive things about the Chinese government and comment favorably on the government policies. As a user of one of the country's largest social media portals, Weibo, I observed that the major media outlets would publish mourning posts during the national memorial days and historical dates for tragic events. A single post such as this would eventually be retweeted and commented by hundreds of thousands of users. Key opinion leaders such as celebrities usually do not promote themselves on that particular day and only retweet the posts to show their patriotism.I believe that there might be a mix of real users and trained users who help in spreading government propaganda among this number of reactions. Nevertheless, I am worried that people in the country would lose critical thinking after being exposed to the brainwashing propaganda and kept away from the opposite voices.Behaving appropriately online does not reward the users, however, misbehavior brings a penalty to the individual.In early October, a Chinese live-streaming host was detained five days for singing the national anthem in a "disrespectful" manner during a broadcast to millions of her followers, according to the New York Times.Another live-streaming host outraged public dissent after making fun of the Nanjing Massacre during her broadcast, according to Global Times. Her account had been banned by the live-streaming portal and was shunned by the other social media outlets.The public outrage showed that it's not only the state officials who do not allow free speech but ordinary internet users are also being framed in the nationalistic-only mindset. The Chinese government is going to implement the social credit system in the next few years and hopefully it will be in place for about 800 million Chinese internet users by 2020, according to Singer and Brooking.Under that system, all different kinds of online activities will be brought together into a single score of social trustworthiness, ranging from online shopping to playing video games. The score will not only affect the individual's online behavior but also the individual's social network. The social credit score of people around the individual is taken into account in hopes that the individual is making a positive influence on people around them.The government is able to monitor every Chinese internet users. Also, it is a way to train internet users to behave appropriately online in order to get a high score, which in turns will limit the freedom of speech and remove the voice of resentment.It's unbelievable and scary. I could imagine people living under high surveillance and losing their freedom of speech, but I couldn't imagine people losing their critical thoughts because they are being exposed to too much propaganda or because they want to fit in with society and favor the people with power.Load-Date: October 26, 2018End of Document

Wang Dan, Student Leader From Tiananmen Square Protest, to Speak at CornellCornell Daily Sun: Cornell UniversityNovember 13, 2018 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 401 wordsByline: Miguel SotoBodyNearly thirty years ago, a Peking University freshman organized one of the most consequential protests in modern Chinese history, making him one of the most wanted men in all of China after the government squashed the dissent. Now, he is bringing his contentious views on Chinese democratization to Cornell.After serving a few years in a Chinese prison and earning a Ph.D. in history from Harvard University, Wang Dan - the world-famous student leader of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests against the Chinese government - will speak on Wednesday in Kaufman Auditorium at 6:30 p.m.The speaker at the event will address whether the U.S. should "actively support democratization in China," according to the event's Facebook page. The event is co-hosted by the Cornell Political Union, Cornell Democrats, Cornell Republicans, Cornell Asian Pacific Student Union and Cornell International Affairs Society, according to John Sullivan '20, CPU president.Living in the United States, Dan currently addresses Chinese communities and students, said Michael Johns '19, president of the Cornell Republicans and an opinion columnist for The Sun.The government violently cracked down on the protests fueled by a yearning for democratization, killing "hundreds to thousands" of Chinese student demonstrators, Johns said. Dan was no exception to the crack down - Johns said he was listed as "most wanted" by the Chinese government of the protesters that escaped death.Johns praised Dan for exemplifying " the inherent desire in all people to be free," urging Cornellians to go see the democratic reformer."His efforts are a testament to the bravery of the human spirit, and the lengths that human beings are willing to go to achieve that freedom and earn peace," Johns said. "I believe that it's important for Cornellians to connect with this idea and to understand the price of freedom, especially given our detached position safe in the woods of upstate New York."Sullivan echoed Johns' sentiment, saying that he hopes Wang's history of standing up for his principles will resonate with Cornellians."We hope that Dr. Wang will inspire Cornellians to stand up for their values," Sullivan said. "Though he's risked death, spent seven years in prison, and was exiled from the country he loves, he continues to challenge the authoritarian one-party state and speak out against the Chinese' government's human rights abuses."Load-Date: November 14, 2018End of Document

China’s future weapon vs. America: Its growing middle class | Trudy RubinPhilly.comNovember 14, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 Distributed by Tribune Content AgencySection: COMMENTARYLength: 857 wordsByline: Trudy Rubin, Philly.comBodyNov. 14--YANTAI, China  — They shop in malls and high-end supermarkets, buy condos by the seaside, attend wine tastings, vacation abroad, and push their kids to apply to Harvard. But they aren't American suburbanites; they are China's huge and growing urban middle class, which Beijing hopes will eventually consume enough to lower the country's dependence on exports.Whatever the outcome of the U.S.-China trade war – and any tête-...-tête between Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping at the upcoming G-20 meeting  in Argentina – China's urban middle class is set to become a major driver of the global economy.  And a major force in the wider world.If you trust Chinese government figures, the middle class already tops 400 million, larger than the entire U.S. population. Even if you cut that figure in half, it outstrips the U.S. middle class of roughly 120 million.  Moreover, despite far lower earnings than their Western counterparts, lower costs in China give them living standards approximating southern Europe.And unlike their frugal parents and grandparents, who lived through China's poverty years and Cultural Revolution and are avid savers, younger Chinese are more eager to spend.On a trip to Beijing, to Chengdu in western China, and to Yantai and Qingdao on the east coast, I saw a booming consumption culture that outstripped anything I'd seen in previous visits.High-end, indoor malls everywhere sporting luxury western brands are already old news.  Add to that a new chain of high-tech supermarkets called 7Fresh – the Chinese version of Whole Foods.  I visited one in Beijing replete with glitzy packaging and lighting, and mobile shopping carts that follow you around. I watched sales people inform Chinese shoppers of every detail of where and how live lobsters, stone crabs, and other sea creatures were caught and delivered still breathing.7Fresh is an offshoot of JD.com, an Amazon wannabe and part of China's e-commerce explosion, that has a China-wide delivery network replete with drones and bikes that can reach 90 percent of the country with same- and next-day delivery.By the way — and this made me feel really archaic — almost no one pays with cash or credit cards these days in China: I watched everyone from kids to old ladies pull out cell phones and flash their Alipay mobile app (from Alibaba, the e-commerce giant). Payments are deducted from their bank accounts.Old ladies with phones? As of early 2017, mainland Chinese consumers accounted for an estimated 243 million iPhone users, a third of all iPhones in use globally, according to research firm Newzoo. But there are excellent, far cheaper Chinese brands for those who want to spend less.On the weekend, Beijing's 798 art district, in a decommissioned military factory, is jammed with Chinese spenders browsing its galleries, cafes, and restaurants.  So is the area around Beijing's Beihai Lake, where old Chinese houses have been converted into shops. Young people eat ice cream in the shape of flowers and Peking duck shredded into Mexican-style tortillas.And how does the middle class spend its vacations? In Yantai, a lovely port city 350 miles from Beijing, newish seaside hotels and restaurants line the oceanfront. Row after row of luxury apartment towers overlook white sandy beaches and  the Yellow Sea across from South Korea; they are snapped up by well-heeled urban Chinese seeking to escape awful urban pollution — and find cheaper real estate.Chinese tourists who want greater rustication can visit Majiagou Village, a former collective farm that has been converted into a tourist destination, as part of a government project to revitalize the countryside. Visitors can stay in a two-story hotel and take their children to pick Yantai's famous Fuji apples in local orchards (I picked some, and they were delicious.)  Villagers said 300,000 visitors had arrived from all over China, as well as South Korea, since 2016.On the more upscale end, I visited Yantai's Changyu winery, dating back to 1892, but now prospering from the new Chinese middle class's widening tastes.  The Changyu Noble Dragon cabernet went down well in a lavish tasting room; reviews say that Chinese wine quality is seriously improving and exports to Europe are growing.None of this is meant to disguise China's problems, including rural poverty and frayed social safety nets.  Middle-class Chinese worry about an economic slowdown and about getting their kids into good schools or getting them visas to U.S. colleges (Some enroll their kids as young as 1 year old in weekday boarding schools with names such as Harvard Cradle, to expose them to intensive language and music training and boost their chances of winning admission to the best U.S. universities.)In my conversations, worries about freedom of speech or political liberalization appear subordinated these days to economic concerns.  Who knows what will happen in the future.  The impact of this rising, ambitious population on its own government and the world is the most fascinating question in China today.___ (c)2018 Philly.com Visit Philly.com at www.philly.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.Load-Date: November 15, 2018End of Document

CHINESE HACKERS, AGENTS IN PLOT TO HACK AEROSPACE TECH FROM US COMPANIESStates News ServiceNovember 1, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 673 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Chinese spies and hackers have been indicted for "repeated intrusions into companies' computer systems" in the U.S. and elsewhere for more than five years, the U.S. Department of Justice has announced.Zha Rong, Chai Meng and other co-conspirators worked for the provincial arm of China's state security police in the eastern province of Jiangsu, which has its headquarters in Nanjing, the DOJ said in a statement on its website."The conspirators' ultimate goal was to steal, among other data, intellectual property and confidential business information, including information related to a turbofan engine used in commercial airliners," it said.Zha and Zhai used a team of hackers including Zhang Zhanggui, Liu Chunliang, Gao Hongkun, Zhuang Xiaowei, and Ma Zhiqi to try to steal technology for a turbofan engine used on U.S. and European commercial airliners, it said.The hackers used a range of techniques, including spear phishing, to sow different strains of malware into company computer systems using the victim companies' own websites as "watering holes" to compromise website visitors' computers, and domain hijacking through the compromise of domain registrars, the DOJ said.The first alleged hack had begun by Jan. 8, 2010, when members of the conspiracy infiltrated Capstone Turbine, a Los-Angeles-based gas turbine manufacturer, in order to steal data and use the Capstone Turbine website as a "watering hole" to compromise site visitors' computers.French connectionThe team also recruited insiders working for a French aerospace manufacturer that had an office in Jiangsu's Suzhou city and a partner company based in the United States, before hacking the computer systems of the French company.The French company in Suzhou hired two employees in 2013, Tian Xi and Gu Chen, who had sought their jobs at the behest of the Jiangsu state security department. They then facilitated the infection of the company's systems with malware, and warned the department when the malware was discovered, enabling it to cover its tracks to a certain extent, the statement said.Companies based in Arizona, Massachusetts and Oregon linked to the turbofan project were also targeted."At the time of the intrusions, a Chinese state-owned aerospace company was working to develop a comparable engine for use in commercial aircraft manufactured in China and elsewhere," the DOJ statement said.Zhang and Li Xiao were also accused of freelancing off the back of the state-sponsored hacking project for their own gain in a project that included a hack targeting a technology company based in San Diego, it said."For the third time since only September, the National Security Division, with its US Attorney partners, has brought charges against Chinese intelligence officers from [Jiangsu] and those working at their direction and control for stealing American intellectual property," U.S. Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers said in a statement."This is just the beginning. Together with our federal partners, we will redouble our efforts to safeguard America's ingenuity and investment," Demers said.Hacking continuesJohn Brown, FBI Special Agent in Charge of the San Diego Field Office, said Chinese state-sponsored hacking attempts have continued unabated."The threat posed by Chinese government-sponsored hacking activity is real and relentless," Brown said. "Today, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, with the assistance of our private sector, international and U.S. government partners, is sending a strong message to the Chinese government and other foreign governments involved in hacking activities."The DOJ successfully extradited an officer with the Jiangsu state security department to Ohio in connection with a hacking attempt linked to technology for jet aircraft engines, while a U.S. Army recruit was charged in September of working for the Jiangsu state security department.Reported by RFA's Cantonese Service.

NATURAL RESOURCES: Bishop still suspicious of global research group's ties to ChinaGreenwireOctober 18, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 Environment and Energy Publishing, LLCSection: Congress; Vol. 10; No. 9Length: 556 wordsBodyThis story was updated at 2 p.m. EDT. House Natural Resources Committee Republicans are demanding more information from a global natural resources research group on its relationship with the Chinese government. Chairman Rob Bishop (R-Utah) and Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.), the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee chairman, aren't satisfied with the initial response from the World Resources Institute in which the group denied that its work with China's government affected its political activities related to environmental policy within the United States. WRI also told the panel last month that it does not act on behalf of any foreign governments or agents. The Republicans, however, in a letter yesterday cited an April 2015 email exchange between WRI staff and Obama administration officials that they say indicates "WRI actions on behalf of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment of the People's Republic of China in the months prior to the draft of the Paris agreement." The email from the then-global director of WRI's climate program to a State Department official said China's National Center for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation had approached the group "to pursue a dialogue ... that would bring together top experts from the US and China. We are in the beginning stages of thinking this through and would benefit immensely from your inputs on how such a dialogue could support the vital processes underway now and also what it could do to think through the longer-term issues to be considered." Bishop and Westerman, requesting more documents and correspondence from WRI by Monday, said the email doesn't square with the organization's unambiguous stance that it isn't acting on behalf of any foreign entity. "Similarly, WRI's refusal to provide documents and information responsive to the committee's inquiries raise additional concerns regarding WRI's candor," they wrote. The two lawmakers in part want more information from WRI to demonstrate "why FARA [Foreign Agents Registration Act] requirements do not apply" to the group. FARA requires those acting as agents of foreign principals "in a political or quasi-political capacity" to publicly disclose the nature of that relationship periodically. The global research organization, which works in more than 60 countries and has several international offices, provided information to the panel after its first request in September (E&E Daily, Sept. 6). WRI said in a statement today to E&E News the committee's allegations have "no merit" and that it "works around the globe to pursue our mission of creating a sustainable world for people and the environment." The organization added: "WRI is an open, transparent, non-partisan research organization. We consistently receive the highest ratings for transparency by Charity Navigator, Transparify, and other independent evaluators. We will respond to the Committee, as we vigorously pursue our goal to make a safer and more vibrant world for people today and future generations." Natural Resources Republicans have fired off similar letters and requests for information to the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Center for Biological Diversity. Both groups have strongly defended their activities against claims of collaborating improperly with foreign governments (Greenwire, June 28).Load-Date: November 15, 2018End of Document

"While we welcome fair competition, we cannot and will not tolerate illegal hacking, stealing or cheating."Hua, the Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, said: "They believe that a lie repeated a thousand times will become the truth, but I want to tell them that a lie is still a lie even after it has been repeated ten thousand times."In a written statement issued earlier Friday, she said the U.S. was "fabricating facts."The whereabouts of Zhu and Zhang are unclear. China does not have an extradition treaty with the U.S."There is some cooperation under the framework of Interpol, but if the Chinese government doesn't agree with the U.S. charges, there is no way to extradite the accused," said Li Fangping, a Beijing-based criminal lawyer.Li said that if Zhu and Zhang travel to other countries that have signed treaties with the U.S., they could be detained for possible extradition, as was the case with Chinese tech executive Meng Wanzhou's recent arrest in Canada.The indictment says the pair worked for the Huaying Haitai Science and Technology Development Company in Tianjin and acted in association with the Chinese Ministry of State Security's bureau in the northeastern port city.A public company registry says that Huaying Haitai's work includes the development of computer software, consulting and business related to a variety of technical equipment.Among the cyberespionage maneuvers detailed in the indictment is the alleged use of a phishing technique which sent emails that appeared to be coming from legitimate email addresses but were in fact from members of "Advanced Persistent Threat 10," the China-based hacking group to which Zhu and Zhang purportedly belong.James Gong, a cybersecurity senior associate at the Herbert Smith Freehills law firm in Beijing, said the mere announcement of charges is likely to affect public perception of China."The allegation itself will give rise to some suspicion, at least, among the international public, that these hacking activities are actually supported by the Chinese state," he said.___Associated Press writers Michael Balsamo and Eric Tucker in Washington contributed to this story.Load-Date: December 22, 2018End of Document

ePlay's China Initiatives Advance With Multiple Projects; Four significant projects identified with multiple partners in ChinaGlobeNewswireNovember 28, 2018 Wednesday 4:00 AM PTCopyright 2018 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENTLength: 1305 wordsBodyCALGARY, Alberta, Nov.  28, 2018  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ePlay Digital Inc. (CSE:EPY) today announced that it has signed a multiple preliminary agreements to pursue at least four significant sports related projects in China with potential new strategic partners following a series of meetings with Chinese media, gaming, Internet, broadcast, and financing organizations.In August 2018, the Telegraph reported that the Chinese government was to "crack down on children's video games" that are deemed as "violent" or unsavoury. Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported on the approach Internet giant Alibaba would take with non-violent games in the upcoming Asian Games and Olympics, hosted in Beijing. In 2017, according to Bloomberg, the NBA "became China's most popular sports league, with a boost from tech giants such as Weibo and Tencent". Former NBA player, Yao Ming, became the chair of the Chinese Basketball Association, the league in which he got his start as a Shanghai Sharks player.Sports, like basketball and the Olympics are very important in China. From the moment visitors to Shanghai step into the airport, basketball is featured in promotional videos with highlights from NBA exhibition games taking place outdoors under the iconic Oriental Pearl Tower in the downtown district of Shanghai known as Pudong. In demos during the past week in Shanghai, Big Shot was consistently seen as a necessary solution to suit the Chinese marketplace."ePlay has a long history in the convergence of sports and mobile games - a convergence that the Chinese companies we are in discussion with have a penchant for," says Trevor Doerksen, CEO of ePlay Digital."The initial and follow-up meetings with Chinese sports networks, media, game, sports, and financing organizations continue towards bringing sports, advertisers, and fans in China and around the world together," continues Doerksen.The interoperability of the ePlay AR Ad KitTM, Big ShotTM and various initiatives under discussion in China advances state-of-the-art augmented reality marketing/advertising including in-game product placement and location-based calls to action. According to PQ Media, product placement advertising grew "13.7% to USD $8.78 billion in 2017 and is surging toward a ninth consecutive year of double-digit growth in 2018".The location-based advertising, the global market was USD $16B in 2016 and expected to grow to $32B in 2021. At Mobile World Congress 2017, where Mobovivo, an ePlay wholly-owned subsidiary,  earned Top Innovative Company recognition in Mashable, Niantic CEO John Hanke stated that Pokemon Go had already driven 500 million visits to sponsored locations with over 35,000 sponsored locations.Philip Chen, ePlay Board Advisor comments, "the response to Big Shot was extremely positive and we heard over and over again from some of the biggest media, financing, and sports organizations in China that the market is ready for Big Shot."According to NewZoo, "619.5 million players in China will spend $37.9 billion in 2018, which makes it the biggest games market in the world. Mobile games will generate $23 billion of this number." The forces of mobile gaming, esports streaming, augmented reality, product placement, and location-based advertising converge as mobile game playing audiences are multiplied multiple times through advanced engagement with increasing esports viewing audiences.About ePlayePlay Digital Inc. is a mobile game creator and publisher specializing in sports, esports and entertainment augmented reality titles, including their new flagship title Big Shot Basketball. ePlay is operated by an award-winning team of sports, gaming and esports leaders as well as broadcast and digital technology industry experts, software engineers and athletes who have brought dozens of game titles to market for companies including Time Warner Cable, ESPN, Sony Pictures, AXS TV, Intel, AXN, Fiat, CBS, and others.ePlay's wholly owned subsidiary, Mobovivo esports specializes in augmented reality, mobile game development and mobile esports streaming.Further InformationFurther details are available under the Company's profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com, and the Company's profile on the CSE's website at            www.thecse.com/For further media  information, or to set up an interview,  please contact:Nelson HudesHudes Communications InternationalTelephone: (905) 660-9155E-mail: nelson@hudescommunications.comWebsite: www.eplaydigital.comorTrevor Doerksen, CEO ePlay Digital(647) 435-3591Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE): Symbol EPYDeutsche Boerse Xetra - Frankfurt Stock Exchange: Symbol 2NY2; WKN: A2AN4D; ISIN CA26885W1041Cautionary and Forward-Looking StatementsThis news release contains forward looking statements and forward looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws.

US, China set to take action against each other as tensions riseCNN WireDecember 12, 2018 Wednesday 9:35 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1368 wordsByline: By Nicole Gaouette, Donna Borak and David Shortell, CNNDateline: WASHINGTON (CNN) BodyWASHINGTON (CNN) --  China and the US are set to take action against each other as tensions escalate over trade, cyber hacking and espionage as US senior law enforcement officials identified Beijing as the most serious threat to US national security on Wednesday. China's methods of non-traditional espionage -- including their use of ordinary Chinese expatriates instead of spies at universities and businesses, and intellectual property theft -- were explained by officials from the FBI and departments of Justice and Homeland Security who briefed US lawmakers."As the United States proceeds a whole of society response to this threat, we must address the vulnerabilities within our system while preserving our values and the open, free and fair principles that have made us thrive," E.W. Priestap, the FBI's assistant director of counterintelligence told the Senate Judiciary Committee. "What hangs in the balance is not just the future of the United States, but the future of the world."A bargaining chipPriestap and his colleagues testified hours after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo confirmed in an interview with Fox News that the US believes Beijing was behind the massive cyberattack on the Marriott hotel chain. The New York Times reported the assault was part of a broader Chinese operation that also targeted health insurers and the security clearance files of millions of Americans.Those disclosures come a day after President Donald Trump told Reuters he would be willing to use a Chinese tech executive arrested for violating US sanctions on Iran as a bargaining chip in his trade war with Beijing, which for now is in a 90-day pause. "If I think it's good for what will be certainly the largest trade deal ever made -- which is a very important thing -- what's good for national security -- I would certainly intervene if I thought it was necessary," Trump said in the interview.US business executives have been bracing for further retaliation from China, which has called for the release of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Huawei and the daughter of the communications giant's founder, following the detainment of a former Canadian diplomat on Tuesday. A Canadian judge granted Meng a $7.5 million bail, while she awaits extradition to the United States. Retaliation planned"The Huawei arrest was enormously unpopular in China and there is some retaliation planned for by security services. You're likely to see more things like that in the next bit," said a source familiar with ongoing trade negotiations, referring to the diplomat's detainment.The Trump administration has insisted that trade talks are on a separate track from renewed strikes against China to halt cyber espionage practices and intellectual property theft.On Tuesday, Trump said the United States and China were having "very productive conversations" shortly after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Robert Lighthizer, the country's top trade negotiator and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He spoke by phone for the first time following a presidential dinner on Dec. 1.But US-Sino experts argue inevitable intrusion of national security concerns will only further complicate fragile trade talks between the two major superpowers."This is going to make the negotiations more complicated," said Craig Allen, president of the US-China Business Council. "If this were only economic negotiations, it would be relatively easy to reach an agreement. But inevitably, it's going to spill over into other areas, and I think the more national security is tied up in this, the more difficult it will be to reach an agreement."The Justice Department's top national security official told lawmakers on Wednesday the administration is reacting to China's "steadily increasing" economic espionage activity, which costs the US an estimated $225 billion a year.From 2011 to 2018, more than 90% of the DOJ's cases alleging economic espionage by a state have involved China, and more than two-thirds of trade secret thefts have a nexus to China, Assistant Attorney General John Demers said."From underwater drones and autonomous vehicles to critical chemical compounds and inbred corn seeds, China has targeted advanced technology across sectors that align with China's publicly announced strategic goals," Demers said. "The play book is simple: rob, replicate and replace."'Rob, replicate and replace'"Rob American companies of information technology, replicate and replace that American company in the Chinese market and then the global market," Demers outlined.US prosecutions of the cases began in 2014 as the department prioritized the crimes."We've been able to bring a number of cases because the activity is tremendous and the grounds for those cases is very fertile," Demers said.Beijing's espionage focus is clear, Demers said, pointing to a 10-year strategic plan China published in 2015 that outlined 10 advanced technology industries for development."What they're telling us overtly is where they want to lead the world" in areas they believe will be the future of technology, Demers said. "What they deny ritually, openly, is that they're also using illegal means to advance their development goals.""No one begrudges a nation that develops the most innovative ideas ..." Demers said, "but we cannot tolerate a nation that steals the fruits of our brainpower."Priestap said that location is no protection against the reach of China's efforts to steal information. "A lack of participation in the Chinese market will not spare a company from the risks the Chinese government and its companies pose," the FBI official said. "While the risks may be more acute for companies with business in China, all companies, even those solely operating in the United States, are at risk."One way China has shifted its approach, Priestap said, is to move away from "spy vs. spy" operations. Instead, it is now "relying today on people from all walks of life to carry out their aims," Priestap said. "They have a great ability to lean on people -- some who are witting, some who are not witting -- in their society to carry out their aims. Whether they be researchers, scientists, students, businessmen, otherwise tourists, the Chinese intelligence services don't hesitate to ask those people to carry out their aims," Priestap said.No demonizingThe FBI official said, "I'm not trying to demonize any people," but emphasized the reach of the Communist Party and its control of all aspects of Chinese life. Businesses that refuse to meet a party request that might contravene US laws "risk being shut down," Priestap said.China views members of its diaspora in the US including students and technology company executives as "being beholden to them," Priestap said. They will "utilize, lean on those students, say if you want your tuition paid ... then you better not come home empty-handed," he added."They think of them as just simply an extension of their power of their nation," Priestap said. The awareness level of knowledge Chinese nationals in the US have about the way they're being used by their government varies, he said."Based on FBI interaction with some of those individuals, it really is a case-by-case basis," he said. "Some are not knowledgeable in the least and are completely unwitting of doing anything in furtherance of their government's aims and others ... understand they have obligations to meet."Demers said the US is considering new steps for dealing with non-traditional espionage, both in and outside the US. One possibility, he said, is the creation of a body akin to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS. The interagency committee reviews transactions involving foreign investment in the US that involve sensitive technology and can veto sales."We also need to be looking at activity that's perfectly legal, but may pose a national security threat," Demers told the committee, saying it may require legislation and should include measures to counter theft of US intellectual property outside the US by non-Americans.

US, China set to take action against each other as tensions riseCNN.comDecember 12, 2018 Wednesday 8:42 PM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICSLength: 1350 wordsByline: By Nicole Gaouette, Donna Borak and David Shortell, CNNDateline: Washington BodyChina and the US are set to take action against each other as tensions escalate over trade, cyber hacking and espionage as US senior law enforcement officials identified Beijing as the most serious threat to US national security on Wednesday.China's methods of non-traditional espionage -- including their use of ordinary Chinese expatriates instead of spies at universities and businesses, and intellectual property theft -- were explained by officials from the FBI and departments of Justice and Homeland Security who briefed US lawmakers."As the United States proceeds a whole of society response to this threat, we must address the vulnerabilities within our system while preserving our values and the open, free and fair principles that have made us thrive," E.W. Priestap, the FBI's assistant director of counterintelligence told the Senate Judiciary Committee. "What hangs in the balance is not just the future of the United States, but the future of the world."A bargaining chipPriestap and his colleagues testified hours after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo confirmed in an interview with Fox News that the US believes Beijing was behind the massive cyberattack on the Marriott hotel chain. The New York Times reported the assault was part of a broader Chinese operation that also targeted health insurers and the security clearance files of millions of Americans.Those disclosures come a day after President Donald Trump told Reuters he would be willing to use a Chinese tech executive arrested for violating US sanctions on Iran as a bargaining chip in his trade war with Beijing, which for now is in a 90-day pause."If I think it's good for what will be certainly the largest trade deal ever made -- which is a very important thing -- what's good for national security -- I would certainly intervene if I thought it was necessary," Trump said in the interview.US business executives have been bracing for further retaliation from China, which has called for the release of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Huawei and the daughter of the communications giant's founder, following the detainment of a former Canadian diplomat on Tuesday. A Canadian judge granted Meng a $7.5 million bail, while she awaits extradition to the United States.Retaliation planned"The Huawei arrest was enormously unpopular in China and there is some retaliation planned for by security services. You're likely to see more things like that in the next bit," said a source familiar with ongoing trade negotiations, referring to the diplomat's detainment.The Trump administration has insisted that trade talks are on a separate track from renewed strikes against China to halt cyber espionage practices and intellectual property theft.On Tuesday, Trump said the United States and China were having "very productive conversations" shortly after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Robert Lighthizer, the country's top trade negotiator and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He spoke by phone for the first time following a presidential dinner on Dec. 1.But US-Sino experts argue inevitable intrusion of national security concerns will only further complicate fragile trade talks between the two major superpowers."This is going to make the negotiations more complicated," said Craig Allen, president of the US-China Business Council. "If this were only economic negotiations, it would be relatively easy to reach an agreement. But inevitably, it's going to spill over into other areas, and I think the more national security is tied up in this, the more difficult it will be to reach an agreement."The Justice Department's top national security official told lawmakers on Wednesday the administration is reacting to China's "steadily increasing" economic espionage activity, which costs the US an estimated $225 billion a year.From 2011 to 2018, more than 90% of the DOJ's cases alleging economic espionage by a state have involved China, and more than two-thirds of trade secret thefts have a nexus to China, Assistant Attorney General John Demers said."From underwater drones and autonomous vehicles to critical chemical compounds and inbred corn seeds, China has targeted advanced technology across sectors that align with China's publicly announced strategic goals," Demers said. "The play book is simple: rob, replicate and replace."'Rob, replicate and replace'"Rob American companies of information technology, replicate and replace that American company in the Chinese market and then the global market," Demers outlined.US prosecutions of the cases began in 2014 as the department prioritized the crimes."We've been able to bring a number of cases because the activity is tremendous and the grounds for those cases is very fertile," Demers said.Beijing's espionage focus is clear, Demers said, pointing to a 10-year strategic plan China published in 2015 that outlined 10 advanced technology industries for development."What they're telling us overtly is where they want to lead the world" in areas they believe will be the future of technology, Demers said. "What they deny ritually, openly, is that they're also using illegal means to advance their development goals.""No one begrudges a nation that develops the most innovative ideas ..." Demers said, "but we cannot tolerate a nation that steals the fruits of our brainpower."Priestap said that location is no protection against the reach of China's efforts to steal information. "A lack of participation in the Chinese market will not spare a company from the risks the Chinese government and its companies pose," the FBI official said. "While the risks may be more acute for companies with business in China, all companies, even those solely operating in the United States, are at risk."One way China has shifted its approach, Priestap said, is to move away from "spy vs. spy" operations. Instead, it is now "relying today on people from all walks of life to carry out their aims," Priestap said."They have a great ability to lean on people -- some who are witting, some who are not witting -- in their society to carry out their aims. Whether they be researchers, scientists, students, businessmen, otherwise tourists, the Chinese intelligence services don't hesitate to ask those people to carry out their aims," Priestap said.No demonizingThe FBI official said, "I'm not trying to demonize any people," but emphasized the reach of the Communist Party and its control of all aspects of Chinese life. Businesses that refuse to meet a party request that might contravene US laws "risk being shut down," Priestap said.China views members of its diaspora in the US including students and technology company executives as "being beholden to them," Priestap said. They will "utilize, lean on those students, say if you want your tuition paid ... then you better not come home empty-handed," he added."They think of them as just simply an extension of their power of their nation," Priestap said. The awareness level of knowledge Chinese nationals in the US have about the way they're being used by their government varies, he said."Based on FBI interaction with some of those individuals, it really is a case-by-case basis," he said. "Some are not knowledgeable in the least and are completely unwitting of doing anything in furtherance of their government's aims and others ... understand they have obligations to meet."Demers said the US is considering new steps for dealing with non-traditional espionage, both in and outside the US. One possibility, he said, is the creation of a body akin to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS. The interagency committee reviews transactions involving foreign investment in the US that involve sensitive technology and can veto sales."We also need to be looking at activity that's perfectly legal, but may pose a national security threat," Demers told the committee, saying it may require legislation and should include measures to counter theft of US intellectual property outside the US by non-Americans. That kind of activity is currently outside the scope of current US law, he said.Load-Date: December 13, 2018End of Document

CHINA CONFIRMS HOLDING TWO CANADIANS IN 'NATIONAL SECURITY' INVESTIGATIONStates News ServiceDecember 13, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 699 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:China on Thursday said it is now holding two Canadian nationals on suspicion of "harming national security," amid ongoing diplomatic tensions with Ottawa over the arrest of a top executive with the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei."Spavor, Michael Peter Todd was detained on Dec. 10, 2018 by the state security police bureau of Dandong city, Liaoning province, for the lawful investigation of activities suspected of harming national security," a news website affiliated with the Liaoning provincial government reported on Thursday.Meanwhile, ruling Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece the People's Daily repeated the exact content of the report via its Twitter account, citing local media reports.Spavor, a tourism consultant with contacts among high-ranking North Korean officials, has previously been photographed shaking hands and laughing with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.His detention came on the same day as that of Michael Kovrig, a former Canadian diplomat held by the Chinese authorities in the wake of the arrest of Huawei's chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou during transit in Vancouver, but was initially less widely reported.Kovrig, who works for the nongovernmental organization International Crisis Group (ICG), is also under investigation for "harming state security."Chinese law allows police to detain those suspected of vaguely worded "national security" crimes and hold them under residential surveillance at a secret location for up to six months, with no access to lawyers or family visits.Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang confirmed that China is holding two Canadian nationals under investigation by state security police in Beijing, where Kovrig was detained, and in the northeastern city of Dandong, where Spavor lived."The legal rights of the two Canadians are being safeguarded," Lu told a regular news briefing in Beijing on Thursday, adding that they are currently under "coercive measures."Canadian officials have been unable to contact Spavor "since he let us know he was being questioned by Chinese authorities," the Associated Press quoted Canadian Global Affairs spokesman Guillaume Berube as saying."We are working very hard to ascertain his whereabouts and we continue to raise this with the Chinese government," Berube said.As a diplomat on current leave of absence, Kovrig technically remains an employee of the Canadian foreign affairs department, but has no diplomatic immunity."The fact that Mr. Kovrig is an employee of my department means a lot of us know him and that adds another layer to the concern," Canadian foreign minister Chrystia Freeland said on Wednesday.But she added that there was "no direct link" between Meng's detention in Vancouver, where she faces possible extradition to the United States on alleged charges of bank fraud in relation to the sale of technology to Iran. 'Hostages' Benson Wong, a former politics professor at Hong Kong's Baptist University, said it was impossible to confirm at this stage whether there was a direct relationship between the detention of the two Canadians in China and Meng's arrest in Canada.But the timing of their detentions made it hard not to link the two cases, he said."The closeness in terms of timing means that one can't help feeling to a greater or lesser extent that the Chinese government wants to get itself some hostages, that they can use to threaten the Canadian government with in its handling of the Meng Wanzhou case," Wong said. "To ensure that they take China's views into account."But Guo Yiping, a current affairs commentator who has lived in the United States and Canada for more than 30 years, said the link is "obvious."Nonetheless, Guo said he expects Ottawa to fully support the U.S. extradition process."Any Canadian administration, regardless of which party is in power, has to go along with the U.S.," Guo said. "Their interestssecurity, defense and diplomaticare as close as lips and teeth.""We [in Canada] can't turn down requests like that from the U.S.," he said.

U.S. moves on China threaten trade talks before they heat upPolitico.comDecember 11, 2018 Tuesday 8:09 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 981 wordsByline: DPalmer@politico.com,  (Doug Palmer)BodyPresident Donald Trump tweeted Tuesday morning that trade war talks with China have been "very productive."But there's little evidence that the two countries are making progress on a 90-day timeline to work things out, and China-U.S. relations are becoming more volatile with each passing day. A top executive from Chinese telecom Huawei remains jailed in Canada, awaiting extradition to the United States, stirring outrage in China. The Justice Department is expected to soon charge Chinese government hackers with a broad campaign of cyberattacks against major technology companies. Meanhwhile, face-to-face talks, originally said to begin as soon as this week, have yet to materialize. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer spoke by phone this week with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, and reportedly China said it would begin lowering tariffs on U.S. auto imports. But so far there's been no sign of movement on other agreements that Trump said were part of the deal - such as increased Chinese purchases of U.S. commodities. China this week detained a former Canadian diplomat, in what many saw as a sign of Beijing's anger over the Canadian government's arrest of Huawei CFO  Meng Wanzhou, who stands accused by the U.S. of fraud connected to violations of sanctions on Iran.Sam Natapoff, a former Commerce Department official who now runs an international business advisory firm, said he believes Xi is serious about getting an agreement to prevent further damage to the Chinese economy. However, the Canadian government's arrest of Meng on suspicion of violating U.S. sanctions on Iran is putting enormous pressure on Xi and could change the dynamic of the trade negotiations, despite the two governments claiming the issues are separate. Not only is Huawei is a symbol of the new China because of its business success and technological prowess, but Meng is the daughter of the firm's founder in a country that puts enormous emphasis on family ties. "Had this been someone else, and not a family member, it would have been treated very differently," Natapoff said. According to the Wall Street Journal, Liu told Lighthizer and Mnuchin on Monday that China would be lowering its tariff on U.S. automobile imports to 15 percent, from 40 percent currently. Beijing had raised the tariff to the higher level as part of its broader retaliation on $110 billion of American exports. However, the paper also reported that Liu is now likely to visit the United States for face-to-face talks after the new year, instead of this week as had been expected earlier. That would get the two sides past the Christmas holidays and Chinese celebrations of the 40th anniversary of its reform movement, but leave only two months for the talks. In addition, the annual Chinese Spring Festival in early February could require a pause in the negotiations and add to the time crunch. "So, this is like the worst possible 90 days you could have," Charles Freeman, senior vice president for Asia at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said. "But I'm sure they're going to get something done. We're certainly going to be working to help them get something done." Meanwhile, farm groups were still waiting for news on commodity purchases that China is expected to make to help reduce the U.S. trade deficit with that country. In a statement after the Dec. 1 talks between Trump and Xi, White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders said China planned to buy a "very substantial" amount of agricultural, energy, industrial and other products. She also emphasized China intended to "immediately" begin buying U.S. farm products as part of the truce.But just how much that will be and which commodities could be part of China's purchase order is still unclear. Earlier this month, Mnuchin said China had offered to buy $1.2 trillion worth of goods, but it was not clear from his remarks how quickly that would take place. "There might be an overall dollar amount that they're looking for, but I'm not certain that there's [a certain] amount for this commodity, [a certain] amount for that," said Floyd Gaibler, director of trade policy and biotechnology at the U.S. Grains Council. So far, no Chinese purchases have shown up through the U.S. Agriculture Department's reporting system, which requires exporters to report large commodity sales on a daily basis to avoid surprising the market.U.S. soybean and other farmers have been hit particularly hard by China's retaliation, which has already prompted Trump to authorize billions of dollars in aid payments to soften the blow. China has also stopped purchases of liquified natural gas as a result of the trade war. While autos, soybeans and LNG could all figure prominently on China's shopping list, companies are still awaiting details of how that would work, said Erin Ennis, senior vice president at the U.S.-China Business Council. There appear to be three different possibilities: China will keep its retaliatory duties in place and require state-owned enterprises or private buyers to pay the higher price; it will temporarily waive the duties while negotiations continue; or it will permanently remove the retaliation in anticipation of final deal with the United States, Ennis said. Part of the difficulty with boosting agricultural sales to China is the country has a number of trade barriers that pre-date the trade war that Trump started this year over China's intellectual property practices. Unless those come down, sales of certain products like corn, sorghum and dry distillers grains will remain stunted, Gaibler said. "We'd rather just see the obstacles removed and let the market determine whether there's demand for it," Gaibler said. But "there's a lot of issues that you have to work your way through in order to ensure that you do have access," he said.Article originally published on POLITICO MagazineLoad-Date: December 12, 2018End of Document

DEMOCRATIC TAIWAN BATTLING DISINFORMATION FROM CHINA AHEAD OF ELECTIONSStates News ServiceNovember 6, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 963 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Authorities on the democratic island of Taiwan say they are battling an influx of disinformation from sources backed by the Chinese Communist Party, ahead of local elections later this month, and even the 2020 presidential election. A national security source said last week that China has mobilized some 300,000 cyber operatives to target the island's internet users ahead of the November 24 local elections, Taiwan media reported. Chinese operatives are spreading disinformation through social media, including Weibo, Facebook and YouTube, as well as targeting its mainstream print and broadcast media, reports said. The Nov. 24 local elections are being used as a testing ground for Beijing's plan to influence the 2020 presidential election in its favor, they said. Taiwan's national security director Peng Sheng-chu told lawmakers earlier this month that his agency is now monitoring comments on social media platforms including Facebook, and that one of the key topics monitored was President Tsai Ing-wen. The revelation has already prompted a storm of mockery from opposition Kuomintang (KMT) supporters, who have likened Tsai to "You Know Who" in the fantasy series Harry Potter. But Peng said security services aren't interested in monitoring individuals' identities or location. Meanwhile, President Tsai said via her Facebook page that the agency needs to make a response to the disinformation campaign. "Our national security agency ... needs to make a necessary response to the threat posed by disinformation from overseas sources, in a bid to interfere in our internal affairs and interfere with the effective functioning of our nation's democracy and rule of law," Tsai wrote. "In the face of this new era of pluralism, the national security agencies of democratic countries around the world are doing the same thing." She said Taiwan would do everything in its power to defend its democratic values. But she said the island's government isn't about to return to the authoritarian rule of the past. "There are all kinds of public messages every day on my Facebook page, including encouragement, criticism and free discussion of topics of public interest," the statement said. "All are welcome, regardless of whether they are our own nationals, internet users from around the world, or our friends on the other side of the Great Firewall," it said, in a reference to the complex system of blocks, filters and human censorship that limits what China's more than 700 million internet users can do or see online. "The people of Taiwan have worked hard to achieve these results of freedom and democracy ... and all of their basic rights are guaranteed by the constitution," Tsai wrote. "No-one has the right to interfere with public opinion on Facebook, and this will not be monitored ... my government doesn't violate the freedoms of its nationals." Campaign of disinformation Taiwan began a transition to democracy following the death of Chiang's son, President Chiang Ching-kuo, in January 1988, starting with direct elections to the legislature in the early 1990s and culminating in the first direct election of a president, Lee Teng-hui, in 1996. KMT lawmaker Tseng Ming-tsung had earlier warned that government monitoring of social media comments would have a chilling effect on free speech. "I feel that it is unreasonable for [the authorities] to use Facebook to investigate people," Tseng said. "This violates the basic rights of citizens." Lawmakers have also hit out at recent reports that the authorities have been meeting informally with internet service providers to ensure that they will hand over data if requested. But ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmaker Hsu Chih-chieh said the national security agency is targeting a campaign of disinformation. "The head of state shouldn't be immune to criticism, but you shouldn't create disinformation in order to criticize [her]," Hsu told reporters. "[For example], some people are saying that Taiwan wants to sell Taiping Island to the U.S., which is obvious disinformation." National security chief David Lee has also said Taiwan wants to cooperate with other countries in addressing cyberattacks and disinformation that attempts to "undermine and subvert" Taiwan's democracy. "Taiwan cannot address cybersecurity issues alone," Lee was quoted as saying in recent reports. "We are keen to work with like-minded countries to ensure that our democratic institutions are protected." Veteran Taiwan journalist Antonio Chiang recently said he believes that the Chinese government is trying to subvert Taiwan's democracy in any way it can. "The economic cooperation between Taiwan and mainland China is used by the Chinese government to undermine our democratic system," Chiang told reporters last month. "The [Communist Party's] United Front uses various means, particularly now social engineering tools such as social media," he said. Awaiting reunification The Chinese Communist Party has never ruled Taiwan, which has been administered officially by the 1911 Republic of China since the KMT fled to the island after losing a civil war with Mao Zedong's communists in 1949. But Beijing sees the island as part of "One China" awaiting "reunification" and has put pressure on its diplomatic partners to isolate Taipei on the international stage. Recent polls show that the majority of Taiwan's 23 million population identify as Taiwanese rather than Chinese, and that there is broad popular support for continued self-rule. But Beijing has threatened to invade, should the island seek formal nationhood. Reported by Chung Kuang-cheng for RFA's Cantonese Service, and by Wang Yun for the Mandarin Service.

US Indicts Chinese Intelligence Officers Over Plot To Steal Aerospace TechCE Noticias Financieras EnglishOctober 31, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 346 wordsBody       The US Department of Justice indicted Chinese intelligence officers and hackers with commercial espionage over a five-year scheme to steal airline engine technology from French and U.S. aerospace companies by hacking into their computers. The DOJ charged 10 people, including intelligence officers Zha Rong and Chai Meng. They and and other conspirators worked for a provincial foreign intelligence arm of the Chinese government. Between January 2010 and May 2015, the intelligence officers and their team of hackers focused on the theft of technology underlying a turbofan engine used in U.S. and European commercial airliners.   This engine was being developed through a partnership between a French aerospace manufacturer which has an office in China, and a US-based company. The Department of Justice did not name the firms. The hackers also conducted intrusions into aerospace companies based in Arizona, Massachusetts and Oregon that manufactured parts for the turbofan jet engine. At that time, a Chinese state-owned aerospace company was working to develop a comparable engine for use in commercial aircraft manufactured in China and elsewhere, the DOJ said in a press release. John C. Demers, Assistant Attorney General for National Security, said it is the third time since September that the National Security Division has brought charges against Chinese intelligence officers for stealing American intellectual property. John Brown, FBI Special Agent in Charge of the San Diego Field Office, said the investigation agency is sending a strong message to the Chinese government and other governments involved in hacking activities. "We are working together to vigorously investigate and hold hackers accountable regardless of their attempts to hide their illicit activities and identities " he added. DOJ noted that besides hacking, the Chinese also used company employees to conduct computer intrusions and steal commercial information.  The FBI, led by the San Diego Field Office, conducted the investigation in  cooperation with French authorities.        Load-Date: October 31, 2018End of Document

Facebook: Free speech and privacy will inform any decision to return to ChinaCNN WireNovember 14, 2018 Wednesday 10:25 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 563 wordsByline: By Sherisse Pham, CNN BusinessDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  Facebook says it won't return to China without considering how to square that with its commitments to free expression and the privacy of its users. That would present a significant challenge, given the Chinese government's current policies. The country's vast internet censorship apparatus regularly blocks discussions on topics Beijing deems sensitive, including the Tiananmen Square massacre, Tibet and criticism of President Xi Jinping. Facebook (FB), which has been banned in China since 2009, set out its approach to China in a written response to questions from US lawmakers. The company said it doesn't know how Beijing would apply laws and regulations on content to its social network if it were allowed back into the country.Its comments to the Senate Intelligence Committee come as US internet companies wrestle with how to do more business in China despite its heavy restrictions on freedom of expression. Many of them have been blocked in China for years, including Twitter (TWTR), Facebook-owned Instagram and Google's (GOOGL) search engine and email service. That hasn't stopped the companies from looking for more ways into the world's second largest economy, seeking access to China's lucrative market of 800 million internet users.Google recently ended up on the defensive after its work on a censored search engine that could be launched in China was revealed in August by The Intercept.Facebook, like Google, is a member of the Global Network Initiative, a digital alliance that follows the United Nations' principles on business and human rights. Members' compliance with the group's goals is assessed every two years. "In keeping with these commitments, rigorous human rights due diligence and careful consideration of free expression and privacy implications would constitute important components of any decision on entering China," Facebook said. "No decisions have been made around the conditions under which any possible future service might be offered in China," the company added in its written response, which is dated October 26 and is now available on the Senate committee's website. Facebook's latest comments on China were first reported by Bloomberg. Rights activists unimpressedHuman rights activists are critical of Facebook and other internet companies' eagerness to do business in China. Human Rights Watch's China director, Sophie Richardson, slammed Facebook's assertion that it doesn't know how the Chinese government would try to limit its operations if it were ever allowed back into the country. "This is at best a profoundly disingenuous claim --- the problems with censorship and surveillance are well known, as are the requirements for foreign firms to hand over all sorts of data and user information in an environment with no privacy rights," she said. Facebook announced earlier this year that it plans to open an innovation hub in China. Its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has also made several efforts to build a relationship with the Chinese government through frequent visits and meetings with Chinese leaders, including President Xi Jinping. And last year, Facebook dipped its toe into the Chinese market by quietly launching a photo and video sharing app called Colorful Balloons, without attaching the Facebook name to it.TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Chinese party agents watch over Uighur funerals, weddingsAssociated Press InternationalNovember 30, 2018 Friday 5:00 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWS; Only on APLength: 824 wordsByline: By DAKE KANG and YANAN WANG, Associated PressDateline: ISTANBUL BodyISTANBUL (AP) - The two women in the photograph were smiling, but Halmurat Idris knew something was terribly wrong.One was his 39-year-old sister; standing at her side was an elderly woman Idris did not know. Their grins were tight-lipped, mirthless. Her sister had posted the picture on a social media account along with a caption punctuated by a smiley-face."Look, I have a Han Chinese mother now!" his sister wrote.Idris knew instantly: The old woman was a spy, sent by the Chinese government to infiltrate his family.There are many like her. According to the ruling Communist Party's official newspaper, as of the end of September, 1.1 million local government workers have been deployed to ethnic minorities' living rooms, dining areas and Muslim prayer spaces, not to mention at weddings, funerals and other occasions once considered intimate and private.All this is taking place in China's far west region of Xinjiang, home to the predominantly Muslim, Turkic-speaking Uighurs, who have long reported discrimination at the hands of the country's majority Han Chinese.While government notices about the "Pair Up and Become Family" program portray it as an affectionate cultural exchange, Uighurs living in exile in Turkey said their loved ones saw the campaign as a chilling intrusion into the only place that they once felt safe.They believe the program is aimed at coercing Uighurs into living secular lives like the Han majority. Anything diverging from the party's prescribed lifestyle can be viewed by authorities as a sign of potential extremism.Under Chinese President Xi Jinping, the Uighur homeland has been blanketed with stifling surveillance, from armed checkpoints on street corners to facial-recognition-equipped CCTV cameras steadily surveying passers-by. Now, Uighurs say, they must live under the watchful eye of the ruling Communist Party even inside their own homes."The government is trying to destroy that last protected space in which Uighurs have been able to maintain their identity," said Joanne Smith Finley, an ethnographer at England's Newcastle University.The Associated Press spoke to five Uighurs living in Istanbul who shared the experiences of their family members in Xinjiang who have had to host Han Chinese civil servants. These accounts are based on prior communications with their family members, the majority of whom have since cut off contact because Uighurs can be punished for speaking to people abroad.Uighurs abroad said their loved ones were constantly on edge in their own homes, knowing that any misstep - a misplaced Quran, a carelessly spoken word - could lead to detention or worse. In the presence of these faux relatives, their family members could not pray or wear religious garbs, and the cadres were privy to their every move.The thought of it - and the sight of his sister, the old woman and their false smiles - made Idris queasy."I wanted to throw up," said the 49-year-old petroleum engineer, shaking his head in disgust."The moment I saw the old woman, I thought, 'Ugh, this person is our enemy.' If your enemy became your mother, think about it - how would you feel?"Tensions between Muslim minorities and Han Chinese have bubbled over in recent years, resulting in violent attacks pegged to Uighur separatists and a fierce government crackdown on broadly defined "extremism" that has placed as many as 1 million Muslims in internment camps, according to estimates by experts and a human rights group.Uighurs say the omnipresent threat of being sent to one of these centers, which are described as political indoctrination camps by former detainees, looms large in their relatives' minds when they are forced to welcome party members into their homes.Last December, Xinjiang authorities organized a "Becoming Family Week" which placed more than 1 million cadres in minority households. Government reports on the program gushed about the warm "family reunions," as public servants and Uighurs shared meals and even beds.Becoming Family Week turned out to be a test run for a standardized homestay program. The Xinjiang United Front Work Department said in February that government workers should live with their assigned families every two months, for five days at a time.Not all "Become Family" pairings involve Han Chinese visitors. A Uighur cadre named Gu Li said she regularly pays visits to a Uighur household, staying three to five days at a time."We've already started calling each other family," she said in a telephone interview from Xinjiang. "China's 56 ethnic groups are all one family."Gu said civil servants of many ethnicities - Uighur, Han and Kazakh - participate in the program.All government employees in the region are required to conduct such visits in order to better understand villagers' needs, according to Gu: "Because we're always sitting in our offices, we don't know what they really need. Only through penetrating the masses can we truly serve them."Load-Date: December 1, 2018End of Document

Hoover event examines Chinese development, demographic shiftsThe Stanford Daily: Stanford UniversityOctober 30, 2018 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 701 wordsBodyOn Monday, the Hoover Institution held a panel discussion on China's upcoming governance challenges in light of national demographic, technological and societal shifts.

Chinese scientist claims world's first gene-edited babies, amid denial from hospital and international outcryCNN.comNovember 26, 2018 Monday 12:56 PM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: HEALTHLength: 1048 wordsByline: By Oscar Holland and Serenitie Wang, CNNDateline: Hong Kong BodyThe Chinese government has ordered an "immediate investigation" into the alleged delivery of the world's first genetically edited babies, as experts worldwide voiced outrage at such use of the technology.The pushback comes amid claims made online by Chinese scientist He Jiankui that twin girls had been born with DNA altered to make them resistant to HIV, a groundbreaking move that is likely to spark significant ethical questions around gene editing and so-called designer babies.He, a professor at Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, claims that his lab had been editing embryos' genetic codes for seven couples undergoing in-vitro fertilization.In a video posted to YouTube on Monday, the Chinese researcher said that one of the pregnancies had been successful and that ostensibly healthy twin girls Lulu and Nana had been born "a few weeks ago."He claims that he used a tool known as CRISPR-cas9, which can insert or deactivate certain genes. In his YouTube video, He describes the procedure as having "removed the doorway through which HIV enters."He's claims have neither been independently verified nor peer-reviewed. Editing the genes of embryos intended for pregnancy is banned in many counties, including the United States. In the UK, editing of embryos may be permitted for research purposes with strict regulatory approval. It is unknown whether the procedure is safe or, if used in pregnancy, whether it can have unintended consequences for the babies later in life or for future generations.China has invested heavily in gene-editing technology, with the government bankrolling research into a number of world "firsts," including the first use of the gene-editing tool CRISPR-Cas9 in humans in 2016 and the first reported use of gene editing technology to modify nonviable human embryos in 2015.More recently researchers in China claimed to have bred healthy mice from same-sex parents, using gene editing technology.But in a statement posted Tuesday morning, China's National Health Commission said that it had "immediately requested the Guangdong Provincial Health Commission to seriously investigate and verify" the claims made by He Jiankui.The statement follows moves by the Chinese hospital named in He's ethical approval documents, Shenzhen Harmonicare Women's and Children's Hospital, to distance itself from involvement in the procedures."We can ensure that the research wasn't conducted in our hospital nor were the babies born here," a hospital representative told CNN. The hospital confirmed that two of the doctors named in He's documents work at the hospital and suggested that an internal investigation was underway.An initial investigation by the hospital said that signatures on He's ethics review form are suspected to be forged. The hospital has never convened an ethics committee meeting on it, according to a statement on its WeChat account, and the facility will ask police to intervene and investigate it and hold related people accountable by law.The Shenzhen Health and Family Planning Commission denounced the legitimacy of the hospital ethics committee and the review process that approved the application. It confirmed that an investigation was launched Monday to "verify the authenticity of the ethical review of the research reported by media."He's University, Southern University of Science and Technology, said in a statement that the researcher has been on leave since February 1."The research work was carried out outside the school by Associate Professor He Jiankui. He did not report to the school or the department of biology. The university and the biology department are not aware of it," the institution said, adding that "the Academic Committee of the Department of Biology believes that it seriously violates academic ethics and academic norms."A 'huge blow' to Chinese researchA joint statement issued by more than 120 Chinese scientists on the Chinese social media site Weibo condemns the human genome-editing research."The medical ethics review exists in the name only. Directly experimenting on human is nothing but crazy ... as soon as a living human is produced, no one could predict what kind of impact it will bring, as the modified inheritable substance will inevitably blend into human genome pool," they wrote, adding that the trial is a "huge blow" to the reputation of Chinese biomedical research. "It's extremely unfair to Chinese scientist who are diligent, innovative and defending the bottom line of scientific ethics."Julian Savulescu, director of the Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics at the University of Oxford, described the alleged births as "genetic Russian Roulette.""If true, this experiment is monstrous," he said. "The embryos were healthy. No known diseases. Gene editing itself is experimental and is still associated with off-target mutations, capable of causing genetic problems early and later in life, including the development of cancer."There are many effective ways to prevent HIV in healthy individuals: For example, protected sex. And there are effective treatments if one does contract it," Savulescu said.Joyce Harper, a professor in genetics and human embryology at the Institute for Women's Health at University College London, described the alleged research "premature, dangerous and irresponsible," calling for public debate and legislation."Before this procedure comes anywhere near clinical practice, we need years of work to show that meddling with the genome of the embryo is not going to cause harm to the future person," she said in a statement.Despite ethical concerns in the West, a recent study suggested that the Chinese public is broadly in favor of using gene-editing for medical purposes. An online survey conducted by Sun Yat-Sen University in Guangzhou found that more than two-thirds of the 4,771 people surveyed (575 of whom reportedly have HIV), supported its use in treating diseases, according to the state-run tabloid Global Times."(Chinese people) have a high willingness to use of gene in disease prevention and treatment," Liang Chen, a professor at Sun Yat-Sen University was quoted as saying. "This suggests that the research of gene editing in China not only has a promising potential, but also is responding to the public's needs."Load-Date: November 28, 2018End of Document

China begins to evaluate behavior of its citizens through camerasCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 3, 2018 SaturdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 710 wordsBody        Under the constant gaze of thousands of street cameras, Chinese citizens are beginning to be evaluated according to their behavior through a controversial "social credit system" in which the score is key when it comes to obtaining a loan or being able to travel.  In dropper, the authorities are revealing the rules of this system of citizen scrutiny that some Chinese cities and companies have already begun to apply as an experiment and that resembles a lot some disturbing science fiction realities.  For example, Beijing has just announced that it will put a bad grade through this method to those who smoke in places where it is not allowed, without specifying what the punishment will be.  Another city in the east, Qingdao, already values ??its residents through this system in which points are lost if you disrespect sweepers, throw garbage in inappropriate places or damage urban trees.  This card by points of good citizen is within the legislative plans of the Chinese Government, which foresees that comes into force in less than three years, but which has not provided details. Read also: Smart cameras and a ranking of citizens: the surveillance system in China Perhaps due to this lack of knowledge, Chinese citizens have not yet shown concern about the arrival of this peculiar system and, for now, it seems to be going unnoticed both on the street and in social networks.  "As far as I know, no one is scoring me, maybe only people who do something wrong know and penalize them," says a young Chinese woman who resides in Beijing and confesses she does not know much about the system, except for the little published by the state press.  However, there are already companies that apply this system, such as Ant Financial, part of the Alibaba group and owner of Alipay, which rates its customers according to their consumption habits or if they pay their bills on time.  Also Ziroom, one of the real estate companies with the most presence in Beijing, has its own rating method and gives points to its tenants according to their behavior so that they can obtain discounts.  Although some Chinese welcome these "rewards" for being good citizens, Amnesty International researcher for China, Patrick Poon, warns that this system is nothing more than a "practice of large-scale social control that legitimizes the hierarchical classification of the citizen".  "Only social tension will increase, it is definitely not good to move towards equality", assures Efe.  The authorities defend this system by ensuring that they want to promote the "culture of honesty" in all areas (labor, education, public places, etc.) to achieve a "harmonious" society.  Chinese experts who are voiced by state media also support this initiative because, they criticize, the low cost of being "dishonest" encourages bad behavior.  An example, they say, is the recent case -which became a viral video- in which a passenger of a high-speed train took the seat of another person and refused to stand up due to the indignation of other passengers, an incident the one who "only" was punished with not being able to travel for a period of time.  The Chinese government has already created a digital platform in which it offers advanced data collection technology to encourage companies and institutions to participate in this system.  Although it may seem difficult to implement in the most populated country in the world, the fact is that one already feels observed in China, where you only need to look up to walk down the street to see that several cameras, many of them with recognition facial- they are recording you.  It is impossible not to find similarities between the reality that exists in China and theomnipresent and vigilant "Big Brother" by George Orwell in "1984" or science fiction that portrays on the small screen "Black Mirror".  In one of the chapters of the popular series, its protagonist lives obsessed with achieving five stars in a social scoring system to buy a luxury apartment.  But his life is complicated after spilling some coffee to a passerby and entering a spiral of negative ratings that lead to social disgrace. "Reality or fiction?" Many people ask themselves in China today.  China approves law to strengthen Internet surveillance Load-Date: November 3, 2018End of Document

US charges China-controlled company in trade secrets theftAssociated Press State & LocalNovember 2, 2018 Friday 1:30 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 861 wordsByline: By ERIC TUCKER, Associated PressDateline: LOS ANGELES BodyLOS ANGELES (AP) - The United States has charged a government-controlled company in China with stealing trade secrets from an American semiconductor company, the Justice Department said Thursday as it outlined an initiative focused on what officials said was the growing threat of Chinese economic espionage.The prosecution comes amid heightened trade tensions between China and the U.S. and as the Trump administration raises alarms that Beijing remains intent on stealing technology and inventions to gain an economic upper hand. The two nations have each imposed billions of dollars in tariffs on each other in a reflection of a confrontational relationship with national security as well as economic ramifications.The case, which involves trade secrets worth up to $8.75 billion and allegedly stolen from Idaho-based Micron Technology Inc., is the latest in a series of prosecutions targeting Chinese corporate espionage. On Tuesday, for instance, federal prosecutors in California charged Chinese intelligence officers and hackers working for them with trying to steal information on commercial jet engines.Other cases have involved stolen wind turbine technology and software source code."China - like any advanced nation - must decide whether it wants to be a trusted partner on the world stage, or whether it wants to be known around the world as a dishonest regime running a corrupt economy founded on fraud, theft and strong-arm tactics," Attorney General Jeff Sessions said at a news conference announcing the criminal case and a new China Initiative.The charges name two companies, one in China and one in Taiwan, and three Taiwanese defendants. A Justice Department spokesman said the defendants were served summonses in Taiwan and that none is in U.S. custody.The Chinese Embassy did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment Thursday.One of the charged individuals had been general manager and chairman of a company that Micron acquired in 2013 and then went to work two years later for the Taiwan semiconductor company, United Microelectronics Corporation, or UMC, where prosecutors say he orchestrated the theft.That man, identified by prosecutors as Chen Zhengkun, recruited both of his co-defendants to join him at UMC. One, according to prosecutors, downloaded more than 900 confidential and proprietary Micron files before he left and stored them in personal cloud storage and on external hard drives so that he could access them at his new job with UMC.The company partnered with a Chinese-controlled business, Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co., to mass-produce technology memory storage products used in computer electronics.That technology, known as dynamic random-access memory, is something that the Chinese government had identified as an important priority because its own companies could not develop such advanced capabilities and had to rely on companies outside of China, the Justice Department saidThe indictment was announced one day after the Trump administration imposed restrictions on technology exports to the Chinese company that was charged, citing national security concerns. Beijing has spent heavily to build up Jinhua and other chipmakers as part of efforts to transform China into a global leader in robotics, artificial intelligence and other technology industries.The United States also Thursday sued to block the transfer of trade secrets and to prevent the companies from exporting to the U.S. any products that they manufacturing by exploiting stolen information.In addition, the Justice Department announced an initiative to target Chinese economic espionage by identifying priority cases and ensuring there are enough resources available.The administration has characterized China, along with Russia, as a strategic competitor of the United States. The U.S. has taken an increasingly confrontational stance toward what it characterizes as China's "predatory" economic policies. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo set the tone in a June speech where he accused China of an "unprecedented level of larceny" of intellectual property.Tensions over trade in particular have exacerbated relations between the two world powers. President Donald Trump has imposed tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese products in an effort to narrow the U.S. trade deficit with China. China has retaliated with tariff increases on $110 billion of American products.The tensions have extended into security issues. China has criticized U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, which Beijing considers a renegade province, and the U.S. has renewed its criticism of China's island-building in the disputed South China Sea. In recent weeks, Trump has accused China of meddling in U.S. elections but hasn't presented substantive evidence of such interference.In a tweet Thursday, Trump said he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping and that they had talked about many topics, but mostly trade.He said U.S.-China discussions on trade are "moving along nicely" with a meeting being scheduled at the G-20 summit in Argentina, which begins late this month.___Associated Press writers Matthew Pennington and Deb Riechmann contributed to this story.Load-Date: November 2, 2018End of Document

Wife of China's detained Interpol chief says he might already be deadCNN WireOctober 19, 2018 Friday 8:55 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 448 wordsByline: By Ben Westcott, CNNDateline: (CNN) Body (CNN) --  The wife of former Interpol chief Meng Hongwei, who dramatically vanished into police custody after returning to China in September, told the BBC she isn't sure her husband is still alive.In an interview with the British broadcaster, Grace Meng said she has received threatening phone calls since the Chinese government announced her husband was in custody in early October."I think it is political persecution. I'm not sure he's alive. They are cruel. They are dirty ... They can do anything," she told the interviewer.Then-President of Interpol Meng Hongwei disappeared after he took a flight back to China in late September. His wife, Grace, said at the time that the last contact she received from him was a text message saying to wait for his call, followed minutes later by a knife emoji.She reported him missing to French authorities, who opened an investigation. Interpol sent an official inquiry to the Chinese government asking for the whereabouts of their missing president.On October 8, Beijing's Ministry of Public Security admitted they had detained Meng following his return to China, saying he was being investigated for corruption."(Meng) insisted on taking the wrong path and had only himself to blame (for his downfall)," the country's top law enforcement official, Zhao Kezhi, was quoted as saying in the statement.In a previous interview with CNN earlier in October, Meng said she still hadn't told her children that their father was in custody in China."No TV for them ... because they are already seven-years-old, maybe they can feel something has happened. (When) they see Mummy is crying, I told them Mummy has a cold," she said at the time.Speaking with in silhouette to protect her from being recognized, Grace told CNN she had spoken out to raise awareness of China's extrajudicial detentions. "I do these things ... for all of China's children. For all of China's wives," she said.No further information has been released by the Chinese government, and Meng has not been seen in public since he left France for China in September.Shortly after Beijing announced Meng's arrest, Interpol said it had received and accepted his resignation with "immediate effect."

Wife of China's detained Interpol chief says he might already be deadCNN.comOctober 19, 2018 Friday 4:55 AM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: ASIALength: 424 wordsByline: By Ben Westcott, CNNBodyThe wife of former Interpol chief Meng Hongwei, who dramatically vanished into police custody after returning to China in September, told the BBC she isn't sure her husband is still alive.In an interview with the British broadcaster, Grace Meng said she has received threatening phone calls since the Chinese government announced her husband was in custody in early October."I think it is political persecution. I'm not sure he's alive. They are cruel. They are dirty ... They can do anything," she told the interviewer.Then-President of Interpol Meng Hongwei disappeared after he took a flight back to China in late September. His wife, Grace, said at the time that the last contact she received from him was a text message saying to wait for his call, followed minutes later by a knife emoji.She reported him missing to French authorities, who opened an investigation. Interpol sent an official inquiry to the Chinese government asking for the whereabouts of their missing president.On October 8, Beijing's Ministry of Public Security admitted they had detained Meng following his return to China, saying he was being investigated for corruption."(Meng) insisted on taking the wrong path and had only himself to blame (for his downfall)," the country's top law enforcement official, Zhao Kezhi, was quoted as saying in the statement.In a previous interview with CNN earlier in October, Meng said she still hadn't told her children that their father was in custody in China."No TV for them ... because they are already seven-years-old, maybe they can feel something has happened. (When) they see Mummy is crying, I told them Mummy has a cold," she said at the time.Speaking with in silhouette to protect her from being recognized, Grace told CNN she had spoken out to raise awareness of China's extrajudicial detentions. "I do these things ... for all of China's children. For all of China's wives," she said.No further information has been released by the Chinese government, and Meng has not been seen in public since he left France for China in September.Shortly after Beijing announced Meng's arrest, Interpol said it had received and accepted his resignation with "immediate effect." It made no mention of the former president's whereabouts or the Chinese investigation.Meng was the first Chinese official to lead the international policing body and his appointment just two years ago in 2016 was greeted enthusiastically by the country's state media.As President, Meng oversaw the agency's executive committee, which sets overall strategy.Load-Date: October 20, 2018End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 26 of 320JUSTICE NEWS  Page 29 of 320Sens.
