A software developer just became the latest victim of China's VPN crackdownCNN WireOctober 10, 2018 Wednesday 7:16 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 509 wordsByline: By James Griffiths, CNNDateline: HONG KONG (CNN) BodyHONG KONG (CNN) --  A Chinese software developer has received a suspended prison sentence for selling software that allowed internet users to dodge the Chinese government's intensifying efforts to control their online activities. According to a court report published Tuesday, the man, surnamed Dai, was given a three-year suspended sentence and fined around $1,400 this week after being found guilty of operating a website offering virtual private network (VPN) services to hundreds of Chinese users between April 2016 and October 2017. This is the first time such a case has been brought in Shanghai, the court said. Such prosecutions are rare nationwide, but have stepped up in the wake of a crackdown on VPN use launched last year. In September 2017, another developer in southern Guangdong province was sentenced to nine months in prison for the same crime. VPN services remain one of the most effective means of getting around the Great Firewall, China's vast online censorship apparatus. In the West, VPNs are mainly used for connecting to company intranets, strengthening online privacy and getting around regional blocks on services such as Netflix or the BBC iPlayer. But they can also skirt the Great Firewall because they mask internet traffic, which prevents the censorship apparatus from analyzing the traffic and blocking access to banned websites. China launched a crackdown on unauthorized VPN services in 2017, and their use was officially banned at the end of March this year. Many popular VPN companies based overseas said users in China have been able to continue using their tools. Their primary market, though, is foreigners living in the country, who are less likely to face repercussions for using banned services and have the foreign credit cards needed to pay for them. Chinese authorities have been gradually stamping out VPN services run from inside the country since the March ban kicked in. VPN apps have also been removed from popular online marketplaces, including Apple's iTunes store. While a complete VPN block is possible -- and has been implemented during certain sensitive periods -- the government usually avoids this as it would cause significant disruption to businesses and diplomatic missions, which rely on VPNs for secure communications. According to the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, VPN services are permitted in China, but must not be "established or leased without the approval of the telecommunications authorities." By encouraging companies to switch to using approved VPN services -- which will continue to block websites deemed off limits by the Great Firewall -- Chinese censors may be preparing for a time when they can block all other providers. The means by which they could do this are unclear, and big companies and diplomatic missions may be particularly uncomfortable using Chinese-government-approved VPNs for security reasons. CNN's Serenitie Wang contributed reporting from Beijing. TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

China's economy had a tough 2018. Next year will be worseCNN WireDecember 30, 2018 Sunday 12:47 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1263 wordsByline: By Daniel Shane, Jethro Mullen and David Goldman, CNN BusinessDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  1. China's rocky year: China's economy is entering uncharted territory, and that could spell trouble for the rest of the world. After decades of sharp expansion, the Chinese economy is slowing down. Growth in 2018 is set to be the weakest since 1990. And 2019 looks even worse.The world's second largest economy is feeling the effects of a darkening trade outlook and government attempts to rein in risky lending after a rapid rise in debt levels. "The drivers of China's slowdown have yet to have their full impact on the economy, and the combination of both is unprecedented," analysts at Moody's wrote in a research note this month. "This creates a high degree of uncertainty and risk." What happens in China matters for businesses and markets across the globe. It's the world's largest exporter of goods, sucking in materials from other countries in order to ship out iPhones, laptops, bulldozers and tons of other products. The country's rapidly expanding middle-class has turned it into the biggest market on the planet for consumer goods like cars, smartphones and beer, generating billions in profits for companies like General Motors (GM) and Apple (AAPL)."China has become the world's largest growth engine," said Rajiv Biswas, chief Asia-Pacific economist at research firm IHS Markit. Fears about China's economic health have already rippled through financial markets. The country's benchmark stock index plunged into a bear market in June and is down 25% since the start of the year. The jitters have also affected markets in Europe and the United States.What remains uncertain is the severity of the slowdown and how far the Chinese government will go in trying to soften its impact.The big wild card is how the trade war between the United States and China, which began this year, will play out in 2019.After imposing heavy new tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of goods, the two sides are now trying to negotiate a deal by the end of February. If they fail, tariffs are set to rise further.Meanwhile, the economic hit from the trade war is expected to become more pronounced in China in the coming months, hurting exports and companies' profits."Export growth will come under pressure even if a further escalation in tariffs is avoided," Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at research firm Capital Economics, wrote in a note to clients this month.Opinion is divided on whether the two governments will reach a lasting agreement in the next two months. Their expanding conflict is about far more than just trade. It spans China's stance on technology, intellectual property, investment, industrial policy and access to its markets.Besides imposing tariffs, the US government has this year prevented two major Chinese tech firms from buying important American-made parts, stepped up scrutiny of foreign investments and sought the extradition of a top executive at Huawei, the Chinese company expected to lead the roll-out of 5G technology around the world."The path to an eventual truce between the two economic superpowers is likely to be bumpy and prolonged," analysts at investment firm Vanguard said in a report this month.Along the way, they could do plenty more economic damage to one another."The trade war has the potential to hit growth significantly," said Gerard Burg, China economist at National Australia Bank. "But it all depends on how far both sides are willing to push." The renewed negotiations show China's need "to achieve some sort of deal with the United States to buy badly-needed breathing space in a toughening economic climate," Diana Choyleva, chief economist at research firm Enodo Economics, wrote in a note to clients this month.A crucial question for China is how its consumers respond to the uncertainty.The country's extraordinary economic transformation in recent decades has pulled hundreds of millions of people out of poverty fueled a spending boom."Household consumption is what has driven the structural growth story in China," said Edmund Goh, a portfolio manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Shanghai. "It has defied a lot of the slowdown" But cracks are starting to show. Car sales have tanked in recent months, dealing a blow to global automakers like Volkswagen (VLKAF) and Ford (F). And retail spending in general has been slowing, according to official data.Debt levels among Chinese consumers have been rising quickly, which could add to their reluctance to spend, Goh said. China is likely to meet the difficulties facing the economy with its trademark approach: juicing activity through government stimulus. It has already resorted to tax cuts, investments in infrastructure and looser monetary policy this year. Analysts expect more measures in 2019.Officials could loosen restrictions on the country's red-hot real estate market to encourage developers to ramp up building activity, economists suggest. But more stimulus measures risk undermining Beijing's efforts to address the deeper problems in the economy, including curbing the huge amounts of debt in the financial system, according to Iris Pang, China economist at investment bank ING. "The government has shelved reform," she said, and will instead "focus on pro-growth measures." 2. Jobs report: The US Labor Department will release its December jobs report on Friday. Economists expect the report to show that the American economy added 178,000 jobs, according to a survey conducted by Refinitiv. The unemployment rate is forecast to remain at 3.7% --- a near-50-year low. And paychecks are expected to grow by 3%.The American labor market is strong. Employers list more job openings than there are people to fill them. But economists predict economic growth will slow in 2019 as the effects of tax cuts and government spending wear off. The economy added 155,000 jobs in November.3. One trading day left in December: The stock market is on track for the worst December since 1931. Stocks have one more day left to make up some lost ground.Stocks often finish December with rallies, but this isn't a typical December. Huge swings in both directions have sent investors' heads spinning. The Dow had its worst-ever Christmas Eve on Monday, only to post its best-ever point gain when trading resumed on Wednesday. Stocks were sharply lower for most of Thursday before roaring back at the close to finish the day in positive territory.4. Missing data in the shutdown: The partial government shutdown means businesses and investors could miss some important economic data reports.The Department of Labor is funded through September 2019, so the monthly jobs report scheduled for Friday will remain on time. But both the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Census Bureau, which belong to the Department of Commerce, have ceased providing updates and can only resume after Congress and the White House agree on a deal. The same is true of the Department of Agriculture, which produces data on crop production, prices and sales.No major reports are due next week, but international trade figures for November are scheduled to be released on January 8. The Census Bureau had been planning to report on public pensions for the third quarter and residential home sales, as well as more international trade data.5.

Fast facts about the arrest of a Chinese tech executiveAssociated Press Financial WireDecember 10, 2018 Monday 5:37 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 371 wordsDateline: VANCOUVER, British Columbia BodyVANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) - WHAT'S HAPPENINGA top executive with Chinese electronics giant Huawei faces a bail hearing. The U.S. wants Canada to extradite Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies. She was detained Dec. 1 while changing planes in Vancouver. U.S. authorities allege Huawei used a Hong Kong shell company to evade U.S. trade curbs on Iran. China is pressuring both the U.S. and Canada over her arrest. Their ambassadors in Beijing were summoned by the Chinese government over the weekend, and an editorial in China's Communist Party newspaper called her treatment "inhumane."WHY HUAWEI?Huawei is the biggest global supplier of network gear for phone and internet companies. It has become the target of U.S. security concerns because of its ties to the Chinese government. The U.S. has pressured other countries to limit use of its technology, warning they could be opening themselves up to surveillance and theft of information. The U.S. sees Huawei and smaller Chinese tech suppliers as possible fronts for spying and as commercial competitors.WHAT'S NEXTThe hearing on whether to release Meng on bail started Friday and will resume Monday. Canadian prosecutor John Gibb-Carsley asked the court to reject Meng's bail request and Justice William Ehrcke said he would think about proposed bail conditions over the weekend. China's vice foreign minister demanded that Meng's arrest warrant be vacated and warned both Canada and the U.S. that Beijing will take steps based on their responses. Officials did not specify what those steps might be, but British Columbia has already canceled a trade mission to China amid fears China could detain Canadians in retaliation. Retaliation against U.S. or Canadian businesses in China is also possible. Huawei said in a statement that "We have every confidence that the Canadian and U.S. legal systems will reach the right conclusion."THE BACKDROPThe arrest took place as China and the U.S., the world's two largest economies, try to resolve escalating trade tensions. President Donald Trump has agreed to postpone U.S. tariff increases for 90 days while the two sides negotiate. China and the U.S. say Meng's arrest will not affect trade talks.Load-Date: December 11, 2018End of Document

It completely transformed into Mo's from the Simpson's.All those stories coming up this Thursday morning and joining me to break it all down Fox Business Network Dagen McDowell, the Wall Street Journal assistant editorial page editor James Freeman, and FOX NEWS contributor Liz Peek.Great to see you. That is just an idea of how connected we are. I know you were going to do that. I looked at you and have you a beat because I was expecting it.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK: We're connected on so many levels. We like talking about statistics and data, earnings and inflation and wage growth and -BARTIROMO: And Bart.JAMES FREEMAN, WALL STREET JOURNAL EDITOR: So you're both vegetarians so that's why it was nice having the sausage plate right here with (inaudible). I didn't have to compete at all.LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I miss the bacon and they took it away. I'm really crushed.BARTIROMO: I go back and fourth. I'm sometimes a vegetarian and sometimes not. I go back and fourth.FREEMAN: Ok, good. That makes me feel better about (ph).MCDOWELL: You'll be shaming me, meantime.BARTIROMO: Lots going on this morning. We've already had some top news. This caravan, this market, really front and center in terms of earnings, what's the problem? Earnings have been going well, Dagen.MCDOWELL: Well revenue came in below expectations. I think it was -BARTIROMO: What'd you say 43 percent of companies?MCDOWELL: Now it's like 41 percent as of the close of October. 41 percent of companies reporting had come up short of revenue expectations and again, when you have an over valued stock, that evaluation changes if interest rates start going up. It's just the way that you do the discounted cash flow model.And some of companies, you look at Apple barely took a hit in the month of October. Reports - results after the close today, but Amazon stock falls 20 percent of its value. It was in a full bear market in October.PEEK: Because of their guidance. The amazing thing is earnings. I think earnings numbers had been beating estimates for 70 plus percent of the stocks the companies have been reporting but its all about the guidance. The fact that people are concerned about tariffs going forward, they're concerned about rising interest rats, rising costs.That's why I was so interested that the CEO of DINE was talking about cost maybe coming down next year. That's the first time I've heard anybody say that tariffs might actually have that kind of benefit to some of the companies here in the United States.BARTIROMO: And this is the worry that everybody is so uneasy about. Whether or not we're going to see inflation, whether or not we're going to see these tariffs impact earnings. He said these costs are going to come down. Steve Joyce just joining us.PEEK: Yes, very interesting I thought, anyway.FREEMAN: Yes. That is the big cloud on the horizon and I think it's a message for the President to try and resolve these trade disputes because that this is the big concern. You look at an otherwise really outstanding economy. I think sometimes people think his salesmanship is a little over the top when he's talking about how everything's hot and great, but it really is.We are the world's strongest economy and that is in larger part thanks to his policies.PEEK: And part of this taking the uncertainty away by rolling back regulations you don't (ph) have this threat as you did during the Obama years that some new rule is going to come in and sideswipe you .FREEMAN: Yes.PEEK: . but at the same time, if you're creating uncertainties with your trade issues, you know, that's kind of an offset which I think they don't want.MCDOWELL: You want to ease and ultimately, if this administration wants to ease some of these inflation pressures, they'll get rid of the steel and aluminum tariffs.PEEK: Absolutely.MCDOWELL: Steve Moore was talking about it yesterday. That's the one policy from the White House that he doesn't agree with, that U.S. manufacturers are paying 38 percent more for steel than a year ago. Ultimately, that hurts businesses. We've heard that from some of the automakers and smaller manufacturers and they will pass those costs on to consumers. They could get rid of that tomorrow.BARTIROMO: But don't forget, these policies that we're talking about could actually get stopped in five days or, you know, the beginning of it if we see a change in leadership on the midterm elections which is why we're talking so much about the midterms now five days away. So we'll see if the Democrats take control of the House and start creating all of these new investigations into the president's personal life as well as trying to stop his agenda as far as rolling back regulations. I don't think Maxine Waters being the Chairman of the Financial Services Committee is going to want rollback in regulations.FREEMAN: And not a single Democrat voted for the tax cuts.BARTIROMO: There's that as well.FREEMAN: That -- that's back on the agenda, that debate about whether we want to be competitive in the world or not is back on if there's a change in House control.MCDOWELL: I've said this all along. Those Democrats in D.C. think they make better decisions with your money than you do. That's the message.PEEK: Oh for sure.BARTIROMO: That's exactly right.PEEK: Speaking of competiveness though, it seems to me that the American companies are doing just what they've always done. On steel, for example, why aren't the American steel companies keeping their prices even rather than raising them to match the ones that are being -- match imports affected by those tariffs? I remember back in the day, every time we've had a protectionist move like this, American companies, instead of trying to gain market share which is the point of this, they raise their prices.MCDOWELL: Well they take advantage of it.PEEK: They do which I think -- you know I think they should be challenged on that a little bit.MCDOWELL: Yes.BARTIROMO: We've got all this coming up this morning and joining the conversation to weigh in, former Microsoft CEO and L.A. Clippers Chairman, Steve Bomber is with me this morning; he's in the studio. Plus former Senior Advisor for President George W. Bush, Karl Rove navigates five days away from the midterms with us. And then National Security Advisor under President George W. Bush, Steven Hadley is with us, along with former German Defense and Economics Minister, K.T. zu Guttenberg to talk about Angela Merkel's plans as well. Don't miss a moment of it. We've got a big two hours coming up when we kick off with this hour with this.Our top story is technology in focus, those fang stocks seeing healthy gains yesterday as you can see after a tough showing the last couple weeks, that's for sure. It's nowhere near enough to erase the losses from October. Amazon was the worst performer for the month, down 20 percent - better than 20 percent in the month of October. Apple is going to be reporting earnings after the close, just days after the company unveiled new gadgets on Tuesday in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Joining us right now is CFRA Research Senior Equity Analyst, Angelo Zino. Angelo, good to see you this morning.ANGELO ZINO, CFRA RESEARCH SENIOR EQUITY ANALYST: Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. What do you expect from Apple, first off?ZINO: Overall, we expect to see very good results but we're really looking at three things here that really is going to dictate the quarter. I'd say first, of course, is going to be average selling prices in the near term. That's really what's going to make or break the quarter as well as the guidance. We think the street continues to be too conservative as far as the average selling price numbers are concerned especially for that all- important December quarter.BARTIROMO: So average selling prices go up?ZINO: Average selling prices continue to go up. If we look at the most recently-completed fiscal year, you're looking at about $755 in average selling prices. We think at the end of the day, Fiscal 2019 is going to be north of $800.BARTIROMO: Oh, wow. OK, so that's first. Got it.ZINO: That's first. Number two, we think services business, of course the ongoing shift, the secular shift towards more service-oriented offerings, you know we think continues. We're looking at a growth of about 25 percent for the quarter. But again, comps start getting a little bit more difficult here but we love what Apple is doing there. The most recent products unveiled on Apple's side of things with regards to the phones, A.R. capabilities, we think will continue to drive that ecosystem here over the next fiscal year.And then third, and maybe most important to investors out there is China. We do think China is going to once again be good here largely because of the average selling price gravitation higher. With that being said, we do think commentary surrounding China will be good. We think that iPhone XR that just was released is going to do very well given the capabilities it has and the moves towards those larger screens.BARTIROMO: Contrast that what Dan Niles said to me last week. He is the fund manager from Alpha One Capital Partners; he founded this firm. In San Francisco I sat down with him and I asked him about Apple. Here's what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Are we looking at fundamentals deteriorating within technology?DAN NILES, ALPHA ONE CAPITAL PARTNERS: I think you absolutely are and this exacerbated by the fact that you have a lot of inventory out there. So if you pick the biggest company in the world, Apple for example, they have 89 percent inventory growth year over year in the June quarter that they reported.The revenues were up 17 percent. Well, what is the iPhone doesn't sell well? They're going to have to burn (ph) that inventory off when we get into the March quarter.BARTIROMO: It's a really point that you make that Apple has all this inventory because if you've got all this inventory and then they've got these economies that worsening, who's going to be $1,000 for an iPhone X?NILES: Well, exactly. I mean you look at last year; they had one phone priced above $1,000. This holiday season they have three phones priced above that and the average selling price they're trying to boost it by another $100.The problem is, if you look at smart phone units overall, this will be the first year in history that smart phone units are down year over year.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Sounds like you're on the other side of that trade. You're comfortable with the iPhone being sold even though the economy of China has slowed down.ZINO: Yes. I mean we're actually on the side of buffet (ph) here when it comes to iPhones being more of consumer staple type device and we think consumers really look at this device more of a utility and more of a need, where as they're paying whether it be $30 or $40 a month for this device.We think consumers will continue to pay that higher price and they are putting more content in these devices which is the reason why they're paying more and consumers are willing to pay more.BARTIROMO: But historically they were adding features and improving it without raising the price. I mean is it a little concerning to you that's the avenue they're taking now to make their numbers basically?ZINO: What's interesting is the most recent quarter that we - the most recent year we saw with iPhone 10 is as we progressed through the fiscal year, we actually saw average selling prices actually increase in the June quarter relative to the March quarter and that's very uncommon in Apple's cycles.So we actually think that consumers are actually starting to get a good understanding of the capabilities of the iPhone 10 and now soon that iPhone 10s and the Max. As consumers start to kind of realize the capabilities that we do think they will pay up for that.FREEMAN: Ok so you were talking about how investors want to hear good news about China and we've been talking about the economics. I'm wondering about the politics in terms of the government there making it less - being less helpful or more helpful to Apple making it easier or harder to do business there.Is that an issue? Or do the investors feel like Tim Cook can manage the politics of these trade disputes?ZINO: I think that's a great question. I think - well we kind of look at Apple here, I think Tim Cook has got an absolutely great relationship when it comes to the Chinese government here and I think they'll be able to manage kind of any type of issues very well.I think the fact that Apple, especially is exempt here with regards to the China tariffs, I think is another reason why you've seen the stock hold up really well here and why the estimates have continued to come up.But that being said, I think both China and the U.S. have a need to make sure that Apple succeeds because Apple is so important to both ecosystems and I think because of that we will continue to see Apple do very well and remain except.BARTIROMO: Sounds like you would buy the stock here.ZINO: We would absolutely buy the stock here. I mean when you look at the stock even on a valuation basis looking at less than 15 times earnings, I think that's what's really different here relative to a number of the fang (ph) stocks that are out there and when you look at those estimates continuing to gravitate higher, we don't think that's done here as we kind of go here into the quarter.BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Angelo, great stuff, thanks so much.ZINO: Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: Thanks for your analyst, Angelo Zino joining us there.Coming up, earning $300,000 a year with no experience, sounds like a good gig if you can get it. Why private equity titans (ph) are scrambling to hire young investment bankers, coming up.Then taking a page from the Simpsons, details on this Texas bar that transformed itself into Mo's Tavern for Halloween, back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The black box of a crashed Indonesian jet now found. Cheryl Casone on headlines now. Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Well Maria, divers have recovered the flight data recorder from the Lion Air plane on the sea floor off Jakarta's coast. They're searching for the voice recorder. The two-month-old Boeing jet plunged into the sea on Monday, just minutes after takeoff. It killed all 189 people on-board. This is Indonesia's worst airline disaster in more than two decades. Lion Air says the plane had a technical issue in its previous flight. The company is still insisting that that problem had been fixed on the plane.Well, a tenth child has died after a viral outbreak at a New Jersey rehabilitation center. Twenty-seven children and one adult have gotten sick from the adenovirus. It broke out back in September there. The disease is most harmful to those who already have weakened immune systems. It's a respiratory disease. Most of the children in that rehab center are disabled and they depend on ventilators to breathe. The center has stopped admitting new patients until the end of the outbreak, but again a tenth child has now died there.Well, Subaru and Toyota recalling more than 400,000 cars. The problem, a faulty engine part that could cause stalling. The recall it affects Subaru's very popular Forrester Sport utility vehicle and the Impreza compact as well as the BRZ sports car. Also included is the Subaru-made Toyota 86 sports car which sold back in the U.S. as the Scion FRS. All of these cars made back in 2012 and 2013 but some of their most popular models.And then there is this - competition heating up for talent among private equity firms and that's got some big salaries coming down the pike kids. The "Wall Street Journal" reports young investment bankers are getting offers that exceed, get this, $300,000. Recruiting used to take place during the summer once an applicant had at least a year of experience. Well, this scramble for preferred candidates has led banks to now lower, Maria, the requirements and start recruiting sooner, less experienced, recruiting sooner and here's some more money. Wow, times have changed.BARTIROMO: Yes, wow is right. Well what is the step, there are seven million open positions right now or seven million more positions than we actually have people to fill them?MCDOWELL: 7.1 million job openings and that's about 900,000 more jobs than there are people who are unemployed in the country.PEEK: The first time ever.MCDOWELL: Yes, the first time ever.FREEMAN: It's very hard to find a market where it's not -- where there's not a huge demand for workers. You're - obviously you're seeing it at the high end and you see it at the low end as well. It's a great economy to look for a job.BARTIROMO: Exactly. Coming up, a scare in the air, an American Airlines baggage handler falling asleep in the belly of a plane, admitting he had been drinking; the details coming up.Plus, a shift in Europe's leadership, what it means for President Trump as German Chancellor Angela Merkel announces she will not seek re-election. We're talking about it, with Z. T. Guttenberg. Back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A major change for one of America's top allies, German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced that she will finish her term in 2021 and then retire from politics. This coming as President Trump vows to crack down on immigration.That's controversial issue for Merkel of course. She faced back lash over her decision to let more than 1 million Middle Eastern refugees into Germany back in 2015.Joining us right now is Spitzberg Partners Chairman as well as former German Defense and Economic Mister under Angela Merkel, K.T. zu Guttenberg.K.T. Good to see you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us.K.T. ZU GUTTENBERG, SPITZBERG PARTNERS CHAIRMAN: Good morning, Maria, good to see you.BARTIROMO: So you know the Chancellor well, what do you make of her decision? How do this change Germany once she does in fact step down?GUTTENBERG: It has already changed Germany. The epicenter of stability in Europe as we knew it for the last few years has been thrown into some turbulence now and her decision is a split decision.One is to step down from party leadership, but at the same time remain in office as Chancellor and that's a step which was quite unexpected coming from her because she was the one always demanding keeping party leadership and chancellorship together.So I personally, Maria, don't expect her to stay all the way through to 2021. It would be a miracle to quote to quote (ph) survive such a constellation longer than let's say maybe a year or one and a half years from now.BARTIROMO: Now that makes sense because for her to announce it now and then stay until 2021 seems odd. Did things really turn on Merkel after - is it really an immigration issue, after she let in the 1 million people and then there was such a focus on immigration and we didn't know who it was, really has taken hold actually across the world, this concern.GUTTENBERG: It's a combination of a couple of things. Of course, the decision to let in the refugees, but more than that, the managing or mismanagement of the refugee issue afterwards damaged her. On the other hand, there is a normal development. If you are in power for 13 years, if you're a party leader for 18 years, that's ages. That's such a long time. So there is a fatigue amongst German public, there is a fatigue within the party. It was her last moment to take a decision now and offer the party a solution which still is being seen as being conducted by herself and not to be thrown out of office, so she handled it quite wisely. On the other hand, it will be hard to stick to any power.BARTIROMO: Do you think that there are other issues that will change in terms of how Merkel handled them versus what her successor will look at. For example, energy policy and the whole issue of importing gas from Russia versus developing natural gas supplies, is there any weakening of the green power as we go forward, do you think?GUTTENBERG: It very much depends who will succeed her. We have at the moment three people lined up, actually, a few more but the others are -- have really no - absolutely minor chances. The three heavy weights running for her succession right now, differ quite a bit from each other.So one of the three merits we think has good chances to step into that office is a committed Transatlanticist and he will definitely try to rebuild the ties, although she was a committed Transatlanticist as well. But to come from a different angle, he has a he very older liberal, very economy-driven background. So that could be helpful in dealing with Donald Trump on a few issues.On the energy policy regarding Russia, for instance and the north stream pipeline, Maria, don't expect significant changes here because we have contracts that have already been made. A lot of Germans say this is not an American thing to get involved here, don't mix it with other topics so I don't see much changes here. But certainly when it comes to green energy, other topics, we might see some alterations because the energy transition a few years ago actually did not turn out as a success story.BARTIROMO: K.T., it's great to get your insights on this. Thanks so much.GUTTENBERG: Thank you.BARTIROMO: K. T. zu Guttenberg joining us there. Coming up, former Microsoft CEO, L. A. Clippers Chairman, Steve Bomber will join me.

This is very good for me.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: We will tell you about the Texas bar that decided to dress up for Halloween as the bar from "The Simpsons".All those stories coming up this Thursday morning. But first, our top story this half an hour, five days and counting. The midterm elections in focus and the results could have major economic implications. Joining me right now is the former CEO of Microsoft Steve Ballmer, he is the co- founder of Ballmer Group and USAFacts chairman, Steve Ballmer. Great to see you, Steve.STEVE BALLMER, CO-FOUNDER OF BALLMER GROUP AND CHAIRMAN OF USAFACTS: Good to be here, Maria.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us this morning. So, you created USAFacts to help voters get informed. And it's basically the facts on economic issues of our time. Tell us what the big important issues are surrounding this midterm election.BALLMER: Yes, what we're trying to do is strictly look through numbers, immigration pops on our -- on our site, health care pops on our site, important, jobs of course, as well as income and wages. And there's very interesting numbers that help frame the issue. One of the things people miss is both sides have religion, I believe X, I believe Y, and the truth of the matter is, most things do reduce to numbers.How many undocumented immigrants are there in the country? What are we doing to stop that today? What's that going to look like in the future? Both sides can look at that issue differently but it's certainly a key one in the election today.BARTIROMO: And USAFacts really helps people get that data to fill in the holes or understand better the actual facts and the actual issues. So we let in a million immigrants or we let in a million foreigners to this country every year but there's still outrage when people look at these caravans of people trying to get in the front of the line and get here illegally. So, facts on immigration.BALLMER: OK. A few things.BARTIROMO: Yes.BALLMER: About half of our population growth comes now from immigration. If you put births and deaths of people who live here and then compare that to immigration. So, immigration is an important part of the growth in our population. That's number one.The undocumented immigrant population over the last 15 years has gone from about 10-1/2 million people to 12 million people but --BARTIROMO: Wow.BALLMER: The number of border guards has increased substantially from about 4,000 to 19,000 if I have it, you know, clear in my head. That the number of people we apprehend at the border, down from 1.7 million to 300,000. What's going on?More border guards, fewer apprehensions, some growth in the number of undocumented. How do people see that? How do they think about it? Some of the other immigration issues are about legal immigration.BARTIROMO: Yes.BALLMER: And you put that all together, we're in a time -- I was listening to your show earlier, 7 million open jobs, and we have at least 3 or 4 million people in the U.S. who are working on an undocumented basis. If all those people left the country, creates even more unfilled jobs.BARTIROMO: So, I think this is one of the reasons that technology executives in particular are very focused on immigration and they call up the president and say, look, we need -- we need people, we need engineers, we need skilled people to work with the jobs that we can offer. Is that right? Because technology CEOs are more interested in this subject than others, I think.BALLMER: Yes, that's true. I certainly was.BARTIROMO: When it comes to business executives.BALLMER: Yes, I certainly was. That was very important for the supply of talent into Microsoft. The thing that's interesting is the so-called high tech workforce that is coming into the country, that is tens of thousands. The number of people who are coming in legally is millions.So when you think about that issue, when I worked at Microsoft it was all no, no, no high skill immigration.BARTIROMO: Right.BALLMER: But the truth of the matter is that does need to be looked at in an integrated way. I love the idea that the smartest people in the world want to come live and work in this country.BARTIROMO: Right.BALLMER: But we have to look at this immigration issue in total.BARTIROMO: You make a lot of good points, Steve.Let me ask you about Microsoft, you were the CEO of Microsoft for a long time. The company announcing it will sell A.I. products to China. And I want to get your take on the opportunity in China and also the opportunity around artificial intelligence, A.I. I'm just back from San Francisco. I sat down with the founder -- co-found of Oracle, Larry Ellison about technology companies working with the government. Here's what he said about Google and China. Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LARRY ELLISON, CO-FOUNDER, ORACLE: I think U.S. tech companies who say we will not -- we will not support the U.S. military, you know, we will not -- we will not work on any technology that helps our military but yet goes into China and facilitates the Chinese government surveilling their people is pretty shocking. I think it's very important that U.S. technology companies support our country, our government. We are a democracy. If we don't like our leaders, we can throw them out. If you don't like the leaders in China, you can fill in the blank.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: What do you think about that, Steve?BALLMER: Well, I think it starts with the premise that I might not agree with. Most at least software intellectual property in China is stolen anyway. So the notion that a policy decision by a U.S. company is going to dramatically impact that is interesting.You know, most of Microsoft software when I left, just a few years ago now, was stolen. And you say OK, is it possible to steal the software without even selling it in China? The answer is yes, it is.So, I do think that there are some important principles in what Larry says. I don't deny that. And yet the specific issue is very hard to control.BARTIROMO: You make such an important point. And I think I heard a stat, you'll be able to correct me if this is wrong, that 90 percent of companies in China use the Microsoft operating system but like one percent pay.BALLMER: Certainly as I left a few years ago that was right.BARTIROMO: Is that -- is that the right stat? 90 percent of companies are using the Microsoft operating platform and only one percent are paying for it. How do we -- I mean, what are we going to do that China keeps stealing everything this way? I mean, that's pretty extraordinary.BALLMER: I'm a free trader by nature. I went to school, economics, it's the best thing for the world. This one's a tricky issue because it's absolutely clear that the rules don't apply in China and the U.S. government needs to do something, whether tariffs are right or wrong, I'm silent on that point. But without any pressure from the U.S. government, we're not -- we're talking about $10 billion plus, for example, in Microsoft that would go into profit. As a shareholder that's the easiest thing for me to now see as an outsider. We just haven't seen the rise in profits that would be commensurate with real intellectual property protection in China.BARTIROMO: So, where does this go, Steve? I mean, I don't think they're going to -- I don't think they're going to change their behavior, frankly. Because they won't even admit that they've been stealing our I.P.I mean, you were the CEO of Microsoft and you can confirm that 90 percent of these large companies in China use Microsoft and they don't even pay for it. So, what -- where is this going? Are you happy that this administration is pushing back on China? I know we're not sure if tariffs is the way to do it but what is the way then?BALLMER: Not sure. I don't work at Microsoft anymore. Hard to see the internal issues. All I can say is without any pressure, nothing's going to change. Not clear tariffs is the right way to go, I'll be silent on that. But at least in this free trader's mind you have to think about more draconian measures.BARTIROMO: You've been watching the industry, a student of technology for a long time. So, let me get your take on this new focus on tech and that is the regulatory environment.I mean, 25 years ago when you and I first started talking, these companies weren't where they are today. So Google, Alphabet, Amazon, you know, -- well, Microsoft as well. They've gotten so much bigger and you were around to see the way the E.U. targeted Microsoft at a time because of the law of large numbers. It was so big that it was so powerful that you became a target at Microsoft. Now Alphabet is the target, Amazon is the target. What do you think should be done? Are they too big and powerful?BALLMER: I think the notion of saying something is just too big because it's big, that doesn't resonate with me. It didn't when governments targeted Microsoft.BARTIROMO: Well, Google does 90 percent of all search in the country.BALLMER: And Microsoft did 90 percent of all operating systems.BARTIROMO: OK.BALLMER: That, per se, is hard to complain with. It's how people leverage that power. Is Google going to favor only its own store for example, when it comes to under putting up search results for products. That's a different problem. That's a targetable offense. Is Google only going to bundle its search with android? That's an issue that needs to be looked at. The pure size, I'm sorry, I don't believe that that should be targeted. They did a good job. They've gained market share. Bravo.BARTIROMO: Do you think we'll see more regulation on tech?BALLMER: I don't think -- well, there's two kinds of regulation. On size, the kind you've talked about, maybe, maybe not. Not sure how to think about that.On the issues of privacy and data protection, yes, I do think we'll see more regulation. In the best of worlds, it's not just slam-down. The regulators will work with the tech companies to find the right solutions. A piece of legislation that throws a lightning bolt and says do this is unlikely to be the right thing.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's a great analysis, Steve.You're also the chairman of the L.A. Clippers. Let's talk -- let's talk sports for a second. You're working on a new way to -- for fans to watch games. Tell us about that technology.BALLMER: Yes, we've been working for a few years on an augmented reality view of the game so then in real-time you can see player statistics. You can take the point of view of the coach, of the point guard. You can sit back and kind of just watch in a fun way. We let you pick different camera angles.BARTIROMO: I love that.BALLMER: And we're in version one. We even use A.I. to auto generate additional facts about the game live as it's going on. It's really incredible, I think, and you know, since I'm a software guy it's version one.BARTIROMO: I love it.BALLMER: And we'll just keep coming.BARTIROMO: So, this is just making everything just much more interactive, getting the fans involved, wherever they are.BALLMER: Exactly right.BARTIROMO: What has been the response to LeBron on the L.A. Lakers?BALLMER: Well, you know, we do our own thing. We do L.A. our way at the Clippers. And obviously LeBron is a great, great player. Our job is to go out and beat 29 other teams every night. And we're after it.BARTIROMO: And you're ready for it.BALLMER: Absolutely.BARTIROMO: Steve, it's great to see you this morning.BALLMER: Great to see you, Maria. Thanks.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. Steve Ballmer.BALLMER: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Stay with Fox Business for a special midterm election coverage beginning November 6. "LOU DOBBS TONIGHT" kicks us off at 7:00 p.m. on election night. And then Neil Cavuto takes over at 8:00 p.m. bringing you the results. MORNINGS WITH MARIA the next day, we'll bring you all the details an hour earlier at 5:00 a.m. Eastern. So, join us next Wednesday for our special coverage.Coming up, driving into the future, details as Elon Musk announces Tesla cars will soon be able to find parking spots on their own. The car will find the spot.Plus, a place that's perfect for Homer Simpson. We check out this Texas bar that transformed itself into Moe's tavern for Halloween. Back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Amazon's $15.00 minimum wage begins today. Cheryl Casone with the details, Cheryl.CASONE: We were just talking about technology jobs just now, Maria. This wage hike applies to U.S. full-time, part-time and temporary workers, that also includes employees at Whole Foods, which of course Amazon bought last year. Amazon currently has more than 250,000 employees in the United States and it plans to hire about 100,000 temporary workers for the holiday season. Taking a look at shares of Amazon, higher in the premarket. Of course their earnings have come out. They're up more than 1-1/4 percent right now. Lots to talk about Amazon lately.And then talk about this, a high flier, an American Airlines baggage handler flew all the way from Kansas City to Chicago in the cargo hold after he passed out drunk, yes, while on the job. The man allegedly admitted being drunk to police before he had to fly back to Kansas City on another flight this time. He was actually in the cabin, not in the cargo hold.Then there is this, speaking of alcohol. One bar in Austin, Texas is looking a lot more like Springfield.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Bartender, buy these men around on me.MOE SZYSLAK, BARTENDER, THE SIMPSONS: You want to buy around? I heard about that in bartending school but I've never seen it happen. This is very good for me.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: The bar Nickel City transformed itself into Moe's Tavern from "The Simpsons" just for Halloween. It wouldn't be complete of course if they didn't have Homer's favorite, which is the pink ice donuts. They have Krusty burgers, they had Flaming Moe cocktails, but they had Jagermeister instead of cough syrup. That's the secret ingredient. Thank God, right? The bar's owner happens to be huge Simpsons fan. His favorite character, yep, Moe the bartender, Maria. So, that is one way to celebrate Halloween.BARTIROMO: That is great. Cheryl, thank you.Coming up, booking a room based on your mood, we are checking out a unique hotel using color theory in its interior design. Stay with us for that.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well, picking a hotel room based on your mood, that is the idea of the Angad Arts Hotel. It is opening today. They let you choose your room by color. Angad Arts Hotel developer Steve Smith joins us now to talk more about it. Steve, it's great to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.STEVE SMITH, DEVELOPER, ANGAD ARTS HOTEL: Thank you, Maria. Thank you for having me.BARTIROMO: What an interesting concept. Tell us about it.SMITH: Yes, so, we're in the Grand Central Arts district which is the cultural hub of St. Louis. And so, from the very beginning, we decided that we're going to do a hotel that basically takes the norms and puts it on its ear. And so, the idea of a typical hotel guest room is neutral in color. So, it would appeal to a broad segment of the population. So, we're going to do that differently. We decided early on that we're going to saturate the rooms with color and then decided to give the guest the choice to pick between the colors and the moods that we think that those colors would elicit.BARTIROMO: And what's been the response?SMITH: Response has been off the charts. I mean, we opened today. But we've been giving tours now probably for the last four months and people come in and have an audible reaction and after the tours, we'll get the opinions I really liked the yellow. I was surprised by how much I liked the red. Those are the kind of reactions we're getting.MCDOWELL: By the way, there's an old wives' tale that says if you have company coming over to stay, make sure that you paint that room yellow because it makes them irritable and makes them want to leave. So maybe that's good if you're in the hotel business.SMITH: I think it differently, you wake up in the morning in a bright yellow room, you can't -- wake up and be cheerful.PEEK: So, if you have a couple coming and one person wants the red room and one wants the yellow. I mean, are you assessing their moods ahead of time or just asking their color preference?SMITH: Well they -- we give them the choice.PEEK: OK.SMITH: So, when you call or go to our website, you can have the choice of the color. And I think what will happen, is people will pick a color, blue will probably be the most common choice initially but when you visit, I can guarantee you, you're going to be delighted by the feelings that are in some of those other rooms.BARTIROMO: So, your mood will change once you get in the room?SMITH: I think it could. I think there's an anticipation of what a red room might feel like.MCDOWELL: And by the way, green is bad luck in racing. I'm just saying. Bad luck.PEEK: If you're going to race that day.FREEMAN: I'm wondering if your sort of typical customer. Because I would imagine there is some segment of the frequent business travelers who want predictability vanilla. They don't want anything weird when they walk in the door.SMITH: Sure. We are not for everyone. And so, we have to understand, we are not for everyone. We imagine --BARTIROMO: Those eye pillows are staring me down right now.PEEK: Yes, you read my mind.SMITH: So, we were intentionally provocative in many cases. The entrance to the hotel is in the rear of the hotel under the fire escape. You come in on the ground floor, take an elevator to the top floor and you check in on the top floor of the hotel and then you go down an elevator to your room and then you enter your room which is awash with color.And so, I've got Paul, who's our founder, named after him, who said what is art but seeing the world in a different way. And that is how innovation happens, is seeing the world in a different way. So, we are intentionally thinking the traditional experience of putting us out of here. We think about the Instagram generation. You know, we grew up wanting things. We were creating experiences that people will talk about.BARTIROMO: Am I paying up for that, is that higher price room?SMITH: What's that?BARTIROMO: Is it a higher price room because of this?SMITH: I think you'd find it very affordable.SMITH: All right.SMITH: Especially coming from New York.BARTIROMO: All right. Steve Smith, joins us. Go check it out.Still ahead, the Boston Red Sox fans may have partied a little too hard. The details after the World Series trophy is dented by a beer can, next hour, right here, MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Stay with us.Load-Date: November 1, 2018End of Document

China rejects Huawei executive detention after US requestCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 7, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 579 wordsBody The Chinese government presented a formal protest through its embassy in Canada, following the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, financial director of the Huawei technology giant.  According to Efe report, Beijing questioned both Ottawa and the United States, a country that according to sources cited by the Spanish agency, calls for the extradition of Meng for allegedly violating the sanctions imposed by Washington against Iran.  "China has lodged a formal complaint with both the Canadian and American sides, asking them to explain immediately the reason for the arrest and release the detainee," said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang.  'As far as I know, Canada and the US they have not given any explanation about the reason for the arrest, "added Geng, who assured that this detention" violates the human rights of the detainee. "  Meanwhile, in a statement broadcast by social networks, Huawei reported that they have not been properly informed about charges against Meg.  '(We) have received very little information regarding the charges and we are not aware of any infringement by Mrs Meng,' the company said. '(the company) complies with all applicable laws and regulations where it operates, including the applicable laws and regulations for the control and sanction of exports from the United Nations, the United States and the European Union,' he added.  Since May of this year, the US president, Donald Trump, resumed the sanctions imposed on Tehran, following his unilateral withdrawal from the nuclear treaty, signed with the Obama Administration.  That pact, which is still backed by Russia, China, the United Kingdom, France and Germany, suspended all trade restrictions against the Persian nation, while it was abandoning its nuclear program.  Although Washington's allies have maintained that Tehran fulfilled its part of the agreement, something corroborated by United Nations specialists, the White House rescinded what was signed in 2015.  During the last months, the United States and China have maintained an intense commercial war with the imposition of several waves of bidirectional tariffs and with accusations against companies, especially against the Chinese that operate in North American territory.  US authorities have warned that Huawei poses a threat to national security because of its alleged ties to the Chinese government and its security services.  Washington has been refusing to buy servers produced by Huawei since 2011, and the Pentagon banned the sale of the Chinese manufacturer's phones in its bases last May.  US senators asked the Canadian government a few months ago to ban the use of equipment produced by Huawei in the country's telecommunications networks for fear that the Chinese executive will be able to use these equipment for espionage activities.  Precisely, the arrest of Meng came on the same day as the meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Trump in Buenos Aires, where they showed their most friendly side and agreed to the temporary suspension of the trade war while awaiting further negotiations. .  Asked if the arrest will affect these trade negotiations, the spokesman of the Chinese Foreign Ministry said that both parties should respect the agreement reached between the two leaders and continue the dialogue to reach an agreement.  Huawei, founded in 1987, has become the world's largest manufacturer of telecommunications equipment and is one of the largest mobile phone manufacturers. Load-Date: December 7, 2018End of Document

Maybe only people who do something wrong know and penalize them, "says a young Chinese woman who resides in Beijing and confesses she does not know much about the system, except for the little published by the state press.  Companies Participate  However, there are already companies that apply this system, such as Ant Financial , part of the Alibaba group and owner of Alipay, which rates its customers according to their consumption habits or if they pay their bills on time.  Also Ziroom, one of the real estate companies with the most presence in Beijing, has its own rating method and gives points to its tenants according to their behavior so that they can obtain discounts.  Climate of confidence  Although some Chinese welcome these rewards for being good citizens, Amnesty International China researcher Patrick Poon warns that this system is nothing more than a " practice of large-scale social control that legitimizes the hierarchical classification of citizens "  "It will only increase social tension. Definitely not good to move towards equality, "he says.  The authorities defend this system by ensuring that they want to promote the " culture of honesty " in all areas (labor, education, public places, etc.) to achieve a "harmonious" society.  Chinese experts who are voiced by state media also support this initiative because, they criticize, the low cost of being "dishonest" encourages bad behavior.  One example, they say, is the recent case -which became a viral video- in which a passenger of a high-speed train took the seat of another person and refused to stand up because of the indignation of other passengers, an incident He was only punished with not being able to travel for a period of time.  The Chinese government has already created a digital platform in which it offers advanced data collection technology to encourage companies and institutions to participate in this system.  Although it may seemdifficult to set in motion in the most populated country in the world, the fact is that one already feels observed in China, where you only need to look up to walk down the street to see that several cameras, many of them with facial recognition, They are recording.  It is impossible not to find similarities between the reality that exists in China and the omnipresent and vigilant Big Brother by George Orwell in 1984 or the science fiction that is portrayed in the Netflix series Black Mirror.  In one of the chapters of the popular series, its protagonist lives obsessed with achieving five stars in a social scoring system to buy a luxury apartment.  But his life is complicated after spilling some coffee to a passerby and entering a spiral of negative ratings that lead to social disgrace. "Reality or fiction?" Many people ask themselves in China today. Load-Date: November 10, 2018End of Document

Detention Of 2 Canadians Raises Stakes In China-U.S.-Canada DisputeStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeDecember 14, 2018 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: MARKETS; Pg. 1Length: 681 wordsByline: Jean GarciaBodyLu dodged direct questions about whether their arrests were in retaliation for Meng's arrest, whether the two men were connected to each other, or whether the so-called allegations of harming Chinese national security had anything to do with their work in North Korea.She was released on bail on Tuesday while awaiting a U.S. extradition hearing.The website for Paektu Cultural Exchange, the organization Spavor founded, says it is "dedicated to facilitating sustainable co-operation, cross-cultural exchanges, tourism, trade, and economic exchanges between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) and worldwide organizations, businesses, and individuals".Early Monday, Spavor shared his upcoming itinerary on Facebook, describing plans for a few meetings and a lecture in Seoul, South Korea.The detainment of former diplomat Michael Kovrig and entrepreneur Michael Spavor has been widely interpreted as a retaliatory action by the Chinese government to put pressure on Canada.They were taken into custody Monday on suspicion of "engaging in activities that endanger the national security" of China, foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said."We have raised this case directly with the Chinese authorities".The government officials said they had seen an uptick in anti-Canadian sentiment online and in China and have communicated concerns about diplomatic staff safety to the Chinese government, which beefed up security in response.Kovrig is an analyst on northeast Asia for the International Crisis Group, a think tank, who took a leave of absence from the Canadian government and is based in Hong Kong. He gained fame for helping arrange a visit to North Korea by former National Basketball Association player Dennis Rodman. The two sides have taken pains this week to emphasize that their trade talks are entirely separate from the US case against Meng and any retaliatory moves by Beijing.US officials say Meng lied to banks about Huawei's control of Hong Kong-based Skycom, a company that allegedly sold USA goods to Iran in violation of USA sanctions against Tehran. Once it does, if a Canadian judge rules in favor of the request, Canada's justice minister must decide whether to extradite Meng to the United States.Intel: From Coffee Lake To Sunny Cove, new Processor architectures inboundAccording to Intel, it expects to launch a range of products that leverage Foveros, starting in the second half of 2019. Now, 3D stacking and 3D integrated circuits are not new technologies; they have been employed for years.Freeland has also indirectly criticised statements by US President Donald Trump, who said in an interview on Tuesday he was ready to intervene in the Meng affair if it helped seal a trade deal with China.China has warned Canada of "grave consequences" over Meng's arrest, though neither country has confirmed a link between the two cases."Whatever's good for the country, I would do", Trump told Reuters on Tuesday.The suggestion that Meng could be a political pawn in negotiations makes the situation more awkward for Canada.Freeland said it was obvious the legal process should not be hijacked for political purposes and that Meng's lawyers would have the option of raising Trump's remarks if they chose to fight extradition.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau bristled at Trump's assertion, saying: "Regardless of what goes on in other countries, Canada is, and will always remain, a country of the rule of law".United States officials have not linked Meng's arrest to the trade talks under way between China and the US.Trump earlier drew fire for intervening on behalf of Chinese telecommunications company, ZTE, after it was accused of selling equipment to Iran and North Korea.USA regulators planned to bar it from receiving US components that it depended on, effectively a corporate death sentence. ZTE agreed to pay a $1 billion fine, change its board and management, and let American regulators monitor its operations. "The trade talks can still go on because China has still been adhering to the agreement at the G20 with Trump", Rein said.Load-Date: December 14, 2018End of Document

China: WTO changes must support developing countriesAssociated Press Financial WireNovember 23, 2018 Friday 1:18 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 630 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - China will go along with changes meant to update global trade rules so long as they protect Beijing's status as a developing country, a Cabinet official said Friday.The deputy commerce minister, Wang Shouwen, said any changes also must address protectionism and abuse of export controls and security reviews - a reference to Beijing's trade clash with U.S. President Donald Trump.China agreed in June to work with the European Union to propose changes to the World Trade Organization to address technology policy, subsidies and state industry - all areas in which Beijing faces complaints. U.S. officials complain the global trade referee is too bureaucratic and slow to adapt to changing business conditions.Wang said each country's "development model" must be respected - a reference to China's state-dominated economy, which has provoked repeated complaints Beijing is violating its market-opening obligations.Beijing has accused Trump of wrecking the global trading system by going outside the WTO to hike tariffs on Chinese imports. Trump says that was necessary because the global body is unable to respond to complaints about Chinese technology theft, subsidies and state-led industry development.China is "willing to assume obligations" that are "compatible with our own level of development," Wang said at a news conference."We will not allow other members to deprive China of the special and differential treatment that developing members deserve," he said.Wang gave no details of changes Beijing might support. But he said they also must address agricultural subsidies - a frequent complaint by developing countries against industrialized economies - and "discrimination against state enterprises," a reference to restrictions on Chinese government companies abroad.Beijing's insistence that it is a developing country and entitled to special protections despite having grown into the second-largest global economy and a major manufacturer rankles its trading partners. That might dampen chances of reaching agreement on WTO reforms that would satisfy the United States, Europe and other governments.Other governments dislike Trump's tactics but echo U.S. complaints about Chinese market barriers and technology policy.Washington and Beijing have imposed penalty tariffs on billions of dollars of each other's goods in their dispute over U.S. complaints that China steals or pressures foreign companies to hand over technology.The United States, Europe and other governments also object to Chinese plans including "Made in China 2025" for state-led creation of competitors in robotics and other technology. American officials worry those might erode U.S. industrial leadership.The EU filed a WTO challenge in June to Chinese rules on technology licensing that it said improperly discriminate against foreign companies.Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, are due to meet this month in Buenos Aires during a gathering of the Group of 20 major economies. Private sector analysts say there is little chance that meeting by itself will produce a settlement.Wang, the commerce official, gave no details of Xi's possible negotiating stance. But he said China hopes G-20 members can have an "effective discussion" about WTO reform."China hopes the G-20 meeting can support the multilateral trading system (and) oppose unilateralism and trade protectionism," he said.Wang warned that an issue that "endangers the WTO's existence" is the status of judges to mediate disputes. The Trump administration has blocked the appointment of judges to the WTO's appeal body, leaving only three members on the seven-seat panel.That is a dispute "between the United States and all other WTO members," said Wang.

Chinese tourists are spending less at Tiffany'sCNN WireNovember 28, 2018 Wednesday 4:27 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 433 wordsByline: By Nathaniel Meyersohn, CNN BusinessDateline: NEW YORK (CNN Business) BodyNEW YORK (CNN Business) --  Chinese tourists in the United States slowed their spending at Tiffany during its most recent quarter, a troubling sign for the jeweler. Tiffany's (TIF) stock tumbled by as much as 13% in early trading on Wednesday. The US based jeweler counts on Chinese shoppers, who make up about a third of the $21 billion luxury goods market.Tiffany, which has about $4.2 billion in annual sales, warned in a securities filing this year that "any slowdown in the Chinese economy could have a negative impact on the sales and profitability of stores."Chinese tourists are especially important to Tiffany. Executives said that the majority of its Chinese customers -- about two-thirds -- make their purchases abroad. But the Chinese economy has weakened lately--- in part from the trade war between Beijing and Washington. That's led to fewer Chinese shoppers making trips abroad, according to China's state-run newspaper.Travelers might also be spending less on US luxury goods because the resale market in China is becoming less lucrative, said Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData Retail. He said the Chinese government has recently strengthened its customs enforcement to crackdown on resellers who bring expensive goods into China and sell them for less than US stores. Saunders also noted that the dollar has strengthened against the Yuan, which makes US products more expensive for Chinese consumers.The Chinese economy hasn't faltered enough to prevent spending in China, however. Sales grew in mainland China last quarter, and Tiffany executives told analysts on Wednesday that they expect a rebound in Chinese tourist spending. "We can speculate on the reasons for the tourist spend down outside of China, but the reality is that the Tiffany brand is appealing to Chinese customers," chief executive Alessandro Bogliolo said.Investors were disappointed by other areas of Tiffany's earnings report, too. Higher spending on marketing, tech, and digital investments drove down the company's profit.

Uninvited guests keep watch for China inside Uighur homesAssociated Press InternationalNovember 30, 2018 Friday 3:21 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWS; Only on APLength: 824 wordsByline: By DAKE KANG and YANAN WANG, Associated PressDateline: ISTANBUL BodyISTANBUL (AP) - The two women in the photograph were smiling, but Halmurat Idris knew something was terribly wrong.One was his 39-year-old sister; standing at her side was an elderly woman Idris did not know. Their grins were tight-lipped, mirthless. Her sister had posted the picture on a social media account along with a caption punctuated by a smiley-face."Look, I have a Han Chinese mother now!" his sister wrote.Idris knew instantly: The old woman was a spy, sent by the Chinese government to infiltrate his family.There are many like her. According to the ruling Communist Party's official newspaper, as of the end of September, 1.1 million local government workers have been deployed to ethnic minorities' living rooms, dining areas and Muslim prayer spaces, not to mention at weddings, funerals and other occasions once considered intimate and private.All this is taking place in China's far west region of Xinjiang, home to the predominantly Muslim, Turkic-speaking Uighurs, who have long reported discrimination at the hands of the country's majority Han Chinese.While government notices about the "Pair Up and Become Family" program portray it as an affectionate cultural exchange, Uighurs living in exile in Turkey said their loved ones saw the campaign as a chilling intrusion into the only place that they once felt safe.They believe the program is aimed at coercing Uighurs into living secular lives like the Han majority. Anything diverging from the party's prescribed lifestyle can be viewed by authorities as a sign of potential extremism.Under Chinese President Xi Jinping, the Uighur homeland has been blanketed with stifling surveillance, from armed checkpoints on street corners to facial-recognition-equipped CCTV cameras steadily surveying passers-by. Now, Uighurs say, they must live under the watchful eye of the ruling Communist Party even inside their own homes."The government is trying to destroy that last protected space in which Uighurs have been able to maintain their identity," said Joanne Smith Finley, an ethnographer at England's Newcastle University.The Associated Press spoke to five Uighurs living in Istanbul who shared the experiences of their family members in Xinjiang who have had to host Han Chinese civil servants. These accounts are based on prior communications with their family members, the majority of whom have since cut off contact because Uighurs can be punished for speaking to people abroad.Uighurs abroad said their loved ones were constantly on edge in their own homes, knowing that any misstep - a misplaced Quran, a carelessly spoken word - could lead to detention or worse. In the presence of these faux relatives, their family members could not pray or wear religious garbs, and the cadres were privy to their every move.The thought of it - and the sight of his sister, the old woman and their false smiles - made Idris queasy."I wanted to throw up," said the 49-year-old petroleum engineer, shaking his head in disgust."The moment I saw the old woman, I thought, 'Ugh, this person is our enemy.' If your enemy became your mother, think about it - how would you feel?"Tensions between Muslim minorities and Han Chinese have bubbled over in recent years, resulting in violent attacks pegged to Uighur separatists and a fierce government crackdown on broadly defined "extremism" that has placed as many as 1 million Muslims in internment camps, according to estimates by experts and a human rights group.Uighurs say the omnipresent threat of being sent to one of these centers, which are described as political indoctrination camps by former detainees, looms large in their relatives' minds when they are forced to welcome party members into their homes.Last December, Xinjiang authorities organized a "Becoming Family Week" which placed more than 1 million cadres in minority households. Government reports on the program gushed about the warm "family reunions," as public servants and Uighurs shared meals and even beds.Becoming Family Week turned out to be a test run for a standardized homestay program. The Xinjiang United Front Work Department said in February that government workers should live with their assigned families every two months, for five days at a time.Not all "Become Family" pairings involve Han Chinese visitors. A Uighur cadre named Gu Li said she regularly pays visits to a Uighur household, staying three to five days at a time."We've already started calling each other family," she said in a telephone interview from Xinjiang. "China's 56 ethnic groups are all one family."Gu said civil servants of many ethnicities - Uighur, Han and Kazakh - participate in the program.All government employees in the region are required to conduct such visits in order to better understand villagers' needs, according to Gu: "Because we're always sitting in our offices, we don't know what they really need. Only through penetrating the masses can we truly serve them."Load-Date: November 30, 2018End of Document

Chinese official charged with espionage against aviation companiesStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeOctober 11, 2018 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: WORLD-NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 653 wordsByline: Steven ClarkeBodyA report by the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, a DNI component, made public last summer said China is engaged in aggressive cyber operations to steal valuable USA technology and economic secrets. "We will not tolerate a nation that reaps what it does not sow".The report said the Chinese, along with Russian and other foreign spies, are targeting key technologies related to energy, biotechnology, defense, environmental protection, high-end manufacturing, information, and communications.Xu Yanjun, who also uses the names Qu Hui and Zhang Hui, was extradited to the United States on Tuesday with assistance from Belgian authorities for seeking "to steal trade secrets and other sensitive information from an American company that leads the way in aerospace", Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers said in a Justice Department announcement on Wednesday.Xu remained in contact with the employee, and in February requested that the employee send specific proprietary information as well as a list of technical topics regarding composite materials in engine fan blades developed by GE Aviation, according to court papers.The indictment alleges that, beginning around December 2013 and continuing until his arrest, Xu targeted the aviation companies as they were recognised leaders in aviation.Federal authorities said it's the first time that a Chinese Ministry of State Security intelligence officer has been extradited to the United States for trial.While the USA government has in the past charged Chinese officials with similar offenses, this is the first time they have done so publicly with an individual in custody. According to the Department of Justice he was captured in Belgium on April 1 as part of a counterintelligence operation.Samsung Galaxy A9 is the First Quad-Camera PhoneWhile Samsung confirmed that it would be bringing the A9 (2018) to India, it did not reveal any specific launch date. The first sensor is an ultra wide sensor with 120-degree field of view, f/2.4 aperture, and 8-megapixel resolution.Justice Department officials said the indictment is but the latest example of China seeking to develop its economy at the expense of American firms and know-how.The ministry of state security is China's intelligence and security agency, responsible for counterintelligence, foreign intelligence and political security. It also said he made contact with experts working for the firms and recruited them to travel to China, often for the initial objective of delivering a university presentation and paying their costs and a stipend. He appealed his arrest in Belgium, but his appeals ultimately failed and he was extradited to the US on Tuesday, authorities said.A spokesperson for GE Aviation told The Associated Press that the company has been cooperating with the Federal Bureau of Investigation for months and that the impact to the company is "minimal thanks to early detection, our advanced digital systems and internal processes, and our partnership with the Federal Bureau of Investigation". In May and June of 2017, the engineer went to China for the exchange of ideas, met Xu, who claimed to be from JAST."In reality, the presentations were for the benefit of the Chinese government", the indictment said.He was the second Chinese national in two weeks charged by the Justice Department with attempting to steal aviation industry secrets.According to The Washington Post, the case is linked to last month's arrest of 27-year-old Ji Chaoqun, a Chinese citizen living in Chicago, who was arrested for allegedly passing information to what the DOJ called a "high-level intelligence officer" with the MSS.Ji targeted individuals in science and tech industries, seven of whom worked for or recently retired from United States defence contractors. All were naturalised U.S. citizens born either in mainland China or the self-governed island of Taiwan.Load-Date: October 12, 2018End of Document

China gives American Express first shot at its huge payments marketCNN WireNovember 9, 2018 Friday 12:36 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 413 wordsByline: By Sherisse Pham, CNN BusinessDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  American Express just became the first US credit card company to get the green light to start building its own payments network in China.The company said Friday that the Chinese central bank has given it preliminary approval to handle payments in yuan. AmEx (AXP) can now start setting up the payments network through a joint venture with LianLian Group, its Chinese partner.In every other market around the world, AmEx processes transactions through its own network, whose hub is in Phoenix, Arizona. But in China, they have been handled by state-controlled payments giant China UnionPay. Once AmEx has built its own network in China, it will be able to use it to process payments on AmEx branded cards and collect fees on far more transactions.In China, AmEx, Mastercard (MA) and Visa (V) can only issue co-branded cards, typically in partnership with UnionPay. The cards use UnionPay's network for yuan payments in China, and the US companies' networks for payments abroad in dollars or other foreign currencies.AmEx now has a shot at taking some of UnionPay's business inside China.Mastercard and Visa are also seeking permission to build their own networks after Beijing last year started letting foreign card companies apply for licenses."We continue to work closely with the Chinese government as we proceed through the application process," a Visa spokesperson said.Mastercard did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.All three US companies are likely to struggle to make inroads in China, where UnionPay has solidified its hold on the bank card industry and tech companies Ant Financial and Tencent (TCEHY) dominate the mobile payments market.The Chinese government dragged its feet for years on opening up its credit card payments market to foreign companies, even after the World Trade Organization ruled in 2012 that China UnionPay was operating a monopoly. Although Beijing is now letting at least one American company into the market, that may not satisfy its critics.Joint ventures have been criticized by the Trump administration. It claims that China makes companies form joint ventures in certain sectors, then forces them to transfer valuable technology.Mastercard has reportedly formed a partnership with several Chinese entities for its China application, while Visa applied to form a wholly owned entity to operate in China.TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

China's Huawei faces new setbacks in Europe's telecom marketAssociated Press InternationalDecember 23, 2018 Sunday 9:33 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 1077 wordsByline: By KELVIN CHAN, AP Business WriterDateline: LONDON BodyLONDON (AP) - The U.S. dispute with China over a ban on tech giant Huawei is spilling over to Europe, the company's biggest foreign market, where some countries are also starting to shun its network systems over data security concerns.Some European governments and telecom companies are following the U.S.'s lead in questioning whether using Huawei for vital infrastructure for mobile networks could leave them exposed to snooping by the Chinese government.Bans in Europe could significantly increase the financial pressures on Huawei. They would also cost Europe tens of billions of dollars as the region looks to build up "5G" networks, which are meant to support a vast expansion in internet-connected things, from self-driving cars to factory robots and remote surgery."Europe is still divided over Huawei, but the trendline is moving in a fairly clear direction" as the U.S. exerts pressure on allies to block it, said Thorsten Benner, director of the Berlin-based Global Public Policy Institute think tank.Geopolitical tensions over Huawei intensified after its chief financial officer, who is also the daughter of founder Ren Zhengfei, was arrested Dec. 1 in Canada in connection with U.S. accusations that the company violated restrictions on sales of American technology to Iran.Huawei has been blocked in the U.S. since 2012, when a House Intelligence Committee report found it was a security risk and recommended that the government and private companies stop buying its network equipment.Germany's Deutsche Telekom said last week it "takes the global discussion about the security of network elements from Chinese manufacturers very seriously." The company said it uses multiple companies to build its network, including Ericsson, Nokia and Cisco."Nevertheless, we are currently reevaluating our procurement strategy," the company said.The statement is significant because until recently it had been one of Huawei's "biggest cheerleaders" based on its cheap and reliable equipment, said Benner.It came shortly after Alex Younger, the director of Britain's Secret Intelligence Service, or MI6, said in a speech that Britain needs "to decide the extent to which we are going to be comfortable with Chinese ownership of these technologies," according to local media reports.At about the same time, mobile provider British Telecom said it was removing Huawei equipment from key parts of its current 3G and 4G networks as part of an internal policy not to use it for core infrastructure, which will also apply to 5G networks.The British government-run center that tests the company's equipment and software this summer identified "shortcomings in Huawei's engineering processes that have exposed new risks" in U.K. networks. Huawei said it's working on fixing those issues.Norway's telecom ministry said it was considering clarifying requirements from network operators, without being more specific.Belgium's cybersecurity agency is reportedly considering a ban on Huawei. And the Czech Republic's prime minister ordered his government office on Tuesday to stop using Huawei mobile phones, after the national cybersecurity agency warned that products by Huawei and another Chinese telecom company, ZTE, pose "a security threat."The European Union's head of technology policies, Andrus Ansip, said "we have to be worried" about possible security risks from Huawei when asked about the company's role in European 5G and driverless car projects.Huawei, founded in 1987 by a former military engineer, denies accusations it's controlled by China's ruling Communist Party or designs equipment to facilitate eavesdropping. It said it recognizes and shares security concerns around the rollout of new 5G networks and is happy to take part in Deutsche Telekom's review.The company noted German officials have said publicly there's no reason to exclude Huawei and it has never been involved in any confirmed cybersecurity breaches."Cybersecurity is incredibly important to Huawei. It is central to every decision and product we make," said Vincent Pang, the company's president for Western Europe. "We think the answer lies in global cooperation and collaboration to ensure that networks are as secure as possible."The Europe, Middle East and Africa market is Huawei's second biggest after China, accounting for 27 percent of its nearly $90 billion revenue last year. Executives said the company has now signed contracts with 25 telecom carriers for commercial or test use of 5G and shipped more than 10,000 5G base stations.The rollout of 5G networks is expected to take a decade. As technologies advance, the amount of data flowing between machines is set to surge, prompting governments to increasingly view telecom networks as strategic national assets.Not everyone is endorsing quick action to ban Huawei.The CEO of the French telecom company Orange, Stephane Richard, said last week his company wouldn't use Huawei gear for sensitive parts of its network because of "messages of prudence" from French authorities. But he said that was not for any technical reason, and that the debate on Huawei had become politicized."We're in the realm of fantasy: 'They're Chinese. They have links to the Chinese army, thus there are spies, thus we can't let them touch our telecom equipment'," he said.Excluding Huawei won't be easy, analysts said."It's not like there's some cheaper alternative," said Paul Triolo, head of geotechnology practice at the Eurasia Group. "Ericsson and Nokia don't produce the whole spectrum" of equipment, referring to the Scandinavian companies that are the only non-Chinese competitors.Huawei has thrived in major European markets like Germany and Britain because their telecom industries wanted to ensure there were multiple equipment suppliers to avoid relying on one."So if you're asking them to remove a major vendor from their markets, it's going to be difficult," Triolo said.German companies won't be happy if they can't use Huawei because their costs will go up and it will delay rolling out 5G networks, which will initially rely on existing 4G infrastructure for which Huawei is already a major supplier, said Benner.But German decisions are also likely to influence those by smaller countries that are part of the German industrial manufacturing supply chain, such as Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia."They'll all wake up if Germany takes a decision and worries about the security of its infrastructure," said Benner.Load-Date: December 24, 2018End of Document

A good thing that happened to Trump this week: China bought soybeansCNN.comDecember 14, 2018 Friday 4:03 PM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICSLength: 1292 wordsByline: Donna Borak, CNNDateline: Washington BodyPresident Donald Trump is facing a series of damaging revelations from the Russia probe and a major West Wing shakeup, but one thing seems to be going well for him right now: his trade talks with China.Since the President met with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, two weeks ago in Argentina, China has delivered on an array of Trump's promises, including lowering auto tariffs and restarting purchases of soybeans.The moves amounted to a political gift from Beijing, even as the US presses ahead with the prosecution of a high-profile Chinese tech executive and looks to crack down on Chinese intellectual property theft and cybercrime.Trump crowed about reports Friday that China's economy is slowing, taking credit for damaging America's top economic rival with his tariffs.That was after he said in an interview Thursday with Fox News of China's economy: "If it's in trouble, it's only in trouble because of me."But US markets took a nosedive Friday, dropping about 500 points at one point over concerns about the global repercussions of a Chinese economic slowdown. The decline extended a pattern over the last week that has frustrated the President, who has complained to advisers that Wall Street hasn't responded positively to what he sees as a major step forward in US-China relations.The volatility reflects investor uncertainty over whether Trump can close his deal -- and anxiety that Beijing, which has so far proceeded on a positive track with trade talks, might change course if US enforcement moves take a bite.For now, China has directed its anger at Ottawa, detaining two Canadians in the wake of the arrest of Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou in British Columbia in connection with a US investigation into Iran sanction violations.Further heightening potential tensions between China and the US are pending indictments against Chinese government hackers by the Justice Department for violating a 2015 pact by stealing American intellectual property and a cyberattack on the Marriott hotel chain linked to Chinese-intelligence gathering efforts that affected nearly 500 million guests.The Justice Department's top national security official told lawmakers this week that the US "cannot tolerate a nation that steals the fruits of our brain power," noting economic espionage costs the US $225 billion a year. "The playbook is simple: Rob, replicate and replace," said Assistant Attorney General John Demers. In March, the Office of the US Trade Representative released a report on China's actions, including routine intrusions into US commercial networks to obtain confidential business information."These are two sides of the same coin," said John Negroponte, vice chairman of McLarty Associates and the first director of national intelligence under President George W. Bush. "What the President is saying is, 'Look, my biggest worry is the merchandise trade deficit with China,' and that is the main thing he wants to fix. But even if he makes progress on that front, he is still left with the issue of what he is going to do about the large-scale theft of our intellectual property and other unacceptable Chinese practices."A White House spokeswoman told CNN this week that the administration will continue to hold China and all other countries accountable for malign cyber activities.But Trump himself created uncertainty this week by suggesting he might be willing to intervene with his own Justice Department if it would help advance trade talks, a highly unusual blurring of lines between the executive branch and law enforcement. "If I think it's good for the country, if I think it's good for what will be certainly the largest trade deal ever made -- which is a very important thing -- what's good for national security -- I would certainly intervene if I thought it was necessary," Trump told Reuters in an interview.Wendy Cutler, a managing director for the Asia Society who's a former diplomat and negotiator for the Office of the US Trade Representative under President Barack Obama, said the President's comments set a "dangerous precedent.""China has kept these issues so far with the US in separate lanes, and now sending a signal to China that it's kind of all on the table, and maybe it can get all get muddled up," said Cutler. "I think this can complicate the ability to achieve success in trade talks, not provide the leverage that the President is suggesting."Others with long experience in trade negotiations agreed."It's really important for the US not to be perceived -- even the perception of other countries -- that the rule of law isn't the rule of law, and it can be used as a negotiating bait would be a serious problem for the US," said Rufus Yerxa, president of the National Foreign Trade Council and former deputy director general of the World Trade Organization.Trump's comments have also created additional heartburn in the US-Canada relationship.Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said in Washington on Friday that she had discussed the Meng issue during her meetings at the State Department with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary James Mattis. Freeland said both sides agreed the most important thing to do was "uphold the rule of law" and ensure Meng's right to "due process" in Canada is respected, and said it was important that the process remain "apolitical."Freeland said she also raised the issue of US tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, saying Ottawa views the tariffs as "unjust and illegal," and believes they are "inconsistent" with the close relationship between the United States and Canada.Aside from demanding Meng's release shortly after her detention was made public, Beijing has been restrained in its comments, largely echoing Trump's sunny tone on the progress of trade? talks.This week China resumed buying US soybeans, placing an order for 1.2 million tons -- one the largest orders ever placed in a single day, according to the US Department of Agriculture. That will help relieve pressure on Trump, who was forced to offer subsidies to farmers hurt by the trade war, but it won't make up for the losses American soybean farmers have experienced. Exports to China, which was the biggest market for US farmers last year, are down about 97%. In July, China mostly stopped buying American soybeans in retaliation to Trump's tariffs.China also announced on Friday it would temporarily reduce tariffs starting Jan. 1 on imports of American-made cars as it seeks to work out a deal with the United States. The Chinese Finance Ministry said it would remove the additional 25% levy on car imports imposed after Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese products for three months, reducing it to 15%. The ministry described the step as a "concrete action" aimed at helping to bring about a "mutually beneficial new Sino-US trade order."But US-China experts said negotiations will depend on whether Beijing continues to keep cool, especially if hardliners interpret the Meng case and any further enforcement actions as attempts by the US to hold China back."There are going to be hardliners in Beijing who will see the purpose of the indictments as a means to limit the technology advancement of countries," said Adam Segal, director of the digital and cyberspace policy program at the Council on Foreign Relations.But, Segal added, it will be impossible for Trump to hobble existing US investigations, even if he wants to."Ambassador Robert Lighthizer and the Justice Department are going to follow through on their agreements, and they are going to pursue what they think are in the best interests of the United States, making it harder for the President to reverse course on them because he had a beautiful piece of chocolate cake," said Segal.Load-Date: December 15, 2018End of Document

Criminal Division: People's Republic of China State-Owned Company, Taiwan Company, and Three Individuals Charged With Economic EspionageTargeted News ServiceNovember 1, 2018 Thursday 8:23 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1220 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe U.S. Department of Justice's Criminal Division issued the following news release:A federal grand jury indicted a state-owned enterprise of the People's Republic of China (PRC), a Taiwan company, and three individuals, charging them with crimes related to a conspiracy to steal, convey, and possess stolen trade secrets of an American semiconductor company for the benefit of a company controlled by the PRC government. All of the defendants are charged with a conspiracy to commit economic espionage, among other crimes. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, FBI Director Christopher Wray, Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers, Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division Brian A. Benczkowski, United States Attorney Alex G. Tse of the Northern District of California, and FBI Special Agent in Charge for the San Francisco Field Office John F. Bennett made the announcement.In addition, the United States filed a civil lawsuit seeking to enjoin the further transfer of the stolen trade secrets and to enjoin certain defendants from exporting to the United States any products manufactured by UMC or Jinhua that were created using the trade secrets at issue. The indictment was filed on September 27, 2018, and unsealed today. The civil lawsuit was filed today."I am announcing that a grand jury in San Francisco has returned a multi-defendant indictment alleging economic espionage on the part of a state-owned Chinese company, a Taiwanese company, and three Taiwan individuals for an alleged scheme to steal trade secrets from Micron, an Idaho-based semi-conductor company," said Attorney General Sessions. "Micron is worth an estimated $100 billion and has a 20 to 25 percent share of the dynamic random access memory industry--a technology not possessed by the Chinese until very recently. As this and other recent cases have shown, Chinese economic espionage against the United States has been increasing--and it has been increasing rapidly. I am here to say that enough is enough. With integrity and professionalism, the Department of Justice will aggressively prosecute such illegal activity.""The theft of intellectual property is not only unfair, but stifles technological innovation by disincentivizing investment in long-term research and development," said U.S. Attorney Alex Tse. "The theft of intellectual property on a continuing basis by nation-state actors is an even more damaging affront to the rule of law. We in the Northern District of California, one of the world's great centers of intellectual property development, will continue to lead the fight to protect U.S. innovation from criminal misappropriation, whether motivated by personal greed or national economic ambition.""No country presents a broader, more severe threat to our ideas, our innovation, and our economic security than China," said FBI Director Christopher Wray. "The Chinese government is determined to acquire American technology, and they're willing use a variety of means to do that - from foreign investments, corporate acquisitions, and cyber intrusions to obtaining the services of current or former company employees to get inside information. If China acquires an American company's most important technology - the very technology that makes it the leader in a field - that company will suffer severe losses, and our national security could even be impacted. We are committed to continuing to work closely with our federal, state, local, and private sector partners to counter this threat from China."According to the indictment, the defendants were engaged in a conspiracy to steal the trade secrets of Micron Technology, Inc. (Micron), a leader in the global semiconductor industry specializing in the advanced research, development, and manufacturing of memory products, including dynamic random-access memory (DRAM). DRAM is a leading-edge memory storage device used in computer electronics. Micron is the only United States-based company that manufactures DRAM. According to the indictment, Micron maintains a significant competitive advantage in this field due in large part from its intellectual property, including its trade secrets that include detailed, confidential information pertaining to the design, development, and manufacturing of advanced DRAM products.Prior to the events described in the indictment, the PRC did not possess DRAM technology, and the Central Government and State Council of the PRC publicly identified the development of DRAM and other microelectronics technology as a national economic priority. The criminal defendants are United Microelectronics Corporation ("UMC"), a Taiwan semiconductor foundry; Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit, Co., Ltd. ("Jinhua'"), a state-owned enterprise of the PRC; and three Taiwan nationals: Chen Zhengkun, a.k.a. Stephen Chen, age 55; He Jianting, a.k.a. J.T. Ho, age 42; and Wang Yungming, a.k.a. Kenny Wang, age 44. UMC is a publicly listed semiconductor foundry company traded on the New York Stock Exchange; is headquartered in Taiwan; and has offices worldwide, including in Sunnyvale, California. UMC mass produces integrated-circuit logic products based on designs and technology developed and provided by its customers. Jinhua is a state-owned enterprise of the PRC, funded entirely by the Chinese government, and established in February 2016 for the sole purpose of designing, developing, and manufacturing DRAM.According to the indictment, Chen was a General Manager and Chairman of an electronics corporation that Micron acquired in 2013. Chen then became the president of a Micron subsidiary in Taiwan, Micron Memory Taiwan ("MMT"), responsible for manufacturing at least one of Micron's DRAM chips. Chen resigned from MMT in July 2015 and began working at UMC almost immediately. While at UMC, Chen arranged a cooperation agreement between UMC and Fujian Jinhua whereby, with funding from Fujian Jinhua, UMC would transfer DRAM technology to Fujian Jinhua to mass-produce. The technology would be jointly shared by both UMC and Fujian Jinhua. Chen later became the President of Jinhua and was put in charge of its DRAM production facility.While at UMC, Chen recruited numerous MMT employees, including Ho and Wang, to join him at UMC. Prior to leaving MMT, Ho and Wang both stole and brought to UMC several Micron trade secrets related to the design and manufacture of DRAM. Wang downloaded over 900 Micron confidential and proprietary files before he left MMT and stored them on USB external hard drives or in personal cloud storage, from where he could access the technology while working at UMC.An indictment merely alleges that crimes have been committed, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. If convicted, the individual defendants face a maximum sentence of 15 years imprisonment and a $5,000,000 fine for economic espionage charges, and 10 years imprisonment for theft of trade secrets charges. If convicted, each company faces forfeiture and a maximum fine of more than $20 billion. However, any sentence following conviction would be imposed by the court only after consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal statute governing the imposition of a sentence, 18 U.S.C. * 3553.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6502986 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: November 6, 2018End of Document

U.K. and Allies Reveal Global Scale of Chinese Cyber CampaignTargeted News ServiceDecember 20, 2018 Thursday 8:00 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 467 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: LONDON, England BodyThe British Foreign and Commonwealth Office issued the following news release:* * *- The UK government and its allies are holding responsible elements of the Chinese government for an extensive cyber campaignPublished 20 December 2018Along with its allies, the UK has announced that a group known as APT 10 acted on behalf of the Chinese Ministry of State Security to carry out a malicious cyber campaign targeting intellectual property and sensitive commercial data in Europe, Asia and the US.The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) assesses with the highest level of probability that the group widely known as APT 10 is responsible for this sustained cyber campaign focused on large-scale service providers. The group almost certainly continues to target a range of global companies, seeking to gain access to commercial secrets.This campaign shows that elements of the Chinese government are not upholding the commitments China made directly to the UK in a 2015 bilateral agreement. It is also inconsistent with G20 commitments that no country should conduct or support ICT enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential business information.Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt said:"This campaign is one of the most significant and widespread cyber intrusions against the UK and allies uncovered to date, targeting trade secrets and economies around the world."These activities must stop. They go against the commitments made to the UK in 2015, and, as part of the G20, not to conduct or support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property or trade secrets."Our message to governments prepared to enable these activities is clear: together with our allies, we will expose your actions and take other necessary steps to ensure the rule of law is upheld."The UK is committed to upholding the rules-based international order, which underpins the peace, security and prosperity of the whole world. With its allies, the UK is once again demonstrating that the international community will not hesitate to call out state-sponsored cyber campaigns.The government will take forward further engagement with service providers to ensure they have robust protections in place against continuing and emerging cyber threats - it is clear that in some cases basic cyber security measures are still not being taken, and this is not acceptable. In the New Year, there will be a roundtable hosted by the government and NCSC inviting a broad range of senior representatives from suppliers to government, including managed service providers and service integrators. Together the community will discuss the necessary step change that is required in contracting and security controls to tackle cyber threats to government and beyond.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6560442 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: December 21, 2018End of Document

International Federation of Journalists: China's Online Crackdown Continues With Twitter, Weibo and Wechat ShutdownsTargeted News ServiceNovember 19, 2018 Monday 7:50 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 358 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: BRUSSELS, Belgium BodyThe International Federation of Journalists issued the following news release:The Chinese Government's online crackdown has continued with the shutdown of thousands of social media accounts. The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) has voice strong concerns for freedom of expression in China with this latest crackdown by the Government.According to Hong Kong Free Press (HKFP) activists in China have been pressured by police to delete sensitive tweets, and in other instances there have been reports of the authorities gaining access to accounts and shutting them down. HKFP reported that Yaxue Cao, founder of the human rights site, China Change, was referring to the action as a 'silent slaughter'. On November 17, China Change reported that the Twitter account of Chinese activist Wu Gan was suddenly deleted. Wu's account had more than 30,000 posts, and he was jailed in December 2017 for subversion.The latest crackdown comes, despite Twitter being blocked by the 'Great Firewall' in China and uses having to use VPNs to access it.At the same time, the South China Morning Post reported that nearly 10,000 social media accounts had been shut down in just three weeks under a new government campaign. The latest government-led campaign was launched on October 20, and include accounts belonging to 'a popular talk show celebrity, an entertainment blogger who shared film footage, online influencers commenting on social issues and bloggers writing extensively on ethnicity'.As part of the crackdown, the Cyberspace Administration summoned representatives of Weibo and Wechat over their management of the platforms. Both platforms were given 'serious warnings' over their 'irresponsibility and lax management'. The Administration also said that the deleted accounts 'trampled on the dignity of laws and regulations and damaged the ecology of online public opinion'.The IFJ said: "The Chinese Government's crackdown of the online sphere has become an ongoing attack on freedom of expression and speech, and is a blatant attempt by the government to control the public narrative."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6523386 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: November 20, 2018End of Document

Photos show how close Chinese warship came to colliding with US destroyerCNN.comOctober 2, 2018 Tuesday 3:19 AM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICSLength: 563 wordsByline: By Brad Lendon, CNNBodyAerial photos taken by the US Navy show just how close a US Navy ship came to colliding with a Chinese warship that had challenged the US vessel's presence in the South China Sea.The guided-missile destroyer USS Decatur was performing a "freedom of navigation" operation on Sunday, sailing close to Chinese-claimed reefs in the Spratly Islands, when it was approached by a Chinese destroyer, the Lanzhou.The US Navy said in a statement Monday that the two ships came within 45 yards (41 meters) of each other, as the Chinese warship "conducted a series of increasingly aggressive maneuvers accompanied by warnings for the Decatur to depart the area."The two ships could have been seconds away from a collision, said Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain with 12 years at sea who looked at the photos at the request of CNN.Taken by a US Navy aircraft but not released by the US Navy, the four photos were verified for CNN by three US officials. They were published on the gcaptain blog site, which describes itself as an "interactive community of maritime professionals."The images show the Lanzhou approaching the Decatur from behind and to the left of the US ship.In this situation, under international naval law, the US destroyer would have right of way and be required to maintain direction and speed, Schuster said. The onus would be on the Chinese ship to keep safe distance from and maneuver past the US ship.But the Chinese ship turned towards the right as it came close to the Decatur, trying to cut across the US ship's bow and forcing the US captain to perform a "radical maneuver," essentially throwing the 500-foot-long, 8,500-ton warship into reverse, he said."It's like slamming on the brakes and turning to the right to avoid a crash on the road," said Schuster, now a Hawaii Pacific University professor."The Chinese ship certainly violated the rules of the road," Schuster said.A Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman said Tuesday that its warship was simply defending Chinese sovereignty in the Spratlys, where Beijing has built up fortifications on man-made islands that were once small reefs."The Chinese military will resolutely perform its defense duties and continue to take all necessary measures to safeguard our sovereignty and the regional peace and stability," spokesman Wu Qian said.Spiking tensionsSunday's near-collision comes after weeks of friction between Washington and Beijing over a range of issues.Late last week US Secretary of Defense James Mattis pulled out of a planned visit to Beijing later in October, two US officials told CNN.Mattis had originally planned to visit the Chinese capital to meet with senior Chinese officials to discuss security issues. The last-minute cancellation of the unannounced trip has not been publicly confirmed by the Pentagon.Earlier in the week, the Chinese government canceled a port visit to Hong Kong by the USS Wasp, a US Navy amphibious assault ship.Then last Friday, the US Navy released a series of photos showing troops aboard the 40,000-ton Wasp taking part in a live-fire exercise in the South China Sea, firing on inflatable targets with mounted machine guns and sniper rifles.Also last week the US flew B-52 bombers over the South China Sea and East China Sea.But it is the "freedom on navigation" operations like the one the USS Decatur performed on Sunday that seem to spike tensions the most.Load-Date: October 5, 2018End of Document

Huawei's Ken Hu Expresses Confidence in Business and Addresses ChallengesTargeted News ServiceDecember 18, 2018 Tuesday 6:40 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 9301 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: DONGGUAN, China BodyHuawei Technologies issued the following news:Huawei Rotating Chairman Ken Hu held a press conference with leading global media at the company's new campus in Dongguan on Tuesday, December 18. The journalists visited R&#38;D labs showcasing materials and thermal management technologies developed for 5G equipment, as well as an independent cybersecurity lab.Hu delivered strong messages of confidence in Huawei's business growth and prospects, citing the trust of hundreds of network operators, nearly half of the world's Fortune 500 companies, and hundreds of millions of consumers. Huawei's 2018 revenue, he said, was expected to exceed US$100 billion.He also directly addressed recent allegations against Huawei, stating that it is best to let facts speak for themselves, while emphasizing repeatedly that the company's security record was clean. Hu noted that there have been no serious cybersecurity incidents in 30 years.Here are some highlights from the press conference:* On 5G - Huawei has secured 25 commercial contracts, ranking number one among all ICT equipment providers, having already shipped more than 10,000 base stations to markets around the world. Almost all network customers have indicated they want Huawei, which is currently the market leader with the best equipment and will remain so for at least the next 12 to 18 months, for faster and more cost-effective upgrades to 5G. Some security concerns based on the technology for 5G were very legitimate, noted Hu, but able to be clarified or mitigated through collaboration with operators and governments."Rare cases" have arisen where some countries are using 5G issues as an excuse for groundless speculation based on "ideological or geopolitical considerations". Security concerns disingenuously raised as excuses to block market competition would slow adoption of new technology, increase costs for network deployment, and raise prices for consumers. If Huawei were allowed to compete in the US for 5G deployment from 2017 to 2020, around US$20 billion of capital expenditure in wireless infrastructure would be saved, according to some economists.* Cyber security - Security is Huawei's highest priority and it overarches everything. Hu was open to a question about building cyber security evaluation centers in places such as the US and Australia, pointing to similar centers in the UK, Canada, and Germany that are designed to directly identify, address, and mitigate concerns. Huawei has subjected itself to the strictest reviews and screening by regulators and customers, while expressing understanding of legitimate concerns that some stakeholders might have.However, no evidence indicates that Huawei equipment poses a security threat. Regarding often-quoted concerns over Chinese law, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China had formally clarified that no law requires companies to install mandatory backdoors. Huawei remains open to concerns about its openness, transparency, and independence as well as dialogue. Any proof or evidence could be shared with telecom operators, if not to Huawei or the public at large.* Compliance - Some journalists asked about Huawei's CFO, Ms. Meng Wanzhou. Hu said he was unable to comment due to legal processes underway, but he did express that business operations were not being impacted by this event. Executive travel plans were not impacted, and Huawei remains very confident about its trade compliance system, which has been running since 2007. The company has confidence in the fairness and independence of the judicial systems in Canada and the US.Hu described the company's recent achievements as exciting, and recalled his almost 30-year history with Huawei during which its people, culture and management had grown. "This is journey of transformation that has helped us grow up from an unknown vendor to the 5G leader". He also recognized that Huawei still faces challenges, thanking the media for interest in dialogue and appealing to employees, customers, and stakeholders."I'd like to share a saying from Romain Rolland", Hu said in his closing remarks, echoing the words of the celebrated French writer who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1915."There is only one heroism in the world: to see the world as it is, and to love it'. At Huawei, we see what we have encountered, and we still love the work we are doing. Similarly, in Chinese, we have a saying: It means that the road ahead is long and hard, but we will keep moving and reach the destination, because we have already embarked on this journey".See transcript belowOpening remarkKen Hu: "Good afternoon, everyone! Welcome to our new campus. This is our largest campus in the world. We built our new manufacturing center here. We built our training center here, and our R&#38;D center as well. And we have moved many of our employees from Shenzhen to here in Dongguan. What I have learned is that our employees are so excited about this new campus."I believe in the morning you had a good tour of our technology lab and here in the security lab. The next time you visit here, we'll be happy to take you on a small train tour of our very beautiful campus. This is a lakeside campus, which is very nice. I know that the holiday season is very busy for all of you, so thank you very much for taking the time to meet with us today."This year has been so eventful, hasn't it? So I believe you must have many questions for today's conversation. Before we start, I would like to take this opportunity to give you a very quick update on our business progress this year, and then go on to the Q&#38;A session."This year business has been very good for us. We are pretty sure that, by the end of this year, we will achieve more than $100 billion U.S. dollars in total revenue."This is a big milestone in our history. This is the first time our sales revenue has exceeded $100 billion US dollars. For different business groups, we had very satisfying growth as well."For example, in our carrier business, which accounts for the largest part in our total portfolio, we secured more than 25 commercial contracts for 5G. Now we rank number one in terms of commercial 5G contracts. This is the result of our far-leading technological innovation across the whole industry. And we have started to ship 5G equipment to the whole world. Actually, we have already shipped more than 10,000 base stations to different markets around the world."Our enterprise business has seen very good progress as well. We secured more and more contracts with leading global companies. This year more than 200 companies in the Fortune 500 selected Huawei as the vendor for their digital transformation. So this is a big step forward as well."And our consumer business. We all know that our smartphones sales are very good. This year, we had a big increase in our sales revenue and shipments with the successful launch of our flagship smartphones, the P20 and Mate 20. These new smartphones bring some amazing functionality to the market, including high quality cameras and particularly artificial intelligence."So in all three business groups we've had very satisfying growth this year. Particularly in October, for the first time we announced our full-stack, all-scenario artificial intelligence solution."We have been working with artificial intelligence for around ten years, and this year we announced our solution - full- stack, all-scenario. We believe that, with this solution, we will be able to make artificial intelligence eventually become a real GPT - a general purpose technology."We're trying to make it more accessible and more affordable for the whole society. And we hope that, in the coming years, we will launch more exciting chipsets, hardware and software solutions for artificial intelligence to help our customers maximize the benefits of this emerging technology."So this is the exciting growth we have achieved this year. Of course, at the same time, we're facing some challenges. You are all aware of the allegations that have been made against Huawei this year. Despite the efforts in some markets to create fear about Huawei, and to use politics to interfere with industry growth, we are proud to say that our customers continue to trust us and recognize our contribution to the industry."They continue to work with us, innovate with us, and build their networks with our innovative technology. We're so grateful for their support."When it comes to security issues, as an industry, we believe that we need to talk more about the technology and how to improve. When it comes to security allegations, it's best to let the facts speak for themselves. And the fact is: Huawei's record on security is clean. We believe that cyber security is a global issue. It's an industrywide issue and we need to address it together."Moving forward, we will continue investing in technological innovation, in broadband, cloud, artificial intelligence, and smart devices. And we believe that this continuous investment in technological innovation will help us secure solid growth in the telco sector in the coming year with faster deployment of 5G technology. It will help us to be in a stronger position in the enterprise market with digital transformation across different vertical industries. And particularly, it will help us bring more exciting and innovative devices to consumers. We are going to launch our first 5G smartphone, and we can expect a lot from that."This is just a quick brief on our business growth and business progress. I'm very happy to talk more about that today with all of you, so we have enough time to do the Q&#38;A session."Now, I would like to open the floor for questions."Q&#38;A"Joseph Waring, Mobile World Live: Given the allegations and the fear that's being pushed across many governments, what specific actions does Huawei plan to take in the near term or the medium term to alleviate some of that pressure? I know you have your cyber security center in the UK working with the operators there and a number of other similar facilities. Can you talk about that?Ken Hu: "We realize that the industry we're in is undergoing faster technological transition periods. Technologies are becoming increasingly complicated. Networks are becoming more open. As a result of this, we definitely notice the increasing interest and care from network operators and regulators and also the general public about the industry. We think this is just normal."When we look at ourselves, as I mentioned just now, Huawei's business has been growing very fast. Our revenue will exceed 100 billion dollars very soon. We're doing business in 170 countries in the world. About half of the Fortune 500 companies are using Huawei products. The majority of the top telecom operators have deployed Huawei's equipment. Our smartphones are being used by hundreds of millions of consumers worldwide."Given our scale, our size, and our presence, we definitely need to take it very seriously when we look at the concerns or interests expressed by governments, by society, and by the general public."In that context, we are keenly aware that it is simply something we must be doing to have proactive, transparent and constructive dialogues and conversations with the governments, with local communities and with our customers."This is exactly what we have been doing. I can briefly introduce our actions and our plans in this area. Take security, for example. Many people have expressed concerns or interests in this area. For Huawei, we take security as our highest priority and our overarching guideline."In 2011, this positioning of security as our highest priority and overarching guideline was recognized in the form of a board resolution. That was the open letter released by our founder and CEO, Mr. Ren, addressed to the world, showing and demonstrating our serious commitment to security."Following that positioning and the resolution, we have taken very solid steps and measures internally and externally. For example, internally, cyber security guarantee and protection have been built and implemented across our business operations from corporate governance, organizational structure, technology innovation, staff management, and IT systems as well. I believe Sean Yang in the morning may have introduced some of those to you."Externally, when we engage with customers, regulators and the general public, we have been following a strategy or approach that we call "make white whiter" over the last ten- plus years."In other words, we understand the concerns from our customers or regulators. Therefore, we are willing to take additional steps or go the extra mile compared to other peers in our industry."As part of that effort, we have undergone third-party certification of Huawei's hardware, software and our solutions, which has been done by independent 3rd parties."If we look at the results of those certifications, we can clearly see over the past 30 years, Huawei and Huawei's equipment has maintained a very solid and correct record in our industry when it comes to cyber security."We have never had a serious cyber security incident for our equipment."And also even with the most strict review and screening by regulators or our customers, there has never been any evidence showing our equipment poses a security threat."According to a most recent report from CFI, a third party, independent auditor, Huawei's equipment from operational stability and operational reliability point of view, has far exceeded industrial average over the past 3 years."We will be very glad to share this report with you after this interview."We feel very proud about this recognition from customers and the industry."But we definitely will not relax requirements we put on ourselves, because we are keenly aware technology will become more and more complex; networks will become more open. Therefore the requirements or demands on security will just be much higher."Therefore, we will continue to increase our investment on security and security related technologies."In our most recent board meeting, we decided on a companywide transformation program to improve our software engineering capabilities."The company will invest an initial special budget of $2 billion US dollars in the next five years to comprehensively improve our software engineering capabilities so our products will be better prepared for the future world."We believe through these efforts, we will be able to continue to maintain our leading position in our industry when it comes to cyber security. We also hope with such efforts we will continue to maintain our solid cyber security track record."We will continue to step up our efforts in terms of communicating, engaging, and collaborating with governments around the world. We will help governments to understand the track record we have had on cyber security, and we'll also talk with the governments so they also understand the efforts and the actions we have been taking on cyber security."For example, the internal cyber security lab you visited in the morning, that's also the lab we make successful and open to governments and customers around the world, so through the visit and the dialogues they can understand our positioning and what we have been doing. Moving forward, we will more, let's say, localize some of these efforts."For example, ten years ago we set up an independent cyber security evaluation center in the UK. As a result of that, we have put in place a long-term and effective collaboration model with the stakeholders in the UK. We're going to continue to work on that moving forward. We also have a similar arrangement in Canada. Those are the efforts we will continue to work on and strengthen."At the same time, we are and will continue to expand similar engagement with the governments. Last month, I myself was in Bonn, participating in an opening ceremony of a security innovation lab there. This lab is essentially an open platform allowing the German government and also our customers in Germany to conduct testing of Huawei's products around security. Such efforts have won the recognition of the German government."The next step is to launch our security transparency center in Brussels in Q1 next year. That is also part of our longer term plan as well. We will also build and put in place similar open and transparent security management mechanisms in other parts of the world as needed."When it comes to security in short, I would say this is an area where we take it very seriously and we pay a lot of attention to it. We have taken a lot of efforts in this area, and we'll continue to do so having dialogue and engagement with governments around the world."When we look at the concerns from governments of Huawei, I think there's another part of it that we also need to address as well."Huawei is a company that originated from China, and we are not a public company. But that does not mean we cannot achieve the same level of transparency. We have taken a lot of efforts and measures in this area as well."Very early on we announced our ownership structure so that people all know that Huawei is a private company that is owned by its employees."Every year we go through the most strict processes of audit before we launch our annual report, so all stakeholders will know the authenticity, integrity and independence of our business operations."At the same time, given certain specific concerns, we have been communicating with the governments around the world around the independence of Huawei's operations. The fact that we have never taken any requests from any governments to damage the business or networks of our customers or other countries. As I mentioned earlier, for any concern, the best way is to let the fact speak for itself. The fact is that over the last thirty years, there's been no major cyber security incident; there's been no cyber security threat; and there's been no evidence showing that Huawei is damaging cyber security. And we'll continue to take proactive communication engagement and also open collaboration so more and more people will be able to realize this.Yang Yuan, Financial Times: "I have a question about the arrest of Ms. Meng in Canada. It's been reported before by Reuters that Skycom, which is a subsidiary of Huawei, was selling technologies from American companies to Iranian customers. And we've also found that Ms. Meng was a director of Skycom, and Skycom employees have described themselves as employees of Huawei. Can you clarify the relationship with Skycom and Skycom's activities in Iran?Ken Hu: "I know you are definitely very interested in what happened recently. But since, as you might be aware, this is right now under a judicial process, I'm not in the position to provide any information at this point in time. Two points I still want to share with you."First, we are very confident in our trade compliance management system. We started development in 2007, which covers our global businesses across our entire portfolio and the entire Huawei workforce. We believe with such a well-running trade compliance management system, we have the fundamental guarantee of our 100 billion dollars business. We have the guarantee to ensure smooth, efficient, and secure operations of our business and also to reassure our customers around the world."Second, we have confidence in the fairness and independence of the judiciary systems in countries involved in this specific case. We look forward to a just conclusion to this matter."Eamon Barrett, Fortune: So one of the issues that various governments have raised concerning Huawei and the potential security threat is the national intelligence law which was passed last year which would compel any industry or company to cooperate with China's national intelligence work. Now, it's fine to say that Huawei has never been asked by our government to infiltrate or otherwise spy on a network but if the Chinese government would come to Huawei and ask it to, what legal grounds would Huawei have to refuse such a request?Ken Hu: "First, on December 10th, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China in a press conference formally clarified that no law in China requires companies to install mandatory backdoors."Of course, just like the US and Australia, China also has certain legal requirements for counter terrorism or cyber security objectives. China also specially emphasizes that all government institutions or agencies must enforce the law according to the law. There are clear definitions."For Huawei, our approach is to address these issues in strict accordance to the law. In the past, we haven't received any requests to provide improper information. In the future, we will also follow in strict accordance to the law in dealing with similar situations. When we talk about according to the law, the law has clear stipulations around the terms of reference for related agencies.Gao Yuan, Bloomberg: "We know Huawei has appointed an acting CFO after the Sabrina's case. My question is - with the current case, if Sabrina can continue with her responsibilities as corporate CFO and what are the real implications and impacts of this case on Huawei's operations because we have learned from some of Huawei's international employees that if there is no financial guidance of this nature, it will have an impact on their business like procurement.Ken Hu: "Currently, our business operations are not impacted by the case in Canada. Our business operations as a company and operations in the financial system are still business as usual.Ryan Mcmorrow, AFP: "After Meng was arrested in Canada, the Chinese government arrested two Canadians on national security concerns. The Chinese government has said this is not in retaliation, but most independent experts now say it was. Does Huawei have any comments or thoughts on the arrest of these two people?Ken Hu: "No comment on that.Eunice Yoon, CNBC: "Do you think that Huawei will have any significant business in the United States and does it matter to the company for the future?Ken Hu: "Well, US is one of the biggest communications markets in the world and I would definitely not say it doesn't matter to us. However, the reality today makes this very difficult for Huawei to enjoy business growth for reasons I think you all know."As a result of that, our current status of US business, I would say, is very limited business. Of course we still have customers in the United States and we continue to follow our business principle of customer-centricity. We try everything we can to provide the best possible services to them and they are very satisfied with our services."On the other hand, we also noticed that the United States is also in a development period when it comes to the digital infrastructure market."Because Huawei cannot participate in the US market, we also notice that this is a market that is falling short of competition in a very big way."According to some economists, from the period of 2017 to 2020, which we believe is a very important period for 5G deployment, if Huawei could participate in market competition, there would be 20 billion US dollars of savings when it comes to capital expenditure for wireless infrastructure."At the same time, since Huawei cannot participate, HHI - which describes market concentration in certain geographies, in the US - HHI is as high as 2,500, much higher than other markets in the world, which are typically in the range of 1,000."Since the best suppliers and the best technologies cannot be part of the market, I believe from a deployment cost point of view, this will significantly be higher. At the same time, it will substantially delay time-to-market of new technologies."At the same time, the digital infrastructure industry dependencies highly dependent on the global supply chain. In other words, the equipment of any company in our industry relies on the global supply chain for development and manufacturing."At the same time, when it comes to deployment, in most of the cases we can say that digital infrastructure is going to be a multi-vendor environment. It requires collaboration and partnerships with players across the industry."From that point of view, banning a particular company from market competition cannot fundamentally address concerns about cyber security. We believe that, at the end of the day, US markets will need best technologies and best companies to participate in market competition. When that day will come, we don't know. We have patience.Raymond Zhong, New York Times: "We saw earlier this year that ZTE almost went out of business because the US prevented it from using American technology. Obviously Huawei is not in this position. But could you explain to us what the impact could be if Huawei is someday in this position - and is the company taking steps to protect its supply chain from dependence on the US?Ken Hu: "We don't comment on things that have not happened, but I would be very glad to share with you our thoughts and our actions on supply chain and on business continuity management."We all know the ICT industry highly depends on a global supply chain. And Huawei is no exception."Today we have 13,000 suppliers in our supply chain. Companies coming from Japan, US, Europe, China and many other countries in the regions. Take this year for example, our annual procurement spend would be 70 billion dollars."From this point of view, the technology innovations of Huawei are, on the one hand, the outcome of our own efforts. On the other hand, also the close collaboration with 13,000 partners in our global value chain."We also realize that the more globalized the nature of your supply chain is, the more vulnerable it might be. So almost 10 years ago, we started to develop a comprehensive and effective business continuity management system."That management system covers many parts of our business: R&#38;D, procurement, manufacturing, logistics, and also services. Over the past 10 years, with this system in place, we have successfully dealt with quite a number of emergencies."Natural disasters like the tsunami in Japan, the flood in Thailand, the earthquake in Nepal, and also ransomware attacks as well. In order to ensure supply chain continuity, we also have to put a lot of thought when we put together our supply strategy and also when we think about how to ensure the operations of our equipment."Our supply chain strategy, for example. We take a diversified supply strategy. That means we have a multi- sourcing strategy. We look at multiple choices in terms of technology solutions, and we also have multi-location supply networks. At the same time, since we're working together with hundreds of telecom operators in the world, and also we are serving a significant number of enterprise customers, so we look at the full lifecycle support that is needed and build up our stock of spare parts and components to ensure support across the product lifecycle."These are some of the actions and measures we have taken to ensure business continuity. At the same time, we think the continuity of the ICT industry chain is also important. We believe this is a topic, an issue, that the whole industry and international community need to look at."As I mentioned earlier, we have 13,000 suppliers. Our annual procurement this year is $70 billion US dollars. If we look across the entire industry chain, or the companies or the countries involved, they are interdependent."If any link in this global industry chain is obstructed in an unusual way, that would have a major impact on the development of the industry chain and even the economic development of countries involved."Therefore, if we take a bigger look, society as a whole, countries involved and the industry must work together to ensure continuity of this global ICT value chain.Steven Jiang, CNN: "I'm going to have two quick follow ups on things people may have mentioned. One is, I know you cannot comment on the case of Ms. Meng, because it is a legal case, but specifically on the impact. For yourself and other senior executives, what's the impact? Are you limiting or changing your travels, or are you avoiding certain countries, for example? What about the impact on Huawei employee morale?"The other is about the US's potential moves. Because we started to see some moves by governments or operators in the US and its allies like France, the UK, or even Japan, to block the use of Huawei equipment in their core 5G networks. Are you worried about this trend? Do you think that's geopolitical issue no matter what you say or do?Ken Hu: "On your first question: There is no impact on our travel plans. Yesterday, I was still on the plane, at this point in time."Regarding the second question, the latest developments on 5G in different countries. I just came back from Europe yesterday. I want to share with you some of my observations."Before that I would like to correct you a little bit. There is no official decision from either France or Japan saying they would ban Huawei from 5G. What we are seeing right now, instead, is that more and more governments and operators in more and more countries are engaged in very proactive discussions with Huawei with 5G."As I mentioned earlier at the very beginning, Huawei has been awarded 25 commercial contracts on 5G. That number is bigger than that of any competitor in the industry. At the same time, we are in a significantly leading position on 5G no matter when we look at the leadership or maturity of our technologies."You visited some of our labs this morning and I believe you must have seen many cool technologies there."Those are the cool technologies that only Huawei enjoys in our industry. It is because of those technologies that we have been able to build the strong leadership position on 5G that we enjoy today. We have participated in dozens of pre-commercial tests on 5G. From the testing results, Huawei is at least 12 to 18 months ahead from a technical maturity point of view compared to other peers in our industry."This leadership of Huawei has been publically acknowledged by our customers. For example, last month at the Mobile Broadband Forum held in London, the chief architect of British Telecom publicly commented that Huawei is the only true 5G supplier right now and others need to catch up."This significant recognition we have from customers and governments is first attributed to our technological leadership on 5G."Those governments and those customers believe using the best supplier for 5G network deployment would help substantially shorten the time-to-market of this new technology. For example, LG U+ in Korea. They have already launched their 5G services after deploying 5G networks with Huawei equipment."This could help them to enjoy a more competitive cost structure and bring compelling services to consumers. At the same time, we also see concerns of various natures of different countries on 5G. For those concerns, we think most of those are very legitimate concerns that are based on technology. Those are the concerns that we believe could be well clarified and mitigated through our collaboration with telecom operators and through joint engagement and communication with governments. Of course, there are also rare cases, where countries take - what we would say - an unnatural approach."They turn this 5G security concern, which is industry- and technology-related in nature, into groundless speculations targeting specific companies. This is not putting the focus on how to improve and how to protect the technology itself, but ending up with speculations targeting particular companies out of ideological or geopolitical considerations."In very rare cases, certain countries, when it comes to 5G technology selection, took an irresponsible approach, which is not at all based on facts, banning certain companies from market participation."We think decisions like this should be very serious and very professional. There must be evidence or proof to support these decisions. If there is no evidence, I think any decision of this nature would not win the test of time. We believe discussions around 5G security should return to technology discussions and should be based on objective assessment of companies."We think security is first a technology topic. And it is also something that the whole industry needs to come together to address. It should not target specific companies for no substantial ground."Security concerns can only be addressed through technical discussions. Security discussions need to involve all stakeholders. On 5G technology selection, we think any government decision should be serious and professional and what's very important is that there must be proof and evidence."If you have proof and evidence, it should be made public, maybe not to the general public, not to Huawei. But at the very least, it should be made known to telecom operators, because it's telecom operators who are going to buy from Huawei."We think for our industry and for society at large, security challenges will be real for a long time. And these can only be addressed and mitigated through open communication and collaboration. And Huawei is committed to be a part of this process."Rejecting one particular company, especially leading companies, cannot fundamentally address concerns on cyber security. At the same time, it would increase the cost of network deployment; it would delay the adoption of new technologies. And in the end, it would be the consumers who have to pay the heavier bill."Take Australia for example, we have some numbers around it. Without Huawei's participation, the cost for deploying wireless base stations in Australia would be higher by 15% to 40%. And the cost of building up an entire network would be higher by several billion Australian dollars. Even worse, the time for people to adopt and use 5G technology would be delayed.Shunsuke Tabeta, Nikkei: "You talked about the Security Transparency Center as an upcoming initiative taken in Europe. Do you have similar measures in Japan, or Asia, or Australia on security?Ken Hu: "On security, we are very willing to take proactive measures to address and mitigate concerns. This is our principle. Under this principle, we stay open to have proactive dialogue with governments around the world, to understand their concerns and to explore all possible solutions."We have already had many successful cases in countries like the UK, Canada, Germany and France. And definitely the APEC region is not an exception. We've also proactively communicated with regulators in those countries. We'll be looking at their needs and requirements and explore the right solutions to address those recent requirements.Joe McDonald, AP: "Some people suggest that governments such as the US that say Huawei is a security risk really aren't concerned about security but about trade and are trying to stop Huawei from becoming a competitor with American technology companies. First I want to ask, do you think that's the case, that governments are creating this as a competitive issue to stop Huawei?"Second how much do you think this might hurt Huawei's business?"How do you feel about being labelled a security risk?"What do you want to see changes in trade between China and the United States or China and other countries to help you?Ken Hu: "First, labelling Huawei as a security risk. Our opinion is that any conclusion, any speculation should be based on real evidence."Either you have evidence to show that Huawei's solution or Huawei's equipment is not secure."Over the past 30 years, hundreds of telecom operators have used Huawei's equipment. There has been no major cybersecurity incidents. And there has been almost zero Huawei equipment being used in the United States, so what is the evidence here to say that Huawei is not secure?"Or either you say there are problems with Huawei's behavior, yet again, over the past 30 years we have become a $100-billion-dollar company with business in 170 countries. There's no evidence to show Huawei has problems with our behavior."So the question I want to ask is for a company with a 100 billion dollars in revenue, with businesses in 170 countries, with the fact that we've provided leading products to most telecom operators around the world, we serve hundreds of Fortune 500 companies, we also serve hundreds of millions of consumers around the world - you say Huawei is a cybersecurity risk without any proof. On what grounds?"You also talked about competition."If you look at advancement in human society from a technology and innovation point of view, a very big driver is the benign competition between different industries and between different companies."With absence of competition consumers cannot enjoy better technologies in a shorter period of time."We also believe leadership can only be gained through competition."Locking competitors out of the field cannot make yourself more excellent."Therefore we believe any concern, any allegation or suspicion on security about Huawei, should be based on factual evidence. Without factual evidence we don't accept and we oppose those allegations."For 5G technology that is about to be deployed, Huawei has the strongest leadership position in this area."Leading companies need to be respected and encouraged. Because we bring benign competition and drive the healthy development of the industry. And in the end the entire society will benefit.Dan Strumpf, Wall Street Journal: "As you know much of the recent efforts against Huawei over the last year in many western ally countries around the world have been led by the United States and by the United States security establishment and it has been well-reported this is a coordinated effort. It's been the 6 years since the American government first raised its security concerns about Huawei. And the company finds itself in this position now 6 years later defending itself against the very same allegations. I am just wondering if you believe, if Huawei believes that it could have done anything differently over the last 6 years to communicate its position primarily to the United States but to governments that find it mistrustful, in particular governments that used to welcome Huawei but now find themselves less willing to accept its equipment as 5G rollout begins. Thank you.Ken Hu: "Over the last couple of years, Huawei has taken many measures to engage in proactive communication with governments. On top of communication, we also established cooperation mechanisms on security with many national governments, including the governments of the UK, Canada, Germany, and France. We highly appreciate the open and pragmatic approach those governments have demonstrated in these engagements. And that progress has encouraged Huawei to do even better in those areas. This is the strategy and approach that Huawei will continue to follow."At the same time, as I mentioned at the very beginning, we realize that as we grow bigger it is also part of our responsibility to proactively communicate and collaborate with the governments around the world. Because naturally, big companies draw more attention and also more concerns. Therefore, as we grow bigger, we will continue to embrace openness and transparency, communicating with all these stakeholders to address and mitigate their concerns."Tony Chan, Commsday: I have a couple of questions specific to Australia. I just want to know the numbers you've quoted about the cost of rolling out base stations and wireless network regarding the cost of rolling that without Huawei that the numbers you gave before. Was that a Huawei study or a third-party research? And the other thing is obviously Huawei continues to engage the Australian government regarding the recent policy of banning Huawei from bidding for 5G. I just want to know if they actually express any detailed requirements for Huawei. Like, is there something that Huawei can do to actually qualify? Or is it just a blanket ban without particular details, technical details.Ken Hu: "On the first question, the numbers that I shared with you earlier came from a third-party report. The name of the company is Frontier Economics. The title of that report is The Value of Competition on 5G Network Deployment. If you are interested, we can provide this report to all of you."And then to your second question. It's a pity that we haven 't got any clear message from the Australian government, saying what exactly the problem is, and what is the evidence for them to come to their conclusion. And we did not have the opportunity to clarify this doubt with the Australian government."Clay Chandler, Fortune: Just a follow-up on Dan's question. You've shown us the wonderful testing and evaluation center here and described how the processes are working for countries like UK. I wonder if in the United States and Australia for example, you see any value in making similar investments to create centers that can show people how these technologies can be verified and demonstrate your security record in a concrete way in particular markets that's been especially problematic.Ken Hu: "I would say, why not? Because if we look at the cyber security center we built in the UK, it's for the UK. And we have a similar center in Canada to address their concerns. We have this new security center in Germany to serve the German market. As I mentioned earlier, we should have communications with government to fully understand their concerns. And also take agreed actions to address and mitigate those concerns."Once people raise concerns about security, if they want to address and resolve the concerns. I would say definitely we will be able to find the right solution."But for security concerns raised as an excuse to block good companies from market participation, without hoping to truly address these concerns, I would say the results would be very different. Take 5G, for example. If security concerns are raised as an excuse to block market competition, the result would be slower adoption of the new technology, much higher cost of network deployment, and consumers not being able to enjoy good technology, good services in a timely way. And yet, they will still have to pay more for those services."And from a security point of view, this approach would not help to truly address and resolve the concerns around cybersecurity, given the fact that the ICT value chain is global in nature. If there are concerns saying Huawei's equipment is made in China, then if you look at all the companies along the value chain of ICT, you can hardly find even one company where they say none of my products or components are produced in China."We would urge all players to get rid of these ideological or geopolitical considerations, and return the discussion to security and to technology. I also call for all players to come together to identify the real risks, and to find the right solutions.Sijia Jiang, Reuters: "I want to ask for more details on the two-billion dollar security overhaul. Can you please give some more information on how exactly you arrive at this number? How you will spend the money in which market, and why now? Is it in response to the July report from CSEC that you decided to address some of the UK concerns? But some of the issues had actually been raised as early as 2015. So why does this take so long for you to take any action, and why now?Ken Hu: "The two-billion dollar five-year program on software engineering improvement is part of Huawei's IPD transformation. This year, the company decided to start what we call IPD 2.0 program. IPD refers to "integrated product development." This software engineering improvement program is part of that overall effort."More than 10 years ago, we started this transformation process by introducing integrated product development for technology and innovation. That's what we call IPD 1.0. And through our efforts over the last 10+ years, and with the support of these restructured processes, we are able to deliver reliable, high quality and innovative products."Then we started IPD 2.0 with a renewed understanding about future technology evolution, future networking environments, and what customers and society expect from technology at large. From a technical point of view, as we say it, the future technical landscape will become more complicated. From a network point of view, the future network environment will be more open, connecting not just people but also things. From a social point of view, digital technology will become increasingly important and an integral part of people's lives, having implications for everyone in the way they work and live. Naturally, as a result of this, what people expect from technology is not just technical leadership and quality. Security will become a basic demand and requirement."We foresee in the not long future down the road, the trustworthiness and security of technology will become the most fundamental and basic requirement for any given technology."That's how we envision the future, then we will start from there and work backwards. The trustworthiness of a technology or a product can not entirely rely on testing efforts at the very end of development processes; rather, it has to start from the early design phase. As people often say, a good product is not made through testing but through design and development."Similarly, we believe trustworthy and secure products of the future will firstly rely on design. As a part of the IPD 2.0 transformation, the trustworthiness and security of the products is a very important objective that we will be working on. At the same time, we think software will be more and more important in future products. Therefore, software engineering will play a more important role to ensure the trustworthiness and security of future products."You are right when you talked about the July report from the Oversight Board of the UK. While they acknowledged the track records of Huawei's products from a security point of view, they also reminded us that Huawei needs to improve its software engineering capabilities and practices."This is help from the UK government and we feel very appreciative about it. Therefore, as part of the overall IPD 2.0 transformation, we include software engineering capabilities as a very important component. In terms of how we arrived at this number [US$2 billion], it is based on our technology mix and also based on our own cost estimations."In the recent several months, we have been looking at this software engineering improvement as part of our overall IPD 2.0 transformation and we are working on our implementation plans for the future. We are quite confident about this transformation."Huawei is a big company. It's not that easy for us to make a decision, especially a big decision. But whenever we've made a decision, Huawei has never failed. We are committed to see to it that we deliver the results on the things that we have decided to do. More importantly, we think this transformation and also all these improvement efforts are important for us to remain confident for our longer-term future and also to maintain the confidence of governments, customers, and partners around the world on Huawei.Sijia Jiang, Reuters: "Whether Huawei would recruit new people or open new labs?Ken Hu: "This investment will cover a lot of areas, including organization and people. For example, we will bring on board more people, especially talented people in software security. We will also improve our facilities at the labs. We will also revisit and improve our processes. At the same time, as part of this effort, we also need to change the mindsets of tens of thousands of our R&#38;D engineers, so that they know security and trustworthiness is part of the important commitment we make to our customers.Edwin Chan, Bloomberg: "I think my colleague has asked this already, but I'm gonna ask a lot more specifically. So we know a lot of carriers are considering or have already decided to rip out Huawei equipment or steer clear of Huawei equipment for 5G. So, specifically, is Huawei confident of sustaining its growth? I know you said your revenue is gonna surpass 100 billion US dollars this year. But are you confident in maintaining your growth rate given the actions that I just described? And, then also, just more philosophically, I think you would agree that Huawei is at a very critical juncture in its history. You know, you are just on the cusp of becoming a 5G power. And then this happened. So, I understand that in some ways it's a technical issue. There are also many who would argue that Huawei is already technologically superior in 5G. But I think the greater concern is more a motivational issue or an issue of your independence. How do you address that?Ken Hu: "We are not seeing as pessimistic a picture as was described just now. We didn't see operators saying they want to swap out Huawei equipment or they want to stay clear from Huawei. On the contrary, out of the hundreds of operators we work with in the world, almost all of them are saying they want to work with Huawei, using Huawei equipment for their 5G networks, because they know we are the best. Only by using the best equipment can they build up their 5G networks faster and can they build up their 5G networks in a more cost-competitive way."It's like a race. There are several runners on the field and now we are in the leading position. And I think leading runners should have every reason to be confident about the future. And we are confident that we will be the first one to hit the line."And you also talked about independence. And I think the most convincing way is to let the facts speak. And over the last 30 years we have been providing services to telecommunications industry and our track records in all different aspects have proven our independence."I think it's not necessary to always dwell on fear or speculations without any facts. Having said that, it definitely does not mean we don't value other voices or concerns around Huawei's openness, transparency, and independence."Therefore in the past and in the future we will continue to adopt a transparent approach in proactively communicating with all stakeholders on all of their legitimate concerns, by providing more information that they need.Yang Yuan, Financial Times: "You mentioned there were geopolitical concerns rather than real technical concerns. Underlying some governments' concerns of 5G safety in Huawei, you mentioned this in the context of the US. But do you think the same geopolitical concerns are also motivating countries, Japan, or more recently the Czech Republic, or even BT in its vision strip Huawei equipment out of its core network? Would you say these countries are also being politically influenced perhaps by US political concerns? Or do you think those countries concerns are coming from genuine technical concerns? And to ask a more specific question on that point, the UK's oversight board, the FCC we just discussed concluded in July that Huawei's safety standards were below industry standards. Do you think this was a technical finding or do you think it was motivated by politics as well? And it was a technical finding then why were you not prepared for it?Ken Hu: "Let me first respond on the BT issue. We are working with BT for over 10 years. We are very good partners to each other. We have provided a large number of equipment, both fixed line and wireless to BT."From the very beginning of the Huawei-BT collaboration we had very thorough discussions around the whole strategy before network deployment and specifically where to introduce Huawei equipment into BT's networks."Regarding 5G technology, BT fully recognized Huawei's leadership as exemplified by the chief architect's remarks, that Huawei is the only one, the only true 5G supplier now in the market. Therefore it is definitely not the case that BT out of technical pressure decides to swap out Huawei's core equipment.'All of our collaboration with BT will follow this pre-agreed network deployment strategy, between Huawei and BT."This year's OB report included the areas where Huawei needs to improve on the technical capability side. We attached great importance to this, and value the viewpoints and perspectives in this report.'On the one hand we have very active discussions with UK operators and also regulators to study and explore our action plans to improve based on those findings."At the same time, we have also started our internal actions. And I would say over the last couple of months and less than half a year, the progress across all different dimensions has been quite encouraging.Eunice Yoon, CNBC: "President Trump has shown that he enjoys engaging directly with executives and we have seen that with Jack Ma, for example. Have you considered or any executive at Huawei, visiting the White House? Or if invited would you consider going?Ken Hu: "We have not received such invitation yet and we don't have such plans.Closing remarkKen Hu: "Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you very much for this long interview and conversation, which is very helpful for me to understand different perspectives from the media community. And now I would like to do a quick summary before we end this session.'So as we discussed today, over the past 30 years, we believe it is the hard work and dedication of every Huawei staff that has made today's Huawei. And we also appreciate the trust and support from our customers, from our partners, and also from many, many governments around the word."I joined Huawei in 1990, almost 30 years ago, so I have had the honor to witness almost the whole process. From my perspective, over the past 30 years, this journey of transformation for Huawei across many, many aspects - in terms of culture, in terms of the management of our people. This is journey of transformation that has helped us grow up from an unknown vendor to the 5G leader. And actually today, our 5G product solutions are in the leading position ahead of our industry peers."So we appreciate the recognition from society. We appreciate the dedication from our employees. And we believe that industry leaders should be respected, because we bring healthy competition and we enable the development of technology and our society. As we discussed today, upcoming 5G technology will create huge opportunities and benefits for society. It will tremendously change many people's lives and the future of many industries, and we believe it highly relies on a global supply chain."Talking about the security, in the past 30 years we have also witnessed the proven track record of Huawei's product security. There isn't any evidence that Huawei poses a threat to national security to any country. We will always welcome any open dialogue with anyone who has legitimate concerns. But for any ungrounded allegations, we will firmly defend ourselves, and we won't allow our reputation to be tarnished."At last, I'd like to share a saying from Romain Rolland. "There is only one heroism in the world: to see the world as it is, and to love it." At Huawei, we see what we have encountered and we still love the work we are doing. Similarly, in Chinese, we have a saying."It means that the road ahead is long and hard, but we will keep moving and reach the destination, because we have already embarked on this journey. So once again, thank you very much for your time with us today. I really appreciate the wonderful conversation with all of you guys. And at last I would like to wish all of you an early Merry Christmas and Happy New Year. Thank you."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6559144 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: December 20, 2018End of Document

The volume of construction output is expected to rise by 85% to reach $15.5 trillion by 2030, as per Institution of Civil Engineers (United Kingdom).Molded plastics are used in manufacturing many products used in construction projects such as pipe and fittings, doors, windows and others. Rising population across the globe coupled with rising urbanization is boosting construction activities. As per The United Nations Environment Programme (Kenya), a department of United Nations (United States), global building floor area is expected to reach 315.4 billion m2 by 2030 and 415 billion m2 in 2050 from 223.4 billion m2 in 2015.As per United Nations (U.S.), in 2018, 55% of global population lives in urban areas in 2018 and the number is expected to increase to 68% by 2050; adding 2.5 billion new individuals in urban areas. Growing economies have escalated their construction activities to higher scale especially developing countries to enhance their infrastructure and also offering basic standards to their people.For instance, as per Ministry of China, Chinese government is expected to add 42 new airports over the period of 2016-2020. Moreover, Government of India is spending huge capital on developing infrastructure of the country and have planned to invest $30.02 billion on 100 smart cities by 2022.Key Topics Covered:1.

As China clamps down, internet users find it harder to scale 'Great Firewall'; Beijing has moved to restrict the availability of virtual private networks, or VPNs, amid an overarching strengthening of Communist Party control under President Xi Jinping.The Christian Science MonitorOctober 12, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 Christian Science Publishing Society All Rights ReservedSection: WorldLength: 1359 wordsByline: Ann Scott Tyson CorrespondentBodyA chill wind whips down the walkways on the campus of Peking University, the selective academy that attracts China's best and brightest students. Strolling past the stone steps and upturned roof of the university library, a law student vents about how China's ruling Communist Party is tightening controls on information."It's harder this year than last year" to bypass the firewall that government censors use to block thousands of blacklisted websites, says the student. (Her name, like others in this story, has been omitted for privacy.) "A lot of VPNs [virtual private networks] are prohibited now," she says, referring to the technology many students use to fanqiang, or "jump the wall."Jumping the wall has grown more difficult under President Xi Jinping, amid an overarching strengthening of Party control. Over the past year, Beijing has moved to restrict the availability of VPNs, including by prosecuting Chinese businesspeople who sell VPN software. This week, a Shanghai court gave a Chinese software developer a three-year suspended sentence for operating a website selling VPN services in China.The "Great Firewall," China's digital censorship technology, summons up images of an impenetrable fortress. The firewall blocks foreign news, search engines, and social media, creating a buffer against information that goes against the party line. In reality, that wall has had significant gaps, largely thanks to VPNs. Today's nationwide crackdown represents an attempt to close one of the biggest remaining loopholes through which ordinary Chinese can gain access to the world of unfettered information."Internet media should spread positive information, uphold the correct political direction, and guide public opinion toward the right direction," the state-run Xinhua news service reported in April, summarizing the instructions of Mr. Xi, who "stressed the centralized, unified leadership of the Party over cybersecurity."China's dogged pursuit of online censorship challenges the belief that a digitally connected society will inevitably be a freer one - and sets an example for other nondemocratic regimes, experts say."China's censorship system has become the model for many authoritarian regimes: evidence exists that others are trying to emulate it," political scientist Margaret Roberts writes in "Censored: Distraction and Diversion inside China's Great Firewall." In the era of digital media, China's manipulation of public information also raises issues relevant for democracies, Professor Roberts argues, such as the need for corporate transparency about the algorithms behind online searches.In Beijing's northwestern Haidian District, home to most of the city's universities and historically a center of intellectual ferment and debate, students say they are feeling the impact of the crackdown. While all the students interviewed say they can still skirt the censorship wall, they agreed it is growing more difficult."The VPNs are not stable. I often have to change from many kinds of VPN to get access now," says a history student from Peking University, taking a break from studies in a café. "It's a very serious problem. In our country, those in power limit the information that the society can have." Eyes on 800 millionChina already has the world's largest and most sophisticated censorship apparatus, reaching far beyond banning and dictating content at traditional state-run media such as newspapers and television stations. The government employs thousands of censors to monitor, filter, and delete posts it deems unfavorable on social media, while fabricating an estimated hundreds of millions of pro-government propaganda posts each year, according to experts. Meanwhile, the firewall blocks thousands of websites including Google services, foreign news outlets, and social media such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.Yet the sheer scope of online activity by China's population - currently with some 800 million internet users, according to the China Internet Network Information Center - makes this a daunting task.Indeed, experts say China's censorship regime has operated less like an impervious wall than a seepy, complex ecosystem, with the government applying varied pressure depending on the size and nature of the leaks."In China, censorship is porous and penetrable," says Roberts, an associate professor of political science at the University of California, San Diego.Chinese with the time, money, and motivation have still been able to obtain VPNs to jump the firewall. Only a small percentage do, and they tend to be younger, wealthier, and better educated, and to live in cities along China's coast, Roberts says.Taking a two-pronged approach, the government assumes most Chinese are impatient and indifferent to sensitive topics, and so uses indirect methods to nudge people away. These include throttling websites to make them load slowly, censoring keywords, burying search results, and distracting citizens with propaganda posts. In contrast, authorities generally reserve the harshest censorship and fear tactics - including detention and prison - for a relatively small group of political and social activists, such as human rights lawyers, outspoken bloggers, and journalists.Cracks in the systemStill, the strategy has risks. Popular indifference can evaporate during a crisis, causing a censorship system based on apathy to fail when the government needs it most, research shows.When pro-democracy demonstrations erupted in Hong Kong in 2014 over electoral system interference by Beijing, for instance, China's censors worried the protests would spread to the mainland, and blocked the social networking service Instagram. That backfired immediately, inspiring millions of Chinese users to obtain VPNs, join censored websites such as Twitter and Facebook, and follow news about the Hong Kong protests.More recently, when students from several universities in China rallied behind a group of factory workers seeking to unionize in China's southern city of Shenzhen this summer, censors were unable to stop the word from spreading."It takes time for the government to delete information from Weibo, so by then many people already know about it," says a physics student, wearing a maroon and white Peking University letter jacket. Weibo, a popular Chinese social media platform, requires users to register their real names, and posts with sensitive content are blocked or deleted.Students are not the only ones concerned about heightening restrictions on information access, according to interviews with several Beijing workers and shopkeepers."There are a lot of ordinary people who are curious to see China from the outside. They want to jump the wall," says the owner of a dress shop near Beijing's main downtown train station. Ordinary citizens are well aware of the censorship, she says."If you post anything sensitive on the web, you will be shut down. Your WeChat number will be blocked," she says, referring to a popular Chinese messaging app. "It has happened to my friends."Foreign businesses rely extensively on VPNs for their operations, but so do some Chinese firms. Chinese social media companies sometimes ignore censorship policies that hurt their bottom lines or make them less competitive, preferring to incur fines, experts say."Market competition can lead media companies to push back against state directives," Blake Miller, a postdoctoral fellow at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire who studies Chinese politics, writes in a working paper. In a study using leaked data, Dr. Miller found that Weibo disobeyed about 1 out of 6 government directives, motivated by the company's concern about alienating customers by censoring more strictly than its Chinese social media competitor, Tencent.All this suggests that the government's bid to strengthen censorship will face ongoing resistance.For some of China's most talented students, opposition could take the form of leaving the country."I don't like the world that the government builds for us, one that decides what we see and what we believe," says a Russian language student. After graduation, he plans to head to Moscow.Load-Date: October 12, 2018End of Document

China calls US ambassador as protestCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 10, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 356 wordsBody Beijing CHINA CALLED the US ambassador to Beijing for his uneasiness over the detention in Canada of the director of Bail Bonds and daughter of the owner of the Huawei electronic giant, Meng Wanzhou.  The official Xinhua news agency said that Deputy Foreign Minister Le Yucheng "presented solemn demonstrations and strong protests" to Ambassador Terry Branstad.  Meng, who is allegedly suspected of trying to evade Iran's trade restrictions, was detained on December 1 while changing planes in Vancouver, Canada.  Xinhua's information quotes Le, who called Meng's detention "extremely atrocious" and demanded that the United States suspend the arrest warrant. He called on the United States to "immediately correct its wrong actions" and said that the Chinese government will take measures based on the actions taken by the United States.  They summon Canadian  The measure on Sunday came a day after the call made by the Chinese government to the Canadian ambassador in Beijing, John McCallum, who told him that there will be "serious consequences" if the Huawei official is not released.  The Canadian province of British Columbia said in a statement that it canceled a trade mission to China due to the detention of Meng. The announcement came amid fears that China could stop Canadians in retaliation.  Huawei is the world's largest provider of network equipment for telephone and Internet companies and has been a concern for the United States because of its links with the Chinese government.  The United States has pressured European countries and other allies to limit the use of their technology, warning that they could be targets of espionage and hacking.  The arrest of Meng threatens to increase trade tensions between the United States and China and has already affected stock markets worldwide. However, the US Trade Representative, Robert Lighthizer, speaking on CBS's Face the Nation, minimized the impact of the arrest on trade negotiations between the two countries.  Roland Paris, former foreign policy adviser to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, said Chinese pressure on the Canadian government would not work. Load-Date: December 10, 2018End of Document

China Says US And Britain Cybertheft Claims Pulled "Out Of Thin Air"Live Briefs PRO Global MarketsDecember 21, 2018 Friday 1:40 AM ESTCopyright 2018 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 447 wordsBody China on Friday denied US and British accusations that it has conducted cybertheft on a massive scale, saying they are a "deliberate defamation" pulled "out of thin air"."The Chinese government has never participated in or supported anyone in any way in stealing trade secrets," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said.Hua said the US accusations that a Chinese hacking operation dating back to 2006 targeted dozens of businesses and government agencies are "very bad in nature". She said China has lodged a formal protest with the US over the claims.China urged the US "to immediately correct its wrong practices and stop smearing the Chinese side on cybersecurity issues", Hua said.US and British officials said Thursday that businesses and government agencies in the US, Britain and at least 10 other countries were the victims of a massive data theft carried out by state-sponsored Chinese hackers.The hackers stole business secrets, intellectual property and private person data, US Justice Department officials said, likening the operation to the theft of the keyring belonging to the custodian of a large building, which allowed the hackers to snoop the occupants' computers undetected.US Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said the hackers turned the material they stole over to China's intelligence service, giving it access to intellectual property and other sensitive business information. "This is outright cheating and theft," Rosenstein said at a news conference in Washington as a formal indictment naming two Chinese nationals was made public.The cybertheft operation they allegedly worked for is part of China's ultimate plan to replace the US as the world's leading superpower, he said.Named in the indictment are Zhu Hua and Zhang Shilong, alleged members of a hacking group known as Advanced Persistent Threat 10 (APT10). The company behind the operation is identified as Huaying Haitai in Tianjin, China. It allegedly acted in association with the Chinese Ministry of State Security's Tianjin State Security Bureau, according to a Justice Department news release.The UK Foreign Office said the hacking group acted on behalf of China's state security agency to conduct a "sustained cyber campaign focused on large-scale service providers."It said Britain and its allies believe the group is continuing to target global companies, in "one of the most significant and widespread cyber intrusions against the UK and allies uncovered to date."The 10 other countries where the hackers operated are Brazil, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, India, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.By Simina Mistreanu and Gretel Johnston, dpaLoad-Date: December 22, 2018End of Document

U.S. will charge Chinese hackers with widespread attacks on tech service providersPolitico.comDecember 7, 2018 Friday 9:39 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 479 wordsByline: egeller@politico.com,  (Eric Geller)BodyThe Justice Department is preparing to charge Chinese government hackers with a broad campaign of cyberattacks against major technology services firms, according to two sources familiar with the matter.The charges come as the Trump administration, locked in a trade war with Beijing, alleges that China has violated a 2015 agreement against stealing U.S. businesses' intellectual property. Further heightening tensions, the U.S. is seeking to extradite from Canada an executive of the Chinese telecom giant Huawei - long considered by U.S. intelligence agencies  to be a facilitator of Beijing's digital espionage - for allegedly violating sanctions on Iran.Chinese intelligence services have spent years trying to hack the managed service providers that remotely administer IT systems for large companies, according to warnings from the Department of Homeland Security and PwC. Access to these providers' systems would give the hackers a jumping-off point into the databases of their primary targets, exposing vast troves of sensitive corporate data.Cybersecurity researchers have linked the Chinese activity to a state-backed group dubbed APT 10 and Cloud Hopper.The charges related to the hacking of managed service providers, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, are only some of the prosecutions that U.S. officials are considering, according to a source familiar with the matter."There are a number of charges being contemplated for hacks directed at a number of industries," said the source, who requested anonymity to discuss ongoing investigations. The IT providers "are just one lucky sub-group."The Justice Department declined to comment.The Journal reported that the charges over the service provider hacks were delayed out of concern that "they could disrupt proceedings" at the G-20 summit in Argentina last week, during which President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping committed to "negotiations on structural changes with respect to ... cyber intrusions and cyber theft."The charges are the latest example of a broad pressure campaign against Beijing over its theft of U.S. trade secrets. At DOJ, a new "China Initiative" will prioritize Chinese IP theft cases, including government-backed hacking. On Oct. 30, the U.S. indicted Chinese intelligence officers and their hired hackers for trying to steal a wide range of intellectual property, including plans for a jet engine.In March, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative released a detailed report on China's actions, including its routine use of "cyber intrusions into U.S. commercial networks targeting confidential business information."Axios reported in September that the White House has been directing an "administration-wide" campaign against China, with a focus on its malicious cyber activity, to shift the focus away from Russia.Article originally published on POLITICO MagazineLoad-Date: December 8, 2018End of Document

XTransfer closes a $10 million series A round of financing led by China Merchants Group with participation from 01VC, Yunqi Partners and Gaorong Capital; XTransfer provides offshore financing solutions for China's SME through its global financial network. The company offers services such as global collection, payments, foreign exchange and wealth management.PR NewswireOctober 23, 2018 Tuesday 10:12 PM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1558 wordsDateline: SHANGHAI, Oct. 23, 2018 BodyPR NewswireXTransfer, a cross-border financial technology company dedicated to serving foreign trade B2B enterprises today announces it has secured a $10 million series A round of financing led by China Merchants Group with participation from 01VC, Yunqi Partners and Gaorong Capital. It is reported that the financing will be used for expansion by XTransfer of its international financial network, application for financial license and market promotion.Founded in May 2017 and headquartered in Shanghai, XTransfer has offices in Hong Kong, U.K., Canada, Japan and the U.S. The company provides offshore financing solutions for China's small and medium importers and exporters through its global capital network, offering services such as global collection, payments, foreign exchange and wealth management.China is currently the world's largest exporting nation, and the second largest importing nation. According to XTransfer founder Bill Deng, the Chinese government plans to additionally import USD 500 million to USD 1 billion of goods within the next five to ten years, the majority of which will be for local consumption to meet "people's desire for a happy life", a move which is in keeping with the businesses of small and medium enterprises. Thus, small and medium enterprises will in the future become a main force in cross-border import and export trade.Nevertheless, enterprises in cross-border trades often face problems with respect to global collections, payment and foreign exchange. Large enterprises are capable of setting out dedicated teams to handle global funding by developing a complex system to link with banks. Small and medium enterprises in contrast, are beginning to find it difficult to open offshore bank accounts, not least because of anti-money laundering measures. Several banks in China with offshore account capabilities have begun to tighten their policies since the second half of 2014. For example, Hong Kong-based banks such as HSBC and Hang Seng Bank have since 2015 raised their bar for offshore account-opening, which has resulted in opening of accounts difficult for many people involved in foreign trade. Then in the second half of 2016, banks began to urge Chinese enterprises to close their offshore bank accounts. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority even explicitly stated in a special report on its website dated February 8, 2018 about the difficulty of opening offshore bank accounts in Hong Kong. An individual/entity who fails to open an account would have to wait for half a year or longer for a second attempt. This problem is compounded by the fact that large local and foreign banks refuse, out of consideration on return and risk, to serve small and medium enterprises which often yield low returns but present a high risk to the bank.To tackle this problem, XTransfer partners with DBS Hong Kong and launches virtual sub-accounts with functions that are almost identical with those of traditional offshore bank accounts - it is akin to rendering the bank's counter work on-line. Enterprises in Mainland China and Hong Kong may open such an account by submitting their basic information to XTransfer's risk control team for verification. Furthermore, there are no charges for account-opening. Such offshore bank accounts are multi-currency accounts - they support up to 14 major currencies, with more currencies being added.Unlike accounts in traditional banks, offshore accounts with XTransfer are free of maintenance fees, annual fees or even account-entry fee. They can also be opened quickly - many within 24 hours of submitting a completed application to open an offshore account with XTransfer.XTransfer also faces money laundering risk. To counter this risk, Bill Deng reveals that it uses technology to verify the identity of persons having actual control over the enterprise, as well as identify the enterprise's structural data and logistics information.Cross-border businesses often involve currency exchange. As 85% of China's foreign trades are with non-U.S. regions, such trades would require exchanging currencies on couple of occasions. For this XTransfer has launched a product called "XForward", allowing the buyer to give price quotation in his home currency. This has allowed emerging markets to be accessible. Buyers from non-US Dollar regions would not have to worry about exchange rate fluctuations as they only need to quote their prices in local currencies. This not only accelerates the negotiation process but also eliminates foreign exchange cost of buyers. XForward could also help buyers to lock in an exchange rate to avoid significant exchange rate fluctuations."First of all, we acquire users through providing free, rapid establishment of offshore accounts for foreign trade B2B enterprises. We are then able to offer a series of global wealth management activities and services including collection, payments and foreign currency exchange. Our aim is to enable small and medium foreign trade enterprises to enjoy, through standardized, electronic and data-enabled products, cross-border financial services that previously only large global enterprises would enjoy," said Bill Deng to iHeima.It is understood that XTransfer is currently building an open platform for financial data related to international trade. Using end-to-end trade data, it aims to provide grass-root level financial infrastructure such as microfinance for financial institutions.When asked about competitive barrier, Bill Deng took the view that in today's business environment, for someone to gain customers' trust, one must let customers feel that every aspect of a product has been meticulously crafted. It is just like entering a "bank's lobby" which is impeccably furnished to give customers increased confidence. As long as one continues to increase value-added services and supplies products according to customers' needs while also providing professional services, one will ultimately gain customers' trust. Customers will tell them how to expand customer base by meeting their needs before developing new products. All they need is to then use their technology and products to accomplish this objective. This is a virtuous cycle.At present XTransfer serves more than 10,000 customers. Early in October the company also obtained a payment license in the U.K. on which it would conduct a round of promotion and advertisements at Canton Fair and in subways.As for the future Bill Deng said that once XTransfer is able to penetrate the Chinese market, the same set of financial services solutions can also be used to serve small and medium enterprises in the Philippines, South Korea and Taiwan region which require offshore financial services.In terms of the company's management team, all five of XTransfer's founders are from Ant Financial and Alibaba. They have seen within the Alibaba system the enormous success of One Touch which provides payment and financial services to small and medium foreign trade enterprises, despite the fact that it serves customers that make up less than 1% of the market. They also saw how innovative European fintech companies like TransferMate which focused on B2B cross-border financial services were expanding rapidly and attempting to open up the Chinese market. They therefore decided to leave Ant Financial to found XTransfer.XTransfer CEO Bill Deng graduated from Fudan University before working for three years in the Beijing, Singapore and Shanghai offices of VISA. In 2010 he joined Alipay (he was in Alipay's International Operations Department in 2014, responsible for retail sales collections of Chinese vendors; in 2016 he was responsible for Alipay's cross-border remittance operations). He resigned from Alipay in April 2017 to become an entrepreneur.The company's CRO Alice Yao graduated from Zhejiang University and has worked in American consulting firm Opera as well as PayPal under its Global Risk Management Department (covering payment risk, compliance and money laundering risk). In 2014 she joined Ant Financial, and was in charge of its Commercial Intelligence Department in 2016.CMO Leon Deng was among the first batch of business development staff for PayPal. From 2011 to 2016 he served at Ant Financial's International Business Department where he was in charge of development of e-commerce exporters' retail collections and local e-commerce importers. In 2016 he worked in Aliyun where he was responsible for business development of solutions for the medical industry.CPO/CSO K2 Deng joined Alibaba in 2004 and held a number of positions. He was regional manager for B2B China vendors. In 2014 he was at Alipay's International Business Department where he was responsible for external vendors. In 2016 he was responsible for Aliyun's international operations for corporate application. CTO Liu Yanfang worked in Alibaba's B2B operations where he was in charge of payment and financial technology; he set up Alibaba's payment and financial platform from scratch.This article is originally written by IHeima.

China summons US envoy to protest detention of Huawei execAssociated Press InternationalDecember 10, 2018 Monday 6:04 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 623 wordsByline: By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN, Associated PressDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - China summoned the U.S. ambassador to Beijing to protest Canada's detention of a senior executive of Chinese electronics giant Huawei at Washington's behest, demanding the U.S. cancel the order for her arrest.The official Xinhua News Agency said Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng "lodged solemn representations and strong protests" with Ambassador Terry Branstad on Sunday against the detention of Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou. Meng, who is reportedly suspected of trying to evade U.S. trade curbs on Iran, was detained on Dec. 1 while changing planes in Vancouver, Canada.The Xinhua report said Le called Meng's detention "extremely egregious" and demanded the U.S. vacate the arrest warrant. It said Le urged the U.S. to "immediately correct its wrong actions," warning Beijing will take further steps based on Washington's response.On Saturday, the Chinese government summoned Canadian Ambassador John McCallum over Meng's detention. He was also given a warning of "grave consequences" if she is not released.The Canadian province of British Columbia said in a statement Sunday it canceled a trade mission to China because of Meng's detention. The announcement came amid fears China could detain Canadians in retaliation.Huawei is the biggest global supplier of network gear for phone and internet companies and has been the target of deepening U.S. security concerns over its ties to the Chinese government. The U.S. has pressured European countries and other allies to limit use of its technology, warning they could be opening themselves up to surveillance and theft of information.Meng's arrest threatens to add to U.S.-China trade tensions at a time when the two sides are seeking to resolve a dispute over Beijing's technology and industrial planning.But U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, speaking on CBS' "Face the Nation," downplayed the impact of the arrest."This is a criminal justice matter," he said. "It is totally separate from anything that I work on or anything that the trade policy people in the administration work on. ... We have a lot of very big, very important issues. We've got serious people working on them, and I don't think they'll be affected by this."Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, was detained on the same day that President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, agreed over dinner to a 90-day cease-fire in the trade dispute.Hearings on whether to grant her release on bail were due to resume later Monday.The U.S. alleges that Huawei used a Hong Kong shell company to sell equipment in Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions. It also says that Meng and Huawei misled American banks about its business dealings in Iran.In a brief statement emailed to The Associated Press, Huawei said "We have every confidence that the Canadian and U.S. legal systems will reach the right conclusion."Canadian officials have declined to comment on Chinese threats of retaliation over the case, instead emphasizing the independence of Canada's judiciary along with the importance of Ottawa's relationship with Beijing.While protesting what it calls Canada's violation of Meng's human rights, China's ruling Communist Party stands accused of mass incarcerations of its Muslim minority without due process, locking up people exercising their right to free speech and refusing to allow foreign citizens to leave the country in order to bring pressure on their relatives accused of financial crimes. The party also takes the lead in prosecutions of those accused of corruption or other crimes in a highly opaque process, without supervision from the court system or independent bodies.___Associated Press writer Rob Gillies in Toronto contributed to this report.Load-Date: December 11, 2018End of Document

Commercial excellence in China: Lessons from the top CPG companiesMcKinsey & CompanyOctober 31, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 McKinsey & Company, Inc All Rights ReservedLength: 2530 wordsByline: McKinsey & CompanyHighlight: What does it take for consumer-goods manufacturers to succeed in the fast-growing-and increasingly competitive-Chinese market? Our latest survey yields some answers.Body Link to Image The dizzying pace of change in China's retail and consumer landscape has kept consumer-packaged-goods (CPG) manufacturers on their toes. In the past few years, demand for their products has grown rapidly in China, but success is far from guaranteed in this evolving and wildly competitive market. The behavior and preferences of Chinese consumers are shifting, aggressive new online and omnichannel players are emerging, and the regulatory environment is becoming trickier to navigate.Against this backdrop, what constitutes commercial excellence? What are the most successful CPG manufacturers doing that aspiring companies should emulate?SidebarAbout Commercial Excellence BenchmarkingThis article draws on the results of the 2017 Asia Commercial Excellence Benchmarking, with an exclusive focus on companies operating in China. The survey, developed in collaboration with Nielsen, aims to identify consumer-packaged-goods (CPG) companies' winning practices in commercial functions including marketing, portfolio management, pricing, and trade investment. Survey respondents are typically heads of sales and their colleagues. The survey responses help inform our framework for sustainable and profitable growth, which has eight elements: portfolio mapping and innovation, dynamic customer-portfolio strategy, data-driven marketing, precision revenue-growth management, retail partnerships for growth, digitally enabled in-store excellence, agile growth organization, and predictive growth analytics.Since 1978, McKinsey has been gathering data and benchmarks on the sales organizations of the leading CPG companies in the United States. Over time, the survey expanded in geographic scope. Our latest global Commercial Excellence Benchmarking, conducted between 2014 and 2017, received responses from more than 280 companies, including eight of the top ten CPG companies worldwide. These companies represent more than $2.2 trillion in net sales and more than $55 billion in trade spending. Our respondent base included a cross-section of industry players from all major CPG product categories.Our 2017 China benchmarking involved 14 CPG manufacturers, a mix of both local and multinational companies. The findings highlighted in this report draw on data from the 2015, 2016, and 2017 surveys.In the 2017 survey, we used three analytical methodologies. First, we analyzed Nielsen-syndicated retail and consumer data as well as self-reported financial data to distinguish winners from others. We define winners based on sales growth versus the category they play in, as well as commercial metrics such as price increases, reduction in marketing expenses, or per-SKU sales growth. We then compared the self-reported commercial practices of winners to those of others. Next, using the companies' self-reported financial and employment data, we benchmarked participating companies against industry averages. Finally, we created the Commercial Excellence Index, assigning each company a score of 0 to 100. The scores were based on two criteria: (1) sales growth versus the category and (2) return on marketing and sales investments. The industry benchmark and the Commercial Excellence Index give companies a quantitative sense of how they compare with their peers and (assuming they participate in future surveys) how they progress over time.In this article, we present highlights from our latest Commercial Excellence Benchmarking of CPG companies. A collaborative effort between McKinsey and Nielsen, Commercial Excellence Benchmarking is a unique global benchmark that quantifies how a company performs compared with the best industry players. It pinpoints strengths and weaknesses using our proprietary Commercial Excellence Index (see sidebar, "About Commercial Excellence Benchmarking"). It reveals what "winners" do differently from "others"-winners being companies that achieved higher sales growth than the categories they play in, while also outperforming peers on one or more commercial metrics. Winners in pricing, for instance, outgrew others by 3.4 percentage points even while increasing the prices of their products.Broadly speaking, our benchmarking indicates that top-performing CPG companies develop a more granular view of consumers and local markets; make greater use of data; collaborate more closely, both internally and with customers; and adopt a performance-based mind-set.Three market trendsConsumer companies in China are experiencing three fundamental changes, each with a massive impact on commercial practices.The spending power of Chinese consumers is increasingIn 2005, only two percent of urban Chinese households were in the "new mainstream" income group-those earning between 103,000 and 222,000 renminbi, or between approximately $16,000 and $35,000, annually. By 2016, that proportion had risen to 43 percent, and we estimate that by 2025 the new mainstream will encompass 66 percent of urban households in China (Exhibit 1). The top two income groups-affluent consumers (those earning more than 222,000 renminbi annually) and the new mainstream-have disproportionately contributed to consumption growth.Exhibit Link to Image These consumers are trading up in many CPG categories-that is, they're switching from their preferred brands to higher-priced brands. In McKinsey's latest survey of Chinese consumers, one in five respondents said they traded up, whereas only 2 percent said they traded down to cheaper brands or to private-label products. The highest trade-up rates were in cosmetics, spirits, milk, and personal-care products.That said, China's population is widely dispersed across the country, and there are vast differences in consumer behavior from one city to the next. To be able to tap into the areas with the highest growth potential, CPG companies need a detailed understanding of local markets.A new breed of retailer is emergingChina's online retail market has been growing at about 18 percent per year over the past two years, and is now the largest in the world at over $800 billion. In fact, online retail sales in China are approximately equal to online retail sales in the next six largest markets combined-the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, South Korea, and France. And there's much more room to grow: online sales still account for only 17 percent of total retail sales in China.But the most powerful trend in China's retail landscape today isn't just e-commerce. Rather, it's the emergence of the truly omnichannel Chinese retailer, which offers multiple offline and online touchpoints and allows consumers to move seamlessly from one to the other. Take, for example, the food retailer Hema. Each of its brick-and-mortar locations is a retail store, restaurant, and warehouse all in one. It delivers fresh food and meal kits in 30 minutes or less to consumers located within three to five kilometers of a Hema store. The company proactively migrates offline customers to its digital channels-for instance, by rewarding in-store staff for helping consumers install the Hema app on their smartphones-thereby extending consumption occasions far beyond the store. Hema builds an integrated view of each of its customers by requiring all transactions to be made electronically, either through its app or Alipay. And it uses data and analytics to constantly generate consumer insights that inform its product mix and sales strategy.As retailers such as Hema and food-delivery platform Ele.me (both owned by Alibaba) gain ground, CPG companies will need to learn how to partner with them effectively.Regulations are constantly changingCPG companies must keep up with the ever-changing regulatory environment in China. In the last four months of 2017 alone, the Chinese government introduced new regulations governing online advertising, food safety, e-commerce, and import tariffs. To stay abreast of-and compliant with-new laws and regulations, CPG manufacturers need agile processes that enable fast communication and coordination among internal departments, rapid decision making, and speedy implementation of market initiatives.What sets winners apart?These trends have compelled the most forward-thinking CPG companies to adjust their commercial practices. We've found that, globally, leaders in commercial excellence are companies that make informed choices about where to play, which investments to make, how to execute in the market, and how to sustain momentum. These choices allow them to consistently outperform the competition and drive sustainable, profitable growth. In particular, our survey reveals that the winners in China prioritize the following imperatives.Take a localized view of the consumer decision journeyWinners in the Chinese market have invested in generating both offline and online consumer insights, and thus can claim a much deeper understanding of how consumers make buying decisions (Exhibit 2). All winners say they understand the in-store consumer decision journey, and about 80 percent of winners (but only 25 percent of others) say they understand the online consumer decision journey as well-making them much better positioned to partner with China's emerging omnichannel players. In fact, most winners build            direct-to-consumer capabilities, often through the Tmall platform-not necessarily to generate sales but rather primarily to capture consumer insights-whereas for others, direct-to-consumer initiatives aren't a priority at all.Exhibit Link to Image Another striking difference between winners and others is in decision rights. Winners place almost all commercial decisions-including setting price guardrails, launching new products, and allocating customer-specific budgets for shopper-marketing initiatives-in the hands of local or regional managers, rather than the global brand leader or global franchise leader. Empowering local managers by giving them decision-making authority is crucial to success in China.Foster cross-functional collaborationThis emphasis on local-market expertise and knowledge is also evident in how winners in China tackle revenue-growth management (RGM) initiatives. At best-practice companies in developed markets, including the United States and Western Europe, a centralized RGM team is accountable for all RGM initiatives. But in China, winners tend to distribute RGM resources and responsibilities across marketing and sales teams, spreading them out across the entire commercial organization. Drawing on local resources for RGM expertise ensures that local-market understanding is embedded into RGM decisions.Winners in China break traditional silos in other ways as well, to bring the best of their organization to their customers. For instance, winners are more likely to have the head of sales, the head of marketing, and the business-unit leader all participate in joint business planning with key accounts. Winners are also more likely to involve all commercial teams-including sales, category management, and business development-in generating shopper insights. Stronger cross-functional collaboration yields a number of benefits: winners say it has led to supply-chain improvements, trade-spend optimization, and broader reach.Embed data and analytics into decision makingWinners put big data and advanced analytics to work as they develop commercial strategies. In general, they rely on a larger and more sophisticated set of analytical models, tools, and processes to generate market-specific customer and shopper insights and to unearth the true drivers of performance (Exhibit 3).Exhibit Link to Image For example, to set prices, most winners (but only 50 percent or less of others) take into consideration a number of factors including category promotion intensity and consumer price elasticity. Winners are also more likely to collect insights from the field, conduct empirical or statistical analysis of point-of-sale data, and use conjoint analysis as a consumer-research technique.Among all companies in China, however, there remains massive opportunity in the use of trade-investment tools: only 63 percent of winners use trade-promotion management tools, and a mere 17 percent use trade-promotion optimization tools. By comparison, in the North American market, 100 percent of winners use these tools.Take customer relationships to a deeper levelUnsurprisingly, winners devote more time and resources to understanding their customers' businesses. For example, in communicating price changes, all winners strive to understand the impact on the retailer's profits by analyzing both the retailer's sales of the manufacturer's own products as well as the retailer's sales in the entire category. A majority of winners also provide price transition programs to smooth the effects of price changes.Furthermore, winners collaborate with their customers to drive change and build capabilities. For instance, winners are significantly more likely to allocate additional employee hours to high-growth online retailers and to co-invest with these retailers in online marketing and shopper insights. Every single winner in our survey plans to increase investments in e-commerce platforms Tmall and JD.com.Adopt a pay-for-performance mind-setFinally, the most successful CPG companies operating in China keep close tabs on their spending-both in marketing and trade investment. They evaluate their spending regularly and rigorously. It's not that they're constantly looking to cut their marketing or trade budgets; rather, they make sure their spending is geared toward channels and activities that yield high returns on investment.For instance, when it comes to marketing spending, winners are twice as likely as others to compensate marketing agencies based on performance. They're twice as likely to enter into labor-based agreements or adopt a per diem compensation model, rather than paying fixed fees. Winners tend to consolidate their marketing with two or three agencies (which they rely on primarily for digital and social-media campaigns), whereas others use five or more agencies.With regard to trade investment, all winners (and most others) have undertaken a shift from nonconditional to conditional trade terms-that is, they're increasingly paying the trade only if agreed-upon key performance indicators are met. By tying trade investments directly to improved performance, CPG companies are making more efficient use of their trade dollars.These survey findings show that to achieve commercial excellence in China, CPG companies must become more disciplined and data-driven. The practices highlighted in our survey can serve as valuable lessons for companies seeking to outdo the competition in a fast-growing and fast-changing market.About the authorsDaniel Hui is an associate partner in McKinsey's Hong Kong office, where Alex Sawaya is a partner; Felix Poh is a partner in the Shanghai office; and Simon Wintels is a partner in the Singapore office. The authors wish to thank Amrita Dhar Sen, Kumar Gaurav, and Rachel Reyes for their contributions to this article.McKinsey InsightsFor more of McKinsey's latest thinking, install our app for iPad or            Android.Load-Date: February 20, 2020End of Document

CHINA ACCUSED BY U.S., ALLIES OF MASSIVE STATE-SPONSORED HACKING CAMPAIGNStates News ServiceDecember 20, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 820 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:The United States' Department of Justice (DOJ) on Thursday indicted two Chinese nationals for a massive hacking campaign targeting intellectual property and sensitive commercial data around the world.The department unsealed indictments against Zhu Hua and Zhang Shilong, saying in a statement: "We hope the day will come when the defendants face justice under the rule of law in a federal courtroom."The charges include conspiracy to commit computer intrusions against dozens of companies in the United States and around the world, the DOJ said."As with all American criminal charges, individual defendants are presumed innocent unless proven guilty in a court of law," it added.Zhu and Zhang are allegedly linked to a group of hackers known to investigators simply as APT 10, which acted on behalf of China's ministry of state security to carry out a malicious cyber campaign known as Cloud Hopper in Europe, Asia and the U.S., according to details released simultaneously in Washington and London.The U.K.'s National Cyber Security Centre said it had assessed "with the highest level of probability" that the group widely known as APT 10 is responsible for this sustained cyber campaign focused on large-scale service providers.It said the group almost certainly continues to target a range of global companies, seeking to gain access to commercial secrets."The U.K. government has made the judgement that the Chinese ministry of state security was responsible," it said.Networks breachedThe alleged hacking contravenes bilateral agreements on cybersecurity made by Beijing with several countries, and is inconsistent with G20 commitments that no country should conduct or support [computer]-enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential business information, according to a statement on the U.K. Foreign and Commonwealth Office website.The hackers breached the networks of Hewlett Packard Enterprise and IBM, then used their access to hack into their clients' computers, Reuters reported.APT stands for Advanced Persistent Threat, and indicates that hackers are using malware to gain access to computer networks and extract data over an extended period of time, the DOJ said.APT 10 allegedly achieved this by targeting and compromising third-party service providers used by companies to store, process, and protect commercial data, including intellectual property and other confidential business information, in at least a dozen countries.Hackers targeted companies in the banking and finance, telecommunications and consumer electronics, medical equipment, packaging, manufacturing, consulting, healthcare, biotechnology, automotive, oil and gas exploration, and mining sectors, according to the DOJ."When hackers gain access to [such providers], they can steal sensitive business information that gives competitors an unfair advantage," the DOJ statement said.The indictment alleges that defendants worked for a group known to cyber security experts as APT-10. These groups are designated as APTs because they use malware to gain access to computer networks and exfiltrate data over an extended period of time."This is not the first time the Department of Justice has accused Chinese state actors and associates of stealing commercial information," the DOJ said. "our department has repeatedly cast a spotlight on Chinese state-sponsored criminal activity targeting U.S. companies."China at center of allegationsIt said more than 90 percent of cases alleging economic espionage over the past seven years involve China, and more than two thirds of thefts of trade secrets allegations."We want China to cease illegal cyber activities and honor its commitment to the international community, but the evidence suggests that China may not intend to live up to its promises," the statement said."America and many allies know what China is doing. We know why they are doing it. And in some cases, we even know which individual people are doing it in association with the Chinese government," it said.U.K. foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt also called on Beijing to cease its "widespread cyber intrusions.""Our message to governments prepared to enable these activities is clear: together with our allies, we will expose your actions and take other necessary steps to ensure the rule of law is upheld," Hunt said.He said the government would work with service providers to boost information security."It is clear that in some cases basic cyber security measures are still not being taken, and this is not acceptable," Hunt said. "Together the community will discuss the necessary step change that is required in contracting and security controls to tackle cyber threats to government and beyond."Reported by Fok Leung-kiu for RFA's Cantonese Service, and by Shi Shan for the Mandarin Service.

CHINA LAUNCHES CRACKDOWN ON TWITTER AMID CALLS FOR PROTECTION OF ACCOUNTSStates News ServiceDecember 17, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 814 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Now that government censors have reined in dissent on domestic social media platforms, China's "stability maintenance" regime is targeting critics of the ruling party and the administration of President Xi Jinping on Twitter, deleting a large number of accounts since last month, rights activists say."The Chinese government has been targeting Twitter users in China as part of a nationwide crackdown on social media, even though Twitter is blocked in the country," Yaqiu Wang, China researcher at the New York-based group Human Rights Watch (HRW) wrote in a recent report."Authorities have detained or summoned dozens or more Twitter users, forcing them to delete sensitive tweets or close their accounts," Wang wrote. "In some cases, authorities appear to have hacked accounts themselves."State security police now appear to be targeting even those users with relatively few followers, with concerns expressed in interrogations and "chats" over the content of tweets, even though the content is visible only to Chinese users who have access to the right tools to circumvent censorship by the ruling Chinese Communist Party's cyberspace administration, Wang said.Guangdong-based rights activist Wang Aizhong said the authorities had managed to cripple his Twitter account on Dec. 15."I discovered something was wrong when I tried to log onto Twitter ... on Dec. 15 but there was a problem," Wang said. "A bit later, I discovered that several thousand tweets of mine had all been deleted, and that my more than 1,000 followers had unfollowed me."Wang is sure that his Twitter account was hacked by the Chinese authorities."I am certain that they did this via the accounts on my phone, because my phone number is tied to that Twitter account," he said. "They would have been able to use my phone to validate access to change my password and suspend my account.""I wasn't able to regain control of my account until several days later, when I reset it using my e-mail address," he said. Accounts deleted Guizhou University professor Yang Shaozheng, who was fired after he made comments critical of the government on social media, said his Twitter accounts had been deleted outright."I wound up registering for three Twitter accounts, one after another, but I stopped using them one by one because I set them up using my mainland Chinese phone," Yang said. "I had previously thought that Twitter accounts couldn't be interfered with by anyone, but actually ... my Twitter accounts were hacked."Last month, authorities in the eastern province of Shandong detained and questioned Hui Muslim poet Cui Haoxin, known by his pen name An Ran, after he tweeted about growing religious oppression in China.According to a transcript of the interview posted to Cui's Twitter account, police wanted to know his aim in writing such a thing on Twitter, which is blocked in China in the absence of circumvention tools to evade government censorship."Police ordered me to delete my Twitter account," Cui tweeted after his release. "I defied them and said [social media] accounts [are] personal property." 'Compulsory treatment' And in July, Shanghai-based Dong Yaoqiong was sent for "compulsory treatment" in her home province of Hunan after she streamed live video of herself splashing ink on a poster of President Xi in protest at "authoritarian tyranny." Her Twitter account was deleted shortly after she tweeted that police were outside her apartment door.Dong, who used the Twitter handle @feefeefly, is now being held as a psychiatric patient in a women's ward in Hunan's Zhuzhou No. 3 Hospital, where she was committed by her mother under pressure from the authorities, according to Dong's father.According to HRW's Wang, the authorities seem keen not just to prevent critical tweets, but to expunge any record of previous critical tweets."Some of the tweets authorities pressured Twitter users to delete were posted years ago. Few would have viewed the tweets had they remained," Wang wrote, adding that Twitter had previously been "a refuge of sorts for those who can't bear the censorship on China's social media."Beijing-based sociologist Wang Jiangsong called on the U.S. government and Twitter to take steps to protect the freedom of speech of Twitter users."This latest clampdown has been centralized and on a huge scale ... we're not talking just a few hundred or thousand people who have been ordered to delete their accounts," he said. "China is rectifying Twitter, a U.S. company.""Their arm is very long, and travels across borders, exerting control even over the internet in other countries," he said. "Can't Twitter and the U.S. protect the speech of users who have scaled the Great Firewall?" Reported by Qiao Long for RFA's Mandarin Service, and by Ng Yik-tung for the Cantonese Service.

China summons US envoy to protest detention of Huawei execAssociated Press InternationalDecember 10, 2018 Monday 3:02 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 936 wordsByline: By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN, Associated PressDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - China summoned the U.S. ambassador to Beijing on Sunday to protest Canada's detention of a senior executive of Chinese electronics giant Huawei at Washington's behest and demand the U.S. cancel an order for her arrest.The official Xinhua News Agency said Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng "lodged solemn representations and strong protests" with Ambassador Terry Branstad against the detention of Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou. Meng, who is reportedly suspected of trying to evade U.S. trade curbs on Iran, was detained on Dec. 1 while changing planes in Vancouver, Canada.The Xinhua report quoted Le as calling Meng's detention "extremely egregious" and demanded the U.S. vacate an order for her arrest. It quoted Le as calling for the U.S. to "immediately correct its wrong actions" and said it would take further steps based on Washington's response.The move followed the summoning of Canadian Ambassador John McCallum on Saturday over Meng's detention and a similar warning of "grave consequences" if she is not released.The Canadian province of British Columbia said in a statement Sunday it canceled a trade mission to China because of Meng's detention. The announcement came amid fears China could detain Canadians in retaliation.Huawei is the biggest global supplier of network gear for phone and internet companies and has been the target of deepening U.S. security concerns over its ties to the Chinese government. The U.S. has pressured European countries and other allies to limit use of its technology, warning they could be opening themselves up to surveillance and theft of information.Meng's arrest has threatened to increase U.S.-China trade tensions and shook stock markets globally last week. But U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, speaking on CBS' "Face the Nation," downplayed the impact of the arrest on trade talks between the two countries aimed at defusing the tensions."This is a criminal justice matter," he said. "It is totally separate from anything that I work on or anything that the trade policy people in the administration work on. ... We have a lot of very big, very important issues. We've got serious people working on them, and I don't think they'll be affected by this."Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, was detained on the same day that President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, agreed over dinner to a 90-day cease-fire in the trade dispute.The surprise arrest raises doubts about whether the trade truce will hold and whether the world's two biggest economies can resolve the complicated issues that divide them.The U.S. alleges that Huawei used a Hong Kong shell company to sell equipment in Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions. It also says that Meng and Huawei misled American banks about its business dealings in Iran.Roland Paris, a former foreign policy adviser to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, said that Chinese pressure on Canada's government won't work."Perhaps because the Chinese state controls its judicial system, Beijing sometimes has difficulty understanding or believing that courts can be independent in a rule-of-law country. There's no point in pressuring the Canadian government. Judges will decide," Paris tweeted in response to the comments from Beijing.A Canadian prosecutor urged a Vancouver court to deny bail to Meng.Canadian prosecutor John Gibb-Carsley said in a court hearing Friday that a warrant had been issued for Meng's arrest in New York on Aug. 22. He said Meng, arrested en route to Mexico from Hong Kong, was aware of the investigation and had been avoiding the United States for months, even though her teenage son goes to school in Boston.Gibb-Carsley alleged that Huawei had done business in Iran through a Hong Kong company called Skycom. Meng, he said, had misled U.S. banks into thinking that Huawei and Skycom were separate when, in fact, "Skycom was Huawei." Meng has contended that Huawei sold Skycom in 2009.In urging the court to reject Meng's bail request, Gibb-Carsley said the Huawei executive had vast resources and a strong incentive to bolt: She's facing fraud charges in the United States that could put her in prison for 30 years.The hearing is to resume Monday.Huawei, in a brief statement emailed to The Associated Press, said "we have every confidence that the Canadian and U.S. legal systems will reach the right conclusion."Canadian officials have declined to comment on Chinese threats of retaliation over the case, instead emphasizing the independence of Canada's judiciary along with the importance of Ottawa's relationship with Beijing.Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland said Canada "has assured China that due process is absolutely being followed in Canada, that consular access for China to Ms. Meng will absolutely be provided.""We are a rule-of-law country and we will be following our laws as we have thus far in this matter and as we will continue to do," Freeland said Friday.While protesting what it calls Canada's violation of Meng's human rights, China's ruling Communist Party stands accused of mass incarcerations of its Muslim minority without due process, locking up people exercising their right to free speech and refusing to allow foreign citizens to leave the country in order to bring pressure on their relatives accused of financial crimes. The party also takes the lead in prosecutions of those accused of corruption or other crimes in a highly opaque process, without supervision from the court system or independent bodies.___Associated Press writer Rob Gillies in Toronto contributed to this report.Load-Date: December 10, 2018End of Document

Beijing - Art Market: Artprice Launches Subscriptions via the Artron.net Website in China on 1 January 2019PR NewswireDecember 19, 2018 Wednesday 5:27 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1531 wordsDateline: Beijing, December 19, 2018 BodyPR NewswireFollowing the mention of different dates by third parties, Artprice wishes to clarify today, December 18, that the official start date of marketing of Artprice subscriptions in China via our loyal institutional partner Artron (9 years of collaboration) is 1 January 2019 (not a holiday in China).     (Logo:https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/644091/Artprice_Logo.jpg)As of that date, Artprice will appear on Artron.net's main home page, in next to the Artron logo, (see twitter image - source Artron):https://twitter.com/artpricedotcom/status/1074943649929138176Artron.net is the world's leading art website with 5.4 billion visits per year.Artprice, which has its own Chinese WeChat account, notes that according to WeChat stats 'immediate purchase' amounts debited to the accounts (QR Code) of WeChat users are credited in real time to Artprice's bank accounts. This is standard practice for the 988 million WeChat users in China.To fully meet the payment requirements of Chinese Internet users, Artprice also offers an Alipay platform that it has developed, enabling it to reach 1.2 billion users worldwide who generate 300 million transactions per day. (Source Alipay - Alibaba Group)Alipay is also a real-time payment system platform running on a QR Code system. The seller provides a Qrcode, which the buyer scans with his mobile to accept the transaction. The payment is made instantly and the invoice arrives by email or text message.On the basis of these payment systems and Artprice's historic new deal with Artron (with 10 agreements in principle that go way beyond the contract), combined with Artron's core stats (at December 2018, Artron - the world's leading art website and leading art book printer - had 3 million professional members with 5.4 billion visits per year),Artprice is anticipating a very substantial growth in sales as of 2019.As of end January 2019, Artprice will communicate a calculated projection of its sales turnover for 2019. Over nine years, Artprice has translated hundreds of millions of data from its data banks into Mandarin. The computer ergonomics developed by Artprice specifically for China and for smartphones is designed for mobile Internet (88% of Chinese Internet users). In June 2018, China already had no less than 1.1 billion 4G users (Source INA).According to thierry Ehrmann, Artprice's CEO/Founder,"As previously announced, Artron hasproducedseveral videos that highlight-beyond our financial and economic collaboration-the"cultural merger"of our two groups. This short video accurately reflects Artron's vision of Artprice" https://vimeo.com/305021641Artprice's Chairman, thierry Ehrmann, and its senior executives recently returned from several days of intense work at Artron's headquarters in Beijing where discussions focused on accelerating and implementing, as quickly as possible, all the agreed strategic and commercial initiatives that will inevitably generate very positive results in terms of turnover and the expansion of Artprice's client base... not to mention shareholder value.Artron and its Chairman Wan Jie gave the Artprice team an exceptionally respectful, warm and loyal welcome and introduced Artprice to China's top-level institutional leaders, the country's principal Art Market players and all of Artron's 3,500 employees.These face-to-face introductions are an essential step in Artprice's bid to fructify the enormous potential of the Chinese market in a fast and optimal manner. In 2018, China accounted for 45% of global online transactions, generating 12 times more online transactions than the United States. China has a huge advantage over the West because it is building its market economy directly on the Internet (Source GEAB / LEAP 2020).Speaking in front of his senior executives and top management, Wan Jie - at the head his Artron empire and probably the most powerful player in China's Art Market - reiterated his unfailing personal friendship and loyalty vis-à-vis Artprice's founder-Chairman, thierry Ehrmann.This fact deserves emphasis as Chinese custom usually prohibits such 'departures' from accepted business protocol.As China has become the global Art Market's leading marketplace over the past decade, it naturally represents a fascinating new market for Artprice.The development of mobile internet in China has been exceptionally fast and in June 2018 the country boasted 1.1 billion 4G users. Thanks to the Chinese government'sMade in Chinaplan, China is currently set to become the world leader in 5G technology (Source INA).In 2017, China's digital economy accounted for nearly 33% of national GDP. In this context, the role played by private companies as catalysts of innovation has been clearly identified as crucial to the development and growth of China's digital economy. In short, China's key economic and industrial actors are closely associated with the State in the transformation of China into an 'information society'. Thus, in 2017, China's digital economy accounted for nearly 33% of national GDP.

Chinese Intelligence Officer Charged With Economic Espionage Involving Theft of Trade Secrets From Leading U.S. Aviation CompaniesTargeted News ServiceOctober 10, 2018 Wednesday 11:48 PM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 858 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: CINCINNATI, Ohio BodyThe U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio, Benjamin C. Glassman, issued the following news release:A Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) operative, Yanjun Xu, aka Qu Hui, aka Zhang Hui, has been arrested and charged with conspiring and attempting to commit economic espionage and steal trade secrets from multiple U.S. aviation and aerospace companies. Xu was extradited to the United States yesterday.The charges were announced today by Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio Benjamin C. Glassman, Assistant Director Bill Priestap of the FBI's Counterintelligence Division, and Special Agent in Charge Angela L. Byers of the FBI's Cincinnati Division."This indictment alleges that a Chinese intelligence officer sought to steal trade secrets and other sensitive information from an American company that leads the way in aerospace," said Assistant Attorney General Demers. "This case is not an isolated incident. It is part of an overall economic policy of developing China at American expense. We cannot tolerate a nation's stealing our firepower and the fruits of our brainpower. We will not tolerate a nation that reaps what it does not sow.""Innovation in aviation has been a hallmark of life and industry in the United States since the Wright brothers first designed gliders in Dayton more than a century ago," said U.S. Attorney Glassman. "U.S. aerospace companies invest decades of time and billions of dollars in research. This is the American way. In contrast, according to the indictment, a Chinese intelligence officer tried to acquire that same, hard-earned innovation through theft. This case shows that federal law enforcement authorities can not only detect and disrupt such espionage, but can also catch its perpetrators. The defendant will now face trial in federal court in Cincinnati.""This unprecedented extradition of a Chinese intelligence officer exposes the Chinese government's direct oversight of economic espionage against the United States," said Assistant Director Priestap.Yanjun Xu is a Deputy Division Director with the MSS's Jiangsu State Security Department, Sixth Bureau. The MSS is the intelligence and security agency for China and is responsible for counter-intelligence, foreign intelligence and political security. MSS has broad powers in China to conduct espionage both domestically and abroad.Xu was arrested in Belgium on April 1, pursuant to a federal complaint, and then indicted by a federal grand jury in the Southern District of Ohio. The government unsealed the charges today, following his extradition to the United States. The four-count indictment charges Xu with conspiring and attempting to commit economic espionage and theft of trade secrets.***According to the indictment:Beginning in at least December 2013 and continuing until his arrest, Xu targeted certain companies inside and outside the United States that are recognized as leaders in the aviation field. This included GE Aviation. He identified experts who worked for these companies and recruited them to travel to China, often initially under the guise of asking them to deliver a university presentation. Xu and others paid the experts' travel costs and provided stipends.***An indictment is merely a formal charge that a defendant has committed a violation of criminal law and is not evidence of guilt. Every defendant is presumed innocent until, and unless, proven guilty.The maximum statutory penalty for conspiracy and attempt to commit economic espionage is 15 years of incarceration. The maximum for conspiracy and attempt to commit theft of trade secrets is 10 years. The charges also carry potential financial penalties. The maximum statutory sentence is prescribed by Congress and is provided here for informational purposes. If convicted of any offense, a defendant's sentence will be determined by the court based on the advisory Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.This investigation was conducted by the FBI's Cincinnati Division, and substantial support was provided by the FBI Legal Attache's Office in Brussels. The Justice Department's Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance in obtaining and coordinating the extradition of Xu, and Belgian authorities provided significant assistance in securing the arrest and facilitating the surrender of Xu from Belgium.Assistant Attorney General Demers and U.S. Attorney Glassman commended the investigation of this case by the FBI and the assistance of the Belgian authorities in the arrest and extradition of Xu. Mr. Demers and Mr. Glassman also commended the cooperation of GE Aviation throughout this investigation. The cooperation and GE Aviation's internal controls protected GE Aviation's proprietary information.The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Timothy S. Mangan and Emily N.

John Bolton knew of Huawei arrest before Trump-Xi dinnerStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeDecember 7, 2018 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: MARKETS; Pg. 1Length: 709 wordsByline: Jean GarciaBodyThe drops, which pushed both the Dow and S&P 500 into the red for 2018, came after the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in Canada for extradition to the United States in an investigation into suspected Iran sanctions violations by the telecom giant.Canadian authorities said they had arrested Huawei's global chief financial officer in Vancouver, where she is facing extradition to the United States."Americans are grateful that our Canadian partners have arrested the Chief Financial Officer of a giant Chinese telecom company for breaking USA sanctions against Iran".Huawei, which overtook Apple as the world's number two smartphone maker this year, said it was unaware of any wrongdoing by Meng and was provided "very little information" about the charges.Both indexes were down more than 1.5 percent, tracking 0.4 percent losses for the year despite coming well off their session lows.The arrest happened at about the same time that President Donald Trump dined with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Buenos Aires last Saturday (Dec 1) to discuss the trade war between the countries. But the company said early this year it had become the 25th largest research and development funder in Canada, thanks to partnerships with local universities.According to Canada's justice department, Meng has sought a publication ban in the case, but it said that the US seeks her extradition, and a bail hearing has been slated for Friday.Former Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper on the arrest of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou.What could be behind it?Ms Meng's arrest is part of an ongoing investigation by U.S. prosecutors into whether Huawei violated banking laws as it sought to evade sanctions against Iran by routing a series of transactions through HSBC Holdings, according to a person briefed on the matter.Geng said the USA and Canada haven't provided reasons for Meng's detention.In 2011, the American government stopped Huawei from purchasing USA server technology company 3Leaf's assets, for national security reasons.Google to shut down its messaging app Allo by March 2019We built Duo , our simple, high-quality video calling app, so you never miss a moment with the people who matter most. Incidentally, changes are also afoot as far as Hangouts is concerned, but Google denies that it is going away.The company had been investigated by U.S. intelligence, who deemed it a national security threat.Huawei's global chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou.Aly Song / Reuters A man walks by a Huawei logo at a shopping mall in Shanghai, China, Dec. 6.Meng, 46, faces extradition to the USA after her arrest on suspicion of violating existing sanctions against Iran. "Huawei complies with all applicable laws and regulations where it operates, including applicable export control and sanction laws".Huawei is one of the largest tech companies in the world, but it has been under pressure in nations like the U.S., U.K., and Australia for allegedly doing the bidding of the Chinese government."If the Chinese need further convincing, this case would show them beyond doubt Trump's commitment", said Lam."The Chinese side firmly opposes and strongly protests over such kind of actions which seriously harmed the human rights of the victim". China's Commerce Department expressed confidence on Thursday that a trade agreement with the United States could still be reached in time to hit a 90-day deadline, but it called on the U.S. and Canada to "immediately correct the wrongdoing" and restore her "personal freedom".Huawei was a pioneering supplier of telecom gear at a time when China was spending heavily to upgrade its networks, importing much of its equipment.Security concerns recently led BT to bar Huawei equipment from the heart of the 5G network it is rolling out in the UK.Last month, the Trump administration launched an unusual lobbying campaign directed at allied foreign governments, asking them to press wireless and internet providers in these countries not to use Huawei equipment, according to The Wall Street Journal.The recent trade sanctions from the USA on Huawei is getting much worse. Trump restored access after ZTE agreed to pay a $1 billion fine, replace its executive team and embed a US -chosen compliance team in the company.Load-Date: December 7, 2018End of Document

ATR Sees Demand for Over 1,000 New Turboprops in China Over the Next 20 Years Valued at Over US$ 25.6 BillionTargeted News ServiceNovember 7, 2018 Wednesday 8:10 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 741 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: ZHUHAI, China BodyATR Aircraft issued the following news release:ATR has today published its new Chinese Market Forecast at the Zhuhai Airshow where it estimates a total market for 1,100 turboprop aircraft in the next 20 years. These aircraft will be required to serve China's rapidly developing Regional Aviation and General Aviation segments. ATR foresees that in 2037 87% of the Regional and General Aviation activity will come from newly created routes, calculated at a total of close to 2,200.ATR's calculations predict that Regional Aviation (up to 100 seats) will be eight times bigger in 2037 than it is today. The necessity for some 300 turboprops (70 50-seat and 230 70-seat) is estimated to connect 200 regional aviation airports, creating nearly 700 new routes in this regional segment.In terms of General Aviation (up to 30 seats), the Chinese Government is investing strongly in this scheme and is planning to develop a significant number of General Aviation airports. ATR estimates that around 800 30-seat turboprops will be required to serve China's General Aviation segment, connecting 300 General Aviation airports, and many Regional Aviation airports, for which the ATR 42-600 is the ideal aircraft. This will lead to the creation of nearly 1,500 new routes.ATRs are proven route openers, opening on average more than 100 new routes per year, and as many as 155 in 2017. ATR's -600 Series aircraft have a 40% fuel burn advantage over their turboprop competitor and are able to access short runways that other aircraft cannot serve. Thanks to these economic advantages and their operational flexibility, ATR aircraft have been the preferred choice of regional airlines since 2010, making ATR the leader in connecting people and small communities, for business or tourism.The market forecast also predicts the required aircraft for each of China's regions. Using gravity modelling each route's activity was correlated with its characteristics. The resulting mathematical model is based on 5,000 existing Chinese domestic routes and estimates activity potential on every airport pair not yet flown. This provides a breakdown of how many new routes will be created in the next 20 years for each region and how many aircraft will be required to serve them.Using regional turboprop aircraft will make regional aviation sustainableChinese aviation has undergone tremendous fleet growth, and is now seven times the size it was in 1998. This growth primarily addressed large traffic flows, with large capacity aircraft. During the same period the regional fleet doubled, however despite this growth Regional Aviation remains significantly underdeveloped in China. Regional aircraft currently represent barely 2% of China's total fleet compared with the global average of 25%. China's fleet currently lacks the adapted capacity necessary to operate regional routes economically. When traffic is limited, using large jets is not sustainable unless hugely subsidised.Currently large aircraft that are more costly to operate and require government subsidisation to break even or become profitable are being used for regional routes with thin traffic flows. Regional aircraft would serve these routes more efficiently, with better operating and trip costs, meaning less subsidisation would be required.Huge development potential for connecting Chinese communities and link into the HST networkAir connectivity can also complement China's High Speed Train (HST) network. While HSTs connect large cities very effectively, air transportation is required to connect many smaller cities communities into the system. Passenger flow in Chinese airports is today highly concentrated, with 32 airports experiencing flows of 10 million or more passengers and 197 airports experiencing lower traffic, which coincides with the global situation where 36% of the 3800 commercial airports worldwide are served exclusively by turboprops. Offering suitable General and Regional Aviation solutions would not only stimulate economic growth in these under-served airports through the connection of secondary and tertiary economies, but also connect domestic passengers in China into the High Speed Train network.In addition, regional air connectivity delivers important economic advantages. A 10% increase in regional flights delivers 5% more tourists, adds 6% to the regional GDP and increases Foreign Direct Investment by 8%.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6511646 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: November 9, 2018End of Document

Global stocks gain on hopes of a US-China deal. Are investors jumping the gun?CNN WireNovember 2, 2018 Friday 10:33 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 552 wordsByline: By Daniel Shane, CNN BusinessDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  Stock markets around the world climbed Friday on optimism about a potential ceasefire in the trade war between the United States and China.The biggest rises were in Asia. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index surged more than 4% while China's Shanghai Composite and Japan's Nikkei both jumped about 2.5%. The positive momentum started after US President Donald Trump on Thursday talked up the prospects of a deal on trade with Beijing after speaking with Chinese leader Xi Jinping by phone. Trump said on Twitter that talks were "moving along nicely." Asian markets then added to their gains after Bloomberg News reported that Trump has asked US cabinet officials to draft a possible trade deal with China ahead of a planned meeting with Xi at the G20 leaders summit in Buenos Aires later this month.A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed on Friday that Trump and Xi had made progress during a "deep discussion." "I hope teams from both sides can implement the agreements achieved by the two countries' leaders," the spokesperson said. Amid the buoyant mood, China's beaten down currency, the yuan, rose about 0.4% against the dollar. Major European markets gained around 1% in early trading, and US stock futures were up nearly 1%.Global stocks are rebounding after a brutal October. But Friday's uptick came despite a lack of details on how Trump aims to reach a deal with Xi after months of exchanging economic blows.Just this week, the US government struck at the heart of China's ambitions to become a global tech powerhouse by banning American companies from exporting parts and software to a major Chinese state-owned maker of computer chips.Investors may now be letting their hopes get the better of them, according to some market watchers.Michael Every, head of Asia financial markets research at investment bank Rabobank, said he suspected Trump's upbeat comments were aimed at boosting market sentiment ahead of next week's crucial midterm elections. "This seems a perfect way to ensure equities rally into election day, put Xi into a box in terms of what is expected of him in the terms of the deal ... and then have someone to blame when the deal then falls through," Every said in an email.The United States has slapped tariffs on over $250 billion of Chinese exports this year and is threatening more. China has retaliated with its own tariffs on more than $110 billion of US goods.The Trump administration says it's trying to pressure Beijing to make deep changes to its economic policies, accusing it of overseeing the theft of US intellectual property and unfairly boosting Chinese companies through aggressive industrial programs.China's efforts to get hold of American technology are "an existential threat" to the future of the US economy, according to US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. Analysts are highly skeptical that China will agree to major changes that would address the US concerns --- especially at such short notice."These are longstanding structural issues within the Chinese economy and cannot be reversed overnight," said Logan Wright, Hong Kong-based director of China research at research firm Rhodium Group.Nanlin Fang contributed reporting.TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

EDITORIAL: Stop aid to repressive regimesThe Citizens' Voice (Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania)October 25, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 The Citizens' VoiceDistributed by Tribune Content AgencySection: COMMENTARYLength: 369 wordsByline: The Citizens' Voice, Wilkes-Barre, Pa.BodyOct. 25--President Donald Trump's anguish over the Saudi regime's medieval-style torture and murder of Jamal Khashoggi has not been over the executed journalist and the attack on journalism and free expression, but over the prospect that outrage by others could derail the kingdom's promised purchase of$110 billion in U.S. military products.The president has embraced and enforced sanctions against other despotic regimes, most notably Saudi Arabia's nemesis, Iran. And he has advocated severely punishing companies that do business with such regimes. But he has not recognized that other totalitarian regimes, including Saudi Arabia, use commerce and other forms of financial coercion to persuade the United States and other democracies to ignore their own values abroad.Google, for example, is developing a supposed "search engine" for China's repressive government called Dragonfly.  Searches in China on the platform, using terms such as "civil unrest," "dissidents" or "human rights" would not produce any results, for example, even though they would produce millions of results on Google searches in the West. Another suspected feature of the product would enable a government monitor to know a user's location and track individual search habits.China has a market of 1.4 billion and Google's Android operating system is the most widely used for smartphones there.The company attempted to keep the project under wraps until Intercept, an online investigative site, revealed the project and 1,400 Google employees signed a letter protesting Dragonfly as a breach of Google's own open standards for internet access.Trump has launched a trade war with China based on purely financial interests. Since the idea is to pressure the Chinese government by making life more difficult for Chinese consumers, it makes no sense to allow U.S. companies to help the Chinese government diminish dissent with the help of an American company.He and Congress should preclude such aid and comfort to repressive regimes to uphold U.S. democratic and economic values.___ (c)2018 The Citizens' Voice (Wilkes-Barre, Pa.)

PETERS REQUESTS DOD BRIEFING ON CHINESE SURVEILLANCE HARDWARE REPORTSStates News ServiceOctober 5, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 642 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Michigan Senator Gary C. Peters:U.S. Senator Gary Peters, a member of the Senate Armed Services and Homeland Security Committees, sent a letter to Department of Defense (DoD) Secretary James Mattis requesting a briefing to Congress on recent reports that China installed surveillance microchips in certain hardware devices used in systems across DoD and other intelligence agencies. According to a recent Bloomberg article, operatives from Chinas Peoples Liberation Army inserted the chips during the manufacturing process, affecting major companies from Amazon to Apple.This incident is particularly alarming because it involves the extremely difficult task of manipulating hardware to provide a potential adversary with long-term access to extremely sensitive networks and data belonging to the military and intelligence community, wrote Senator Peters. It is essential that the Department of Defense take action to ensure the security of the microelectronics supply chain for sensitive network infrastructure.Last year, Peters introduced bipartisan legislation with Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) to increase scrutiny on the transfer of sensitive U.S. technology to foreign countries like China, which may utilize American investment opportunities to gain military advantages. The bill, which was signed into law earlier this year as part of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act, will update the process in which Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS) approves acquisitions, mergers, and other foreign investments in the United States a process that has not been updated in nearly a decade.The full letter can be found below, or click here:October 4, 2018The Honorable James MattisSecretary of DefenseThe PentagonWashington, DC 20301Dear Secretary Mattis:Recent media reports suggest that certain information technology devices, including those used by the Department of Defense and Intelligence Community, were compromised by surveillance microchips installed by operatives of Chinas Peoples Liberation Army. I request a briefing on this incident, as well as any associated investigation, in the coming weeks.This reported incident seems plausible given Chinas past behavior and demonstrated capability. Earlier this year, it was reported that Chinese government hackers stole sensitive information related to U.S. Navy undersea warfare capabilities from a contractor. The Chinese government has targeted data relating to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, defense contractors, satellite operators, telecommunications companies, and other sensitive national security programs.This incident is particularly alarming because it involves the extremely difficult task of manipulating hardware to provide a potential adversary with long-term access to extremely sensitive networks and data belonging to the military and intelligence community. It is essential that the Department of Defense take action to ensure the security of the microelectronics supply chain for sensitive network infrastructure.Congress has taken action to address the threat of foreign competitors stealing sensitive technologies. The John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 includes the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, legislation that reforms the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and is intended to protect sensitive U.S. technology. I appreciate your testimony in the Senate Armed Services Committee supporting these important reforms and know that you take the Departments role in developing and safeguarding cutting-edge technology seriously.As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I request that you provide Congress with information relating to this alleged incident and the potential exposure within the Department of Defense.###Load-Date: October 5, 2018End of Document

China slams 'ridiculous' US election meddling chargesStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeOctober 7, 2018 SundayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: WORLD-NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 868 wordsByline: Steven ClarkeBodyChina on Friday firmly opposed to U.S. Vice President Mike Pence's accusations against China's domestic and foreign policies and said any malicious slander on China is futile.In 2010, Google shuttered most of its operations in mainland China, although it continues to operate China-focused sites elsewhere, including in Hong Kong, which maintains a small degree of independence from the rest of the country.We offered to reduce the trade deficit of the US States, for instance. U.S. warships and combat planes, as well as ground troops, would be mobilized for the operation.Former US Federal Reserve governor Kevin Warsh described relations as "probably as poor as" it was before the Nixon administration opened up links between the world's two biggest economic superpowers more than four decades ago. "And we also presented a very good proposal to the USA side about the further reform and opening up in China, some of the so-called structural issues", he said.Pence will assert that China's actions surpass those of Russian Federation in trying to shape American opinion.Pence's speech served to provide a reactionary and duplicitous justification for Washington's plans for military escalation.Vice President Mike Pence charged Thursday that Russia's influence operations in America pale in comparison with the covert and overt activities China is taking to interfere in the US midterm elections and counter President Donald Trump's tough trade policies. Remarks to a think tank would not be an inauspicious venue for such a speech; Churchill was addressing Westminster College in Missouri when he delivered his. "Instead, China has chosen economic aggression, which has in turn emboldened its growing military".The vice president, a favorite of conservative US Christians, also criticized China on human rights, voicing disappointment that rising prosperity has not led to reforms. It was confronted by a Chinese destroyer, with the two vessels coming within 45 feet of each other."These actions threaten the stability of the Taiwan Strait - and the United States of America condemns them". We will not be intimidated. Indeed, as the CNN report indicates,Washington is preparing far more massive and unsafe provocations.Pence mentioned Taiwan several times in the speech, in particular criticising Beijing for pushing three Latin American nations to sever ties with Taipei.He alleged that China has initiated an unprecedented effort to influence American public opinion, the 2018 elections, and the environment leading into the 2020 presidential elections.The speech by Pence had the twin goals of expressing a desire to work closely with China, while warning of what he said is the country's "whole-of-government approach" to expand its influence and interests globally and within the United States.Busy Philipps & Ellen DeGeneres Speak About Sexual Abuse & Share Their StoriesDeGeneres pointed out how crucial it is for survivors to be able to speak out safely. "She wrote: "#tbt This is me at 14. I said, 'But Mom, I just want you to know, ' because she felt like she had failed me and didn't protect me."Regrettably, we found that China has been attempting to interfere in our upcoming 2018 election", Trump said."Beijing has mobilizedcovert actors, front groups and propaganda outlets to shift Americans' perception of Chinese policies", he said.Pence said China was waging a sophisticated effort to sway the elections against the Republicans in retaliation for Trump's trade policies.Both the countries so far slapped additional tariffs on range of products amounting to billions of dollars.China hit back furiously on Friday, branding Pence's accusation "ridiculous".Bloomberg Businessweek cited 17 unidentified intelligence and company sources as saying that Chinese spies had placed computer chips in equipment used by about 30 firms, as well as multiple US government agencies, which would giveBeijing secret access to internal networks. "As a senior career member of our intelligence community recently told me just this week, what the Russians are doing pales in comparison to what China is doing across this country and the American people deserve to know".The remark was interpreted by some sections of the media as an attempt by the Trump administration to deflect from special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian "meddling" in the U.S. election and possible complicity on the part of the Trump campaign.But China is unlikely to succumb to USA demands on core issues such as Taiwan, the South China Sea and its longer term industrial technological development plan, said Prof Li. In a lengthy report released Thursday evening, the administration asserted that China "represents a significant and growing risk to the supply of materials and technologies deemed strategic and critical to USA national security".In a speech to the Hudson Institute on Thursday, Vice President Pence amplified the charge leveled by President Trump last week.He accused the Chinese government of orchestrating an aggressive military, economic and political campaign to expand its influence inside the U.S. and across the world.Google is blocking the World Socialist Web Site from search results.Load-Date: October 7, 2018End of Document

Snowden joins voices asking Google not to enter ChinaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 11, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 408 wordsBody On the eve of the testimony before Congress of the head of Google, Sundar Pichai, a coalition of human rights groups and activists, including the former employee of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, have asked for more details about the plans of the giant Internet searches to develop your business in China.  Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the Committee to Protect Journalists are among the organizations and people who signed the letter, which asks Google to promise not to create a search engine for China that will contribute to censorship and repression politics in the country.  "To facilitate the access of the Chinese authorities to personal data, as the media have published, would be particularly imprudent," the authors of the letter write. "There is a real risk that Google will directly help the Chinese government to arrest or imprison people simply by expressing their opinions online, making the company complicit in human rights violations."  The activists also published a letter they obtained from Google's senior vice president for global affairs, Kent Walker, responding to a series of previous protests and statements made by Amnesty International and other groups in October.  Walker refers to Google's goals of connecting people in emerging markets to the internet and repeats the statements made by Pichai that the Dragonfly project, as it was known internally to the search engine, was not close to a formal launch. However, he refrains from making any commitment to censorship, and instead says that the company will carefully evaluate all comments before making a final decision.  Dragonfly caused a stir inside and outside of Google, and many employees expressed concern about the possibility that the company would work with the Chinese government after leaving the country in 2010, precisely because the Chinese authorities pressured Google to help the government control to its citizens.  The debate will reach a decisive moment on Tuesday, when Pichai answers questions before a committee of American politicians. Some have already wondered why Google is considering a search engine in China while moving away from some of its work with the United States military.  "We hope the Capitolians ask some hard questions for Google," said Cynthia Wong, senior analyst at Human Rights Watch.  The Snowden entry adds to voices that ask Google not to enter China was first published in La Tercera. Load-Date: December 11, 2018End of Document

Update: Pompeo Confirms China Behind Marriott International Cyberattack; Beijing Denies InvolvementMT Newswires Live BriefsDecember 12, 2018 Wednesday 2:04 PM ESTCopyright 2018 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 376 wordsBody (Updated to add Pompeo's confirmation of China's involvement, and China's denial)Secretary of State Mike Pompeo confirmed on Wednesday China was behind the massive cyberattack on the Marriott International (MAR) chain of hotels, in an interview with Fox News.Pompeo said the Chinese government was "conducting espionage and influence operations here in the United States," the latest of which was the security breach on Marriott.China, meanwhile, has denied involvement in the hacking attack. "China firmly opposes all forms of cyberattack and cracks down on it in accordance with the law," Geng Shuang, a spokesman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told the New York Times."If offered evidence, the relevant Chinese departments will carry out investigations according to the law," the spokesman added.The New York Times previously reported, citing two sources familiar with the investigation, that Chinese hackers were behind the cyberattack on Marriott that compromised the personal information of about 500 million guests, as part of a wider effort that also breached health insurers and the security clearance files of millions more Americans.The hackers are suspected of working for the Ministry of State Security, which is China's Communist-controlled civilian spy agency. The allegations come amid the Trump administration's plan for actions that will target China's trade, cyber and economic policies, which may kick in within days.The moves will include indictments against Chinese hackers who are working for the country's intelligence services and military, according to four anonymous government officials. The Trump administration is also reportedly planning to declassify intelligence reports to reveal China's efforts from at least 2014 to build a database that contains the names of executives and US government officials with security clearances.The hacking of Marriott's Starwood hotels, uncovered in September but only revealed last month, is not expected to be part of the coming indictments. However, in part because Marriott is the top hotel provider for US government and military personnel, two government officials said that it added urgency to the administration's crackdown.Price: 110.91, Change: +0.88, Percent Change: +0.80Load-Date: December 13, 2018End of Document

Asian shares rise on hopes for Chinese stimulus for economyAssociated Press InternationalNovember 1, 2018 Thursday 3:23 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; Financial MarketsLength: 404 wordsByline: By ANNABELLE LIANG, Associated PressDateline: SINGAPORE BodySINGAPORE (AP) - Asian markets were mostly higher Thursday on hopes for Chinese government help for the economy as manufacturing slows.KEEPING SCORE: Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 1.6 percent to 25,386.77 and the Shanghai Composite index added 1 percent to 2,628.34. The Kospi in South Korea was 0.7 percent higher at 2,042.83. Australia's S&P-ASX 200 gained 0.1 percent to 5,834.00. Japan's Nikkei 225 index bucked the regional trend, dropping 0.8 percent to 21,749.78. Shares were higher in Taiwan and throughout Southeast Asia.WALL STREET: A rally by retailers and technology and internet companies led major indexes higher on Wednesday. Companies like Facebook and General Motors posted strong earnings, boosting investor confidence amid rising interest rates. The S&P 500 index gained 1.1 percent to 2,711.74. The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 1 percent to 25,115.76 and the Nasdaq composite jumped 2 percent to 7,305.90. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks rose 0.3 percent to 1,511.41. Despite the push, U.S. stocks finished October with their worst monthly loss in seven years.CHINESE STIMULUS: Manufacturing in China slowed in October, according to official data, triggering concerns over the effects of tariffs on businesses despite official assurances. In a statement on Wednesday, the State Council, China's Cabinet, said there was a need for "timely countermeasures" and that "some policy effects needs to be further released". The hint of more stimulus lifted markets in Asia.ANALYST'S TAKE: Fiscal stimulus by the Chinese government is a tricky affair as it would weaken its currency, Michael Every, senior Asia-Pacific strategist at RaboResearch, said in a commentary. "That is something they don't want, partly to prevent capital flight, and partly because Washington is watching like a hawk on that front," he added.ENERGY: Oil prices continued to weaken on news that U.S. crude stockpiles increased for the sixth straight week. Benchmark U.S. crude dropped 18 cents to $65.13 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract dropped 87 cents to settle at $65.31 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, shed 21 cents to $74.83 per barrel. In the previous session, it dropped 91 cents to $75.04 a barrel.CURRENCIES: The dollar fell to 112.86 yen from 112.94 yen late Wednesday. The euro strengthened to $1.1342 from $1.1312.Load-Date: November 1, 2018End of Document

Pompeo says China hacked MarriottPolitico.comDecember 12, 2018 Wednesday 4:34 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 316 wordsByline: egeller@politico.com,  (Eric Geller)BodySecretary of State Mike Pompeo confirmed today that the Chinese government hacked Marriott and potentially stole the information of up to 500 million people.During an interview on "Fox & Friends," Pompeo said China was "conducting espionage and influence operations here in the United States."When one of the Fox program's hosts interjected and said, "The latest one was the Marriott," Pompeo replied, "That's right."Marriott announced the hack on Nov. 30 and said the intruders had access to its Starwood chain's reservation database since 2014. The company did not identify the attackers, but multiple news outlets subsequently reported that security researchers found links to Chinese intelligence services.Chinese government hackers "have committed cyberattacks across the world," Pompeo said on "Fox & Friends."Also this morning, at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Chinese hacking, Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said China is responsible for "over 90 percent of cyber-enabled economic espionage in the United States. Reports issued this year by the White House Office on Trade and Manufacturing, the U.S. Trade Representative and ODNI all report detailed findings on China's role as a prime cyber-attacker and thief of American intellectual property and technology."Those comments come one day before multiple Trump administration agencies are expected to blame China for a long-running campaign of hacks that includes the Office of Personnel Management and Anthem breaches. Both are part of what U.S. intelligence officials believe is an attempt by Beijing to amass dossiers on Americans susceptible to recruitment as double agents."Our effort, from Department of Homeland Security and the FBI and the State Department, is to push back against these threats to America from China," Pompeo said.Tim Starks contributed to this story.Article originally published on POLITICO MagazineLoad-Date: December 13, 2018End of Document

China's ZTE taps Joe Lieberman for D.C. damage controlPolitico.comDecember 14, 2018 Friday 12:21 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 881 wordsByline: soverly@politico.com,  (Steven Overly)BodyChinese telecom giant ZTE is tapping a deeply connected Washington insider, former Sen. Joe Lieberman, as it tries to fend off ongoing concerns that it poses a threat to U.S. national security.The company - the subject of a heated congressional battle earlier this year - has hired Lieberman (I-Conn.) to conduct an "independent" national security assessment of its products, the former senator told POLITICO. "There are obviously still concerns about the safety of their products or the extent to which their products could be used to compromise American security in any way or even individual security," Lieberman said in an interview, adding that ZTE has "decided to really try to get ahead of those concerns and be in a position to answer them."U.S. officials have ramped up warnings that ZTE, which produces networking equipment as well as smartphones and tablet computers, provides opportunities for Chinese cyber espionage, given its ties to the Chinese government. Key lawmakers this summer sought to block the company from doing business in the U.S., but Congress later settled for a ban on ZTE entering into U.S. government contracts, following intervention by President Donald Trump.Still, U.S. suspicion of ZTE and another Chinese telecom company, Huawei, is widespread. Canada arrested the chief financial officer of Huawei this month at the request of American officials who contend she violated U.S. sanctions against Iran. The action strained relations between the U.S. and China at a time when the countries are trying to de-escalate their trade war. Lieberman is the third former U.S. lawmaker working on ZTE's behalf in Washington. The company has retained the lobbying services of two other former lawmakers, former Minnesota Sen. Norm Coleman and former Nebraska Rep. Jon Christensen. Bryan Lanza, a former deputy communications director for the Trump campaign, also did work for ZTE earlier this year through Mercury Public Affairs. ZTE paid the Washington, D.C., law firm Hogan Lovells nearly $2 million during the second and third quarters of the year. Lieberman plans to register as a lobbyist for ZTE, but he said he won't actually lobby, instead focusing on his assessment for the company. Still, the former senator said he's already "made a bunch of phone calls" and visited Capitol Hill twice in the last two weeks to meet with members of Congress who have spoken out against ZTE or are leaders of relevant committees. He declined to say which lawmakers, but Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), two vocal ZTE critics, have spoken with him, according to their offices.Lieberman said he also hopes to talk to officials at the Commerce, Defense and Homeland Security departments. "I don't expect at any point, certainly in this phase, to be giving ZTE's point of view," he said. "I'm really supposed to be listening and asking questions." He said he wants to determine what can be done to "raise the level of trust in ZTE because they've got plenty of lobbyists and they don't need me to do that, and I didn't particularly want to do that."Lieberman, currently senior counsel in New York at the law firm Kasowitz Benson Torres, will report back to ZTE in roughly six months about what he's found. After he finishes his investigation, he said the company could keep him on to develop a program for the company to "try to reassure both their consumers in America and also obviously the U.S. government."During his time in the Senate, Lieberman chaired the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and co-sponsored legislation to create DHS. Toward the end of his tenure, he and Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) championed proposed legislation to toughen cybersecurity protections for key U.S. infrastructure. A ZTE spokesperson confirmed the Lieberman hire, adding in a statement, "ZTE initiated this fact-finding mission as part of its comprehensive effort to better understand and address any national security concerns of its customers, Congressional and Executive Branch officials in the U.S., and governments across the globe."The Commerce Department reimposed a seven-year ban on ZTE earlier this year for violating U.S. sanctions against North Korea and Iran, but Trump, in the midst of trade negotiations with China, took aim at his own administration's decision."President Xi of China, and I, are working together to give massive Chinese phone company, ZTE, a way to get back into business, fast," Trump tweeted on May 13. "Too many jobs in China lost. Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done!"The Commerce Department later lifted the ban, with ZTE agreeing to pay a $1 billion fine, replace its management team, and allow the U.S. to assign compliance officers to prevent future violations. Trump's meddling sparked bipartisan resistance in the Senate with Minority Leader Chuck Schumer as well as  Republicans like Rubio arguing the company presents a national security threat. The Senate voted to revive the ban as part of a defense bill, but the prohibition later got softened when the legislation was reconciled with the House. In the end, Congress prevented ZTE from selling to government agencies but allowed its commercial business in the U.S. to continue.Article originally published on POLITICO MagazineLoad-Date: December 14, 2018End of Document

Powell said he did not think the Phillips curve is dead.-China provides money to USA universities, think tanks and scholars with the understanding that they will avoid ideas that the Communist Party finds offensive, Pence said.The Chinese Embassy inWashington referred queries about Pence's speech to an interview that China's ambassador, Cui Tiankai, gave to National Public Radio on Wednesday.He urged Google to "immediately end development of the "Dragonfly" app that will strengthen Communist Party censorship and compromise the privacy of Chinese customers".Google declined comment, except to reiterate that its China search engine project was "exploratory" and not close to launch.He said a Chinese naval vessel came within 45 yards of the Decatur 'as it conducted freedom-of-navigation operations in the South China Sea, forcing our ship to quickly maneuver to avoid collision."We did not and will not interfere in any country's domestic affairs, we refuse to accept any unwarranted accusations against China and we call upon other countries to also observe the purposes of the U.N. Charter and not interfere in other countries' internal affairs", he said. "We will not be intimidated; we will not stand down".Pence was also to use the phrase "debt diplomacy" in reference to China's efforts to expand its influence worldwide.Pence also protests Beijing's construction of military fortresses in the South China Sea as well as Chinese efforts to intercept American ships carrying out naval exercises created to contest China's territorial expansion.Pence lashed out at China's human rights abuses in his remarks, including the shuttering of underground Christian churches last month, and reports of more than 1 million imprisoned Muslim Uygurs in the western province of Xinjiang.Load-Date: October 6, 2018End of Document

The delegation included famous Japanese investors, well-known consortiums and entrepreneurs, as well as the political and business class, including former Senator of Aichi Prefecture, Misako Yasui; JBA legal counsel and member of Cryptocurrency Legislative Committee at Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA, the financial regulator of Japan), Masataka Ogasawara; and the chairman of global asset management company, Union Capital Group, Tomita Takashi.Shota Awata had mentioned earlier in a live broadcast interview with a well-known media in US blockchain that the current friendly diplomacy between Japan and the Chinese government would be beneficial for Genkicell's plan to launch in China. The project itself is also related to China's famous blockchain projects - Ontology and Juyaotang® (the producer and supplier of China's third largest Chinese herbal medicine). In addition, it is related to other local Chinese projects and companies that have established good relationships with Genkicell.The trip to China mainly focused on topics such as project landing, solutions to the problems caused by the aging society, development of the Internet industry, and big data information. The delegates also communicated these topics to the related governments of Nanjing, Hangzhou and Jinhua cities.China's Yangtze River Delta region has been regarded as a strategic emerging industry and the core of development likely to accelerate independent innovation as well as promote economic restructuring. The region also actively responds to the National "Three-Year Action Plan" (Three-Year Action Plan for the Integration of the Yangtze River Delta Region - (2018-2020)). The main goal of this plan is to build a world-class industrial cluster aimed at optimizing the layout of key industries and promote the deep integration of the industrial chain. After the G20 summit, Hangzhou City, as the organizer, proposed the direction of "building the first city of digital economy" and jointly promoted technological innovations, including cloud computing, big data, Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and cooperatively building the Yangtze River Delta region into a global digital economy. Additionally, they aim to develop the highlands. As such, the blockchain technology in China's Yangtze River Delta region has been accelerated to attract the attention of many Japanese developers.Zhongyu Chen, the chairman of the Zhejiang Normal University Committee and professor at the School of Mathematical and Information Engineering and the Institute of Blockchain, strongly supports Genkicell's idea of landing in China and believes that Genkicell has potential, especially since the aging society in both Japan and China is becoming increasingly severe. The One Health industry is becoming a major industrial form of domestic demand. Therefore, it is necessary to encourage and support its implementation and solve One Health problems using blockchain technology.Genkicell Chain also initiated their upcoming application - GEN (GID). Shota Awata gave a detailed introduction to the project on behalf of Genkicell and explained the GID function in the GEN series products."GEN (GID) is a global decentralized health management application that applies Genkicell's modular infrastructure to easily collect health data from hospitals, laboratories and IoT devices via scalable interfaces. It can also effectively conduct health prediction and prevention by building user biometric data quantification. At the same time, it helps enterprises and service organizations to reduce operating costs, provide data foundations for hospitals and research institutions, and promote the accelerated development of One Health industries."Since China is the most populated country worldwide, it is possible that a large number of people suffer chronic diseases. In particular, data indicates that nearly 300 million people suffer from chronic diseases and an estimated 8 billion consultations are carried out every year. Meanwhile, the number of medical examinations is about 500 million, with medical examinations accounting for about 95% of China's health management services. Therefore, the application of GEN (GID), a global decentralized health management App, can effectively solve problems such as huge operational costs, health prediction, and prevention.Jian Wang, deputy director of Zhejiang Provincial Department of Commerce, also expressed that he expects the Genkicell project to be beneficial and that the project will be landed after the inspection.More information about Genkicell Chain:Facebook：https://www.facebook.com/GenkicellchainTwitter：           https://twitter.com/@genkicell Telegram EN：           https://t.me/genkicellGroupenReddit：           https://www.reddit.com/user/genkicell Medium：           https://medium.com/@Genkicell View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/genkicell-chain-invited-to-china-to-communicate-about-project-landing-300761218.htmlSOURCE Genkicell ChainCONTACT: Rikki Yao, +86-17321057437, rikki@genkicell.ioLoad-Date: December 7, 2018End of Document

Argentina and China will sign 37 agreements at the G20 SummitCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 29, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 536 wordsBody Chinese President Xi Jinping and Argentine President Mauricio Macri will sign close to 40 bilateral agreements in various areas during the first visit to Buenos Aires on the occasion of the G20 meeting, revealed the Argentine ambassador to China, Diego Ramiro Guelar .  Some of the topics covered by the 37 protocols are electronic commerce, politics, economy and finance, energy, transport, infrastructure, science, technology, education and culture.  In a recent meeting with media, Ramiro Guelar said that "the relationship with China is very important for Argentina", since it is its maximum investor and, if it excludes the International Monetary Fund (IMF), its main creditor.  "China is our second market after Brazil. Our central banks have very good relations. We have large banks (Chinese) installed in Argentina, such as ICBC and, since the end of this month, the Bank of China, "exemplified Guelar.  The bilateral meeting will take place on Sunday, December 2, at the Olivos residence and 37 agreements will be signed, many of which are aimed at long-term projects of more than five years.  However, the construction of the Atucha III nuclear power plant, which was planned at an estimated cost of 8,000 million dollars financed by the Chinese government, due to a bid between the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Energy, which made the possibility unviable, will be suspended. of an agreement.  The intimate friendship erases the distance: Xi Jinping  A few days before the G20 summit, President Xi Jinping, drafted a statement that points out several factors that unite the Asian giant with the South American giant, in economic, cultural and solidarity terms, and pointed out the keys for the mutual development between both nations:  The Chinese leader began the text extolling how pleased he is to visit Buenos Aires, "as a Chinese proverb says," intimate friendship erases the distance ", beyond the immense geographical distance between China and Argentina, our peoples They are united by the love of peace and reciprocal solidarity. "  In two years, President Mauricio Macri and Xi Jinping have had four meetings, which, "in addition to attesting the high importance assigned by both parties to bilateral relations, allow us to reach relevant consensus on the further development of the same. China strongly supports Argentina in the search for a development path in line with its national realities and has full confidence in its development perspective. "  China and Argentina are common development partners.  "Chinese consumers love fruits, beef, wine and seafood, among other Argentine products. Over 10,000 million Chinese investments in Argentina, covering infrastructure, energy, communications and agriculture, and create tens of thousands of local jobs, "he said.  Commercial ties  The value of Argentina's exports to China amounted to 4,592 million dollars in 2017, however, imports were 12,329 million dollars, with which the South American country registered a trade deficit of 7,737 million dollars last year, pronouncing its negative balance with respect to the one recorded in 2016, which was 5,820 million dollars, according to INDEC data.

China: Canada's detention of Huawei exec 'vile in nature'Associated Press Financial WireDecember 9, 2018 Sunday 3:18 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 835 wordsByline: By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN, Associated PressDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - China summoned the Canadian ambassador to protest the detention of a top executive of leading Chinese tech giant Huawei, calling it "unreasonable, unconscionable, and vile in nature" and warning of "grave consequences" if she is not released.A report by the official Xinhua News Agency carried on the Foreign Ministry's website said that Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng called in Ambassador John McCallum on Saturday over the holding of Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou, who is reportedly suspected of trying to evade U.S. trade curbs on Iran.Huawei is the biggest global supplier of network gear for phone and internet companies and has been the target of deepening U.S. security concerns over its ties to the Chinese government. The U.S. has pressured European countries and other allies to limit use of its technology, warning they could be opening themselves up to surveillance and theft of information.Le told McCallum that Meng's detention at the request of the United States while transferring flights in Vancouver was a "severe violation" of her "legitimate rights and interests.""Such a move ignores the law and is unreasonable, unconscionable, and vile in nature," Le said in the statement."China strongly urges the Canadian side to immediately release the detained Huawei executive ... or face grave consequences that the Canadian side should be held accountable for," Le said.Roland Paris, a former foreign policy adviser to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, said that Chinese pressure on the Canadian government won't work."Perhaps because the Chinese state controls its judicial system, Beijing sometimes has difficulty understanding or believing that courts can be independent in a rule-of-law country. There's no point in pressuring the Canadian government. Judges will decide," Paris tweeted in response to the comments from Beijing.A Canadian prosecutor urged a Vancouver court to deny bail to Meng, whose case is shaking up U.S.-China relations and worrying global financial markets.Meng, also the daughter of Huawei's founder, was detained at the request of the U.S. during a layover at the Vancouver airport Dec. 1 - the same day that Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping of China agreed over dinner to a 90-day ceasefire in a trade dispute that threatens to disrupt global commerce.The U.S. alleges that Huawei used a Hong Kong shell company to sell equipment in Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions. It also says that Meng and Huawei misled American banks about its business dealings in Iran.The surprise arrest raises doubts about whether the trade truce will hold and whether the world's two biggest economies can resolve the complicated issues that divide them.Canadian prosecutor John Gibb-Carsley said in a court hearing Friday that a warrant had been issued for Meng's arrest in New York Aug. 22. He said Meng, arrested en route to Mexico from Hong Kong, was aware of the investigation and had been avoiding the United States for months, even though her teenage son goes to school in Boston.Gibb-Carsley alleged that Huawei had done business in Iran through a Hong Kong company called Skycom. Meng, he said, had misled U.S. banks into thinking that Huawei and Skycom were separate when, in fact, "Skycom was Huawei." Meng has contended that Huawei sold Skycom in 2009.In urging the court to reject Meng's bail request, Gibb-Carsley said the Huawei executive had vast resources and a strong incentive to bolt: She's facing fraud charges in the United States that could put her in prison for 30 years.The hearing will resume Monday after Meng spends the weekend in jail.Huawei, in a brief statement emailed to The Associated Press, said that "we have every confidence that the Canadian and U.S. legal systems will reach the right conclusion."Canadian officials have declined to comment on Chinese threats of retaliation over the case, instead emphasizing the independence of Canada's judiciary along with the importance of Ottawa's relationship with Beijing.Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland said Canada "has assured China that due process is absolutely being followed in Canada, that consular access for China to Ms. Meng will absolutely be provided.""We are a rule of law country and we will be following our laws as we have thus far in this matter and as we will continue to do," Freeland said Friday.While protesting what it calls Canada's violation of Meng's human rights, China's ruling Communist Party stands accused of mass incarcerations of its Muslim minority without due process, locking up those exercising their right to free speech and refusing to allow foreign citizens to leave the country in order to bring pressure on their relatives accused of financial crimes. The party also takes the lead in prosecutions of those accused of corruption or other crimes in a highly opaque process, without supervision from the court system or independent bodies.___Associated Press writer Robert Gillies in Toronto contributed to this report.Load-Date: December 9, 2018End of Document

China ensures reasonable growth of its economyCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 22, 2018 SaturdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 565 wordsBody China delivered good news to the markets, but not as good as they wanted. At the close of the Annual Economic Work Conference, the authorities of the Asian giant assured that they would provide sufficient fiscal and monetary stimuli to maintain 2019 growth within a "reasonable range", but refrained from referring to the yuan, which accumulates in the year a depreciation against the dollar of 5.84%.  According to the state agency Xinhua, Beijing will deploy a "proactive fiscal policy that should improve efficiency, implement tax cuts and tariff reductions on a larger scale, and substantially increase the size of special local government bonds." Thus, tax cuts and tariff reductions are anticipated that exceed the 1.3 trillion yuan (US $ 188,000 million) authorized for this year.  Additionally, Iris Pang, an economist for Greater China at ING, explains that there will also be special bond issues by local governments, which would reach some 3 trillion yuan (US $ 435,000 million). "These funds will support local government infrastructure projects. For example, some cities have revived their plan to have more metro lines, "he says in a report to his clients.  On the other hand, Xinhua added that it will work with a "prudent monetary policy, which should not be too flexible or too strict, keeping liquidity broad enough".  Under these conditions, the Chinese authorities expect "investment to play a key role" in the improvement of the industry, 5G technology, artificial intelligence and industrial capabilities of the Internet.  "Prioritizing China's growth and delivering a clearer political response in 2019, in relation to a half-hearted attempt to stimulate the economy in 2018, to stabilize the domestic slowdown and mitigate the trade war, is good news," analysts say. the consultant Natixis after knowing the plans of the Chinese government, adding that they hope that "that China softens its structural slowdown successfully and expands by 6.3% in 2019".  Market doubts  The response to the strong support that the authorities will give to the activity of the country, did not have the response of the markets that could be expected. With the weight of the reversals of Wall Street in the previous session, the stock markets of China operated all day in red, frame where the CSI 300 and Shanghai closed with decreases of 1.24% and 0.79%, respectively.  The foreign exchange market paid more attention to the decisions made at the Annual Economic Work Conference, but there was no good news for China either.  The external yuan registered a depreciation of 0.35% against the dollar, closing at 6.92, while the Dollar Index achieved an advance of 0.77%.  This movement is explained by the lack of reference to the currency in the government's economic definitions for 2019. This is what Iris Pang says, who considers that this absence "can be seen as a signal from the government that it will allow the USD / CNY I crossed the control of 7 yuan in 2019, "adding that we must not forget the context of the commercial war, which makes it" difficult to avoid "that the Chinese currency continues to fall. "Once the trade war truce ends after 90 days, the yuan will depreciate further and could easily go to 7.0. Our forecast is 7.30 at the end of 2019, "said the ING economist.  The China entry ensures a reasonable growth of its economy was first published in La Tercera. Load-Date: December 22, 2018End of Document

Report: China targets South Korea's largest search engineUPIOctober 19, 2018 Friday 1:01 PM ESTCopyright 2018 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 383 wordsByline: ELIZABETH SHIMDateline: Oct. 19 BodyChina's crackdown on free speech is targeting South Korean web portals as video games continue to be banned, according to a South Korean press report.Operators of online search engines based in China told News 1 on Friday access to parts of Naver, South Korea's largest search engine, had been blocked in China.Naver's section for personal blogs and online "cafÃ©s," where users can post messages on an electronic board for each other, have not been accessible since Tuesday, according to the report."At present, accessing Naver from China's Internet is impossible," News 1's source said. "There were similar incidents in the past, but this is the first time we have not been connected for such an extensive period."China blocks about 10,000 domain names, including Google, Youtube, Instagram and Twitter -- although access to the sites are still possible using a virtual private network, or VPN.News 1's sources say online censorship is worsening following a Chinese government decision to shift the monitoring of Internet content from the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television to the propaganda department of the Communist Party."Chinese IT firms used to access Naver to study trends in South Korean entertainment and games," a South Korean source in China said, "But this appears to be blocked. It is discouraging the transfer of South Korean content to the Chinese market. The objective appears to be to operate content, manageable by the Communist Party, to prevent anti-Xi Jinping sentiment."South Korean video games were being unofficially banned in the Chinese market following Seoul's decision to deploy THAAD, the U.S. missile defense system, on the peninsula in 2016.Chinese sanctions targeting South Korea appear to be easing, however.Money Today reported Friday South Korean tour operators expect large groups of Chinese tourists to return to Seoul for shopping excursions.One group of 820 Chinese tourists are to be taken to duty-free stores, but the itinerary does not include the duty-free store belonging to South Korean conglomerate Lotte, according to the report.Lotte may have been the target of unofficial sanctions when Chinese shoppers boycotted Korean goods following the controversy over THAAD. The firm offered its golf course as a site to deploy missile defense.Load-Date: October 20, 2018End of Document

China's quiet imprisonment of Muslims should disturb youThe Rensselaer Polytechnic: Rensselaer Polytechnic InstituteOctober 17, 2018 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: OPINION; Pg. 1Length: 776 wordsBodyThe Chinese government started a campaign, called the de-extremification policy, to socially re-engineer the Uighur Muslims of the province of Xinjiang through the use of technological surveillance and modern-day internment camps. The Uighur Muslims are a Turkic ethnic group who live primarily in the Xinjiang autonomous region of the People's Republic of China. The population of this region consists of 21 million people, and of those, 11 million people are Muslim, making the Muslim population of Xinjiang a designated minority. At this very moment, the Chinese government have turned Xinjiang into a 21st century surveillance site with checkpoint and facial recognition software. Muslims are forced to install spyware on their phones to allow authorities to monitor their online activity. The surveillance has become more invasive, with more than 1 million Chinese-Communist party members being planted in people's homes to spy on those who the party suspects are religious extremists. These spies report back with information about the extent of the Uighur's religious beliefs, their uncleanliness, and drinking habits. If they are found to be extremists, the Muslims are placed in detention facilities. These facilities are equipped with prison-like compounds with walls, security doors, security fences, barbed wire, reinforced security doors, surveillance systems, secure access systems, watchtowers, and guard rooms. In these facilities, Muslims undergo psychological torture, ranging from studying the communist propaganda and swearing loyalty to the president-by giving thanks to him and wishing him a long life-to criticizing and renouncing their faith. The detainees undergo physiological torture as well, from being poorly fed, sometimes even being made to eat pork or drink alcohol (both of which are things disallowed by the Muslim faith), to being sleep deprived. If they are defiant, disobey a rule by refusing to be on duty, engage in a fight, or even arrive late to studies, it could result in waterboarding or tiger chairs-in which the detainee is bound for upwards of 24 hours. This horrid situation has reached a point to where many inmates have committed suicide, and entire families have disappeared.  The Uighurs are in a constant state of fear, because the definition of extremism is too broad. Not watching the state TV is extremism. Not having their children attend state schools is extremism. Even complaining about children marrying someone of a different faith or ethnic group is extremism. Their ethnicity and their values are also being targeted. They can also be detained for spreading Halal items, giving their babies a Muslim name, and having a long beard or wearing a veil. According to the United Nations' estimates, 1 million Uighur have been imprisoned, and the situation looks hopeless, because the information about this situation is incredibly hard to come by. The information that we have so far is from accounts of former detainees who have been rescued or have escaped. The UN have used other methods, such as scanning satellite footage, procuring documents of public recruitment notices, and construction bids to confirm that detainees are telling the truth and such horrid, backward thinking can exist in the world today.So far, the United States has not been involved, but Republicans Marco Rubio and Chris Smith have proposed bipartisan legislation to have the Trump administration have China close these re-education camps. The senators have gone as far as asking the Department of Commerce to limit sales of tech that could be used for surveillance. Though I have strong doubts that Trump will issue a statement, something must be done. China is a leading influence in African countries-many of which are poor and have a large Muslim population-raising the possibility that these African governments will label Muslims as scapegoats for their problems. This situation mirrors what occurred during World War II with the imprisonment of the Jewish population. The Jewish people were labeled as the scapegoats for German woes, and lived under restrictions on what they could wear and the different ethnicities they could marry. They were kept under horrid conditions in internment camps, where many committed suicide and entire families were killed. In 2018, nearly 73 years from the end of World War II, a global superpower should not be able to revert back and echo the horrors of the past with facing judgement from the rest of the world. The technological advances that China has made mean absolutely nothing if they cannot ensure the safety and prosperity of their citizens-regardless of their faith.Load-Date: October 22, 2018End of Document

DOE Issues Statement on Chinese Hacking of Global Managed Service ProvidersTargeted News ServiceDecember 20, 2018 Thursday 9:47 PM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 415 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe U.S. Department of Energy issued the following joint statement by Secretary Rick Perry and Assistant Secretary Karen S. Evans on Chinese hacking of global managed service providers:* * *Today, the U.S. Government is announcing that a group of Chinese cyber actors, known publicly as APT 10, is carrying out a campaign of cyber-enabled theft targeting global managed service providers, cloud service providers, and their clients. APT 10 is operating on behalf of the Chinese Ministry of State Security. Over the past four years APT 10 compromised and gained extensive access to multiple U.S. and global managed service and cloud providers. They infiltrated these providers' clients, including global companies located in at least 12 countries. The U.S. Government is taking steps to mitigate the impacts of this activity and hold the Chinese government accountable for these unacceptable actions."As the Secretary for the Sector Specific Agency for cybersecurity in the energy sector, I have no higher priority than protecting our nation's energy infrastructure against the threat of cyberattacks. "Malicious actors are conducting sophisticated attacks to threaten our Nation's critical infrastructure. Today's announcement affirms our government's vigilance and resolve to respond swiftly and forcefully against those who would use technology to threaten our way of life."Since at least 2014, APT 10 compromised the administrative credentials of managed service providers and then infiltrated their clients' networks. Using a mix of sophisticated custom malware and off-the-shelf applications, they stole intellectual property and other confidential business information. APT 10 targeted information from companies responsible for critical infrastructure, including entities in the information technology, energy, healthcare and public health, communications, and critical manufacturing sectors."In our capacity to protect and coordinate with the energy sector, the Department of Energy is dedicated to working with our government and industry partners to strengthen the preparedness and resilience of both the electricity and oil and natural gas sectors. "As the Sector Specific Agency, DOE's CESER is committed to addressing these aggressive cybersecurity threats and keeping the nation's critical energy infrastructure safe and secure."We encourage those affected, or who want to know more, to please visit www.us-cert.gov/china.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6559814 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: December 20, 2018End of Document

Chinese tech companies are now keeping detailed records of users' activityCNN WireNovember 30, 2018 Friday 5:42 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 512 wordsByline: By Sherisse Pham, CNN BusinessDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  Chinese internet companies have started keeping detailed records of their users' personal information and online activity. The new rules from China's internet regulator went into effect Friday, just the latest sign of the increasingly restrictive environment for tech companies like Tencent (TCEHY) and Alibaba (BABA).The new requirements apply to any company that provides online services which can influence public opinion or "mobilize the public to engage in specific activities," according to a notice posted on the Cyber Administration of China's website earlier this month. Companies will now have to start logging the activities of users posting in blogs, microblogs, chat rooms, short video platforms and webcasts.Citing the need to safeguard national security and social order, the Chinese regulator said companies must be able to verify users' identities and keep records of key information such as call logs, chat logs, times of activity and network addresses.Officals will carry out inspections of companies' operations to ensure compliance. But the Cyber Administration didn't make clear under what circumstances the companies might be required to hand over logs to authorities.According to their terms of service, messaging and social media platforms WeChat and Weibo are already required to hand over user information to the Chinese government upon request. The new requirements affect some of China's biggest tech companies and startups, including Tencent, Alibaba, Baidu (BIDU) and ByteDance. It is unclear if the new rules also apply to international companies, such as Apple (AAPL), whose iMessage service is available in China. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Beijing has stepped up scrutiny of internet companies recently. Earlier this month, the Cyber Administration shut down almost 10,000 social media accounts, saying they "trampled on the dignity of laws and regulations" and "damaged the healthy ecology of online public opinion." In April, authorities ordered ByteDance to shut down a popular social media platform on which users often shared jokes, videos and GIFs, saying many of the posts were vulgar and displayed "improper public opinion."China heavily polices its domestic internet. The country's vast censorship system regularly deletes any online posts or discussions about topics that Beijing deems sensitive, including criticism of President Xi Jinping, the Tiananmen Square massacre, or news that could spark mass protests. Most of the world's most popular social media and internet platforms --- including Facebook (FB), Google (GOOGL) and Twitter (TWTR) --- are banned in China.But Google has been exploring ways to rebuild its presence in the Chinese market. And Facebook recently told US lawmakers that although it has no current plans to enter China, any effort to do so would take into account free expression and privacy concerns.Serenitie Wang and Steven Jiang contributed to this report.TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Inside China's Silicon Valley: From copycats to innovationCNN WireNovember 23, 2018 Friday 2:37 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 883 wordsByline: By Matt Rivers, CNNDateline: SHENZHEN, China (CNN Business) BodySHENZHEN, China (CNN Business) --  At the Huaqiangbei Market in Shenzhen, you can build a smartphone from scratch in a couple of hours.Spread over several floors and covering hundreds of thousands of square feet, the market is home to vendors selling the parts that make up your standard phone --- cameras, motherboards, frames, screens and so on. All you have to do is buy the right bits and know how to put them all together. And it's not just smartphones. You can find the parts here for almost any consumer electronics device you can think of, like portable power banks and drones.To be sure, there is copycatting going on here. The designs of Apple (AAPL) or Samsung devices are regularly ripped off. Intellectual property rights, one of the US government's biggest bugbears with China, are nonexistent. But there's invention at work, too. Some people are trying to use the parts to come up with new and improved versions of existing gadgets. The whirling, chaotic market highlights how innovation sometimes works in China. Experts say viewing the country as just a vast manufacturing base for products designed by foreign companies is outdated and misguided."There's a ton of innovations at a huge scale that are happening in China," said Christian Grewell, a business professor at NYU Shanghai. "They are just happening very, very quickly and without the knowledge of the rest of us."He pointed to how smartphone maker Xiaomi has updated its software based on user feedback, and China's rapid adoption of digital payments through Tencent's (TCEHY) WeChat app and Ant Financial's Alipay. Hardware hubOnce a tiny fishing village in the shadow of nearby Hong Kong, Shenzhen is now a glittering metropolis of more than 12 million people. Along with other cities spread across Southern China's Pearl River Delta, it rose to prominence in the 80s and 90s as the world's factory floor, pumping out boatloads of industrial and consumer products. But today it's also widely known as China's answer to Silicon Valley, the home of tech giants like Tencent and Huawei.Shenzhen has become a magnet for ambitious young entrepreneurs seeking to take advantage of the city's position at the heart of global tech supply chains. It has produced startups like DJI, the world's top maker of non-military drones."If you have an idea, you can quickly evaluate this idea and find factories to manufacture the product for you," said Jasen Wang, CEO of tech education startup Makeblock.The company produces kits that kids can use to build things like race cars and walking robots --- and then program them. Makeblock's products and software are designed to teach children the language of computer programming in a fun way.Shenzhen provides a ready supply of the hardware needed by his company, which was valued around $350 million in its last fundraising round. And it also has the human talent. "There are so many big companies here, it's very easy to find hardware development engineers," Wang said. "You don't have that kind of advantage in Beijing or Shanghai."Moving fastShenzhen also gets things done quickly."If you really want to develop products in a fast pace, I think you have to be in China --- and practically have to be in Shenzhen," said Steven Yang, CEO of battery technology company Anker Innovations. "Anything you have to do in days or weeks elsewhere can be done in hours here."Yang, a 36-year-old former Google (GOOGL) employee, has built Anker into one of the top makers of portable power banks for smartphones and other devices. It generated revenue of well of over $500 million last year, and its products sell on Amazon (AMZN) and at Walmart (WMT).Ten years ago, Shenzhen was 90% about copycatting and 10% innovation, according to Yang. Now, it's 70% innovation and 30% copycatting, he suggests.Foreign businesses agree that Chinese companies are upping their game.In an annual survey by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, this was the first year that a majority of respondents said they view Chinese companies as "equally or more innovative than European firms."Counterfeiting still rifeWhile genuine innovation is happening in Shenzhen, so are trademark infringement and intellectual property theft. The counterfeiting industry is still massive, with fake iPhones and Nike (NKE) sneakers prominently on sale. Anker suffered from knockoffs in its early days, but authorities are gradually taking a tougher line on copycats, according to Yang. "I think it's getting better year over year," he said.The Trump administration remains unconvinced. It has cited Chinese theft of American intellectual property as one of the main reasons for the trade war between the two giant economies.Experts say the Chinese government needs to do more if it wants to become a global tech powerhouse."China does want to see a few of their local firms take on world markets. And they are making lot of bets in various places" such as electric vehicles and artificial intelligence, NYU Shanghai's Grewell said."For China to go send its innovations overseas," he added, "I think it's got to fully join the international community in protecting some of that intellectual property."Jon Jensen contributed to this report.TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Senate Homeland Security &#38; Governmental Affairs Committee Issues Report on Federal Acquisition Supply Chain Security ActTargeted News ServiceDecember 19, 2018 Wednesday 9:28 PM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 8717 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON, Dec. 19 -- The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee issued a report (S.Rpt. 115-408) on legislation (S. 3085) to establish a Federal Acquisition Security Council and to provide executive agencies with authorities relating to mitigating supply chain risks in the procurement of information technology. The report was advanced by Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, on Dec. 4.Excerpts of the report follow:I. Purpose and SummaryS. 3085, the Federal Acquisition Supply Chain Security Act of 2018, establishes a whole-of government approach to supply chain risk management by creating a council and providing executive agencies with the necessary authorities to effectively share information and mitigate supply chain risks when procuring information and communications technology (ICT). The bill establishes the Federal Acquisition Security Council (Council), an inter-agency body headed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The Council is tasked with several functions related to supply chain risk management (SCRM), including the development of protocols for assessing risk, a government-wide strategy, and the authority to recommend exclusion or removal orders to executive agencies. The bill gives the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Secretary of the Department of Defense (DoD), and the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) plenary authority to issue exclusion and removal orders based upon the Council's recommendations. The bill details a limited judicial review process available to an aggrieved company wishing to challenge the DHS, DoD, or ODNI determination.II. Background and the Need for LegislationHostile nation states and other bad actors are attempting to gain unprecedented access to sensitive and classified information via the Federal ICT supply chains.1 Experts have noted that using the supply chain, ICT "products could be modified to (1) perform below expectations or fail, (2) facilitate state or corporate espionage, of (3) otherwise compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a federal information technology system."2 Many of the technologies the Federal Government relies on for vital, daily functions either could be or already have been targeted by bad actors or hostile nation states.3 The actors' motivations vary, but the effects are the same: a less secure America.41See, e.g., Confirmation Hearing for William R. Evanina to be Director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center: Hearing Before the S. Select Comm. on Intelligence, 115th Cong. (2018) (statement for the record by William Evanina, Director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, stating, "The most critical CI threats cut across these threat actors: influence operations, critical infrastructure, supply chain, and traditional as well as economic espionage. . . . Advanced technology previously available mainly to leading nation-states is now increasingly available to a wide range of nation-state and non-state actors as well. For example, a growing set of threat actors are now capable of using cyber operations to remotely access traditional intelligence targets, as well as a broader set of U.S. targets including critical infrastructure and supply chain, often without attribution."), available at https:// www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/os-revanina- 051518.PDF.2Supply Chain Vulnerabilities from China in U.S. Federal Information and Communications Technology (Apr. 2018), https:// www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/Research/Interos_Supply% 20Chain%20Vulnerabilities%20from%20China%20in%20U.S.%20Federal%20ICT _final.pdf.3See Current and Projected National Security Threats to the United States: Hearing Before the S. Select Comm. on Intelligence, 112th Cong.

(Oct. 8, 2012), available at https://intelligence.house.gov/sites/intelligence.house.gov/files/ documents/huawei-zte% 20investigative%20report%20(final).pdf (stating, "Inserting malicious hardware or software implants into Chinese- manufactured telecommunications components and systems headed for U.S. customers could allow Beijing to shut down or degrade critical national security systems in a time of crisis or war. Malicious implants in the components of critical infrastructure, such as power grids or financial networks, would also be a tremendous weapon in China's arsenal. Malicious Chinese hardware or software implants would also be a potent espionage tool for penetrating sensitive U.S. national security systems, as well as providing access to the closed American corporate networks that contain the sensitive trade secrets, advanced research and development data, and negotiating or litigation positions that China would find useful in obtaining an unfair diplomatic or commercial advantage over the United States. . . .").This is not a new threat. The U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) and Congress have long warned that foreign governments may target the Federal ICT supply chain via certain products or services. This well-documented history includes:In 2011, the Office of National Counterintelligence Executive released a report stating, "Sensitive U.S. economic information and technology are targeted by the intelligence services, private sector companies, academic and research institutions, and citizens of dozens of countries."55Office of National Counterintelligence Executive, Foreign Spies Stealing U.S. Economic Secrets in Cyberspace: Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection &#38; Industrial Espionage, 2009-2011 (Oct. 2011), available at https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Newsroom/ Reports%20and%20Pubs/20111103_report_fecie.pdf.In 2012, the U.S. House of Representatives' Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) released a bipartisan report on the national security issues posed by Chinese telecommunications companies that stated in part, "[T]he U.S. government must pay particular attention to products produced by companies with ties to regimes that present the highest and most advanced espionage threats to the U.S., such as China."66H.

If in a foreign country, identify potential relationships between the foreign government and the provider (suppliers, vendors, etc.). Identify the foreign country's laws or policies which enable it to request sensitive business information from the provider. Request the names, addresses, and roles of foreign individuals associated with, or who have access to the provider. . . . Identify if the provider employs foreign nationals . . . ."77U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, Best Practices in Supply Chain Risk Management for the U.S. Government (Feb. 2016), available at https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/scrmbestpractices-1.pdf/view.In 2017, the DoD's Defense Science Board's Task Force on Cyber Supply Chain released a report stating that factors to consider when vetting a supplier could include ownership and control of the supplier.88Department of Defense, Defense Science Board Task Force on Cyber Supply Chain, Final Report of the Defense Science Board Task Force on Cyber Supply Chain (Feb. 2017), available at https://www.acq.osd.mil/ dsb/reports/2010s/1028953.pdf.In 2018, during testimony before the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI), FBI Director Wray publicly stated: "I think probably the simplest way to put it in this setting would be that we're deeply concerned about the risks of allowing any company or entity that is beholden to foreign governments that don't share our values to gain positions of power inside our telecommunications networks. That provides the capacity to exert pressure or control over our telecommunications infrastructure. It provides the capacity to maliciously modify or steal information, and it provides the capacity to conduct undetected espionage. So, at a 100,000-foot level, at least in this setting, those are the kind of things that worry us."99Worldwide Threats: Hearing Before the S. Select Comm. on Intelligence, 115th Cong. (2018) (statement of Director Chris Wray, Director of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation).For years, the United States security agencies have understood the threat to national security systems posed by ICT supply chains, while grappling with how to appropriately share classified information and address the risk for all government agencies. The need for this legislation is underscored by several recent examples of supply chain risks discovered within the Federal ICT system.AO Kaspersky LabAO Kaspersky Lab ("Kaspersky"), including its related entities such as Kaspersky Lab, Inc., is a cybersecurity and anti-virus software provider headquartered in Moscow, Russia.10 Anti-virus software, by its very nature, is designed to have access to all files on the system on which it is running. Although the exact nature of how Kaspersky software operates is outside the scope of this report, Kaspersky's potential capabilities and the impacts on U.S. national security have been widely reported by a variety of leading security specialists and scholars.11 In September 2017, DHS issued a Binding Operational Directive (BOD) ordering all Federal civilian executive agencies to identify and remove Kaspersky-branded products from Federal information systems.12 This was the first time since receiving the authority under the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 to issue BODs that DHS used the authority to remove a product from the Federal supply chain.10Contact Us, Kaspersky.com, https://usa.kaspersky.com/about/ contact (last visited Oct. 17, 2018).11See, e.g., Herb Lin, The Real Threat from Kaspersky Security Software, Lawfare (Oct. 12, 2017), https://www.lawfareblog.com/real- threat-kaspersky-security-software (stating, "Of more concern to me is the idea that Kaspersky software has the capability to inspect the media of any computer running it for interesting files and to forward such files to Russian intelligence.") (emphasis in original); Nicholas Weaver, On Kaspersky, Lawfare (July 25, 2017), https://            www.lawfareblog.com/kaspersky (noting that there is a risk of a "government-mandated malicious update."); see also Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, Kaspersky Lab, Inc.; and Kaspersky Labs Limited v. United States of America, D.D.C. (Mar. 26, 2018), Civ. No. 18-325 (CKK), available at            https://www.nextgov.com/media/gbc/docs/pdfs_edit/ 032718kaspersky1ng.pdf.12Department of Homeland Security, BOD-17-01: Removal of Kaspersky-Branded Products (Sept. 13, 2017), available at https:// cyber.dhs.gov/assets/report/bod-17-01.pdf. BOD-17-01 defines "Kaspersky-branded products" as "information security products, solutions, and services supplied, directly or indirectly, by AO Kaspersky Lab or any of its predecessors, successors, parents, subsidiaries, or affiliates, including Kaspersky Lab North America, Kaspersky Lab, Inc., and Kaspersky Government Security Solutions, Inc. . . ."Then-Acting Secretary of DHS Elaine Duke released the following statement contemporaneous with the BOD explaining why the Department acted. The statement said, in part:This action is based on the information security risks presented by the use of Kaspersky products on federal information systems. Kaspersky anti-virus products and solutions provide broad access to files and elevated privileges on the computers on which the software is installed, which can be exploited by malicious cyber actors to compromise those information systems. The Department is concerned about the ties between certain Kaspersky officials and Russian intelligence and other government agencies, and requirements under Russian law that allow Russian intelligence agencies to request or compel assistance from Kaspersky and to intercept communications transiting Russian networks. The risk that the Russian government, whether acting on its own or in collaboration with Kaspersky, could capitalize on access provided by Kaspersky products to compromise federal information and information systems directly implicates U.S. national security.1313Press Release, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Acting Secretary Elaine Duke, DHS Statement on the Issuance of Binding Operational Directive 17-01 (Sept. 13, 2017), available at https:// www.dhs.gov/news/2017/09/13/dhs-statement-issuance-binding-operational- directive-17-01.In making the decision to issue the BOD, DHS consulted with multiple interagency partners.14 Additionally, DHS offered Kaspersky the opportunity to submit a written response to address the Department's concerns and an opportunity to mitigate them.1514Id.15Id.Congressional interest in Kaspersky continued throughout 2017.16 In December 2017, Congress passed and the President signed into law the Fiscal Year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which contained a statutory ban on Kaspersky products.17 Unlike DHS' BOD, which applied only to Kaspersky branded products, the exclusion in the NDAA applied to "any hardware, software, or services developed or provided, in whole or in part, by Kaspersky Lab (or any successor entity); and any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with Kaspersky Lab; or any entity of which Kaspersky Lab has majority ownership."18 The NDAA ban is much broader than the BOD as it targeted any product with Kaspersky coded embedded in it. Furthermore, this exclusion applied Government-wide. This provision went into effect on October 1, 2018.1916See Disinformation: A Primer in Russian Active Measures and Influence Campaigns, Panel II: Hearing Before the S.

The Kaspersky case made clear the potential threat to civilian agencies' ICT purchases and systems. Since then, a number of disjointed efforts to address the supply chain risk from Government ICT purchases have emerged, but there is no cohesive framework for all agencies to follow. A whole of government approach is needed to give U.S. agencies the information and authorities they need to swiftly address ICT supply chain issues.S. 3085 establishes the Federal Acquisition Security Council, chaired by OMB. This Council, comprised of civilian, DoD, and IC agencies, is designed to develop a government-wide strategy for addressing supply chain risks from ICT purchases, to facilitate information sharing among government agencies and to be the central, government-wide authority for SCRM activities. The composition of the Council allows for agencies with a critical stake in Federal SCRM to have a voice in the Government's policy direction. Among its various SCRM-related functions, the Council is required to identify and recommend the development of SCRM standards for executive agencies to use when addressing supply chain risks. This will provide uniformity in how agencies assess and address such risk. The Council must also identify or develop criteria for sharing information related to supply chain risk management, including information pertaining to the exercise of authorities under sections 1326 and 4713. This criteria is to include, among other things, the content to be shared, when sharing is mandated or voluntary, and when it is appropriate for an executive agency to rely on shared information to exercise its authorities under this bill. This is designed to prevent one or two executive agencies from being aware of a present supply chain risk and failing to notify other agencies of that risk. As such, another responsibility of the Council includes designating an appropriate executive agency to act as a "central hub" for receiving supply chain information submitted by other executive agencies. This will streamline the information-sharing process across the Federal Government.Another authority granted to the Council is the ability to recommend exclusion or removal orders for "covered articles." Covered articles are items found in the ICT supply chain, including, but not limited to: IT, including cloud computing services; telecommunications equipment; hardware; and software. Once the Council issues a recommendation, the Secretary of DHS, the Defense Secretary, and the Director of National Intelligence are vested with plenary authority to act on those recommendations. Once one of those officials, or their delegates, have acted on the recommendation(s), the corresponding agencies and systems they are responsible for are required to abide by the order(s). In the event that the Secretary of DHS, Defense Secretary, and Director of National Intelligence all issue the same order(s), collectively resulting in a government-wide decision, the bill requires the Administrator of the General Services Administration (GSA) and officials at other agencies to effectuate the order(s) government-wide.In the event the Council makes a recommendation, the bill requires the Council to provide notice of the recommendation to any named source. The notice must advise the source that: a recommendation has been made; the criteria the Council relied upon in making the recommendation, to the extent consistent with national security and law enforcement interests; that the source has 30 days after receipt of the notice to submit information and arguments in opposition to the recommendation; of the procedures governing the review and possible issuance of an exclusion or removal order; and, if practicable and within the sole and unreviewable discretion of the Council, a description of any mitigation steps the source could take that may result in the Council rescinding its recommendation. If one of the authorized agency heads decides to act on the Council's recommendation and issues an exclusion or removal order, that official must notify any named source of the exclusion or removal order and of the information that formed the basis for the order, to the extent consistent with national security and law enforcement interests. These exclusion and removal orders require an annual review thereafter.This legislation also authorizes the head of an executive agency to carry out a "covered procurement action" and to limit the disclosure of information relating to the basis for doing so. A covered procurement action includes: the exclusion of a source that fails to meet certain qualification requirements; the exclusion of a source that fails to achieve an acceptable rating for supply chain risk when evaluating contract award proposals; the determination that a source is not a responsible source; and the decision to withhold consent for a contractor to subcontract with a particular source or to direct a contractor to exclude a particular source. Except when addressing an urgent national security interest, an agency head may only carry out a covered procurement action after receiving a joint recommendation from their chief acquisition officer and the chief information officer, or officials performing similar functions if the agency does not have such officials, and after providing notice of the joint recommendation to any source named in the recommendation. This notice must advise the named source of the following information: that a recommendation is being considered or has been made; of the information that formed the basis for the recommendation, to the extent consistent with national security and law enforcement interests; that the source has 30 days to submit information and argument in opposition to the recommendation; and of the procedures governing the consideration of the submission and the possible exercise of the agency's authority.Finally, this bill contains judicial review procedures that appropriately balance the need for aggrieved companies to receive due process with the need for the Federal Government to act swiftly to address threats, share sensitive and/or classified information, and ensure that information is protected from disclosure. Any action taken under section 1323 or 4713 is not subject to existing administrative review or judicial review procedures for government purchases, including bid protests before the Government Accountability Office or in any Federal court. The bill provides for the filing of petitions for judicial review only in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. A petition must be filed within sixty days after a party is notified of an exclusion or removal order under section 1323 or a covered procurement action under section 4713, claiming that the action is unlawful. The court will consider such an action unlawful only if it finds it to be: arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity; in excess of statutory jurisdiction; lacking substantial support in the administration record taken as a whole or in classified information submitted to the court; or not in accord with procedures required by law. These constraints and the timeline of sixty days affords for an expeditious resolution. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit is granted exclusive jurisdiction over such claims, which is appropriate given its unique expertise with national security matters and handling of classified material.III. Legislative HistoryRanking Member Claire McCaskill (D-MO) introduced S. 3085, the Federal Acquisition Supply Chain Security Act of 2018, on June 19, 2018, with Senator James Lankford (R-OK). The bill was referred to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.The Committee considered S. 3085 at a business meeting on September 26, 2018. During the business meeting, Ranking Member McCaskill and Senator Lankford offered an amendment in the nature of a substitute that was twice modified to reflect discussions among Members of the Committee and feedback from relevant executive agencies. The bill, as amended by the McCaskill-Lankford Substitute Amendment as twice modified, was ordered reported favorably by voice vote en bloc. Senators present were Johnson, Portman, Lankford, Enzi, Hoeven, McCaskill, Carper, Heitkamp, Peters, Hassan, Harris, and Jones.IV. Section-by-Section Analysis of the Bill, as ReportedSection 1. Short titleThis section provides that the bill may be referred to as the "Federal Acquisition Supply Chain Security Act of 2018."Sec. 2. Federal Acquisition Supply Chain Security.Section 2 of the bill amends chapter 13 of title 41, United States Code (U.S.C.), by adding the following new subchapter at the end:Subchapter III--Federal Acquisition Supply Chain SecuritySec. 1321. DefinitionsThis section defines or provides references for the following terms in the subchapter: "appropriate congressional committees and leadership;" "Council;" "covered article;" "covered procurement action;" "information and communications technology;" "intelligence community;" "national security system;" and "supply chain risk."Sec. 1322. Federal Acquisition Security Council establishment and membershipThis section establishes the Council, whose membership is comprised of the following agencies: OMB; GSA; DHS; ODNI, including the National Counterintelligence and Security Center; Department of Justice, including the FBI; DoD, including the NSA; Department of Commerce, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST); and any other executive agencies the Chairperson designates. Within 90 days of the bill's enactment, each agency represented on the Council is required to designate a lead representative who is an expert in SCRM, acquisitions, or information and communications technology. Each agency's lead representative is tasked with ensuring that their agency leadership and subject matter experts are kept apprised of the Council's business. The Director of OMB is required to designate a senior-level OMB official to serve as the Council's Chairperson. The Chairperson is tasked with several functions, including developing a charter for the Council. The Council is required to meet within 180 days after enactment and at least every quarter thereafter.Sec. 1323. Functions and authoritiesThis section delineates the functions and authorities granted to the Council.New subsection (a) outlines that the Council is required to perform several functions, including but not limited to: (1) recommending NIST to develop SCRM standards and practices for executive agencies; (2) developing criteria for sharing information regarding supply chain risk; (3) identifying an executive agency to act as a "clearing house" for several functions, including receiving supply chain risk information submitted by other executive agencies and facilitating the sharing of that information to support supply chain risk analyses; (4) identifying executive agencies to provide shared services and common contract solutions to support SCRM; (5) issuing guidance on any other steps necessary to address supply chain risks that may arise when executive agencies provide shared services, common contract solutions, acquisitions vehicles, or assisted acquisitions; and (6) engaging with the private sector and other nongovernmental stakeholders on SCRM in the acquisition process, as appropriate.New subsection (b) states that, in its sole and unreviewable discretion, the Council may establish a program office and any other bodies it deems appropriate for the purpose of carrying out its functions.New subsection (c) details the authority the Council has to issue exclusion or removal orders. The Council is required to establish criteria and procedures for several actions, including for: (1) recommending orders for executive agencies requiring the exclusion of sources or covered articles from executive agencies procurement actions, also known as "exclusion orders;" (2) recommending orders for executive agencies requiring the removal of covered articles from executive agency information systems, also known as "removal orders;" (3) requesting and approving exceptions to issued exclusion or removal orders; and (4) ensuring that any recommended orders do not conflict with standards issued under section 11331 of title 40 and that the Director of NIST is consulted with regarding any orders that would implement standards developed by NIST. Using these established criteria, the Council will make recommendations regarding the exclusion of sources or covered articles from any executive agency procurement action or the removal of covered articles from executive agency information systems. Recommendations must include several important components, including, but not limited to, information regarding the scope and applicability of the recommended exclusion or removal order and a summary of any risk assessment reviewed or made in support of the order.New subsection (c) also states that the Council is required to issue a notice of its recommendation to any source named in the recommendation. This is intended to provide notice to the source that a recommendation has been made; of the criteria the Council relied on in making the recommendation; and that the source has 30 days after receipt of the notice to submit information and argument in opposition of the recommendation.New subsection (c) also details how exclusion and removal order recommendations become operable. Exclusion and removal order recommendations issued by the Council will be reviewed by the Secretary of DHS, for orders applicable to civilian agencies, to the extent not covered by clause (ii) and (iii); by the Secretary of DoD, for orders applicable to the DoD and national security systems other than sensitive compartmented information systems; and the Director of National Intelligence, for orders applicable to the intelligence community and sensitive compartmented information. These officials have sole and unreviewable discretion to issue exclusion and removal orders based upon the Council's recommendations. If officials from DHS, DoD, and ODNI issue orders collectively resulting in a government-wide exclusion, the Administrator of GSA and officials at other agencies responsible for management of the Federal Supply Schedule and government-wide acquisition and multi-agency contracts must help facilitate implementation of the orders by removing the identified covered articles or sources from contracts. Exclusion and removal orders must be reviewed at least annually by the issuing officials. An authorized official from the relevant issuing agency may rescind exclusion and removal orders. Once such an order has been issued, the issuing official must provide notice to any source named in the order. The issuing official must also notify the appropriate congressional committees and the aforementioned agency selected to be the "clearing house" for such information. All executive agencies are required to comply with exclusion and removal orders.New subsection (d) states that the Council may request any information from executive agencies it deems necessary to carry out its functions.New subsection (e) states that the Council must consult and coordinate, as appropriate, with other relevant councils.New subsection (f) states that nothing in this section limits the authority of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy to carry out its responsibilities.Sec. 1324. Strategic planThis section requires the Council to create a strategic plan for addressing supply chain risks posed by the acquisition of covered articles within 180 days of enactment. The necessary components of this plan include, but are not limited to: (1) an identification and promulgation of best practices for executive agencies to assess and mitigate supply chain risks; (2) an evaluation of the effect of implanting new policies or procedures on existing contracts; and (3) a plan for the identification and mitigation of supply chain risks from existing and prospective information and communications technology made available to executive agencies by other executive agencies. This plan is due to Congress within seven days after completion.Sec. 1325. Annual reportThe Chairperson of the Council is required to submit an annual report to Congress on the Council's activities before December 31 of each year.Sec. 1326. Requirements for executive agenciesThis section outlines the responsibilities of each executive agency head for SCRM, which include, but are not limited to: (1) assessing the supply chain risk posed by the acquisition of covered articles and either avoiding, mitigating, accepting, or transferring that risk; and (2) prioritizing such assessments based on the criticality of the mission or asset. This section also includes clarifications for interagency acquisitions and assisted acquisitions. For interagencyacquisitions, in which one agency purchases supplies or services using another agency's contract, SCRM activities are the responsibility of the funding agency. For assisted acquisitions, in which an agency performs acquisition-related functions on behalf of another agency, it is required that the parties negotiate the assignment of responsibilities. The Secretary of DHS may assist executive agencies in conducting risk assessments and provide additional tools as necessary in support of such actions.Sec. 1327. Judicial review proceduresThis section outlines the judicial review procedures applicable to an action taken under Sec. 1323 or Sec. 4713 of this title. New subsection (a) clarifies that any action taken under either Sec. 1323 or Sec. 4713 is not reviewable, either by administrative review or judicial review, including bid protests before the Government Accountability Office or in any Federal court.New subsection (b) describes the process for petitioning exclusion or removal orders. After a party has been notified of an exclusion or removal order under Sec. 1323 or a covered procurement action under section Sec. 4713, the party has 60 days to file a petition for judicial review in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ("court"). The court will rule that a covered action taken under Sec. 1323 or Sec. 4713 is unlawful if it is: (1) arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion; (2) contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity; (3) in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitation, or short of statutory right; (4) lacking substantial support in the administrative record taken as a whole or in classified information submitted to the court; or (5) not in accordance with procedures required by law. The court has exclusive jurisdiction over claims arising under these sections against the U.S., any U.S. department or agency, or any component or official of any such department or agency, subject to review by the U.S. Supreme Court.New subsection (b) also describes the contents and procedures for the administrative record, which will apply to the review of a petition. The U.S. is required to file an administrative record with the court, which consists of the information that the appropriate official relied on when taking an action under Sec. 1323 or Sec. 4713. Information that is both unclassified and non-privileged in the administrative record will be provided to the petitioner, with appropriate protections for any information that is privileged or confidential. The following information may be included in the administrative record and will only be submitted to the court ex parte and in camera: (1) classified information; (2) sensitive security information; (3) privileged law enforcement information; (4) information obtained or derived from any activity authorized under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, with several exceptions; and (5) information subject to privilege or protections under any other provision of law. Any of the previously described information must remain under seal. The administrative record must be returned after the time to seek further review has ended or after further proceedings have concluded. Any determination made by the court under this subsection is the exclusive remedy. In this section, the term "classified information" not only has the meaning given the term in 1(a) of the Classified Information Procedures Act, but also includes any information that the government has determined to require protection for reasons of national security and any restricted data, as defined in section 11 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.Sec. 1327. TerminationThis section states that the subchapter terminates five years after the day of enactment. Amendments made by this section take effect 90 days after the day of enactment and apply to contracts that are awarded before, on, or after that date. The Federal Acquisition Security Council must prescribe an interim final rule to implement subchapter III of chapter 13 of title 41, U.S.C. within one year of enactment, and the Council must issue a final rule no later than one year after prescribing that interim final rule. If the Council does not issue a final rule in that time frame, the Council will be required to submit a report to Congress explaining why they failed to do so.Sec. 3. Authorities of Executive Agencies relating to mitigating supply chain risks in the procurement of covered articlesSection 3 of the bill amends chapter 47 of title 41, U.S.C., by adding the following new section to the end:Sec. 14713. Authorities relating to mitigating supply chain risks in the procurement of covered articlesNew subsection (a) establishes that heads of executive agencies have the authority to carry out a covered procurement action and to limit the disclosure of information relating to their basis for doing so.New subsection (b) provides that an agency head may carry out a covered procurement action, absent an urgent national security interest, only after (1) obtaining a joint recommendation from the agency's CIO and chief acquisition officer, or comparable officials; (2) providing notice of the joint recommendation to any source named in the joint recommendation; (3) making a written determination that the use of the authority is, among other things, necessary to protect national security by reducing supply chain risk; and (4) providing notice of the determination to Congress. Any named sources must be provided with a notice containing the following information: (1) that a recommendation is being considered or has been made; (2) what information formed the basis for the recommendation, to the extent consistent with national security interests; (3) that the source has 30 days after receipt to submit an argument against the recommendation; and (4) what procedures govern the consideration of that submission.New subsection (c) provides an exception for cases in which an agency head determines that an urgent national security interest necessitates the immediate exercise of the authority provided in new subsection (a). This exception allows agency heads to, among other things, temporarily delay sending notice to named sources; however, agency heads are required to comply with all of the requirements of new subsection (b) as soon as practicable after the urgency has passed.New subsection (d) states that an agency head may not delegate these authorities to an official below the level one level below the Deputy Secretary or Principal Deputy Director, except that the Secretary of Defense may delegate authority for removal orders to the Commander of U.S. Cyber Command.New subsection (e) states that if an agency head has made the decision to limit the disclosure of information relating to their basis for carrying out a covered procurement action, that official must notify the aforementioned agency identified as a "clearing house" for such SCRM-related information.New subsection (f) requires agency heads to annually review any covered procurement actions.New subsection (g) requires the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council to prescribe any regulations necessary to implement this section.New subsection (h) requires the head of each agency to submit a report to Congress, at least annually, summarizing the actions taken under this section.New subsection (i) states that this section applies to the DoD, Coast Guard, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration, notwithstanding Sec. 3101(c)(1)(A) of this title.New subsection (j) provides that the authority provided under subsection (a) terminates in 5 years.New subsection (k) defines the terms "appropriate congressional committees and leadership;" "covered article;" "covered procurement;" "covered procurement action;" "information and communications technology;" and "supply chain risk."Sec. 4. Federal Information Security Modernization ActNew subsection (a) amends the Federal Information Security Modernization Act to provide references to several provisions in this bill and to add a new SCRM-related provision. That Act provides a government-wide framework for the oversight and security of non-national security Federal executive branch information security.New subsection (b) contains a rule of construction, clarifying that nothing in this bill alters or impedes any authority or responsibility under Sec. 3553 of title 44, U.S.C., which addresses the authorities and functions of the Director of OMB and Secretary of DHS under the Federal Information Security Modernization Act.Sec. 5. Effective dateSection 5 states that this bill will take effect 90 days after enactment.V. Evaluation of Regulatory ImpactPursuant to the requirements of paragraph 11(b) of rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, the Committee has considered the regulatory impact of this bill and determined that the bill will have no regulatory impact within the meaning of the rules. The Committee agrees with the Congressional Budget Office's statement that the bill contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments.VI. Congressional Budget Office Cost EstimateU.S. Congress, Congressional Budget Office, Washington, DC, November 28, 2018.Hon. Ron Johnson, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 3085, the Federal Acquisition Supply Chain Security Act of 2018.If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Matthew Pickford, who can be reached at 226-2860.Sincerely,Keith Hall, Director.Enclosure,S. 3085--Federal Acquisition Supply Chain Security Act of 2018S. 3085 would create the Federal Acquisition Security Council, which would work to mitigate security risks that may arise from information technology (IT), telecommunications services, and other goods and services procured by the federal government. The council would consist of representatives from at least 11 departments and agencies and a representative from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) would serve as chair of the council.Under the bill, the council would look at the security of the entire supply chain for goods and services procured by the government including threats from terrorism, piracy, and theft in both the real world and cyber space. (The term supply chain refers to the total number of organizations, individuals, and processes involved in producing and selling something to a final user.) Primary responsibilities for the council would include:Developing criteria for assessing threats and vulnerabilities to the supply chain, andIssuing guidance on risks to the supply chain and how to address such risks.Using information from OMB and based on the scope of the council's responsibilities, CBO estimates that when fully implemented the council would spend about $2 million annually; most of that would be for the cost of about 10 employees. CBO estimates that implementing S. 3085 would cost $10 million over the 2019-2023 period; any spending would be subject to the availability of appropriated funds.S. 3085 also would allow agencies to change their procurement actions based on expected risks to the agency from different acquisitions. Those changes would involve preparing risk management plans and strategies to assess risks to the supply chain prior to purchasing and goods or services.CBO is unaware of any comprehensive information on the security of the government's supply chain. CBO aims to produce estimates that generally reflect the middle of a range of most likely outcomes that would result if the legislation was enacted. However, CBO cannot determine how agencies currently handle supply chain risks nor how many resources are devoted to those activities. In addition, what policies, procedures, or guidance the new council would provide to agencies is not clear. Finally, under existing authority initially provided by section 806 of Public Law 111-383 and recently reauthorized by section 881 of the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 115-232), the Department of Defense can currently perform many of the activities described in section 3 of S. 3085. However, CBO cannot determine whether those authorities have ever been used. Thus, CBO cannot estimate whether implementing that section would have costs or savings for government agencies.CBO expects that agencies would continue to procure goods and services at the lowest price available and that issues involving supply chain risk would not significantly increase or decrease the costs of goods and services procured by the government.Enacting S. 3085 could affect direct spending by agencies that are authorized to use receipts from the sale of goods, fees, and other collections to cover operating costs. Therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures apply. Because most agencies can adjust the amounts collected as operating costs change, CBO estimates that any ntchanges in direct spending by those agencies would be negligible. Enacting the bill would not affect revenues.CBO estimates that enacting S. 3085 would not increase net direct spending or on-budget deficits in any of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2029.S. 3085 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform ActThe CBO staff contacts for this estimate are Matthew Pickford and Ray Hall. The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Assistant Director for Budget Analysis.VII.

China injects 110 billion dollars into the economy in the face of the US trade warCE Noticias Financieras EnglishOctober 8, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 496 wordsBody        China has announced that it will reduce commercial banks' reserve money, allowing them to free 110 billion US dollars in credit, and mitigate the impact of the trade war with Washington.  The Chinese People's Bank (central bank) said on Sunday it would cut the 1% reserve ratio by October 15 to ensure "reasonable credit growth" and boost economic development.  Analysts said the ruling was a sign of Beijing's growing concern about the impact on the domestic economy of trade disputes with the United States.  "This is a sign of easing monetary policy aimed at countering the effects of the US / China trade war, and shows Beijing's determination to keep pace with [economic] growth," Liao Qun, an economist at China Citic Bank.  Zhang Ming, a Chinese Academy of Social Sciences researcher, said in a statement that the central bank measure is Beijing's response to the economic slowdown over trade disputes.  "Deepening trade disputes with the US will reduce the burden of foreign trade on growth," he said.  Several economic indicators point to a slowdown in the pace of growth of the Chinese economy.  In September, China's manufacturing activity fell to the lowest level since February, as export orders and production and inventory declined.  In tourism, spending on the first four days of the 'golden week' [holiday week marking the anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1] increased by 8.1% year on year after, in the year 21%, according to official data.  And since the start of trade disputes between Washington and Beijing, the Shanghai stock market has fallen more than 20%.  The reduction in mandatory reserve rates, for the fourth time this year, also contrasts with US monetary policy.  At the end of September, the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 25 basis points, the third increase since the beginning of the year to the highest level of the last decade.  Economist at the French bank Natixis in Hong Kong, Xu Jianwei said the Chinese government has no choice but to adopt a different monetary policy from the US.  "In a trade war, the Chinese economy will face more difficulties, given the lower confidence of investors ... China has to inject more liquidity [into the economy]," he said.  US President Donald Trump has already imposed a $ 250 billion ($ 217 billion) import duty on imports from the Asian country. Beijing retaliated with fees on American goods.  This is Beijing's policy for the technology sector, namely the "Made in China 2025" plan, which aims to transform the country into a technological powerhouse with capabilities in high added value sectors such as artificial intelligence, renewable energy, robotics and cars electrical installations.  The US considered that the Chinese-led plan violates China's commitments to open up its market, notably by forcing foreign companies to transfer technology and subsidizing domestic enterprises while protecting them from foreign competition. Load-Date: October 8, 2018End of Document

White House trade adviser Navarro on tariffs: 'The ball's in China's court'CNN.comOctober 23, 2018 Tuesday 7:06 PM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICSLength: 427 wordsByline: By Katie Lobosco, CNNDateline: New York BodyWhite House trade adviser Peter Navarro wouldn't offer a time frame Tuesday for how long it will take President Donald Trump to reach a trade deal with China amid escalating rounds of tariffs."The ball's in China's court," he said in an interview with CNN chief business correspondent Christine Romans.Trade talks between the two countries stalled after Trump said in September that he'd move forward with his biggest round of tariffs yet, hitting $200 billion of imports.To date, the United States has imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods, roughly half the value of all Chinese goods sold to the United States last year.Trump has said he will increase the tariff rate from 10% to 25% on most of those imports by the end of the year if China doesn't agree to change its trade practices.Hitting hard on trade, particularly on China, has been a centerpiece of Trump's presidency after he promised to hold other countries accountable for engaging in unfair trade practices during the campaign.He's pushed forward with more tariffs even though he's met repeatedly with Chinese President Xi Jinping and at one point said he "didn't blame China" for taking advantage of the differences between the way the two do business.White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Tuesday that Trump is expected to meet with Xi on the sidelines of the upcoming G20 summit in Argentina. But Navarro downplayed the meeting, saying it's "not a trade negotiation by any means."A report released by Navarro's office earlier this year accused China for engaging in unfair trade practices detailing the ways China's "economic aggression" threatens the technology and intellectual property of businesses around the world.But the Chinese have yet to address those issues, Navarro said Tuesday. In fact, he believes some practices have gotten worse."They're moving in the opposite direction," Navarro said."There are thousands and thousands of people who work for the Chinese government just hammering us, hammering us through cyber-espionage," he said.China has retaliated with its own tariffs on US goods. But it imports far less from the United States than it exports back, and is running out of new products to target.Beijing could try other measures to escalate the trade war, including charging even higher tariffs, imposing import quotas, restricting Chinese citizens' travel to the United States for study and tourism and slashing taxes for companies affected by the tariffs.CLARIFICATION: This headline and story were updated to fix a grammatical error in the transcript.Load-Date: October 25, 2018End of Document

HUAWEI IS THE DOORWAY TO CHINA'S POLICE STATEStates News ServiceDecember 12, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 676 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Center for the National Interest (former the Nixon Center):The free world should be worried about the creation of a police state under the technology umbrella of Huawei.by Dan BlumenthalThe arrest of Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou was apparently a long time coming. U.S. investigators began looking into Huawei's dealings when Iran's once Chinese-backed ZTE was identified as a sanctions-breaker. U.S. prosecutors now appear to have substantial evidence of the Chinese Communist Party's state-backed mobile and technology company's violations of the sanctions regime against Iran.The arrest and call for extradition spotlights just how concerned the free world should be about Huawei. The stakes are high, as the company is positioned to be the dominant player in 5G mobile networks. If Huawei wins this competition against U.S. companies, much of the world's data will pass through the mobile networks of a CCP-backed company that does business with the world's most troubling regimes. Huawei is also the critical player in CCP General-Secretary Xi Jinping's bid to establish a high-tech police state and to leapfrog the United States in critical technologies that will enable a host of military capabilities.The CCP is already collecting enough data from Chinese citizens who use mobile networks, search engines, and online purchasing systems to establish a "Social Credit System." To say that this system is Orwellian is an understatement. Even George Orwell could not have imagined the new technology of totalitarianism.The Chinese government plan is to have a database on Chinese citizens' consumer preferences, personal activities, and habits to give each one a "score" based on loyalty to the party and other behaviors deemed by party leaders to make for good citizens. This score will determine if Chinese citizens are accepted to colleges, can get good jobs, buy a house, and so much more. It is nothing less than an attempt to perfect the world's first ever high-tech police state.Huawei will continue to play a big role in the creation of this system. But Huawei is an international company with high ambitions. An almost unimaginable amount of global data will flow through the next generation of mobile technology. This is partly the reason why 5G and artificial intelligence are so closely related: the companies with the most access to data will be able to train the best AI systems.Thus, this CCP-backed company is poised to determine the future of how people use everything, from transportation to health care. If it wins the global race to become the dominant player in mobile technology, then the rest of the world could lose control over the use and integrity of data to the CCP colossus. Regardless of Huawei's protestations that it is a private company, Chinese laws require companies doing business in China to share data that the party deems necessary for national security. And, notwithstanding the passage of strict data laws in places like Europe, there will no way to guarantee the integrity and use of data if it flows through a CCP-made 5G system. The CCP may not own Huawei, but it is benefitting from the massive amounts of 5G and AI related research and development, the abuse of Chinese patenting and anti-monopoly laws that put competitors at a disadvantage, the absence of ethical restrictions in China, and the use of AI technologies.Thus, the recent arrest reveals just one element of Huawei breaking of international laws and practices. And, the Chinese Communist Party's attempt to browbeat Canada to break its own laws shows how close Huawei and the party really are. If Beijing succeeds in its years-long plan for Huawei to become the dominant player the mobile industry, then it will be Chinanot the Westsetting the 'rules of the road' for the next generation of technology. Given Huawei's record, this is a truly troublesome future to consider.Dan Blumenthal is the director of Asian Studies at AEI. He consults with U.S. technologies companies as well.Load-Date: December 13, 2018End of Document

China gets US tariff delay but movement on tech unclearAssociated Press Financial WireDecember 3, 2018 Monday 3:11 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 1040 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - Buy more U.S. exports? Done. Tinker with technology tactics that irk Washington and other trading partners? Maybe. But scrap those plans, seen by Beijing as a path to prosperity and influence? Probably never.The agreement by President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on a cease fire on tariffs postpones the threat of more disruption for China's exporters and their Asian suppliers. Some economists said Xi might be ready to negotiate in earnest.Still, Beijing gave no sign of a changed stance on technology ambitions that Washington says violate Chinese market-opening obligations and might threaten U.S. industrial leadership.Trump's complaints strike at the heart of the ruling Communist Party's state-led economic model and plans to restore China to its rightful place as a political and culture leader by creating global champions in robotics and other fields."It's impossible for China to cancel its industry policies or major industry and technology development plans," said economist Cui Fan of the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing.At his weekend meeting with Xi in Argentina, Trump agreed to postpone planned U.S. tariff hikes on Chinese imports by 90 days while the two sides negotiate. Xi revived promises to narrow China's multibillion-dollar trade surplus with the United States by purchasing more American exports.The outcome was "as good as we could have expected," the chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, William Zarit, said in a statement.Also late Sunday, Trump said on Twitter that Beijing agreed to cut import duties on U.S. autos. There was no Chinese confirmation of the move, which would have little impact on trade because most American vehicles sold in China are made here.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters at the White House Monday that there was an "an immediate focus on reducing auto tariffs," though he did not provide details or timing. Asked if there was a specific agreement to remove the tariffs, he said: "yes, there was."Mnuchin stressed that the two leaders had detailed conversations on 142 items and said the goal now was to turn the talks into a "real agreement." He said both leaders had extended invitations to visit their respective countries and said he expects them to meet in the "near future."Asian stocks markets rose Monday following the agreement. China's main market index gained 2.7 percent, while Tokyo rose 1 percent. Hong Kong, Sydney and Seoul also advanced.Trump's promise gives Xi political room to negotiate after Beijing said earlier talks were impossible while Washington "holds a knife" of tariff threats to China's throat. But both leaders face a mix of economic nationalists, free trade advocates and other conflicting forces at home.The outcome wasn't the result of a "significant change" by China, Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics said in a report. Washington instead chose to see Beijing's argument that it already is making changes "in a more positive light."One sign of how far apart the two sides are: China's foreign minister announced in Buenos Aires that Trump agreed to stop raising tariffs, rather than that he promised a 90-day suspension. Wang Yi failed to mention industrial policy or Trump's demand that Beijing make progress toward changing it or face renewed increases.Those omissions suggest Beijing doesn't recognize how important those demands are to Trump, said Nick Marro of the Economist Intelligence Unit."As a result we expect trade hostilities to resume in 2019," Marro said in a report.Trump imposed a tariff hike of 25 percent on $50 billion of Chinese imports in July over complaints Beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology. Trump hit an additional $200 billion of Chinese goods with a 10 percent tariff that had been due to rise to 25 percent on Jan. 1.China retaliated by raising its own charges on U.S. imports.Beijing has tried without success to recruit France, Germany, Japan and other government as allies against Trump. They dislike the American president's tactics but echo U.S. complaints about market barriers.Xi's government has offered to alter details but rejects pressure to discard blueprints such as "Made in China 2025," which calls for creation of champions in artificial intelligence, electric cars and other industries.Those are "central to Xi's core agenda of making China an innovation superpower" and linked to "geopolitical competition" with Washington, said Michael Hirson, Jeffrey Wright and Paul Triolo of Eurasia Group in a report.Still, Kuijs said Chinese leaders might have hinted to the Americans of possible concessions.China has its own grievances. Beijing is unhappy with U.S. limits on exports of "dual use" technology with possible military applications. Xi's government complains Chinese companies are treated unfairly in American security reviews of proposed corporate acquisitions, even though nearly all deals are approved unchanged."China hopes the United States will treat Chinese companies equally," said Song Lifan, an economist at Renmin University in Beijing.Cui put the odds of an agreement at "higher than 50 percent" but said he had no idea how long that might take.The tariffs battle has overshadowed changes Xi's government has announced this year.While Beijing retaliated for U.S. tariff hikes by imposing penalty charges on American soybeans, autos and other goods, it cut duties on factory machinery and other imports from other countries.The government also has promised to ease limits on foreign ownership of automakers, insurance ventures and other companies.Business groups have welcomed those changes but say they don't address more important complaints about a thicket of rules limiting access to China's finance, logistics and other industries.Companies want a genuine response with measurable goals, said Kenneth Jarrett, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, in an email.A measure of progress will be whether Beijing offers "meaningful concessions" on technology, said Hirson, Wright and Triolo of Eurasia Group.Without that, hardliners in Washington "will urge Trump to resume escalation," they said.___AP Researcher Henry Hou contributed.Load-Date: December 4, 2018End of Document

By attacking Huawei, one of the most successful firms in the country, "it will provoke an anti-American sentiment in China."  "The incident could become a turning point," he added.  Last month, New Zealand prevented a mobile phone company from using Huawei equipment, saying it was a "significant risk to network security." In August, Australia vetoed the company to work in the country's fifth-generation network for security fears.

Trade Tension Tightens Screws on China's Market MoversRealMoneyNovember 9, 2018 Friday 12:54 PM EDTCopyright 2018 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 597 wordsByline: Kevin CurranHighlight: The trade temperature is only heating up.BodyChinese stocks are taking a hit on Friday as trade tension tightens the screws on China's biggest market movers.Even stocks that are set to benefit from the "Singles Day" bonanza on Sunday are taking a beating on Friday as prospects of an "economic iron curtain" linger in investors' minds.Real Money "Stock of the Day" Alibaba  has fallen by almost 4% and JD.com  has sagged as much as 2% in morning trading. Their stocks have mirrored the drop of the Shanghai Index, which has been dragged down by the worrisome trade data released Tuesday night."Strong export data in October shows that Chinese exporters are worried that U.S. tariffs will increase in January 2019," a report from ING Group greater China economist Iris Pang explains. "We expect this front-loading behavior to continue for the rest of 2018, as we don't think the Xi-Trump meeting at the G20 will yield positive results."She noted that the front-loading bodes poorly for and leaves her group with a pessimistic view on Chinese trade for 2019. The bearish outlook comes amid the slowest growth for the Chinese economy since 2009.Deceleration in the economy and worsening trade relations pose significant harm to companies like JD and Alibaba given their reliance on  on retail,  , and  .Further slowdowns would be problematic given the already weakening domestic consumption that Alibaba relies upon.To be sure, some trade problems might be alleviated as China weakens the yuan and makes overtures to new trading partners to fill the United States shaped hole in its trade equation."No country, in my view, will 'divorce' a major nation that remains, even amid a slowdown, among the world's fastest growing major economies," former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson said at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum on Wednesday.Paulson speculated that China will simply move on to other trading partners in the far East and continue to strengthen without President Donald Trump.He added that he hopes there is a revival of the Trans-Pacific Partnership at some point in order to rekindle warmer Sino-American trade and the United States being frozen out.Such an arrangement would certainly reverse the fortune of major Chinese companies in technology and ecommerce and possibly unlock more value for shareholders of the companies given a much rosier relationship.For now, the market and most experts are pricing the probability of Paulson's preferred scenario at about zero percent while Trump remains in office.This minimized probability is especially likely as White House National Trade Council Policy Director Peter Navarro turns up the temperature on trade."Consider the shuttle diplomacy that is now going on by a self-appointed group of Wall street bankers and hedge fund managers," he railed at the Center for Strategic and International Studies on Friday morning. "As part of a Chinese government influenced operation, these globalist billionaires are putting a full-court press on the White House in advance of the G-20."Navarro said that Trump will not fold to the demands of "unregistered foreign agents" on Wall Street and would make a deal on his own terms."If Wall Street is involved and continues to insinuate itself into negotiations, there will be a stench around any deal that is consummated because it will have the imprimatur of Goldman Sachs and Wall Street," he said. "If [Wall Street firms] want to do good, then spend their billions in Dayton, Ohio."Optimism heading into the Buenos Aires G20 meeting at the end of the month is justifiably muted and Chinese stocks could continue sinking as a result.Load-Date: November 10, 2018End of Document

Inside China's Silicon Valley: From copycats to innovationCNN.comNovember 15, 2018 Thursday 11:18 PM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: TECHLength: 855 wordsByline: By Matt Rivers, CNNBodyAt the Huaqiangbei Market in Shenzhen, you can build a smartphone from scratch in a couple of hours.Spread over several floors and covering hundreds of thousands of square feet, the market is home to vendors selling the parts that make up your standard phone ? cameras, motherboards, frames, screens and so on. All you have to do is buy the right bits and know how to put them all together.And it's not just smartphones. You can find the parts here for almost any consumer electronics device you can think of, like portable power banks and drones.To be sure, there is copycatting going on here. The designs of Apple (AAPL) or Samsung devices are regularly ripped off. Intellectual property rights, one of the US government's biggest bugbears with China, are nonexistent. But there's invention at work, too. Some people are trying to use the parts to come up with new and improved versions of existing gadgets.The whirling, chaotic market highlights how innovation sometimes works in China. Experts say viewing the country as just a vast manufacturing base for products designed by foreign companies is outdated and misguided."There's a ton of innovations at a huge scale that are happening in China," said Christian Grewell, a business professor at NYU Shanghai. "They are just happening very, very quickly and without the knowledge of the rest of us."He pointed to how smartphone maker Xiaomi has updated its software based on user feedback, and China's rapid adoption of digital payments through Tencent's (TCEHY) WeChat app and Ant Financial's Alipay.Hardware hubOnce a tiny fishing village in the shadow of nearby Hong Kong, Shenzhen is now a glittering metropolis of more than 12 million people.Along with other cities spread across Southern China's Pearl River Delta, it rose to prominence in the 80s and 90s as the world's factory floor, pumping out boatloads of industrial and consumer products. But today it's also widely known as China's answer to Silicon Valley, the home of tech giants like Tencent and Huawei.Shenzhen has become a magnet for ambitious young entrepreneurs seeking to take advantage of the city's position at the heart of global tech supply chains. It has produced startups like DJI, the world's top maker of non-military drones."If you have an idea, you can quickly evaluate this idea and find factories to manufacture the product for you," said Jasen Wang, CEO of tech education startup Makeblock.The company produces kits that kids can use to build things like race cars and walking robots ? and then program them. Makeblock's products and software are designed to teach children the language of computer programming in a fun way.Shenzhen provides a ready supply of the hardware needed by his company, which was valued around $350 million in its last fundraising round. And it also has the human talent."There are so many big companies here, it's very easy to find hardware development engineers," Wang said. "You don't have that kind of advantage in Beijing or Shanghai."Moving fastShenzhen also gets things done quickly."If you really want to develop products in a fast pace, I think you have to be in China ? and practically have to be in Shenzhen," said Steven Yang, CEO of battery technology company Anker Innovations. "Anything you have to do in days or weeks elsewhere can be done in hours here."Yang, a 36-year-old former Google (GOOGL) employee, has built Anker into one of the top makers of portable power banks for smartphones and other devices. It generated revenue of well of over $500 million last year, and its products sell on Amazon (AMZN) and at Walmart (WMT).Ten years ago, Shenzhen was 90% about copycatting and 10% innovation, according to Yang. Now, it's 70% innovation and 30% copycatting, he suggests.Foreign businesses agree that Chinese companies are upping their game.In an annual survey by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, this was the first year that a majority of respondents said they view Chinese companies as "equally or more innovative than European firms."Counterfeiting still rifeWhile genuine innovation is happening in Shenzhen, so are trademark infringement and intellectual property theft. The counterfeiting industry is still massive, with fake iPhones and Nike (NKE) sneakers prominently on sale.Anker suffered from knockoffs in its early days, but authorities are gradually taking a tougher line on copycats, according to Yang."I think it's getting better year over year," he said.The Trump administration remains unconvinced. It has cited Chinese theft of American intellectual property as one of the main reasons for the trade war between the two giant economies.Experts say the Chinese government needs to do more if it wants to become a global tech powerhouse."China does want to see a few of their local firms take on world markets. And they are making lot of bets in various places" such as electric vehicles and artificial intelligence, NYU Shanghai's Grewell said."For China to go send its innovations overseas," he added, "I think it's got to fully join the international community in protecting some of that intellectual property."Load-Date: November 24, 2018End of Document

DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY STATEMENT ON CHINESE HACKING OF GLOBAL MANAGED SERVICE PROVIDERSCQ Federal Department and Agency Documents REGULATORY INTELLIGENCE DATADecember 20, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 Congressional Quarterly, Inc. All Rights Reserved.Length: 405 wordsBodyAGENCY: DEPARTMENT OF ENERGYSIC-MAJOR-GROUP: 05 - EnvironmentCONTACT: 202-586-5000WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, the U.S. Government is announcing that a group of Chinese cyber actors, known publicly as APT 10, is carrying out a campaign of cyber-enabled theft targeting global managed service providers, cloud service providers, and their clients. APT 10 is operating on behalf of the Chinese Ministry of State Security. Over the past four years APT 10 compromised and gained extensive access to multiple U.S. and global managed service and cloud providers. They infiltrated these providers' clients, including global companies located in at least 12 countries. The U.S. Government is taking steps to mitigate the impacts of this activity and hold the Chinese government accountable for these unacceptable actions."As the Secretary for the Sector Specific Agency for cybersecurity in the energy sector, I have no higher priority than protecting our nation's energy infrastructure against the threat of cyberattacks," said Secretary of Energy Rick Perry. "Malicious actors are conducting sophisticated attacks to threaten our Nation's critical infrastructure. Today's announcement affirms our government's vigilance and resolve to respond swiftly and forcefully against those who would use technology to threaten our way of life."Since at least 2014, APT 10 compromised the administrative credentials of managed service providers and then infiltrated their clients' networks. Using a mix of sophisticated custom malware and off-the-shelf applications, they stole intellectual property and other confidential business information.

DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY STATEMENT ON CHINESE HACKING OF GLOBAL MANAGED SERVICE PROVIDERSStates News ServiceDecember 20, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 410 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the U.S. Department of Energy:Today, the U.S. Government is announcing that a group of Chinese cyber actors, known publicly as APT 10, is carrying out a campaign of cyber-enabled theft targeting global managed service providers, cloud service providers, and their clients. APT 10 is operating on behalf of the Chinese Ministry of State Security. Over the past four years APT 10 compromised and gained extensive access to multiple U.S. and global managed service and cloud providers. They infiltrated these providers' clients, including global companies located in at least 12 countries. The U.S. Government is taking steps to mitigate the impacts of this activity and hold the Chinese government accountable for these unacceptable actions."As the Secretary for the Sector Specific Agency for cybersecurity in the energy sector, I have no higher priority than protecting our nation's energy infrastructure against the threat of cyberattacks," said Secretary of Energy Rick Perry. "Malicious actors are conducting sophisticated attacks to threaten our Nation's critical infrastructure. Today's announcement affirms our government's vigilance and resolve to respond swiftly and forcefully against those who would use technology to threaten our way of life."Since at least 2014, APT 10 compromised the administrative credentials of managed service providers and then infiltrated their clients' networks. Using a mix of sophisticated custom malware and off-the-shelf applications, they stole intellectual property and other confidential business information. APT 10 targeted information from companies responsible for critical infrastructure, including entities in the information technology, energy, healthcare and public health, communications, and critical manufacturing sectors."In our capacity to protect and coordinate with the energy sector, the Department of Energy is dedicated to working with our government and industry partners to strengthen the preparedness and resilience of both the electricity and oil and natural gas sectors," said Karen S. Evans, Assistant Secretary for Cybersecurity, Energy Security and Emergency Response (CESER).

Huawei, the engine of China's technological ambitionsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 13, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 562 wordsBody The surprise arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the financial director of Huawei Technologies Co., has thrown the company into a political storm and deepened a major threat: that more and more countries reject their switches, routers and phones due to a growing fear that Foreign spies can kidnap them.  But inside Huawei's Shenzhen headquarters, a secretive group of engineers works, indifferent to those risks, in artificial intelligence, cloud computing and chip technology, which is crucial for China's national priorities and for the future of Huawei. . While the trade war persists, the Chinese government has encouraged the creation of an industry less dependent on software and semiconductors in the United States. Far from slowing down those ambitions, Meng's arrest will hasten the fall of that "silicon curtain" when the US and China no longer provide each other with chips , wrote Gus Richard, an analyst at Northland Capital Markets, in a recent report. "Huawei is the emblem of China's rise in industrial power," he added.  Although a Canadian court granted bail to Meng, he must remain in the Vancouver area while awaiting possible extradition to the US. for accusations of fraud.  The company invests enormous resources in new technology and seeks to replicate the success it has had in other areas. In the last 10 years, the closed-end firm has become a giant in telecommunications equipment and networks, and is currently only behind Cisco Systems Inc., which is headquartered in San Jose, California. Then Huawei entered the smartphone market and surprised most of the observers by exceeding Apple this year in market share . In the September quarter, the Chinese company had 15% of the world's exports, only behind Samsung Electronics, according to data from IDC. Just two years before I had about 9% of the market.  The technical suitability of Huawei, coupled with its relationships with major Chinese companies and the government, could allow it to give another surprise in what many consider the backbone of future technology.  These ambitions coincide with the government's objectives. President Xi Jinping wants China to be a self-sufficient leader in semiconductors, and Huawei shows that it can do so . China wants to have a global impact, and Huawei has it. Xi wants China to move from basic manufacturing to more lucrative industries so that the country gets the benefits, and Huawei does too.  In the months prior to the arrest of the chief financial officer, US officials would have asked their counterparts in Germany and several other European countries to abandon Huawei equipment for 5G networks for security reasons. A representative of Deutsche Telekom declined to comment.  In a statement, a spokesperson for Huawei said the company operates in more than 170 countries and criticized the alleged request of US officials. "If the conduct of a government goes beyond its jurisdiction, that activity should not be encouraged," the spokesperson said.  Siow Meng Soh, analysis manager of GlobalData Plc, suggested that Huawei should turn to more receptive markets in Latin America and Africa, especially after the arrest of Meng Wanzhou in Canada. "He still has a lot of room to grow," he said. "Unless the US get your allies to stop buying you. "  The Huawei entrance, the engine of China's technological ambitions, was first published in La Tercera. Load-Date: December 13, 2018End of Document

Stories from Slate; Countries like Russia and China can redirect web traffic-and they aren't just trying to steal information.Slate MagazineNovember 16, 2018 Friday 8:22 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Washingtonpost.Newsweek Interactive Company, LLC. All Rights ReservedSection: FUTURE TENSE; TechnologyLength: 1255 wordsByline: Justin ShermanHighlight: It's Far Too Easy for Countries Like Russia and China to Hijack Internet TrafficBodyDid you have trouble accessing Google on Monday? If so, that's because another country may have hijacked your internet traffic.According to a Google blog post on the incident, users were temporarily unable to reach services for about an hour due to an issue "external" to the company. The Wall Street Journal            reports research firm ThousandEyes said that bad network instructions rerouted traffic to Russian network TransTelekom, Nigerian internet provider MainOne, and China Telecom. Any of these countries may have been involved, though Russia and China are the most likely suspects.Routing traffic through your borders is a way to view potentially sensitive information, from financial transactions to government documents. It's all possible thanks to the protocols that run the global internet, which weren't built with rigorous security in mind. But this sort of attack isn't just about gleaning valuable information; it's also about sowing distrust of the internet. Whether it's Russia posting fake news on social media or Chinese companies remotely stealing intellectual property, authoritarians have long taken, encouraged, or allowed actions that demonstrate the internet's insecurity and capacity for harm. It's all part of their ongoing international push to justify tight control of the internet, like censorship and surveillance, within their borders.These internet protocols are essentially the programmed rules that dictate how devices communicate. For instance, the Transmission Control Protocol handles the delivery of "data packets"-small units of data-from one device to another. The Internet Protocol provides the digital "addresses" that assist in data packet delivery. Another commonly known protocol is HTTP, the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, which communicates information between a web browser and a website's server. Together, the entire cluster of internet protocols form the code backbone of the global network. At the center of these protocols is trust, even though they weren't designed with security in mind. From global commerce to military communications to conversations with loved ones, we are meant to trust that these protocols will work properly and send information where requested.This recent incident is hardly the first time a foreign country may have rerouted American internet traffic by attacking this backbone of trust on the internet. A recent study published in the Journal of the Military Cyber Professionals Association showed how the Chinese government hijacks internet traffic from around the world by manipulating the Border Gateway Protocol, or BGP, which is used to route data sent over the internet. By            exploiting weaknesses in this protocol, an attacker can alter the path a piece of online information takes from location A to location B. The authors of the report found that China Telecom-the state-owned communications giant allegedly involved in the recent Google incident-does just this.China Telecom appears to use its presence in Western internet systems, they wrote, "to selectively redirect internet traffic through China." While BGP hijacking is complex, it's much easier with the help of a "complicit and preferably largescale" internet service provider that is more likely to be a central hub for global internet traffic. Since 2016 alone, the authors found that China used BGP hijacking to reroute traffic originally sent from Canada to Korea, the United States to Italy, Scandinavia to Japan, and Italy to Thailand. All in all, government websites, banks, and news organizations were just some of the impacted groups.In July 2018, my New America colleague Robert Morgus and I released a framework to study the internet on and through which countries project their power-an increasingly centralized, increasingly restricted, and certainly insecure internet, as opposed to the one imagined by liberal-democratic policymakers with properties like freedom and security. (Disclosure: New America is a partner with Slate and Arizona State University in Future Tense.) What we found was opportunities to undermine trust on many levels of the internet.The insecurity of the internet-as these recent events show-doesn't just apply to laptops and smartphones, but to the internet protocols that are far more vulnerable to manipulation than you might imagine (or hope). My web browser crashing won't impact everyone else's web browser functionality, but the failure of a single internet protocol like the Domain Name System or the Internet Protocol could catastrophically impact the way traffic is routed around the world. Undermining trust in these single points of failure (what, I believe, the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace means when they refer to the "public core" of the internet) undermines trust in the internet at a fundamental level in a way that hacks of specific devices don't.The incident with Google and the Journal of the Military Cyber Professionals Association study on China come on the back of other BGP hijackings, like when Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, and Google all experienced (unexpected) traffic rerouting through a Russian internet provider in 2017. Internet monitor BGPmon            called the incident "suspicious," with a significant impact despite its short lifespan (the hijack lasted a total of six minutes). "Whatever caused the incident," BGPmon wrote, "it's another clear example of how easy it is to re-route traffic for 3rd parties, intentionally or by accident."Not all internet protocol hijackings are of the Border Gateway Protocol, though. Attacks have hit other mechanisms (in addition to BGP) that ensure internet traffic is routed where intended. In April, hackers manipulated Amazon's "Route 53" system to redirect traffic through Russia and steal Ethereum cryptocurrency. In 2013, the Syrian Electronic Army            manipulated internet protocols to deface a series of websites, including those of theNew York Times, theWashington Post, Financial Times, theGuardian, and NPR. In 2010, Pentagon traffic was            routed through Beijing in another BGP hijacking, which potentially compromised information sent to and from U.S. government and military sites, including those for the secretary of defense's office. In 2008, Pakistan's state-owned telecommunications company            took YouTube offline when it took control of internet address protocols, rendering the site globally inaccessible. The list goes on.In response to this growing threat, there are several initiatives to bolster the security of internet routing protocols-including MANRS for Network Operators, which provides guidance to internet service providers on preventing hijacks, and            Internet Society's work on securing the Border Gateway Protocol. The Internet Engineering Task Force has previously run a working group on            Secure Inter-Domain Routing, and it currently has an            open working group on running the Domain Name System over a secure HTTPS connection (an idea worthy of separate discussion in and of itself).Still, policymakers must pay more attention to this issue. Authoritarian countries depend on the insecurity of the global internet to call for sovereign control of the internet within their borders-what is often termed "cyber sovereignty." Since the global internet is not safe when controlled by nongovernmental standards bodies, the logic goes, the government must exert near-complete to complete control over the network to make it safer. By better securing the internet, then, we can protect its core identity: as a global and open platform for everyone.Load-Date: November 17, 2018End of Document

Trump said in his Twitter account.  President Xi and I have a very strong and personal relationship. He and I are the only two people that can bring about massive and very positive change, on trade and far beyond, between our two great Nations. A solution for North Korea is a great thing for China and ALL!  - Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 3, 2018  Trump met this weekend with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, at the G20 Summit in Argentina and called that bilateral meeting "extraordinary".  The meeting between the two leaders in Buenos Aires was considered a key to reduce commercial tensions between the two countries, which began in July and have been in suspense since then to international markets.  At that meeting, the EU and China agreed to begin "immediately" negotiations on structural changes in the Chinese economy, among other issues, the White House reported.  Both powers will try to complete the talks "in the next 90 days," a period in which Trump agreed "to leave the tariff of Chinese products worth 200 billion dollars at the 10 percent level as of January 1. of 2019, and not raise them for now to 25 percent ", as planned.  For Louis Kujis, analyst at the consultancy Oxford Economics for Asia, "it is likely that the truce is mainly due to a change of mentality, possibly temporary, in the US."  "The space for a substantial agreement is quite narrow, fragile," the expert said today in a statement.  However, Kujis said that the postponement of levies and the resumption of dialogue and negotiations "are positive for the economy and asset markets."  As expected, investors reacted with joy to the commercial truce between the US and China, and Wall Street opened today with strong gains and the Industrial Dow Jones, its main indicator, rose 1.23 percent.  Half an hour after the opening of the session in the New York stock exchange, the main reference gained 315.39 points to 25,853.85, a rise that was also reflected in the selective S & P 500, which rose 1.02 percent or 28.03 units, to 2,788 20 whole  The "ceasefire" between the two world powers comes after a continuous exchange of coups between the US and China in recent months; a situation that has created a generalized alert and that has caused a slowdown in the forecasts of global economic growth.  In total, the US has imposed tariffs on Chinese products worth 250 billion dollars since July, and Trump had threatened to sanction goods for another 267 billion dollars, which would far exceed the volume of imports from China to the country, that in 2017 it stood at 506 billion.  For its part, Beijing applied reciprocal measures to more than 60 billion dollars in US imports, almost half of the 130 billion that it bought in 2017.  Despite the enthusiasm transmitted by Trump, the Chinese government today preferred to be cautious about the agreement reached and avoided giving more details about the agreement.  A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, Geng Shuang, chose not to confirm whether the information is trueIt was announced by the White House that China is committed to increasing "substantially its purchases of agricultural products, industrial and other types of energy" from the United States.  "China is willing (...) to open the market and expand imports and help alleviate the problems in our commercial areas," argued Geng, who also refused to corroborate or deny other information indicating that China would have committed to reduce tariffs on imported American vehicles.  jamj  ? Load-Date: December 3, 2018End of Document

Chinese-style digital authoritarianism rises, internet freedom declinesStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeNovember 3, 2018 SaturdayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: WORLD-NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 595 wordsByline: Steven ClarkeBody13 of the countries prosecuted citizens for allegedly spreading false information.China was the worst abuser of internet freedom in 2018, according to a report from the USA nongovernment organization Freedom House.65 countries were assessed.But rather than wait for others to follow, Xi has actively been pushing his intense level of "digital authoritarianism" on the world, the report found.As internet freedoms were rolled back around the world this year, online censorship and a lack of digital privacy meant that China once more ranked lowest in the world in the group's "Freedom on the Net" report.'Cutting off internet service is a draconian response, particularly at a time when citizens may need it the most, whether to dispel rumours, check in with loved ones, or avoid risky areas, 'Freedom House researcher Adrian Shahbaz said.Freedom House, whose main financier is the United States government, said in its report on Wednesday that China's export of "digital authoritarianism" had become a major threat to sustaining democratic governance in some countries, Reuters reported. "As a result of these trends, global internet freedom declined for the eighth consecutive year".The organization says that Internet access and usage continues to grow in the country.Iceland, Estonia and Canada were named the top three countries regarding internet freedom, with China, Iran and Ethiopia at the other end of the spectrum.The Chinese government is also accused of demanding foreign companies conform to its content policies outside of China, such as not recognising the independence of Taiwan.Oprah hits campaign trail in push for America's first black female governorPresident Trump will appear with Kemp on Sunday. "This ain't Hollywood!" said Pence Thursday at a rally in Savannah.

RUBIO, WARNER URGE CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER TRUDEAU TO RECONSIDER HUAWAI INCLUSION IN CANADA'S 5G NETWORKStates News ServiceOctober 12, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 785 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Florida Senator Marco Rubio:U.S. Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Mark Warner (D-VA) today urged Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to reconsider Huaweis inclusion in any aspect of Canadas 5G development, introduction, and maintenance. The letter follows comments made by Head-Designee of the Canadian Center for Cyber Security Scott Jones regarding Huawei. The entry of Chinese state-directed telecommunications companies like Huawei into the Canadian market could seriously jeopardize the relationship between U.S. and Canadian carriers, depriving North American operators of the scale needed to rapidly build out 5G networks.The full text of the letter is below.Dear Prime Minister Trudeau:We write with grave concerns about the possibility that Canada might include Huawei Technologies or any other Chinese state-directed telecommunications company in its fifth-generation (5G) telecommunications network infrastructure. As you are aware, Huawei is not a normal private-sector company. There is ample evidence to suggest that no major Chinese company is independent of the Chinese government and Communist Partyand Huawei, which Chinas government and military tout as a national champion, is no exception.Based on what we know about Chinese state-directed telecommunications companies, it was troubling to learn that on September 20, 2018, the new Head-Designee of the Canadian Center for Cyber Security Scott Jones told the House of Commons Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security that banning Huawei is not needed, in response to a question about why Canada has not come out against Huawei as other Five Eyes allies have. Specifically, he claimed that Canada has a very advanced relationship with our telecommunications providers, something that is different from most other countries, adding, We have a program that is very deep in terms of working on increasing that broader resilience piece especially as we are looking at the next-generation telecommunications networks.In contrast to Mr. Scotts comments, however, three former senior Canadian national security officials warned earlier this year against the inclusion of Huawei in Canadas 5G network.

Indeed, we are concerned about the impact that any decision to include Huawei in Canadas 5G networks will have on both Canadian national security and Five Eyes joint intelligence cooperation among the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. As you know, Australia effectively banned Huawei, ZTE, and other Chinese state-directed companies from its nations 5G networks by excluding firms that are likely to be subject to extrajudicial directions from a foreign government and therefore pose unacceptable risks to national security.

The entry of suppliers such as Huawei into the Canadian market could seriously jeopardize this dynamic, depriving both Canadian and American operators of the scale needed to rapidly build out 5G networks.Given the strong statements by former Canadian national security officials as well as similar concerns out of the U.S., Australia, and the United Kingdom, we hope that you will reconsider Huaweis inclusion in any aspect of Canadas 5G development, introduction, and maintenance.

WHAT IS TO BE DONE? SAFEGUARDING DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE IN THE AGE OF NETWORK PLATFORMSStates News ServiceNovember 13, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 22517 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: STANFORD, Calif. BodyThe following information was released by the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace:by Niall FergusonOnce upon a time, only the elite could network globally. David Rockefellerthe grandson of the oil tycoon John D. Rockefellerwas a pioneer networker. According to a recent report, "He recorded contact information along with every meeting he had with about 100,000 people world-wide on white 3-by-5-inch index cards. He amassed about 200,000 of the cards, which filled a custom-built Rolodex machine, a 5-foot high electronic device." Rockefeller's contacts ranged from President John F. Kennedy to the shah of Iran, Pope John Paul II and the astronaut Neil Armstrong. Henry Kissinger, a former secretary of state, garnered the most cards35, describing hundreds of encounters over sixty years. Close behind was Gianni Agnelli, the Italian industrialist who ran Fiat. In his memoirs, Rockefeller recalled how he had learned the importance of contacts while serving as an Army intelligence officer during World War II. "My effectiveness depended on my ability to develop a network of people with reliable information," he wrote. It was an experience that he took home with him when he joined Chase Manhattan after the war.1What was once the preserve of a tiny elite is now available to everybody with an Internet connection and a smartphone, tablet or laptop computer. Facebook was founded at Harvard in 2004, before David Rockefeller's 90th birthday, and rose rapidly to become the world's dominant social media platform. The company's foundational premise was and remains that "Simply through sharing and connecting, the world gets smaller and better."2 Connecting people on Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg declared in 2015, was building a "common global community" with a "shared understanding." A year later he summed up his utopian vision in a Facebook Live session (with Jerry Seinfeld):We're at this next point in human civilization, where we have the next set of tools that we need, things like the internet, that can be this global communication infrastructure ... Just like we went from hunter-gatherers to villages and cities and then nations, I think we now need to come together as a global community. Because a lot of the problems that you're talking about, whether it's terrorism or the refugee crisis or climate change or global diseases spreading around the worldthese are not things that can be solved by any one city or one nation or one small group of people.Humanity is certainly connected as never before. One in three people2.48 billionworldwide used a social network in 2017, according to eMarketer, nearly nine per cent more than the previous year, thanks to rapid expansion in Asia-Pacific, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. Three quarters of all users of the Internet on mobile phones used their devices to access social media. In the United States, an estimated 60 per cent of the population will use a social network at least once a month this year, up 2.6 per cent since 2017. The number of U.S. Facebook users is expected to reach 169.5 million in 2018, more than 60 per cent of all Internet users. Penetration is similarly high in the United Kingdom, where half the population is on Facebook.How far the resulting network can be regarded as a problem-solving global community remains an open question, as we shall see. What is beyond doubt is that network platform companies are astonishingly profitable businessesnot least because users have handed them their personal data for nothing. As a commenter on the website MetaFilter memorably observed in 2010: "If you are not paying for it, you're not the customer; you're the product being sold." In terms of its revenues, Facebook is primarily an advertising company, as is Google's parent company Alphabet. As a half-smirking Zuckerberg explained to Senator Orrin Hatch at a congressional hearing in 2018, "We sell ads, Senator."Eight of the world's most highly valued companies in 2017 were technology businesses, with a market capitalization equal to nearly a third of the market capitalization of the other 92 companies in the global top hundred. Of these eight companies, five (Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook) were American, two Chinese (Alibaba) and Tencent) and one South Korean (Samsung). It was not strictly speaking software that "ate the world," in Marc Andreessen's famous phrase, because two of these companies sell hardware. It would be more accurate to say that network platforms ate the world, as the market dominance of all these companies arises from network effects and the operation of Zipf's Law (which can be summed up "winner takes nearly all").Amazon ate bookselling. Jeff Bezos's company today sells 55 per cent of all the books sold in the United States, 82 per cent of all the e-books and 99 per cent of all the audiobooks. Nor is that all. Although its share of total U.S. retail remains small (4 per cent, or half of Walmart's share), the company's share of the global cloud business is 34 per cent, its share of U.S. online commerce is 44 per cent, and its share of the voice-activated device market is 71 per cent.3 Google ate search. It accounts for between 87 and 92 per cent of online searches worldwide, processing 63,000 queries a second. Apple ate music (along with Alphabet's YouTube and Spotify). YouTube ate television. Above all, Google and Facebook ate advertising. According to eMarketer, the two companies will capture a combined 56.8 per cent of U.S. digital ad spending in 2018, though Amazon and Snapchat have been increasing their shares. The revenues from this source seem certain to continue growing as a rising share of total advertising expenditure goes to the Internet."For many years," according to a New Yorker profile, "[Mark] Zuckerberg ended Facebook meetings with the half-joking exhortation 'Domination!'" He stopped doing this because in European legal systems "dominance" is a term used to describe a business monopoly. However, he remains unabashed about Facebook's appetite for market share. "There's a natural zero-sumness," he told an interviewer in September 2018. Revealingly, the figure he most admires in history is the Emperor Augustus:You have all these good and bad and complex figures [in ancient Rome]. I think Augustus is one of the most fascinating. Basically, through a really harsh approach, he established two hundred years of world peace. What are the trade-offs in that? On the one hand, world peace is a long-term goal that people talk about today. Two hundred years feels unattainable. [But] that didn't come for free, and he had to do certain things.4Facebook is indeed an empire, with as many users as Christianity has adherents, but a workforce of just 23,000. Nor does the new Caesar render up much to the old one: between 2007 and 2015, Facebook paid just 4 per cent of its profits in taxes. Amazon paid only 13 per cent, Google 16 per cent and Apple paid 17 per cent. (The average SandP 500 company paid 27 per cent.)Market dominance is seldom without its political aspect. Prior to 2016, remarkably little attention was paid to the growing political power of the big technology companies. The posture they adopted might best be summed up as faux na¯f. "Don't be evil" was the motto adopted by Google in July 2001, after a brainstorming session between Eric Schmidt and early employees shortly before he took over as chief executive. As Schmidt recalled, referring to the company's decision to exit China rather than comply with Beijing's censorship requirements, "We actually did an 'evil scale' and decided [that] not to serve at all was worse evil." By contrast, close involvement in the administration of Barack Obamaincluding energetic efforts to secure his reelection in 2012was deemed to lie at the other end of the evil scale. According to one estimate, there were 252 job moves between Google and the Obama administration from its inception to early 2016, and 427 meetings between White House staff and Google employees from 2009 to 2015. In 2012, Google was the nation's second-largest corporate spender on lobbying, behind General Electric. By 2017 Google was number one, spending $18 million.5 The closeness of the relationship between Silicon Valley and the Democratic Party was not unknown at the time, but it was remarkably uncontroversial. Little, if any, attention was paid to the political activities of the other big technology companies.Donald Trump's victory in the November 2016 presidential election changed that, not just because the leaders of the big technology companies had confidently expected him to lose, but also because it was immediately apparent to them that their core products had either helped Trump win or failed to avert Clinton's defeat. The fact that Trump had dominated Clinton on both Facebook and Twitter throughout the campaign had been overlooked by most political pundits because his huge lead in follower numbers was at odds with all opinion polls. Likewise, experts ignored or discounted his even larger lead over her in terms of Google searches. Brad Parscale, Trump's digital media director, put it well: "These social platforms are all invented by very liberal people on the west and east coasts. And we figure out how to use it to push conservative values. I don't think they thought that would ever happen." A video recording of a post-election internal meeting at Google confirms this. Senior executives lined up to express their dismay at Trump's victory and their allegiance to Clinton.6 As President Obama told David Letterman, his own successful use of social media in 2008 had left him and other Democrats with "a pretty optimistic feeling about it. ... What we missed was the degree to which people who are in power [sic], special interests, foreign governments, etcetera, can in fact manipulate that and propagandize." Obama's analysis of what had gone wrong for his party and its presidential candidate in 2016 is worth quoting in full:One of the biggest challenges we have to our democracy is the degree to which we don't share a common baseline of facts. ... What the Russians exploited but it was already here is we are operating in completely different information universes. If you watch Fox News, you are living on a different planet than you are if you listen to NPR. ... That's what's happening with these Facebook pages where more and more people are getting their news from. At a certain point you just live in a bubble. And that's part of why our politics is so polarized right now. I think it is a solvable problem but it's one we have to spend a lot of time thinking about.7Speaking at MIT in February 2017, Obama suggested that "the large platformsGoogle and Facebook being the most obvious, but Twitter and others as well that are part of that ecosystemhave to have a conversation about their business model that recognizes they are a public good as well as a commercial enterprise." It was, he said, "very difficult to figure out how democracy works over the long term" when "essentially we now have entirely different realities that are being created, with not just different opinions but now different factsdifferent sources, different people who are considered authoritative."8Obama was right. The status quo, in which a handful of giant corporations dominate the public sphere but tend not only to divide it but also to pollute it with a torrent of fake news* and extreme viewsat least some of it generated by this nation's foesis not defensible. Something needs to change. But what? What exactly does it imply to say that the network platforms are "a public good as well as a commercial enterprise"? In short, to quote Nikolai Chernyshevsky (from whom Lenin stole the famous title): "What is to be done?"The Self-Non-Regulation of the InternetThe starting point for any serious analysis must be the business model of the network platforms. They are, in Tim Wu's phase, "attention merchants," the heirs of the big twentieth-century media companies, such as Hearst, which used news and other mostly non-fictional content to attract readers' attention, selling space alongside articles and photographs to advertisers.9 They have a lot of attention to sellmore than any print publishing company in history. The average American spends 5.5 hours a day using digital media, more than television, radio and print put together.10 More than half that digital media time is spent on mobile devices. An average smartphone user clicks, taps and swipes 2,617 times per day. In April 2016, Facebook said it was capturing on average 50 minutes of every American's day, up from 40 minutes in July 2014, though usage may have declined slightly in 2017.11Most of what is said online is inane. The ten most common words used in Facebook status updates are day, loud, word, ticket, nice, long, light, hangover, good and vote.12 A little of what is said is highly cerebral. Some is old-fashioned fiction: stories that do not purport to be true. But a significant proportion is "news," i.e., content that purports to be true information about current affairs. In 2017, two thirds of American adults said they got news from social media sites. Around three quarters of Twitter users got news from the application, around two thirds of Facebook users, and around a third of YouTube users. In all, 45 per cent of American adults get news from Facebook, 18% of them from YouTube and 11 per cent from Twitter. A significant share of younger users also gets news from Instagram and Snapchat.13 It is a startling fact that Facebook and Google are now responsible for nearly 80 per cent of news publishers' referral traffic.The network platforms have set out to act as aggregators of news for the simple reason that it engages users' attention. If extracts from the novels of Dickens or Pascale's Pensees had the same appeal, these too would feature in users' "feeds" or search results. The key point is that the network platforms customize the news that users see in order to maximize their engagement. When Mark Zuckerberg talked in 2013 of making Facebook "the best personalized newspaper in the world," this was what he meant. News Feed is a "personalized collection of stories," and a user sees on average of 220 per day. Advertising and Pages, dedicated profiles for groups or causes, are sources of stories in News Feed. Anyone can buy ads to promote Pages, using an automated interface. Whenever one of Facebook's users opens the Facebook app, a personalization algorithm sorts through all the posts that a person could potentially see, serving up and sorting the fraction it thinks he or she would be most likely to share, comment on, or like. (Shares are worth more than comments, which are both worth more than likes.) Around two thousand pieces of user data ("features") are used by Facebook's machine-learning system to make those predictions. A somewhat similar process works when a user enters words in the Google search box. The user's individual search history, geographic location, and other demographic information affect the content and ranking of the results.The problem is that the algorithms are not prioritizing truthfulness or accuracy but user engagement. For example, on October 1, 2017, Google directed users towards a false story alleging that the perpetrator of the Las Vegas massacre on that date was a member of the far-left group Antifa. A study by the Wall Street Journal and former YouTube engineer Guillaume Chaslot showed that a user searching for "The Pope" on YouTube was directed to videos with titles such as "How Dangerous is the Pope?", "What if the Pope was assassinated?" and "BREAKING: They caught the Pope."14 As we shall see, these and other features of the network platforms had historic consequences in 2016 when they played a decisive role in the election of Donald Trump as the U.S. president.How did we arrive at this state of affairswhen such important components of the public sphere could operate solely with regard to their own profitability as attention merchants? To answer this question, we must briefly review the history of Internet regulation. A decisive early decision was to define the Internet as a Title I information service, and therefore fundamentally different from the old telephone network, which was governed by Title II's intrusive monopoly utility regulations. (The Internet was briefly re-classified as a Title II service between 2015 and 2017, but no major regulatory change occurred in that period.) Another important decision was to give Internet companies very lenient treatment when they violated copyright. The Digital Millennium Act's notice-and-takedown provisions minimized the penalties to the network platforms of making the intellectual property of others available gratis to their users. A third vital decision was enshrined in Section 230 of Title V of the 1996 Telecommunications Act,15 which was enacted after a 1995 New York court held an online intermediary liable for a user's defamatory posts. Previously, managing content had triggered classification as a publisherand hence civil liabilitycreating a perverse incentive not to manage content at all. Thus, Section 230c, "Protection for 'Good Samaritan' blocking and screening of offensive material," was written to encourage nascent firms to protect users and prevent illegal activity without incurring massive content management costs. It states:1. No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.2. No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of:A. any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene [etc.]; orB. any action taken to enable or make available to information content providers or others the technical means to restrict access to material in paragraph 1.In essence, Section 230 gives websites immunity from liability for what their users post. The net result of this regulatory framework is that technology companies are neither communication utilities nor content publishers.The argument for Section 230, as articulated by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, is as follows: "Given the sheer size of user-generated websites ... it would be infeasible for online intermediaries to prevent objectionable content from cropping up on their site. Rather than face potential liability for their users' actions, most would likely not host any user content at all or would need to protect themselves by being actively engaged in censoring what we say, what we see, and what we do online." Senator Ron Wyden puts it even more strongly: "If websites, ISPs, text message services, video game companies and any other type of platform were held liable for every word and deed they facilitated or somehow enabled, the entire system would shut down ... collaboration and communication on the internet would simply cease."16 In effect, it has been argued, Section 230 split the difference between liability, which would have meant restriction, or complete lack of curation, which would have led to a torrent of "filth, racism, insults, and pornography." Thus, "hobbling 230" would "stifle the competition that got us to today's rich internet in the first place."17 According to one recent and influential account:Platforms moderate content because of a foundation in American free speech norms, corporate responsibility, and the economic necessity of creating an environment that reflects the expectations of their users. Thus, platforms are motivated to moderate by both of 230's purposes: fostering Good Samaritan platforms and promoting free speech. ... [They] should be thought of as operating as the New Governors of online speech. These New Governors are part of a new triadic model of speech that sits between the state and speakers-publishers. They are private, self-regulating entities that are economically and normatively motivated to reflect the democratic culture and free speech expectations of their users.18Note that under the present dispensation, the network platforms have the power (not the obligation) to "curate" content that they host. They do so, it is argued, "out of a sense of corporate social responsibility, but also, more importantly, because their economic viability depends on meeting users' speech and community norms." This curation began some time ago with the exclusion of content that no one would publicly condone. For years, the big technology companies have shared "signatures" of child pornography, so that once an illegal photo or a video is uploaded to one site, it is detected and taken down or excluded from all platforms. Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Microsoft have a global working group that applies the same kind of technologies to terrorist content. In November 2017, for example, YouTube took down videos of Anwar al-Awlaki, the jihadist cleric killed by a U.S. drone strike in Yemen in 2011. Video fingerprinting technology has not removed al-Awlaki altogether from the platform, but it has substantially reduced the number of videos relating to him.However, the process of removing or at least downgrading offensive content has not stopped with recognized advocates of pedophilia or jihad. In January 2018 YouTube removed from its Google Preferred platform the channels of Logan Paul, a YouTube star with almost 16 million subscribers, after he posted a video showing a suicide victim in Japan. "Demonetizing" YouTube videos, so that they are not promoted on the platform and their creators receive no share of any advertising revenue, is a powerful sanction short of outright prohibition. Twitter set out to be the "free speech wing of the speech movement," but in 2015 added a new line to its Twitter Rules that barred "promot[ing] violence against others ... on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, age, or disability." Any danger that the platforms might abuse their power has been airily dismissed with a promise that all problems can be addressed simply by making "changes to the architecture and governance systems put in place by these platforms."19 Yet platforms' content moderation guidelines are not public, only their more nebulous "community standards."The network platforms have been left blissfully unmolested by the Federal Communications Commission, even as they have moved into direct competition with the television radio stations that it regulates and the telecommunications firms that provide most consumers with access to the Internet. The Federal Election Commission until recently considered digital platforms exempt from disclosure rules on political ads. In 2011 Facebook asked the FEC for an exemption to rules requiring the source of funding for political ads to be disclosed, arguing that the agency "should not stand in the way of innovation."20 The only U.S. regulator that Silicon Valley has had to contend with is the Federal Trade Commission, which has powers to enforce consumer-protection laws. In 2011 the FTC cited Facebook for "engaging in unfair and deceptive practices" with regard to the privacy of user data. The company signed a consent decree pledging to establish a "comprehensive privacy program" and to evaluate it every other year for twenty yearsa commitment it seems to have honored mainly in the breach, as we shall see.In short, to characterize the U.S. regulation of network platforms as laissez faire or "light touch" would be a considerable understatement. The current system is, in essence, one of self-regulationor, to be more precise, self-non-regulation.The Political ConsequencesThe consequences have been profound. The first and best known has been to favor fake news. It has been claimed that social media mainly tend to amplify the content produced by traditional media.21 But that overlooks two things. First, if network platforms choose to promote a message of their ownfor example that users should consider organ donation for transplantsthe results are far more impressive than when newspapers or television channels make similar appeals.22 Second, social media also disseminate fake news, which traditional media tend not to do. Unfortunately, it appears that false information on Twitter is typically retweeted by many more people, and far more rapidly, than true information, especially when the topic is politics. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology tracked 126,000 storiessome true, some falsetweeted by roughly three million people more than 4.5 million times from 2006 through 2017. They then used six different fact-checking sitesincluding Snopes, Politifact, and FactCheck.orgto rate the truthfulness of each story. It turned out that false claims were 70 per cent more likely than the truth to be shared on Twitter. True stories were rarely retweeted by more than a thousand people, but the top one per cent of false stories were routinely shared by between 1,000 and 100,000 people. And it took true stories about six times as long as false ones to reach 1,500 people. No accurate news item was able to chain together more than ten retweets, whereas fake news could put together a retweet chain 19 links longand do it ten times as fast as the accurate news item put together its ten retweets. This finding is especially startling, as Twitter users who share accurate information typically have more followers, and send more tweets, than fake-news sharers.23 An important role is evidently played in the dissemination of fake news by "bots"automated accounts purporting to be humanswho are believed to account for between 9 and 15 per cent of active Twitter accounts and as many as 60 million Facebook users.24 In the words of a recent large-scale study by the Knight Foundation, "A supercluster of densely interlinked, heavily followed accounts plays a large role in the spread of fake news and disinformation on Twitter. Social bots likely make up the majority of the accounts in the supercluster, and accounts in the cluster participate in what appear to be coordinated campaigns to push fake news stories."25A second consequence of leaving the network platforms to their own devices has been polarization. Homophilythe tendency of birds of a feather to flock togetherhas long been a recognized feature of social networks, even those of modest size. Giant online networks were therefore always likely to self-segregate into more or less homogeneous clusters. This was true of the "blogosphere," for example, prior to the ascendancy of the network platforms.26 We are innately inclined to form into opposing sides over any bone of contention, as the case of "The Dress"a photograph of a dress taken in England at 3:30pm on a February afternoonillustrates. (For days the Internet was rent asunder: Was the dress black and blue or white and yellow?)27 Yet the network platforms do more than merely reveal our innate divisions. Because their algorithms are designed to maximize our engagement and, because confirmation bias is one of our many cognitive biases, they tend to accentuate it.A good illustration of the point is the way that Twitter works. If the network of political retweets is graphed using a force-directed algorithm, two highly segregated communities of users are revealed: liberals and conservatives.28 A similar depiction of the retweet activity of messages containing moral and emotional language on a range of political topics (gun control, same-sex marriage, climate change) looks very similar. The presence in tweets of words that researchers classified as "moral-emotional" increased their diffusion by a factor of 20 per cent for each additional word. Moreover, "moral contagion" was bounded by group membership, in that "moral-emotional language increased diffusion more strongly within liberal and conservative networks, and less between them."29 Another paper, based on 3,938 Twitter users who together generated 4.8 million tweets in August 2016, suggested that it is politically extreme people who tweet about politics more than centrist users of Twitter.30 In Congress, more ideologically extreme lawmakers get more Facebook followers than centrists.31This is not to say that people consciously choose to inhabit filter bubbles or echo chambers. A 2015 study found that "most social media users [were] embedded in ideologically diverse networks, and that exposure to political diversity has a positive effect on political moderation." Nor is it to blame all polarization on social media. The division between liberals and conservatives has deep historical roots. Its reflection in the mediafrom newspapers to cable televisionis not new. And the increase in polarization in recent years seems to have been greatest amongst the elderly, the group least likely to use the internet and social media.32 Yet the network platforms are clearly making polarization worse because of the way they work. A good example is the way the YouTube suggestions algorithm works. In the words of former Google engineer Guillaume Chaslot, "Videos about vegetarianism led to videos about veganism. Videos about jogging led to videos about running ultramarathons. Given its billion or so users, YouTube may be one of the most powerful radicalizing instruments of the 21st century. ... YouTube leads viewers down a rabbit hole of extremism, while Google racks up the ad sales."33 YouTube assists extremists in other ways, notably by placing advertisements for respectable corporations and other organizations on the websites of Nazis and so-called white nationalists. YouTube channels with over 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch-hours over a twelve-month period can apply to receive a portion of YouTube's revenue from the advertisements running on their videos. Until it was shut down, Brian Ruhe's Nazi channel featured adsand therefore earned moneyfrom Nissan, Disney, Mozilla and 20th Century Fox.34 There is also evidence from the 2015 protests against police violence in Baltimore that the degree and volume of moral rhetoric used on social media predicted the number of arrests during protests.35 The "culture war" in the United Statesover campus free speech, climate change, healthcare reform, racism, gender fluidity, and sexual harassmentwould no doubt be happening without social media. But the network platforms have surely intensified the conflict.The elections of 2016 brought to light the full extent of the network platforms' role in the modern public sphere. Like the culture war, the elections would no doubt have been bitterly contested without social media. But the network platforms in 2016 did more than merely intensify the contests. They decisively influenced the results.There is of course nothing new about a change in the structure of the public sphere having political consequences. Each new communications technologythe newspaper, the telegraph, the radio, the televisionhas had its effect on the political process. William Randolph Hearst was first a hero and then a pariah for his accumulation of mass-circulation newspapers and magazines, each of which toed his political line. Most recently, cable news stations such as CNN and Fox have had a measurable impact on American elections. According to one study, biased coverage by Fox News during the 2000 presidential election was enough to shift 10,757 votes in Florida, where George W. Bush's decisive margin of victory was just 537 votes.36 Social media played a modest role in the 2008 election because at that time Facebook and Twitter were still in their infancy, though there is no question that Barack Obama's use of them was far superior to John McCain's. But they were more important in the 2012 election. This shift had its roots in 2009, when Dan Wagner began work on a sophisticated model (known as the Survey Manager), which before long was accurately forecasting the "shellacking" inflicted on the Democrats by Tea Party Republicans in the 2010 midterms. At first, much of the data Wagner used were from surveys he and his team carried out. But by 2012 the Democratic National Committee had invested heavily in technology designed to integrate as much information as possible about individual voters. The Obama campaign spent twice as much on online advertisements as Mitt Romney's. Its approach to television advertising was based on far superior data on the viewing habits of potentially persuadable voters. The Romney campaign mostly out-sourced its data operation; in effect it relied on the technology and methods Obama had used in 2008.37 In 2012, by contrast, the Obama campaign was able to create a voter-outreach app that analyzed users' Facebook connections and encouraged users to reach out to potential Obama supporters among their Facebook friends. Google also made its data tools (Google Analytics) available to Obama's reelection campaign.Google is first and foremost a search engine. So well established is the company's reputation for fast and efficient ranking of web pages that most users assume more or less uncritically that its search results are an objective measure of citation frequency, if not credibility. That is why nine out of ten clicks are on the first page of Google search results. In fact, the search engine can be manipulated and with significant effects. Three experiments relating to the 2010 Australian election found that the influence of a Google-like search engine on voter behavior was very great. After subjects were left to conduct their own search-based web research, seeing results that were biased by design, the likelihood of their voting for a particular candidate diverged from their initial preferences by between two and four percentage points. The authors term this differential "voter manipulation power" or VMP. Between three quarters and all of the subjects in these experiments showed no awareness of the manipulation. A similar experiment with U.S. voters had similar results. The VMP of voters in the 2014 Lok Sabha Elections in India was 9.4 per cent and as much as 73 per cent amongst unemployed males from Kerala. The authors of a pioneering paper on the "search engine manipulation effect" concluded in 2015 that "If a search engine company optimized rankings continuously and sent customized rankings only to vulnerable undecided voters, there is no telling how high the VMP could be pushed. ... Search results favoring one candidate could easily shift the opinions and voting preferences of real voters in real elections by up to 80 percent in some demographic groups with virtually no one knowing they had been manipulated."38 The same author's estimated that "Google's search enginewith or without any deliberate planning by Google employeeswas currently determining the outcomes of upwards of 25 percent of the world's national elections ... because Google's search engine lacks any kind of equal-time rule, so it virtually always favors one candidate over another."39 Comparably powerful is the "Search Suggestion Effect," whereby Google search suggestions ("autocomplete" suggestions) have the power to shift opinions and voting preferences:Negative ("low valence") search terms can attract 10-to-15 times as many clicks as neutral or positive terms can (an example of "negativity bias"), which means that a simple yet powerful way for a search engine company to manipulate elections is to suppress negative search suggestions for the candidate it supports, while allowing one or more negative search suggestions to appear for the opposing candidate (the "differential suppression of negative search suggestions") ... [T]he higher a suggestion appears in a list of search suggestions, the more impact it has on search, and overall, manipulating search suggestions can shift a 50/50 split among people who are undecided on an issue to a 90/10 split without people's awareness and without leaving a paper trail for authorities to follow.40Nearly everything that happened in 2016 had a pre-history. Cambridge Analytica was established in June 2014 by Robert and Rebekah Mercer, who had previously invested in Alexander Nix's Strategic Communications Laboratories (SCL) Group. The new company was set up as a joint venture with SCL; its name was chosen by Stephen K. Bannon, executive chairman of the right-wing website Breitbart, who became a director. The company's voter database was purchased from the Cambridge University researcher Aleksandr Kogan, whose "this is your digital life" app represented itself as a research tool used by academic psychologists. Its online questionnaire was hosted by a company called Qualtrics. Respondents were asked to authorize access to their Facebook profiles and, when they did, Kogan's app harvested their data as well as the data of all their Facebook friendsnot only their names, birth dates and location data, but also lists of every Facebook page they had ever liked. The small print accompanying Kogan's questionnaire told users that their data could be used for commercial purposes, a violation of Facebook's rules at the time. In 2015, Facebook said that, having learned that Kogan had passed user data to Cambridge Analytica, it had excluded him from access to Facebook data and demanded assurances that the data had been deleted. But the company did not disclose to usersor anyone elsethat their data had been misused. Moreover, in November 2015, Facebook brought Kogan in as a consultant to explain the technique he had used.41 In March 2018, when Facebook was forced by news revelations to comment, the company insisted there had not been a data breach but merely "a scamand a fraud." In all, some 270,000 people downloaded Kogan's app. That was enough to give him access to the data of 87 million Facebook users, 71 million of whom were Americans. Around 30 million profiles contained enough information, including places of residence, to enable Cambridge Analytica to build the psychographic profiles that were its main selling point.42 In 2014 the company did work for Texas Senator Ted Cruz, the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.43To date, the most controversial aspect of social media's involvement in the 2016 U.S. election was the way Russian entities, principally the Internet Research Agency (IRA), disseminated inflammatory content through Twitter and Facebook. This, too, had a prelude. According to special counsel Robert Mueller's indictment of 25 Russian individuals (12 of them identified as Russian military intelligence agents), Moscow began building a U.S. influence operation in 2014. It had already experimented with "information warfare" in a number of countries, including Ukraine, which Russian forces invaded in 2014. During the UK referendum on membership of the European Union, at least 2,752 Twitter profiles appear to have been created and managed by the IRA. Russian content found itself into mainstream media on numerous occasions: 29 different Russian-run accounts were quoted across 73 different news stories. The Daily Telegraph embedded posts from Russian accounts such as @Ten_GOP and @Pamela_Moore13 15 times, for example. Another Russian account, @WarfareWW, accounted for four of the Daily Mail's seven citations. A recent NBER study estimates that automated tweets added 1.76 percentage point to the "Leave" share of the vote. There was a "massive volume" of tweets from Russian-language accounts in the few days before the referendum.44 When, in October 2018, Twitter released datasets of more than 10 million tweets and more than 2 million images and videos from 3,841 IRA-affiliated (plus 770 others suspected of being Iranian), the material dated back as far as 2009. 45In short, there was ample reason to expect the network platforms to play both an important and a subversive role in the U.S. election of 2016. And yet almost no precautions appear to have been taken by either the authorities or the big technology companies themselves. On the contrary, Facebook executives continued to repeat the company's foundational mantra: "Move fast and break things." On June 18, 2016, a day after the fatal shooting of a Chicago man was captured on Facebook Live, the company's vice president Andrew "Boz" Bosworth, circulated an internal memorandum that epitomized a culture of indifference to negative externalities:So we connect more people.That can be bad if they make it negative. Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools.And still we connect people.The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is *de facto* good. It is perhaps the only area where the metrics do tell the true story as far as we are concerned.That isn't something we are doing for ourselves. Or for our stock price (ha!). It is literally just what we do. We connect people. Period. ...... I know a lot of people don't want to hear this. Most of us have the luxury of working in the warm glow of building products consumers love. But make no mistake, growth tactics are how we got here. ...That's our imperative. Because that's what we do. We connect people.What Exactly Happened in 2016?Since the November 2016 election, Facebook has admitted that the Internet Research Agency used up to 470 false identities and spent $100,000 on more than 3,000 Facebook and Instagram ads to spread politically divisive posts to Americans before and after the vote. The ads promoted about 120 Facebook Pages set up by the IRA and related groups. These Pages posted 80,000 pieces of content between January 2015 and August 2017, reaching up to 126 million Americansa number only slightly smaller than the total number who voted. In all, an estimated 146-150 million users saw posts from accounts linked to the IRA, including around 16 million Instagram users. Jonathan Albright has suggested that posts on just six publicly known Russia-linked Pages were shared 340 million times. In addition, Russians with false identities used Facebook Events to promote political protests, including an August 27 anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim rally in a rural Idaho town that was known to welcome refugees. The event was "hosted" by "SecuredBorders," a phony anti-immigration group that was in fact a Russian front. (It had 133,000 followers when Facebook closed it down.) "Heart of Texas," a Russian-controlled Facebook group that promoted Texas secession, announced a rally to "Stop Islamification of Texas" in front of the Islamic Da'wah Center of Houston on May 21, 2016. A separate Russian-sponsored group, "United Muslims of America," advertised a "Save Islamic Knowledge" rally for exactly the same place and time. The Russians did not confine themselves to Facebook. Twitter has admitted that Russian bots tweeted 2.1 million times before the election. So far, 2,700 Twitter accounts have been identified as IRA-run. Of these, 65notably @WarfareWW, @TEN_GOP and @Jenn_Abramsfeatured prominently in a large-scale study of the fake news phenomenon.46How big an impact did this Russian effort have? Political scientist Kathleen Hall Jamieson goes so far as to argue that the election was in fact decided by Russian content aimed at discouraging potential Clinton voters from turning out, as this was the key variable that tipped Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin over to Trump.47 It is important, however, to recognize that the impact of Russian was not simply in one, pro-Trump direction. A study of retweet activity reveals, surprisingly, that liberals were more inclined to disseminate this content than conservatives.48 Another analysis of the Twitter network suggests that "clusters of accounts affiliated with Russia serve a brokerage role, serving as a cultural and political bridge between liberal U.S. accounts and European far-right accounts." 49 Moreover, the Russians only accounted for a part of the fake news disseminated by foreign actors during the election. Buzzfeed traced a hundred pro-Trump sites to a small town in Macedonia. At least one of these was run by the Israeli private intelligence firm Psy-Group. The Iranians also appear to have abused Twitter.50Yet the key point is that all this foreign-originated content was a drop in the ocean. Between March 23, 2015, and November 2016, an estimated 128 million people in America were responsible for nearly 10 billion Facebook posts, shares, likes, and comments about the election. Hindman and Barash identified 6.6 million tweets or retweets from 454,832 separate accounts that linked to at least one of more than 600 fake news or conspiracy websites during the month before the election. The tweets of Russian operatives and bots represented perhaps one per cent of all electionrelated tweets. The same goes for fake news from any source was only a fraction of total election-related content. True, according to one estimate, the average American encountered between one and three stories from known publishers of fake news during the month before the 2016 election.51 Another study of the browsing histories of 2,525 adult Americans during the run-up to the 2016 election suggested that one in four Americans saw at least one false story, with the most conservative 10 per cent of the sample accounting for two thirds of visits to fake news sites. Yet false stories were a very small proportion of the total news people consumed, accounting for just 1 per cent of the news intake of Clinton supporters and 6 per cent in the case of Trump supporters.52It could be argued that even that small a proportion of fake newsforeign and home-grownmight have sufficed to decide a very tight election. Research on the impact of traditional television advertising between 2004 and 2012 concluded that partisan imbalances in advertising had significant effects. (Exposure to an additional ad by one party or the other shifted the partisan vote of approximately two people out of 10,000.)53 Moreover, false election stories tended to attract more attention than true ones. In August 2015, a rumor circulated on social media that Donald Trump had let a sick child use his plane to get urgent medical care. Snopes confirmed almost all of the story as true. However, only about 1,300 people shared or retweeted the story. In February 2016, by contrast, a rumor circulated that Trump's elderly cousin had recently died and that he had left a message publicly condemning his relative's presidential bid. Snopes rejected this story as false, but around 38,000 Twitter users shared it. Its retweet chain was three times longer than the one produced by the true sick child story. A false story alleging that the boxer Floyd Mayweather had worn a Muslim head scarf to a Trump rally also reached an audience more than ten times the size of the sick child story.However, the Russians had real news, too, which they had obtained by means deemed legitimate by the mainstream media outlets that published it. Beginning in March 2016, Russian hackers Fancy Bear sought to phish their way into the Democratic party's emails, sending fake emails that seemed to come from Google and told recipients to change their passwords. Chairman John Podesta fell for the ruse on March 19, clicking on the fatal link and giving the Russians access to 50,000 emails. Former Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos said that he was told on April 26 by an academic closely connected to the Kremlin that the Russian government had obtained compromising information about Clinton. "They have dirt on her," Papadopoulos was told. "They have thousands of emails." On June 12 WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange told a British TV show that emails related to Clinton were "pending publication." On June 15 the supposedly Romanian (but in reality Russian) Guccifer 2.0 claimed to have hacked the DNC and began directing reporters to the newly launched DCLeaks site. WikiLeaks joined in on July 22. Guccifer 2.0, WikiLeaks and DCLeaks ultimately published more than 150,000 emails stolen from more than a dozen Democrats. Long-established newspapers did as much as network platforms to disseminate the leaked content. Hillary Clinton herself attaches more blame for her defeat to FBI James Comey's intervention on October 28when he told Congress that he was reopening an investigation into her private email serverthan to Russian disinformation.Another point often overlooked is that not all online manipulation during the campaign was calculated to hurt Clinton. True, YouTube tilted its users towards Trump. Guillaume Chaslot discovered that, regardless of whether users started with a pro-Clinton or a pro-Trump video, they were many times more likely to have a pro-Trump video recommended by YouTube. Twitter also helped Trump as most Twitter bots (not only the Russian ones) favored him.54 However, there is striking evidence that the Search Engine Suggestion Effect was exploited by Google in Clinton's favor. Search suggestions on Google, Yahoo and Bing on August 3, 2018, differed strikingly. The user who consulted Yahoo was promoted to search for "Hillary Clinton is a liar" or "Hillary Clinton is a criminal." On Bing the top two suggestions were "Hillary Clinton is a filthy liar" and "Hillary Clinton is a murderess." But the user who typed "Hillary Clinton is" into Google's search box was prompted to search for "Hillary Clinton is winning" or "Hillary Clinton is awesome." 55 Robert Epstein argues that Google search rankings favored Clinton over most of the six-month period that he and his research associates monitored. Between October 15 and Election Day, "search rankings favored Mrs. Clinton in all 10 of the search positions on the first page of search results."56Yet the truly decisive factor in the 2016 was probably none of the above. It was the different ways the Trump and Clinton campaigns themselves used the network platforms, particularly Facebook. According to the New Yorker, Facebook "offered to 'embed' employees, for free, in presidential campaign offices to help them use the platform effectively. Clinton's campaign said no. Trump's said yes." Trump used Facebook to raise $280 million. More than a third of that moneyvastly more than the Russians spentwent to pay for targeted Facebook ads. These included a voter-suppression drive in the days before the election, targeting "idealistic white liberals, young women, and African Americans." Theresa Hong, the Trump campaign's digital-content director, later told an interviewer, "Without Facebook we wouldn't have won." 57 Her verdict has been echoed by Gary Coby, the director of advertising at the Republican National Committee and director of digital advertising and fundraising for Trump's campaign, and by Brad Parscale in an interview with Lesley Stahl for 60 Minutes and in a conversation with Michael Isikoff in Lisbon last November. Ali-Jae Henke, the head of elections at Google, explained how his company also provided help to both campaigns:They say like "look, we really want to get attention and we want to reach as many people as possible and these are kind of the areas politically where we might have challenges or the different types of voting blocs we need to reach" ... and so then I am able to in that advisory capacity be like, "well this is what moms look like online, this is how we find them ..."Parscale explained the role of Cambridge Analytica in this process:[They] didn't play a role in crafting ads [but] helped with a research strategy to help us raise money. We needed to build an infrastructure. [Cambridge Analytica] provided staff, resources, because we had to grow a large organization, fast. They did a lot of polling, and they did a lot of building some directional arrows for us [regarding] where to place the money, being able to provide reporting back that says, "Here are trends that are happening," so I could move the budget around in a way and I could make recommendations to [then candidate Trump] and to leadership, saying, "Here's an opportunity. We should go into this part of Michigan. We should go into this part of Wisconsin." [Cambridge was] able to drive that kind of information ... and in a simple consumption model, daily.58Also important was the way Facebook directed users to content on the Breitbart website, run since March 2012 by Steve Bannon. On August 17, 2016, Bannon was appointed chief executive of Trump's presidential campaign. "I wouldn't have come aboard, even for Trump," he later said, "if I hadn't known they were building this massive Facebook and data engine. Facebook is what propelled Breitbart to a massive audience. We know its power."This was the crucial difference between 2012 and 2016. By the time of the later election, Facebook had acquired a database of American voters far superior to anything either party could possibly have built on its own. It had done so not only by persuading a majority of Americans to join Facebook, but also by (among other things) logging the phone call and messaging histories of Android smartphone users who installed Messenger or Facebook Lite and then synced their phone contacts with the app.59 Facebook had also paid third-party websites and apps to let it place cookies, invisible pixels, "like" and "share" buttons on them, thereby acquiring data on people who are not Facebook users.60 Facebook's approach to data-gathering was even more ruthless than Google's.61 Its attitude towards how that data got used by third parties was, at best, cavalier. And only one campaign made full use of Facebook's data. We may ask counterfactual questions to our heart's content about how the election would have turned out if the Russians had played no role. Yet the crucial point is that Russian meddling was a subplot in a much bigger crisis of the American political system produced by the unregulated and generally reckless operation of the network platforms. Without the Russians, Trump might not have won. It would still have been close. Without Facebook, he would have stood no chance.The BacklashThat there would be a backlash against the network platforms after their role in the 2016 election was easily predictable.62 A few writerssuch as Jonathan Zittrain and Tim Wuhad been warning about their growing power for some time. Established content publishers such as Rupert Murdoch and Michael Bloomberg had obvious commercial reasons for going on the offensive. For Wu, Facebook was like a television network but with no "sense of responsibility. No constraints. No regulation. No oversight. Nothing." Robert Thomson of News Corp talked about "tech tapeworms in the intestines of the internet." Speaking at Davos in January 2017, George Soros warned of "a web of totalitarian control the likes of which not even Aldous Huxley or George Orwell could have imagined," and called on European Union Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager to be the "nemesis" of the network platforms.63The most credible critics have been the insidersformer Facebook employees such as Antonio Garcia Martinez, author of Chaos Monkeys, or Sandy Parakilas, a former operations manager, who publicly criticized the company's handling of privacy issues in 2017, warning that "The company won't protect us by itself, and nothing less than our democracy is at stake."64 Former vice president for user growth, Chamath Palihapitiya, told an audience at Stanford's Graduate School of Business: "I think we have created tools that are ripping apart the social fabric of how society works. ... The short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops that we have created are destroying how society works. No civil discourse, no co-operation: misinformation, mistrust." He felt "tremendous guilt" about his own part in this because, deep down, he and his former colleagues "kind of knew something bad would happen." In a similar vein, Facebook's first president Sean Parker admitted that the platform was consciously designed to take advantage of "a vulnerability in human psychology" by delivering "a little dopamine hit every once in a while." Parakilas joined forces with Dave Morin, Justin Rosenstein and Roger McNameeeall former Facebook employees or early investorsas well as Tristan Harris and Lynn Fox (both ex-Google) to establish the Center for Human Technology and launch a campaign with the title: "The Truth about Tech."Negative publicity in the wake of the election has led to a decline in public trust in Facebook and Twitter.65 Facebook also now lags quite far behind Amazon, Google, Apple and Microsoft in the Small Business Trust Index. A Gallup Knight survey published in January 2018 showed that 57 per cent of Americans regarded the way tech companies chose which stories to show to users as "a major problem" for democracy, while 73 per cent said the same about the spread of inaccurate information on the Internet.66 At that time only 49 per cent favored regulation of how websites provide news. By February 2018, however, the proportion "concerned that government would do too little" to address the problem had risen from 40 to 55 per cent.67 Young Americans in particular have lost trust in Facebook (though they trust it more than Washington and Wall Street).68 The Economist summed up the prevailing mood: the big tech companies were "too big, anti-competitive, addictive and destructive to democracy"BAADD. 69At Facebook's second annual Social Good Forum in December 2017, Mark Zuckerberg described how his company uses artificial intelligence to identify users who might be contemplating self-harm or suicide. He did not discuss the possibility that Facebook might itself be driving people to self-harm or suicide. As Deborah M. Gordon has suggested, online social networks replicate on a vast scale many of the more insidious features of friendship circles amongst girls in a middle school.70 Using data from 5,208 adults over two years from a national longitudinal panel, Holly Shakya and Nicholas Christakis argue that "the more you use Facebook, the worse you feel."71 They found that "most measures of Facebook use in one year predicted a decrease in mental health in a later year ... [B]oth liking others' content and clicking links significantly predicted a subsequent reduction in self-reported physical health, mental health, and life satisfaction." The authors suggest that use of social media gives the impression of "meaningful social interaction" but is in fact no substitute for the real thing and therefore undermines wellbeing and health. Even Facebook's own research comes to similar conclusions about the effects of overuse of social media by students.72Especially troubling is the effect of social media on children. As James Bridle has shown, Kid's YouTube seems designed to lure young users towards disturbing videos with titles like: "Surprise Play Doh Eggs Peppa Pig Stamper Cars Pocoyo Minecraft Smurfs Kinder Play Doh Sparkle Brilho" or "BURIED ALIVE Outdoor Playground Finger Family Song Nursery Rhymes Animation Education Learning Video." A search for "Peppa Pig dentist" leads to a video on which Peppa Pig is "tortured, before turning into a series of Iron Man robots and performing the Learn Colours dance." Others feature Peppa eating her father or drinking bleach.73 Facebook Messenger Kids, launched in 2017, seems calculated to introduce children under 13 to the app in order to get them hooked as early as possible. The analogies with cigarettes and corn syrup in the twentieth century and opioids in the twenty-first are not fanciful, as Marc Benioff of Salesforce and Aza Raskin of Mozilla and Firefox have acknowledged.74 There is some evidence that younger users of Facebook have been kicking the habit, but only in favor of Instagram (which Facebook owns) and Snapchat (which it would have liked to own).75The revulsion against the power of the network platforms has not been confined to the United States. In Britain, Facebook has suffered a reputational hit, especially with older people. Although the evidence is less compelling that the company played a malign and decisive role in the Brexit referendum, journalists such as Carole Cadwalladr have done their utmost to make that case.76 There was controversy over the role of social media in the 2018 Irish referendum on abortion, too, as Facebook and Google restricted advertisements in moves widely interpreted to be helpful to the proponents of constitutional change. Did Facebook interfere in the 2017 election in Iceland by selectively displaying its "I Voted" button on some voters' pages but not others?77 In India, fake news stories on WhatsApp service have triggered riots, lynchings, and fatal beatings. In Sri Lanka, after a Buddhist mob attacked Muslims over a false rumor, a presidential adviser put it nicely: "The germs are ours, but Facebook is the wind." In Myanmar, too, violence against the Rohingya minority has been fueled, in part, by disinformation and incendiary content systematically spread on Facebook by the military. The United Nations investigator in charge of examining the persecution of the Rohingya, told the New Yorker, "I'm afraid that Facebook has now turned into a beast, and not what it was originally intended."78 A Burmese legislator called the company "dangerous and harmful for our democratic transition."79 It would be easy to give other examples. In Egypt, the Arab Spring was supposed to be a democratic revolution propelled by social media. Eight years later, Wael Ghonima leading figure in the Tahrir Square protests of 2010is pessimistic. "We wanted democracy," he has said, "but got mobocracy." It seems unlikely that Kenyan democracy benefited from Cambridge Analytica's work for Uhuru Kenyatta in the 2013 and 2017 Kenyan elections. According to Freedom House, online manipulation and disinformation tactics played an important role in elections in 18 countries in 2016. In undemocratic regimes, too, the manipulation of social media is now standard practice, from China to Saudi Arabia.Yet the analogies offered by the critics of the network platforms are not consistent. As one journalist complained with respect to Facebook:I've heard government metaphors (a state, the E.U., the Catholic Church, Star Trek's United Federation of Planets) and business ones (a railroad company, a mall); physical metaphors (a town square, an interstate highway, an electrical grid) and economic ones (a Special Economic Zone, Gosplan). For every direct comparison, there was an equally elaborate one: a faceless Elder God. A conquering alien fleet. ... Maybe Facebook is a church and Zuckerberg is offering his benedictions. Maybe Facebook is a state within a state and Zuckerberg is inspecting its boundaries. Maybe Facebook is an emerging political community and Zuckerberg is cultivating his constituents. Maybe Facebook is a surveillance state and Zuckerberg a dictator undertaking a propaganda tour. Maybe Facebook is a dual powera network overlaid across the United States, parallel to and in competition with the government to fulfill civic functionsand Zuckerberg is securing his command. Maybe Facebook is border control between the analog and the digital and Zuckerberg is inspecting one side for holes. Maybe Facebook is a fleet of alien spaceships that have colonized the globe and Zuckerberg is the viceroy trying to win over his new subjects.80This kind of muddle helps explain the inconsistencies in the global debate on regulation.The European Commission, as George Soros foresaw, has taken the lead in seeking to regulate the U.S.-based network platforms. In June 2017, the Commission's antitrust division fined Google $2.7 billion for "anticompetitive practices" related to Google Shopping, the company's product comparison tool (specifically, for favoring the company's own site over competitors). The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into force in May 2018, requires online services to make it easier for customers to transfer their information to other providers and even competitors, as well as strengthening people's control over their data. At the same time, the European authorities have also been active in regulating online "hate speech." In May 2016, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, and YouTube signed an agreement with the European Commission to "prohibit the promotion of incitement to violence and hateful conduct" by removing content inciting violence or hatred against protected groups within 24 hours of its being posted. On December 5, 2016, the companies announced plans for an industry database of "hashes"unique digital signaturesof all extremist material banned on their platforms. National governments have added to this pressure. In 2017 Germany passed a law threatening Facebook, Twitter and other social media companies with fines of $50 million if they failed to give users the option to complain about hate speech and fake news or refused to remove illegal content within 24 hours. After a series of terrorist attacks in London in 2017, British Prime Minister Theresa May and French President Emmanuel Macron threatened to impose steep fines on companies that failed to remove extremist propaganda from online platforms. Shortly thereafter, Google announced a four-part plan to address terrorist propaganda that included the increased use of technology to identify terrorist-related videos, the hiring of additional content moderators, the removal of advertising on objectionable videos, and the directing of potential terrorist recruits to counter-radicalization videos.81These regulations are seen by some as a model for the United States. Another way of looking at them is as a halfway house between the American laissez faire regime and the Chinese system of much stricter state control. An important difference between Europe and China is that, unlike the Europeans, the Chinese have succeeded in building their own technology giants: the online retail site Alibaba, the search engine Baidu and the Internet conglomerate Tencent. That these companies are subordinate to the Chinese state is clear. They are obliged to share their data with central authorities such as the People's Bank of China (PBoC), which therefore has access to users' payment history, creditworthiness and contacts. This universal "back door" into the data represents the first step towards a comprehensive system of "social credit."82 On June 1, 2017, a new cybersecurity law came into effect in China that requires technology companies to help the authorities remove content that "endangers national security, national honor and interests." The Chinese police are rapidly expanding their network of surveillance cameras and facial-recognition technology. "The political and legal system of the future is inseparable from the internet, inseparable from big data," Alibaba's Jack Ma told a Communist Party commission overseeing law enforcement in 2017. In future, he said, "Bad guys won't even be able to walk into the square."83 In the context of a one-party state, the combination of ubiquitous smartphones, network platforms, big data and artificial intelligence makes possible a precision-targeted totalitarianism beyond the dystopian visions of Orwell and Huxley. At the same time, the immense attractiveness of the rapidly growing Chinese market to Western tech companies makes them susceptible to pressure from the Chinese government. For example, Twitter joined Facebook and YouTube in restricting social media accounts of popular dissident Chinese businessman Guo Wengui, in response to pressure from Beijing.Regulation of the Internet is on the increase. Nearly half of the 65 countries assessed in Freedom on the Net 2017 experienced declines in online freedom last year, while just 13 made gains, most of them minor. Less than one quarter of users reside in countries where the internet is designated "free." Not only China, but also Venezuela, the Philippines, and Turkey were among 30 countries where governments were found to employ armies of "opinion shapers" to spread government views.84 Yet it is not self-evidently obvious which is more dangerous: a regulated Internet, in which governments exercise at least some control over network platforms, or an unregulated one, in which private companies continue to gather and exploit the personal data of citizens for profit and without scruple.Promises, PromisesFacebook's response to the criticism directed against it over the past two years has been unconvincing. "Personally," declared Zuckerberg two days after the 2016 election, "I think the idea that fake news on Facebook, which is a very small amount of the content, influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea." His February 2017 manifesto, entitled "Building Global Community," was long on aspirations, short on specifics. Four months later, Facebook unveiled a new mission statement to "give people the power to build community, to bring the world closer together." The assertion that Facebook was engaged in community-building was disingenuous. The implication was that Facebook should not be held responsible, like a media company, for the content that appeared on its platform. "Things happened on our platform that shouldn't have happened," Sheryl Sandberg conceded. But "at our heart we're a tech company. We hire engineers. We don't hire reporters. No one is a journalist. We don't cover the news."85 A former senior employee explained:The view at Facebook is that "we show people what they want to see and we do that based on what they tell us they want to see, and we judge that with data like time on the platform, how they click on links, what they like." And they believe that to the extent that something flourishes or goes viral on Facebookit's not a reflection of the company's role, but a reflection of what people want. And that deeply rational engineer's view tends to absolve them of some of the responsibility, probably.86This defense had lost credibility, however. The insistence that the content on Facebook was somehow not Facebook's problem effectively collapsed in the wake of the revelations about 2016.In the course of 2017, a new strategy evolved, which might be characterized preemptive self-regulation. On September 21, Zuckerberg pledged to increase the resources of Facebook's security and election-integrity teams in order to work "proactively to strengthen the democratic process." Facebook would henceforth require that all political ads disclose which Facebook page paid for them and ensure that every ad a given advertiser ran was accessible to anyone on the buyer's page. Facebook would double the number of employees and contractors working on user safety and security issues to 20,000 by the end of 2018. It would also build new artificial-intelligence systems to detect what Zuckerberg described as "bad content and bad actors." This could mean a significant increase in operating costs. But Zuckerberg told investors: "I am dead serious about this. I've directed our teams to invest so much in security on top of the other investments we're making that it will significantly impact our profitability going forward." These pledges amounted to an admission of responsibility for content.Yet the practical consequences were confusing. In October 2017, Facebook introduced "Explore Feed," which required media companies to pay for inclusion in the News Feed.87 Further changes were introduced in January 2018, when Zuckerberg announced that News Feed would prioritize "meaningful interaction" over "passive consumption of low-quality content," demoting "things like clickbait headlines and false news, even though people often click on those links at a high rate." He added: "We want to make sure that our products are not just fun, but are good for people ... good for the world." At the same time, Facebook would start to boost certain publishers whose content was "trustworthy, informative, and local," according to reader surveys. In the course of 2018, Zuckerberg made numerous such announcements:In January Facebook hired Nathaniel Gleicher, the former director for cybersecurity policy on President Obama's National Security Council, to counter "information operations."In July, it removed thirty-two accounts running disinformation campaigns that were traced to Russia. A few weeks later, it removed more than six hundred and fifty accounts, groups, and pages with links to Russia or Iran.In March, Zuckerberg pledged "dramatically [to reduce] the amount of data that developers have access to, so that apps and developers can't do what Kogan did" in providing data to Cambridge Analytica.88That same month, he said that "People should know who is buying the ads that they see on Facebook, and you should be able to go on any page and see all the ads that people are running to different audiences." He said that this would be in place by the November 2018 midterms.89Also in March, Facebook announced that it would "try to make privacy settings clearer by creating a central hub where users can examine the data they are sharing" with third-party developers."90In September he announced a "three-year project" to "rebuild all of our content enforcement systems to proactively find harmful content rather than wait for people to flag issues." He added: "It is our responsibility to amplify the good and mitigate the bad." 91Similar measures of self-regulation have been announced by the other network platforms over the past eighteen months.In April 2017, Google announced the release of "Fact Check": "For the first time, when you conduct a search on Google that returns an authoritative result containing fact checks for one or more public claims, you will see that information clearly on the search results page." This was another sop to established publishers whose revenue Google and Facebook had been devouring.In October 2017 Google ended its "first click free" policy, which required publishers to give away some stories in order to appear high in its search rankings. Google chief executive Pichai spoke of "a flight to quality."92In November 2017, Google announced the "Trust Project," hosted by Santa Clara University and developed in conjunction with more than 75 news organizations worldwide. The goal of the project would be to introduce eight "trust indicators," such as "author expertise," "citations and references," and "diverse voices," into the search ranking algorithm.In December 2017, Google announced its intention to increase to 10,000 the number of employees tasked with removing extremist content from YouTube.In short, the network platforms' response to the crisis of 2016 has been a barrage of promises to regulate themselves. "I actually am not sure we shouldn't be regulated," Zuckerberg said in a CNN interview in March. "I actually think the question is more, what is the right regulation rather than 'Yes or no, should it be regulated?'"93 He told Ezra Klein that he could imagine "some sort of structure, almost like a Supreme Court, that is made up of independent folks who don't work for Facebook, who ultimately make the final judgment call on what should be acceptable speech in a community that reflects the social norms and values of people all around the world."94 This was an unusual concession, as Zuckerberglike his Roman role model Augustusrarely offers to limit his own power. "One of the things that I feel really lucky we have," he also told Klein, "is this company structure where, at the end of the day, it's a controlled company. We are not at the whims of short-term shareholders. We can really design these products and decisions with what is going to be in the best interest of the community over time." This was an allusion to the preference shares that give Zuckerberg control over Facebook. Advertising might be Facebook's principal source of revenue, he conceded, but that was only so that his platform could be free to users. "I think probably to the dissatisfaction of our sales team here, I make all of our decisions based on what's going to matter to our community and focus much less on the advertising side of the business."In addition to numerous interviews, the leaders of the big technology companies have set out the case for self-regulation in a succession of hearings: on October 31-November 1, 2017, in April 2018when Zuckerberg himself testified before two congressional committeesand again in September 2018. "Which are you?" Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) asked Zuckerberg in April. "Are you a tech company, or are you the world's largest publisher?"Zuckerberg: I view us as a tech company, because the primary thing that we do is build technology and products.Sullivan: You said you were responsible for your content, which makes you kind of a publisher, right?Zuckerberg: I agree that we are responsible for the content, but we don't produce the content. I think that when people ask us if we are a media company or a publisher, my understanding of what the heart of what they are really getting at, is "Do we feel responsibility for the content on our platform?" And the answer to that, I think, is clearly "Yes."This recognition of responsibility for content was an important moment in the April hearings. Also important, however, was Zuckerberg's assertion that Facebook is "a system of different things: we compete with Twitter as a broadcast medium; we compete with Snapchat as a broadcast medium; we do messaging, and iMessage is default-installed on every iPhone." This was part of a wider argument he sought to make against any attempt to apply antitrust law to Facebook. "I think that anything that we're doing to constrain [the big tech companies] will, first, have an impact on how successful we can be in other places," Zuckerberg also said. "I wouldn't worry in the near term about Chinese companies or anyone else winning in the United States, for the most part. But there are all these places where there are day-to-day more competitive situationsin Southeast Asia, across Europe, Latin America, lots of different places."95 In other words, what is good for Facebook is good for America, and vice versaas General Motors CEO Charles Wilson famously said of GM in 1953. Regulate big tech at your peril, for you may unintentionally help the Chinese competition.The scale of the self-defense effort by Silicon Valley since 2016 cannot be understate. Facebook has followed Google's lead by investing heavily in Washington lobbying, hiring Joel Kaplan, a former policy adviser to President George W. Bush, and Sandy Luff, a former aide to Attorney General Jeff Sessions. According to data from the Center for Responsive Politics, Facebook had contributed a total of $641,685 since 2014 to the members of Congress that Zuckerberg faced during his visit to Capitol Hill. The top recipients of that money included Senators Cory Booker and Kamala Harris.However, these efforts could not prevent a flurry of activity by legislators and regulators. In August 2017, an unusual bipartisan alliance of 27 Democratic and Republican senators introduced the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (SESTA), despite opposition from the Internet Association and Google. It was passed, along with the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA), in April 2018. In October Senators Amy Klobuchar, Mark Warner and John McCain introduced the Honest Ads Act (S. 1989), which would require the network platforms to reveal the buyers and content of all campaign-related ads as well as to maintain a public list of all political advertisers spending $500 or more. Other legislative initiatives of the past year include Keith Ellison's 21st Century Competition Commission Act, an antitrust bill; Senator Edward J. Markey's bill to commission research on the impact of technology on children's health, and California measure to prohibit the use of bots without identification (the so-called "Blade Runner" law SB-1001). Senator Amy Klobuchar has also proposed two bills to change the criteria for mergers. At the same time, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is conducting an "open non-public investigation" into whether or not Facebook violated the terms of the 2011 consent decree when users' personal data were made available to Kogan and Cambridge Analytica. In 2012 the FTC fined Google $22.5 million for violating the terms of another consent decree. It remains to be seen if Facebook will be penalized more or less harshly. Facebook is also under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice. Also investigating Facebook are the attorney generals of New York, Massachusetts and Connecticut.Not to be outdone, the president himself has begun to use Twitter to attack the other big tech companies. "Facebook was always anti-Trump," he tweeted in October 2017. "The Networks were always anti-Trump hence,Fake News, @nytimes(apologized) and @WaPo were anti-Trump. Collusion?" ("That's what running a platform for all ideas looks like," Zuckerberg responded in a Facebook post.) In 2018, Trump attacked Amazon for tax evasion and taking advantage of the U.S. Postal Service. On April 5, Trump told reporters that "Amazon is just not on an even playing field. You know, they have a tremendous lobbying effort, in addition to having The Washington Post [which Jeff Bezos acquired in 2013], which is, as far as I'm concerned, another lobbyist." He was, he said, "going to take a pretty serious look" at Amazon because "the playing field has to be leveled." According to an unnamed source who had spoken to Trump, the president had "wondered aloud if there may be any way to go after Amazon with antitrust or competition law."96 Even Trump's preferred platform, Twitter was not spared. On July 26, 2018, he accused Twitter of "shadow banning" Republicans and said he would look into what he called a "discriminatory and illegal practice." The big tech companies "better be careful because you can't do that to people," Trump said in August, following the expulsion from Facebook of far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. "I think that Google, and Twitter and Facebook, they are really treading on very, very troubled territory and they have to be careful. It is not fair to large portions of the population." Google, too, came under attack. In August 28, 2018, Larry Kudlow, Trump's economic adviser, said that the administration was "taking a look" at whether or not Google and its search engine should be regulated by the government. Trump complained that "Fake CNN" was "prominent" in search results for him. "They have it RIGGED, for me and others," he complained, "so that almost all stories and news is BAD." Conservative media were being "shut out." Was this "illegal?" he asked, accusing Google of "controlling what we can and cannot see." In a tweet on August 18, Trump accused social media of "totally discriminating against Republican/Conservative voices. ... They are closing down the opinions of many people on the RIGHT, while at the same time doing nothing to others."The only surprising thing is that this kind of complaint was not made sooner. FEC disclosures from last year's presidential campaign showed that 95 per cent of tech employee donations went to Hillary Clinton, and only 4 per cent to Donald Trump. The liberal politics of Silicon Valley was regularly on display in 2017, beginning as early as January, when thousands of Google employees walked out of the office for a rally sanctioned by the companyand indeed addressed by chief executive Sundar Pichaito protest against Trump's executive order banning travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Google's firing of James Damore, for writing an in-house essay that questioned the desirability of hiring and promoting more female engineers, seemed to furnish fresh evidence of a corporate culture skewed to the left. In March 2018 YouTube imposed "strikes" on the videos of some prominent far-right actors and conspiracy theorists, including Mike Cernovich, Infowars (Alex Jones), Atomwaffen and Sargon of Akkad (Carl Benjamin). The company maintained that its "reviewers remove content according to our policies, not according to politics or ideology."97In a similar way, employees at Facebook have been dismissed for apparently political reasons. Benjamin Fearnow was fired from Trending Topics for leaking Zuckerberg's condemnation of an "All Lives Matter" sign at Facebook. In the words of Brian Amerige, a senior Facebook engineer, and founder of "FB'ers for Political Diversity," the company has "a political monoculture that's intolerant of different views. We claim to welcome all perspectives, but are quick to attackoften in mobsanyone who presents a view that appears to be in opposition to left-leaning ideology." When Facebook imposed an outright ban on the anti-immigration, anti-Islam group "Britain First," it was explained that the group had used language "designed to stir up hatred against groups in our society." On July 27, after a direct appeal from the parents of a child killed at Sandy Hook, Facebook took down four Infowars videos and suspended Alex Jones for a month. On August 5 Apple stopped distributing five podcasts associated with Jones on the ground that they purveyed "hate speech." Facebook also shut down four of Jones's pages for "repeatedly" violating rules against hate speech and online bullying. Zuckerberg's attempt to explain his reluctance to ban Jones backfired when he explained to Kara Swisher of Recode:The principles that we have on what we remove from the service are: If it's going to result in real harm, real physical harm, or if you're attacking individuals, then that content shouldn't be on the platform. [But] ... The approach that we've taken to false news is not to say: You can't say something wrong on the internet. I think that that would be too extreme. Everyone gets things wrong, and if we were taking down people's accounts when they got a few things wrong, then that would be a hard world for giving people a voice and saying that you care about that. ... I'm Jewish, and there's a set of people who deny that the Holocaust happened. I find that deeply offensive. But at the end of the day, I don't believe that our platform should take that down because I think there are things that different people get wrong. 98The resulting storm of criticism illustrated the shift in attitudes in Silicon Valley. The libertarian instincts of an earlier generation of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs are being forced to yield to the more censorious attitudes of more recently hired employees who have been schooled in the modern campus culture of "no platforming" any ideas deemed to be "unsafe."For conservatives, as well as for right-wing populists, the alarm bells can no longer be ignored. Alex Marlow, editor-in-chief of Breitbart News, and film-makers Peter Schweizer and James O'Keefe are among those to add their voices to the growing chorus of complaint about Silicon Valley's bias. Of considerable importance is Prager University v. Google, a lawsuit filed by Dennis Prager that accuses YouTube of violating his first amendment rights by "regulat[ing] and censor[ing] speech as if the laws governing free speech and commerce do not apply to it." Facebook was recently forced to apologize to Prager for removing videos with the titles "Where Are the Moderate Muslims?" and "Make Men Masculine Again." At the time of writing, allegations of anti-conservative bias on network platforms are being made with increasing frequency. Renee DiResta's insists that the platforms "need to be able to take down users and sites that fail the tests of authenticity, organic distribution and integrity reputation." But it seems inevitable that many of those who fall foul of "viewpoint agnostic moderation" will complain of politically-motivated censorship.99So What Is to De Done?American lawmakers must realize that the status quo is indefensible. The network platforms currently enjoy unprecedented power over the public sphere not only in the United States but around the world. Yet they have shown themselves to be very poor custodians of their users' personal data. They have shown themselves to be vulnerable to abuse by foreign and domestic actors. They can no longer plausibly claim not to be publishers or media companies, as they are increasingly under pressure to curate, sort and otherwise manage the content that they host, and to do so in ways that have significant political implications. Minor modifications of the law, such as SESTA, do not address the fundamental question of how to limit the power and capacity for harm of the big tech companies.There are five options that seem worthy of consideration:1. Scrap "net neutrality" in order to empower the Internet service providers (ISPs) relative to the network platforms;2. Update antitrust doctrine and law so that the network platforms can be broken up;3. Increase the regulation of the network platforms by either the FTC or the FCC, acknowledging that they are now public utilities;4. Repeal Section 230 altogether, thereby making the network platforms legally liable for the content they host, and leave the rest to the courts; and5. Impose First Amendment obligations on the network platforms, recognizing that they are too important a part of the public sphere to be able to regulate access to it on the basis of their own "community standards."The first of these options, the ending of so-called net neutrality, is the only one to date that has been acted upon. Unfortunately, it is also the least likely to be effective. FCC chairman Ajit Pai has repealed Obama-era rules that were intended to ensure equal access to the Internet by preventing ISPs from charging users more to see certain content and to curb access to some websites. Under Pai's new regime, ISPs will be able to block access, slow down or speed up service. For ATandT, Comcast and Verizon this has obvious appeal; for the network platforms it is much less attractive. The two kinds of company have adopted predictably opposing stances. From the point of view of the citizen-consumer, however, the net benefits of nixing net neutrality are not obvious. The most likely outcome would seem to be that Internet users will end up either paying more for certain kinds of content and enduring slower speeds for other kinds content. That does not address any of the fundamental problems described above. It merely shifts power from the network platforms to the ISPs. There is no reason to believe they are superior actors from the point of view of the public interest in a functioning market for ideas.Of considerably more importance is the revival of interest in antitrust as a tool. This began on the left, with the so-called "antitrust hipsters" around Barry Lynn of the Open Markets Institute, who was effectively ousted from the New America Foundation last year because of Silicon Valley donors' opposition to his work. In the past year, however, interest has grown in the idea that the big tech companies are simply too big, even amongst conservatives. The analogy with Standard Oil, which was broken up more than a century ago, is drawn with increasing frequency. In Washington, proponents of antitrust refer to Amazon, Facebook and Google as "Standard Commerce, Standard Social and Standard Data." Tim Wu of Columbia Law School argues that Facebook should relinquish Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp; Google should give up YouTube and DoubleClick; Amazon should spin off Amazon Web Services. Scott Galloway takes a similar view and includes Apple on his list.100 Such arguments have ceased to be the preserve of progressives.101Antitrust law was developed in the United States as a response to the rise of trusts and combinationsthat is, cross-ownership and management structures facilitating collusion. The focus of early antitrust law was (and in large part continues to be) enterprise size, market share, and strategic market positioning. At first, John D. Rockefeller was praised for bringing down the price of kerosene from 26 cents in 1870, when his market share was 4 per cent, to 7 cents in 1890, when his market share reached 90 per cent. Standard Oil was feted for bringing efficiency to the oil industry, which in turn fueled the development of steel, railroads, and the technological industries associated with them. However, in the early 1900s, journalists such as Ida Tarbell helped turn public opinion against Rockefeller (the "King of Combinations") and his allegedly anti-competitive tactics. Trusts became a political lightning rod. Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis coined the phrase "the curse of bigness," arguing that firms could be too big to treat employees on equal terms, to be efficient, and to treat rivals fairly. This laid the foundation for the 1911 landmark judgment in Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States, which broke Standard Oil up into 34 separate firms.For half a century, Brandeis's approach was dominant in the courts. In 1956, the biggest platform of that era, ATandT, settled an antitrust case by signing a consent decree in which it made two important concessions: it agreed not to expand its business into new markets (such as computers) and it made all of its patents available to others at no charge. The consent decree did not break up ATandTthat did not happen until 1984but it was an essential first step, and one with great consequences as one of the many patents in ATandT's portfolio was the transistor. In 1968 the Department of Justice's merger guidelines were that any acquisition of a company with a market share of more than 3 per cent by one with a share higher than 15 per cent should be challenged. However, this view of antitrust law was challenged by Robert H. Bork and Ward S. Bowman in their seminal 1965 article "The Crisis in Antitrust," which asserted that the intention of antitrust law was simply the protection of "consumer welfare." Bork and Bowman argued that antitrust law could in fact harm consumer welfare by punishing aggressive pricing and preventing mergers that would reduce costs and therefore prices. "Consumer welfare" came to be equated with economic efficiency, notably in the Reagan administration's 1982 merger guidelines, which aimed to proscribe the "ability of one or more firms profitably to maintain prices above competitive levels"a radical departure from the previous 1968 guidelines, which had aimed "to preserve and promote market structures conducive to competition." Another change was the narrowing of the definition of "barriers to entry" to exclude incumbent advantages from economies of scale and capital requirements. The argument was that all firms were subject to the threat of potential competition, so market power was always fleeting, and antitrust enforcement rarely needed.This helps explain why neither IBM in the 1960s nor Microsoft in the 1990s was split up, despite their dominance of, respectively, computer hardware and software. The most that happened was that IBM had to open its platform to independent software developers and Microsoft was obliged to disclose details about the workings of its Windows operating system to rivals. The failure of the antitrust action against Microsoft looks, with hindsight, like a major turning point. Microsoft had sought to bundle its Windows operating system with its own web browser, Internet Explorer, to the disadvantage of its rival, Netscape. On April 3, 2000, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled that Microsoft had committed monopolization, attempted monopolization and tying, in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act and on June 7, 2000, ordered a breakup of Microsoft. However, Jackson was removed from the case after he talked to reporters in an off-the-record discussion before his final decision. The DC Circuit Court of Appeals then overturned Jackson's rulings and in 2002 the company reached a settlement with the Department of Justice that left it intact. Microsoft survived, though it has been argued that the warning shot fired by Judge Jackson had a significant effect on the conduct of Bill Gates and his colleagues. Plans to program Internet Explorer so that it would redirect users away from Google to MSN Search, or simply warn them against Google, were quietly shelved.The interpretation and enforcement of today's U.S. competition laws follow two main principles: the per se concept, whereby behaviors with no judicially redeeming characteristics are illegal per se, and the rule of reason, where the illegality of behaviors rests on their probable negative effect on market competition or in creating "restraints of trade." Antitrust laws and market regulations are enforced in three ways: criminal and civil enforcement actions brought by the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division, civil enforcement actions brought by the FTC, and lawsuits brought by private parties asserting damage claims. Yet in practice the law did almost nothing to stand in the way of the emergence of the network platforms. How could "consumer welfare" be harmed by "free" services such as Facebook. Where were barriers to entry to the Internet? The absence of good answers to such questions encouraged an increasingly overt defense of monopoly in Silicon Valley. During a 2011 Senate Judiciary Committee antitrust hearing, Alphabet Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt observed: "It's also possible to not use Google search." If competition was "one click away," how was Google in breach of antitrust law? In his book Zero to One, Paypal founder and early Facebook investor Peter Thiel argued that competition was for losers, as it eroded profits; only companies with a shot at establishing a monopoly were worth investing in. At the start-up incubator Y-combinator, according to its president Sam Altman, "We ... ask how the company will one day be a monopoly ... We're looking for businesses that get more powerful with scale and that are difficult to copy."In reaction to such boasts, some attempt to revitalize antitrust law was highly likely. In "Amazon's Antitrust Paradox," Lina M. Khan argues that the big tech companies have created conflicts of interest by using their dominant platforms to promote their own services against those of their competitors. This is in line with the reasoning advanced by the European Commission when it fined Google for giving more prominence to its own shopping services in search results. Khan has also revived the presumption of predation in cases of below-cost pricing, which others have argued creates pernicious long-term effects on productive investment, worker wages, product quality, and consumer choice.102 Roger McNamee, one of Facebook's earliest investors, has denounced "the U.S. government's laissez-faire approach to regulation" and called for (among other things) a ban on further acquisitions by the network platforms, an insistence on more equitable end-user license agreements with meaningful opt-out clauses, a return of data to the ownership of consumers, andlast but not leasta revival of "the country's traditional approach to monopoly."103There are two problems with the attempt to revive pre-Bork and Bowman antitrust, aside from the extreme difficulty of achieving a rapid paradigm shift in the minds of judges. First, the software industry is prone to natural monopoly or oligopoly. Software reduces friction along existing value chains, often reconfiguring industries into two-sided markets, with platforms intermediating between owners of assets or providers of services and consumers. As demonstrated by the work of Nobel laureate Jean Tirole, two-sided markets exhibit powerful network effects and therefore produce just a few dominant firms, an effect compounded by the aggressive use of patents in software markets and a deliberately engineered lack of inter-operability. Preferential attachment models, such as those developed by the physicist Albert-Laszl Barabasi, describe markets where strength begets strength. For example, in social media networks, the users with the most friends or followers are the most likely to get any additional nodes added to the network. This produces a power-law-like distribution that makes it all but impossible for latecomers to succeed. These insights from network science challenge the Chicago School's belief that high capital requirements or regulation are the most important barriers to market entry; network effects create a new kind of barrier. Breaking up network platforms would reduce these effects because the whole network is genuinely more valuable than the sum of its parts (Metcalfe's law).In any case, the historian is bound to point out that even supposedly successful antitrust actions in reality achieved much less than was intended. The outcome of the breakup of Standard Oil was in fact to make Rockefeller richer. The 34 "Baby Standards" were worth a combined $600 million in 1911, swelling to $2.9 billion in value and paying out $920 million in dividends by 1921, making Rockefeller one of the richest men in history. The interoperability forced on Microsoft, which allowed rivals to make their products more compatible with Windows, only made Microsoft more central to the software ecosystem. After the original 2001 judgment ordering the breakup of Microsoft, many predicted the company's decline. But Microsoft retained more than 90 per cent of the operating system market until last year and Apple did not surpass it in market capitalization until 2010.If breaking up big tech is either impossible or pointless, the obvious answer is to regulate the network platforms as utilities. There are ample precedents. In the 1876 case of Munn vs. Illinois, the Supreme Court upheld the power of the government to regulate private industries such as the railroads, though the railroads defied any attempts to regulate prices and the Munn decision was eventually reversed. The creation in 1886 of the Interstate Commerce Commission gave the government real power to intervene, but enforcement was left to the courts, which usually sided with the railroads. It was not until the twentieth century that the railroads came to be regulatedin other words, after the monopolized market had leveled off in innovation, growth and profitability. History shows that, in the United States, government intervention often serves to cement the dominance of large players for the foreseeable future, and that equity holders generally fare quite well. As Gabriel Kolko demonstrated in two seminal booksRailroads and Regulation and The Triumph of Conservatismlate nineteenth century regulation was often designed to stabilize profitability in oligopolistic industries that had reached maturity. This is a judgment supported by Carlotta Perez's more recent work on technological development, Carl H. Fulda's study of inland water-carriers, aircraft, and motor carriers, and conservative economist and jurist Richard A. Posner's work on natural monopoly regulation. It is therefore hard to summon up much enthusiasm for the prospect of a more assertive FTCor for that matter FCCworking in tandem with the biggest companies of Silicon Valley to create a regulatory framework very likely to entrench their market dominance.Senator Mark Warner's October 2018 paper on "Potential Policy Proposals" illustrates what a more heavily regulated tech sector might have to contend with.104 Out of twenty proposals, two have already made it into law:1. Duty to label bots ("Blade Runner" law).2. Disclosure requirements for online political advertisements (Honest Ads Act).Four of Warner's proposals envisage new legislation:3. Comprehensive (GDPR-like) data protection legislation and establish an enforcement agency4. Legislation banning so-called "dark patterns" such as Facebook nudges to induce users to upload their contacts.5. A Data Transparency Bill that would "require companies to more granularly (and continuously) alert consumers to the ways in which their data was being used, counterparties it was being used with, and ... what each user's data was worth to the platform."6. A Data Portability Bill: "predicated on a legal recognition that data supplied by ... users (or user activity) is the users'not the service provider's."Only one Warner proposal envisages reducing the scope of legislation, namely removing Section 230 immunity for state-level "dignitary torts" such as defamation, false light, public disclosure of private facts.Four other proposals would, implicitly or explicitly, increase the power of existing federal agencies or create a new agency:7. Restore the FTC's rulemaking authority with respect to privacy.8. Create an interagency task force for countering asymmetric threats to democratic institutions9. Establish a public initiative for media literacy10. Increase deterrence against foreign manipulationA total of eight would impose new duties or responsibilities on network platforms, which presumably one or more of these regulatory agencies would enforce:11. Duty to determine [the] origin of posts and / or accounts12. Duty to identify inauthentic accounts13. Information fiduciary duty, stipulating "not only that providers had to zealously protect user data, but also [that they had to] pledge not to utilize or manipulate the data for the benefit of the platform or third parties."14. Obligation to make anonymized activity data available to "independent, public interest researchers" (Public Interest Data Access Bill)15. Requirement to get first-party consent for data collection16. Requirement to provide consumers with the sources of data used to make algorithmic determinations or classifications.17. Requirement for platforms to make their services interoperable with other platforms.18. Obligation to make "essential facilities" (e.g., Google Maps) publicly available a "fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory" (FRAND) terms.Only one (the requirement to open federal datasets to university researchers and qualified small businesses) asks anything from the government.This is a list fraught with technical difficulties. For example, it is often impossible to origins of posts and accounts. Insisting on identification could have unintended consequences for users living in authoritarian states and even for the civil rights of those living in democracies. Is it entirely clear to whom data belongs, if it is data based on the platform's observation of user behavior? Would not increased portability of data go hand in hand with increased insecurity? But the biggest objection to Warner's approach is that, as in the past, increasing the powers of federal agencies would incentivize the already establish network platforms to collude with those agencies to raise entry-barriers. For example, data portability might entrench incumbents by obliging any new entrants to give them access to their data.A fourth approach would be to go beyond Warner's more limited proposal on Section 230 and repeal it altogether, ending the exemption of network platforms from liability for the content they host. That exemption made sense when these companies were fledglings or did not yet exist. Today, it gives the biggest companies in the world both power and influence without responsibility or accountability. One appealing feature of getting rid of Section 230 is that it would be left to the courts to bring the network platforms to heel when plaintiffs could show that a harm had arisen from, say, a fake news story disseminated by Facebook's News Feed. Already the courts have established that the network platforms are not exempt from liability to warn and product liability, because they have a duty of care to warn users of potential dangers. Indeed, given social media's uniquely deep and wide knowledge of users' interactions and relationships, they have unprecedented abilities to foresee potential harms. In one important case, a model ("Jane Doe") had been lured by scammers on ModelMayhem, a social network for models and photographers, who then drugged and raped her, filming the incident for a pornographic video. Internet Brands, the owner of ModelMayhem, was aware of this rape ring, but did not warn any of its users. In Jane Doe No. 14 v. Internet Brands, Inc., the 9th circuit court ruled that "Doe's negligent failure to warn claim did not seek to hold Internet Brands liable as the 'publisher or speaker of any information provided by another ...' and therefore the Communications Decency Act did not bar the claim." This case has established an important limit on Section 230 immunity, but it also exposes the anachronistic nature of Section 230 itself. If Internet Brands should have warned Jane Doe of the dangers of using ModelMayhem, why should not Facebook have warned all its users of the dangers of Russian-generated fake news targeted at them through the News Feed?105There is, however, an important corollary. If we are to end the fiction that network platforms are not, in some respects, media companies or publishers, then we must at the same time end the equally dangerous fiction that they are not in many respects the modern public sphere. A first step has already been taken in this direction. In Packingham v. North Carolinathe Supreme Court last year overturned a state law that banned sex offenders from using social media. In the opinion, Justice Anthony Kennedy likened internet platforms to "the modern public square," arguing that it was therefore unconstitutional to prevent sex offenders from accessing, and expressing opinions, on social network platforms. In other words, despite being private companies, the big tech companies have, in some cases, a public function. "While in the past there may have been difficulty in identifying the most important places (in a spatial sense) for the exchange of views," Justice Kennedy wrote, "today the answer is clear. It is cyberspacethe vast democratic forums of the Internet in general, and social media in particular." In May this year the Southern District of New York gave a similar ruling in Knight First Amendment Institute v. Donald J. Trump, Hope Hicks, Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Daniel Scavino:We hold that portions of the @realDonaldTrump accountthe "interactive space" where Twitter users may directly engage with the content of the President's tweetsare properly analyzed under the "public forum" doctrines set forth by the Supreme Court, that such space is a designated public forum, and that the blocking of the plaintiffs based on their political speech constitutes viewpoint discrimination that violates the First Amendment.106As president, Donald Trump could not therefore block Twitter users from seeing his tweets.If the network platforms are the new public sphere, then it cannot be their responsibility to remove "hateful content," as 19 prominent civil right groups demanded of Facebook in October 2017, because hateful contentunless it explicitly instigates violence against a specific personis protected by the First Amendment. To be sure, Kate Klonick has argued that tech companies should not "be held to a First Amendment standard," because that would mean "porn stays up, spam stays up, everything stays up." But this is not convincing. It is better that porn and spam "stay up" than that our freedom of speech be circumscribed by the community standards of unaccountable private companies, run by men who imagine themselves to be emperors.ConclusionIn a series of brilliant essays, the former Facebook engineer Sam Lessin has challenged much received wisdom about the Internet. As he puts it, the Internet "increasingly represents a strange hybrid of the public and private spheres." The problem revealed in 2016, he argues, was not fake news or feed ranking but the fact that "a public candidate can for the first time effectively talk to each individual voter privately in their own home and tell them exactly what they want to hear." Moreover, the disappearing message feature of Snapchat and Instagram makes tracking of all advertisements harder. "Lots of data, and systems which can react properly to the interests, beliefs, and feelings of different people lead to a world where technology and brands tell us exactly what we want to hear in a way that can't be tracked or audited." Far from worrying about "echo chambers," we need to worry about "personal, private and disappearing messaging that can be powerful but can't be broadly traced or audited."107For Lessin, the Internet is no more likely to produce two opposing ideological camps than it was to produce a global community. Polarization is just a phase on the way to a much more complete atomization as "the pressure built into the internet's DNA, accelerated by things like artificial intelligence, ... threatens to undermine our ability to understand one another [and] see reality the same way." Lessin poses a series of difficult questions:Is Anonymity a Feature to Be Protected, or a Bug to Be Quashed? (Looks like the latter.)Should Anyone Be Able to Reach Everyone? (Not clear. Who gets through the email gateways?)Is Money a Form of Speech? (If extreme views are stickier than moderate ones, they are cheaper to disseminate online.)Who Decides What Algorithms and Human Policies Control Our View of Reality? (Answer: network platforms, i.e. private corporations in conjunction with ~200 governments. Means rising costs.)Will We Tolerate Unregulated Escape Hatches for Free Speech? (Answer: if not, the global village blows up.)108His worry is that the Internet is a kind of fission bomb. First it shrank the world into a global village; now it threatens to start "a chain reaction that, just like a nuclear weapon, will cause the world to violently explode." The problem is that, with the consolidation of the public sphere in the network platforms and the rapid collapse of the private sphere, we are losing the ability to let off steam because nothing is any longer "off the record."109Nothing is off the record, but no record is wholly reliable. As technological advances make it easier to create believable fake photos, video and audio recording, we may soon find ourselves unmoored from the modes of rational verification we have evolved since the Scientific Revolution. The network platforms flourished in an anarchic Internet because they appeared to create trust. But our trust in them was misplaced, because their business models incentivized them to send us fake news from fake accounts if it was sufficiently engaging. Our biggest vulnerability turns out to be that while our appetite for entertainmentbranded as fictionis finite, our appetite for "edutainment"entertaining content branded as educational or informativeseems almost infinite. As a result, when we go online, we find ourselves a "world where we are connected to less trustworthy people and organizations than we ever would have been in the physical world. The value of the human network has almost reversed itselffrom being an incredibly good way to 'clean' content and refine information to a system that packages together good and bad information and leaves the two indistinguishable."110 Worse, we are no longer able to distinguish when we are connected to another human being or to a bot or other device. Those who talk of the "Internet of Things" seem to believe we shall be able to tell the 8 billion people from the 30 billion "things" that will be connected to the Internet by 2020. That will be hard when many of the things will appear to be people.111To some commentators, the future looks exceedingly bleak. The advance of artificial intelligence, they argue, dooms mankind to a new totalitarianism, rendering liberal democracy and free-market economics "obsolete." According to Yuval Noah Harari, "once we begin to count on AI to decide what to study, where to work, and whom to date or even marry, human life will cease to be a drama of decision making. ... We are now creating tame humans who produce enormous amounts of data and function as efficient chips in a huge data-processing mechanism." We shall soon be to data what cows are to milk.112 Lessin is only slightly more optimistic. He envisages two viable futures (and one untenable one that tries to lie between the two extremes). In his authoritarian future, national governments end up regulating all private and public speech, and the Internet effectively breaks up. In such a scenario, all countries end up going down the Chinese road. However, there is an alternative worldof "technologically guaranteed free speech," based on blockchain technology. In this future, each person would have a public and private key-pair, as with today's cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. But this would be a blockchain-based system of communication and record-keeping:Everyone could be identified by their public key. Anyone could write public or private "claims" about any other key (signing the information with their key and the keys of intended recipients). And, critically, all the "speech" shared over time could be stored in an append-only distributed database ... that would make it impossible for anyone to rewrite history or limit speech. ... anyone could say anything to anyone else. Anyone could remember anything they wanted. No one's identity could be blocked or eliminated. We would have true freedom of speech, memory and identity.Yet this would be no libertarian paradise because "people could have as many different identities as they want ... fraudulent identities spewing falsehood would abound. ... there would be a huge amount of junk, lies and attempted manipulation ... the most abhorrent speech [would be] unstoppable. Bullying would abound."113 Subversive interventions by foreign governments would presumably abound, too.None of these futures is very appealing, but each becomes more plausible the longer we leave the Internet in its present state, with generally incompetent or repressive regulation by governments or bogus self-regulation by the network platforms. The events of 2016 should have made it clear that the status quo is indefensible. The network platforms are too powerful and too reckless, too addicted to making us addicted, to be left to regulate themselves. We do not wish to follow China down the road to the surveillance state. It is doubtful that we should passively follow Europe as it seeks, at one and the same time, to live off the network platforms, by taxing and fining them, and to delegate the power of public censorship to them. It would be far better if the United States, before succumbing to the terrors of science fictional futures, sought to learn from history.The network platforms are new, but they have recognizable antecedents. They combine the pricing power of the big railroad companies with the monopolistic tendencies of Standard Oil; the political influence of William Randolph Hearst with the technological leadership of ATandT and IBM; the convenience of Microsoft with the addictiveness and harmfulness of cigarettes. That we should trust them not to "be evil" is out of the question. We should always have expected them both to move fast and to break things that we did not want to have broken. It will not be enough to tilt the balance of power a little in the favor of the ISPs. Antitrust alone is not likely to be a swift enough remedy, and it would be a chronic optimist who believed a federal government agency would solve all the problems described above. (The recent record of financial regulators offers almost no encouragement.) Far better, surely, to oblige the network platforms to deal directly with citizens and competitors through the lawcourts, by removing the privilege on which they have grown so fatthe exemption from liability for content, established by Section 230and at the same time to impose on them the obligation that is appropriate for entities that now so dominate the public sphere: the duty to uphold the First Amendment. This combination of remedies seems consonant with the traditions of American government. It recognizes the difficulty of reviving antitrust law in the age of network economics. It avoids the pitfall of entrusting too much power to bureaucrats. Yet by simultaneously increasing the network platforms' costs and reducing their power to distort the democratic process, the measures proposed here would, if implemented, stand a reasonable chance of reining in the new Rockefellersnot to mention the Caesarsof Silicon Valley.Niall Ferguson is the Milbank Family Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution and a senior fellow of the Center for European Studies at Harvard University, where he served for twelve years as the Laurence A.

One way to do this would be to make clear that the Section 230 safe harbor does not apply to the platform's contributory or vicarious liability for third-party content. Vicarious liability (which would arise when the platform has the right, duty, or ability to control conduct and benefits from the conduct) would be especially important for shaping the behavior of platforms that benefit from third-party content (by selling advertising tied to the content, for example). A phased-in duty to control would give big tech companies a very strong incentive to address tortious material on their platforms, much as YouTube was induced to deal with rampant copyright infringement on its platform by a long and expensive round of litigation.106 U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, ruling in May 23, 2018.107 Sam Lessin, Free Speech and Democracy in the Age of Micro-Targeting," The Information, December 5, 2016.108 Sam Lessin, "The Tower of Babel: Five Challenges of the Modern Internet," The Information, November 6, 2017.109 Ibid.110 Sam Lessin, "How the Internet Broke and What to Do About It," The Information, September 4, 2018.111 Philip Howard, Pax Technica How the Internet of Things May Set Us Free Or Lock Us Up (New Haven / London: Yale University Press, 2015).112 Yuval Noah Harari, "Why Technology Favors Tyranny," The Atlantic, October 2018.113 Lessin, "How the Internet Broke."Load-Date: November 15, 2018End of Document

Companies that continue buying Iranian crude after the sanctions risk being denied access to the US banking system and clearing purchases priced in dollars such as crude oil.The news on China came after OPEC on Thursday said it may have to trim oil output as global inventories rise.An OPEC and non-OPEC ministerial panel said in the statement that cartel members "expressed concerns about rising inventories in recent weeks and also noted looming macroeconomic uncertainties which may require changing course."Separately, Reuters reported similar remarks from a Saudi official."We are of the view that the market in the fourth quarter could be shifting towards an oversupply situation as evidenced by rising inventories over the past few weeks," Saudi OPEC governor Adeeb Al-Aama told Reuters on Thursday.Ahead, Baker Hughes reports on the weekly US oil rig count, which posted a gain last week to 873,  at 13:00 EDT. US natural gas futures rose 0.66% to $3.187 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) after weekly data on Thursday.The Energy Information Administration reported an 58 billion cubic feet (bcf) storage jump for the week ended Oct.19 in its latest report, an injection 40% below the five-year average for this week, but above an expected 45-55 Bcf  injection expected by Credit Suisse analysts.(First Oil reports are produced by MT Newswires' global team of oil reporters.

Bolton: White House knew about Huawei arrestPolitico.comDecember 6, 2018 Thursday 6:00 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 1215 wordsByline: lgardner@politico.com,  (Lauren Gardner)BodyWhite House officials knew Canada was about to arrest a top executive of the Chinese telecom giant Huawei even as President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met over dinner last weekend in Argentina, National Security Adviser John Bolton told NPR Thursday. Sabrina Meng, vice chairman and chief financial officer of Huawei was detained by Canadian authorities in Vancouver on Saturday, but the news didn't become public until Wednesday night.Markets dropped Thursday as the news cast fresh doubts on the U.S. and China's ability to work out the trade dispute that has for months threatened both economies.Bolton told NPR he learned of the forthcoming arrest as part of a routine Justice Department briefing. An administration official told POLITICO that Trump and most of the other senior aides at the dinner with Xi in Buenos Aires knew about the extradition request until after the dinner.The Chinese government on Thursday demanded answers as Meng remained in detention in Canada, facing extradition to the U.S.Meng, whose Chinese name is Meng Wanzhou, faces an investigation into whether she has run afoul of U.S. trade sanctions against Iran, The Globe and Mail reported Thursday. The investigation is reportedly being handled by prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's office in the Eastern District of New York. A spokesperson for that office declined to comment to POLITICO.It also comes as part of a broader U.S. investigation into whether Huawei was using the global banking system to circumvent U.S. sanctions against Iran, Reuters reported Thursday, citing sources familiar with the situation.A bail hearing for Meng is set for Friday, said Ian McLeod, a spokesman for Canada's Department of Justice."As there is a publication ban in effect, we cannot provide any further detail at this time," McLeod said in a statement. "The ban was sought by Ms. Meng."U.S. concerns about security risks posed by Chinese technology companies are one of the central points of tension between the two countries and were a primary focus of discussions Saturday during the dinner meeting among members of Xi and Trump's teams. Huawei is an influential company in China, making network gear and smartphones that it sells worldwide. Bolton noted Thursday that Huawei "is one company we've been concerned about" regarding its history of what the White House sees as forced technology transfers and the theft of intellectual property.Allegations that Huawei poses a cybersecurity risk spurred Congress to pass legislation this summer banning the U.S. government from procuring equipment or services from the company, as well as from another Chinese telecommunications firm, ZTE.The fiscal 2019 National Defense Authorization Act passed in September includes a governmentwide ban on procuring equipment and services from Huawei and ZTE, as well as several other telecommunications firms with ties to the Chinese government.A bipartisan group of lawmakers from the Senate Intelligence Committee has also written to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to register alarm over the prospect of Huawei or other Chinese state-directed companies being included in the development of Canada's 5G network.Over the past few days, few details have emerged about Saturday's trade talks. China has agreed to resume imports of U.S. agriculture and energy goods, and the U.S. has suspended an escalation of tariffs. U.S. officials have also said Beijing will immediately address issues related to the Trump administration's complaints over forced technology transfer and other practices they say are aimed at U.S. companies, but China has not confirmed if or when it will make those changes.However, China has put out positive statements on the talks even after Meng was arrested on Dec. 1. In a statement on Wednesday, China's Ministry of Commerce called the meeting between the president "very successful.""China and the U.S. should follow the consensus reached by the two heads of state to step up consultations and reach a mutually beneficial agreement at an early date," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said during a news conference on Thursday.Beijing said Thursday that the U.S. and Canadian authorities had yet to clarify their reason for arresting Meng. Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng said Beijing is asking the U.S and Canada to release her."Detaining the person involved with no explicit reason certainly harms her human rights," Geng said. "In addition, like I said just now, neither the U.S. nor Canada has made any clarification on the reason for the detention so far."The detainment of a prominent executive at a prominent company could be viewed in China as a direct attack."Clearly, it will make the relationship worse," said Bill Reinsch, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "Their tendency is to assume anytime something like this happens that there are implications for the relationship - that it was done deliberately and that the whole thing is extralegal and it's part of U.S. policy."The U.S. has asked for Meng's transfer, and in Canada, these cases are considered virtually automatic: The Canadian government systematically approves American extradition requests, with few exceptions - such as the possibility the accused might face the death penalty in the U.S. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters on Thursday that he was given advance notice of the arrest but did not intervene and has not discussed the issue with the Chinese.Members of Congress began praising the arrest on Wednesday and Thursday. Sen.Ted Cruz (R-Texas), for one, criticized Huawei as "a Communist Party spy agency thinly veiled as a telecom company."Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), who serves as vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said it's clear that Huawei and ZTE are a threat to national security."Now we know that Huawei, like ZTE, has violated U.S. sanctions law," he said in a statement. "It's my hope that the Trump Administration will hold Huawei fully accountable for breaking sanctions law, as it failed to do in the case of ZTE."Asked whether he was worried about Chinese retaliation, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) emphasized that the incident was purely a law enforcement matter and not a political one. "Someone breaks the law, you can't say, 'We're not going to arrest him, we're not going to prosecute them because they happen to work for a company linked to a very powerful nation,'" he told POLITICO. "'It's as simple as that."Meng is also the daughter of Huawei's founder and CEO, Ren Zhengfei. Some mainland China media have identified Meng as a leading contender to succeed her father, the South China Morning Post reported.Shortly before he was ousted, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions had announced a crackdown to combat Chinese economic espionage to identify Chinese trade theft cases that are a priority for the administration. He said he would ensure the department has enough resources to investigate them and bring them an to appropriate conclusion quickly and effectively.Amanda Eisenberg contributed to this report from New York; Adam Behsudi, Andrew Restuccia and Martin Matishak contributed from Washington; and Alex Panetta contributed from Montreal.Article originally published on POLITICO MagazineLoad-Date: December 7, 2018End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 25 of 322A software developer just became the latest victim of China's VPN crackdown  Page 27 of 322A software developer just became the latest victim of China's VPN crackdown  Page 30 of 322China's economy had a tough 2018.
