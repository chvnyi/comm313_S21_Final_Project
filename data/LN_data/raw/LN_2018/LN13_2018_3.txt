At Homeland Security Hearing, Sen. Portman Presses DHS on Cybersecurity, PSI Report on Drug Traffickers Shipping Fentanyl Through the MailTargeted News ServiceFebruary 7, 2018 Wednesday 8:24 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1971 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe office of Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, issued the following news release:U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH), during today's Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC) roundtable on "Reauthorizing DHS: Positioning DHS to Address New and Emerging Threats to the Homeland," questioned Department of Homeland Security leadership on ways in which they are working to improve the department's ability to respond to new and emerging threats, such as cybersecurity vulnerabilities and the shipment of deadly drugs like fentanyl through the United States Postal Service. Last month, Portman released a shocking bipartisan report (https://www.portman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/files/serve?File_id=12F93202-C8EC-4AF1-8A66-181EE6716F37) that details how drug traffickers exploit vulnerabilities in our international mail system to easily ship synthetic drugs like fentanyl from China into the United States. His legislation, the STOP Act, is designed to help save lives by keeping these deadly drugs out of our communities. DHS Deputy Secretary Elaine Duke confirmed again that the department supports Portman's legislation.Transcript of his questioning can be found below, and a video can be found here (https://youtu.be/JBq8EG0-8Yc).Senator Portman: "I'd like to piggyback on the cyber issue because one of the questions I wanted to ask was about workforce. As you know, back in 2014, we wrote bipartisan legislation--this committee strongly supported it--to upgrade your abilities in cyberspace. I'm very concerned about the lack of retention and also being able to attract top-flight talent. That was three years ago. We asked that GAO do a report three years out. I'm pleased to say, Mr. Scott, that we got the report just a few days ago, which is great. I saw it for the first time last night. Your report basically says that the DHS has missed all kinds of deadlines. I understand the need to help state and local. I understand the need to help our own, but if we don't have the personnel to do it, it makes it incredibly challenging. So quickly, Mr. Scott, tell us what are your specific recommendations right now as to how we get DHS back on track and begin to attract this workforce we need."Mr. Scott: "Thank you, Senator Portman. As you mentioned, just yesterday we issued a report really highlighting the urgent need for the department to take additional steps to identify its cybersecurity positions and critical skill requirements. In summary, the department has made some progress categorizing and signing certain codes to some of its cybersecurity positions. There are also some concerns about the accuracy about the information they provided. For example, I think they estimated about 95 percent of their positions were identified. We came in and did an analysis and found that it's really around 79 percent because the department basically excluded some of the vacant positions. They didn't count those in the math. We made six recommendations including for DHS to enhance the procedures around identifying these vacant positions, improving their workforce data, and developing specific plans to identify and report on critical cyber needs. The department concurred with all six recommendations, so our expectations within the next two years or so is that they should be further along in addressing some of these critical cyber workforce needs."Senator Portman: "Secretary Duke, one of your recommendations was to have accountability. In other words, have someone responsible for every component, and I think that's something that you two should focus on given your management responsibilities. Second, I was involved in 2002 with the legislation that created the department, as some of you know. I have wondered sometimes since then whether we have created a behemoth, something that is just too difficult to manage, but having said that, the risks that we face in an increasingly dangerous and volatile world I think require us to have one agency to focus on keeping us safe. At the time, we did try to align the committee structure with the department, unsuccessfully. Again, in the 9/11 report, this was talked about, but I agree with what the Chairman and my other colleagues have said about that, [which] is that it is difficult for you. And the Chairman talked about the number of testimonies you have had to give over the last year and the inability for you all to focus on your core function because you are dealing with so many different committees and subcommittees. So I do think it is a good idea, Mr. Chairman, and the first step in it is to have an authorization from this committee because we have the bulk of the jurisdiction, and if we aren't taking that jurisdiction seriously and ensuring that we do have authorizations, we're going to continue to have even more erosion of that responsibility. So, this is good. We tried this back in 2011. Susan Collins and Joe Lieberman tried it. We were able to get it out of committee. We were never able to get it across the floor. So, I'm glad you are doing this, and this authorization, as I understand, is going to be a little narrower to try to avoid issues. I hope we can do this in a bipartisan basis as kind of a first step towards a much broader issue here, which is: how do you manage this department that has so many different silos, as Mr. Kelly said earlier, and make it work better as a single entity? This will help."On oversight, I've got to raise, as Chairman of the PSI Committee--the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations--you all have not been responsive on a few of our requests and we push, we push, and we write letters, but let me just give you three quickly. One is, way back in April of 2017, we asked some questions about the management of the Chief Information Office. I'm not going to go into the details because we don't make these investigations public typically until we report, but we need that information. We have been given a minimal amount of documents, most of which are not at all responsive to the request, so we need help there. Second is, back in December, we asked about your privately-run immigration detention facilities. Again, not to get into the details but we need that information, and you guys have not been responsive. You have not produced any documents. We have made phone calls, sent emails, status updates. We need that information--that was back on December 6th. Then finally, January of this year. Just a couple of weeks ago, we asked you guys for information on the procedures to protect unaccompanied alien children. You remember we had this hearing and a report on this topic and have deep concern about the lack of accountability. This was Senator McCaskill and myself. We are simply looking for what we were told at the time you were doing, which was a memorandum of agreement that you were going to have between HHS and DHS. We were told it would be done a year ago almost, February 22, 2017. You still haven't done it. So, we need to figure out a way to get that information to us, figure out why you haven't accomplished it, and what we can do to push DHS and HHS to get that memorandum of understanding to protect these kids. So on all these issues, can I get a commitment from you all today? I want to ask for two weeks, but I will be much more generous. I will ask for four weeks. But we need to have a response."Elaine Duke: "My apologies, Senator. I was not personally aware of that and I do commit that to you. I will give this committee an update next week on all three in that timeline for giving you that information."Senator Portman: "Finally, Mr. Chairman this will be my last point, with regard to the hearing and the report from last week on the fact that dangerous chemicals, synthetic opioids, are coming into our country through our own U.S. mail system and your Customs and Border Protection: people are not able to stop it because they do not have the information. We need to pass the STOP Act. My colleagues for the most part here are cosponsors of that and I think would agree with me, but we also ask for some other things in that report which is that DHS work better with the Chinese government to shut down these labs, to stop the shippers, to deal with it in China. And I know you were, along with Attorney General Sessions, at a session on this broader issue of securities issues with China last year. Can you tell us has that happened with regard to China and their willingness to help us to stop this poison from coming into our communities by stopping it at the source?"Elaine Duke: "We have made progress with China. The biggest thing is that the percentage of packages that we can track, which is key to shutting it down, has over doubled and we are making more progress. We need to be able to track all of them but the Chinese government has been very cooperative in that they do not..."Senator Portman: "Has not been very cooperative?"Elaine Duke: "They have been very cooperative in being able to track packages."Senator Portman: "How are they being cooperative?"Elaine Duke: "They are helping us institute a tracking system with the mail service. We do not have a mail service tracking system in the United States and there isn't an international one, so we have very good tracking of DHS, DHL, UPS, and FedEx."Senator Portman: "You have 100 percent tracking there because you require them to do it, and we should require the Post Office to do the same thing, but only half of the packages coming in of that increased volume, admittedly from China, have that kind of advanced electronic data on them. So they are not there yet, just so you know, and my goal is not just to have that tracking information, which is very important and that is what the STOP Act focuses on, but how do we actually get China to do what they say they want to do, because after our hearing in this committee room a Chinese government official spokespeople said, 'yes, we want to cooperate more with the United States.' To me, that seems like that was an extension of some kind of olive branch to you all to get with them and to begin to crackdown. Not just to have the codes and to have the information, but to actually stop these labs. There are thousands of them in China. We know that. They are creating this poison that is coming into our community and beginning to prosecute some of these people who are involved. We have two indictments. They have yet to arrest these individuals that we have indicted over here who are Chinese nationals. My question is what more can we do on that front and what have you done?"Elaine Duke: "We have been working them regularly, principally through the Department of State, in terms of working with China. But it isn't a China problem. We have an opioid conference going on now in Miami that I leave for tonight to look at how we can do enforcement. As you know, it is hard to discuss everything in this environment, but the transit to some countries south of us, we are looking at that and stopping it not only in China but the transit. And then also the president's council on trying to do the deterrence for opioids. We support the STOP Act. We are hitting it from many angles. It is a challenging problem."Senator Portman: "We could go on and on, but I would just say, your own people tell us that primarily through our own mail system and primarily from China right now--and understandably there is a lot of transshipment going on right now and maybe even some new routes being developed--but we know we have got a huge issue right here. It is the number one killer in my home state of Ohio. Now, 60 percent of overdose deaths this last year were from fentanyl and carfentanil. Thank you for pushing the Chinese more on helping to stop this at the source."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6157603 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: February 8, 2018End of Document

Xiaozhu Eyes Growth as China Supports Sharing EconomyPR NewswireMarch 6, 2018 Tuesday 7:00 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 391 wordsDateline: BEIJING, March 6, 2018 Body China Sharing Economy Annual Report 2017 was released in Beijing Feb. 28th by China State Information Center. According to the report, the sharing economy market transaction volume reached over 4.92 trillion yuan (778 billion U.S. dollars) last year, up 47.2 percent year on year. Xiaozhu remained a leading player in the sector.According to the report, more than 700 million people participated in sharing economy in 2017, 100 million more compared with 2016. While car-hailing and home sharing still remained the top shared services, new players into the battleground include bicycle sharing, power-bank sharing, and so forth. The booming sharing market yielded 216 billion yuan (34 billion U.S. dollars) in total, rising 25.7 percent from the year before.Wang Liantao, co-founder and COO of Xiaozhu, China's largest home sharing platform, expects to see greater growth in 2018. "As a leading player of the industry, Xiaozhu has witnessed and played a significant part in the booming of China's sharing economy," said Mr. Wang. "Xiaozhu's GMV increased by 1200 percent from 2015 to 2017." Mr. Wang added.Xiaozhu has long been seen as Airbnb's China answer. According to a recent report released by the company, it now has more than 250,000 listings and 20,000,000 registered users. Founded in 2012, Xiaozhu finished its 120-million-USD Series E funding last November. The funding round was led by Jack Ma backed Yunfeng Capital.On Mar. the 5th, "sharing economy" was mentioned once again by premier Li Keqiang in his annual government work report during the National People's Congress. "In high-speed rail, e-commerce, mobile payments and the sharing economy, China is leading the world," Mr. Li said.Chen Chi, cofounder and CEO of Xiaozhu believes that the industry is gaining greater momentum with the government providing innovators with greater flexibility. "The Chinese government's flexibility has given innovators large space to try and grow fast," said Mr. Chen, "we do hope there'd be clearer laws and regulations soon so the industry can be better protected.""China has the potential to set the world's frontier in many sectors, including sharing economy," Mr. Chen said. View original content with multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/xiaozhu-eyes-growth-as-china-supports-sharing-economy-300608721.htmlSOURCE Xiaozhu.comCONTACT: Shilan Pan, 86 18522581743, shipanlan@xiaozhu.comLoad-Date: March 7, 2018End of Document

The representative of the Asian country arrives with the objective of advancing the good diplomatic relations between both countries and seeking channels of understanding to seal trade agreements.  In the visit of the President of the Republic, Tabaré Vázquez, to China in 2016 he agreed with Chinese President Xi Jinping to advance in the talks to sign a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between both nations.  However, internal differences in the governing party, Frente Amplio, led the Vázquez government to take priority away from the pro-FTA negotiations.  In spite of that, the Executive Power has the firm decision to advance in commercial agreements "of whatever kind", as explained to El País by a Foreign Ministry source as a policy of opening to the exterior with one of the main world powers.  A sample of the good moment that relations between the Chinese and Uruguayan governments go through is the letter that Xi Jinping sent to Vazquez on January 17 to mark the Uruguayan president's birthday.  The Chinese foreign minister will arrive today and tomorrow will hold meetings with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Rodolfo Nin Novoa, and President Vázquez. There they will seek to advance in the exchange of proposals to underline new commercial agreements.  Recently, the China-LAC summit was held, attended by more than 700 Chinese businessmen with interests to do business with Latin American peers.  One of the points where it is intended to advance in the negotiations is in terms of technology and artificial intelligence. China is particularly interested in Uruguay developing the industry linked to artificial intelligence as an experimental way to develop in Latin America.  This is a sector that China is demanding in large media and has not found partners that bet on this technological development in the South American continent. Load-Date: January 23, 2018End of Document

MARCH 2018CHINA'S ACHIEVEMENTS OVER THE PAST 40 YEARS AND CHALLENGES IN THE NEW ERA - TAKEHIKO NAKAOStates News ServiceMarch 24, 2018 SaturdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 2060 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: Mandaluyong City, Philippines BodyThe following information was released by the Asian Development Bank (ADB):Speech by ADB President Takehiko Nakao at the China Development Forum 2018 on 25 March 2018 in Beijing, People's Republic of ChinaI. IntroductionMr. He Lifeng ('cia[deg]), Chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission,Mr. Zhang Junkuo ( a†›ac‰), Vice President of the Development Research Center of the State Council,Distinguished colleagues,Ladies and gentlemen:Good morning to you all. This is the fifth time that I have had the honor to participate in this distinguished Forum as President of ADB. The China Development Forum is especially memorable this year as it marks the 40th anniversary of China's start of reforms and opening up (ac"e-iac").China joined ADB in 1986, in the early years of the country's economic transformation. ADB is proud that we have contributed to China's remarkable development. And we will continue to be China's important development partner through our lending program and knowledge work in key areas like climate change, the environment, and regional cooperation.II. China's achievements over the past 40 yearsChina's achievements over the past 40 years have been phenomenal. The country's rapid economic growth has driven per capita income from one of the poorest in the world to the level of an upper-middle income country. China is now the second largest economy globally and is approaching high-income country status.Poverty levels in China have fallen significantly. While 250 million people in the rural area lived below the national poverty line in 1978, the figure fell to 30 million at the end of 2017. China is advancing toward its target of eradicating absolute poverty by 2020. And the government has committed to the Sustainable Development Goals.China has progressed from an economy with basic agriculture and technology to a global manufacturing powerhouse. It is now transitioning to an economy driven more by consumption and services. China has become a front-runner in areas such as e-commerce and shared economies. New technologies and entrepreneurs are fostering the emergence of innovative industrial clusters.I have spoken on several occasions about eight key conditions for economic development. This idea of eight conditions was inspired by the experiences of China and others. They are:investment in infrastructure;investment in education and health;sound macroeconomic management;open investment and trade regimes;good governance and the strong delivery of public services;social inclusiveness;a clear vision for the future; andsecurity, political stability, and friendship with other countries.Indeed, China has devoted a larger portion of its gross domestic product (GDP) to infrastructure investment, such as in power and transport, compared with other developing countries. Investment in human capital has allowed China to better realize the potential of its large population. China has pursued prudent macroeconomic management, especially after the early 1990s. Its determination to adopt market systems and open trade and investment regimes has been unwavering. Regarding inclusiveness, since the founding of the People's Republic, the status of farmers and women has been significantly enhanced. The government's five-year plans have showed clear vision and strategy for the country's development and reform.Still, I have been wondering what the key is to China's success. Last year, a senior Chinese government official said to me that contrary to perceptions many people have, China's rapid growth was not just brought about by state guidance. Social drivers were the key. Reforms which started in 1978 unleashed people's aspiration to grow, to invent, and to live better lives.III. Challenges for China in a New EraToday, I would like to share my thoughts on how China can achieve high-quality development in a new era by tackling remaining and emerging challenges. I know that Chinese leaders understand these challenges. They were discussed at the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party last October and the recently concluded first session of the 13th National People's Congress.I will focus on three challenges.The first is inclusiveness. China must ensure that the entire population can enjoy the fruits of growth more equally. China has lifted millions out of poverty and people can enjoy better lives overall. But today, it is also true that China is facing the challenge of growing inequality.China is home to a large number of billionaires, but many people in lagging areas and in parts of cities still live at a subsistence level and lack access to basic services such as clean water and sanitation. China's Gini coefficient for income in 2016 was high at 0.46.Inequality is not only bad for social fairness; it will also negatively affect growth. If people do not feel equal, they have less incentive to work hard and educate their children. An equal society with a broad middle class is the basis for stability.In my view, China is already a very dynamic and innovative country with momentum for continued growth. Making society more inclusive and equal is a greater challenge for China than achieving further technological development and industrial transformation.Mobility between urban and rural areas is necessary for balanced and inclusive growth. The government is unifying the rural and urban hukou (acˆa ), the household registration system, for small and midsized cities. The Government Work Report presented to the 13th People's Congress confirmed the continued effort to expand access to many social services such as education, health, and public housing in cities for migrant workers.Reforming the tax system to support income redistribution is a priority. This should include increasing the contribution of personal income tax to government revenue and introducing taxation on inheritance and capital gains. In 2016, China's personal income tax revenue was a mere 1.4% of GDP, compared with the OECD average of 8%. Local governments' taxation power should be strengthened, including through the introduction of property tax, so that they have sufficient revenue to deliver social services. ADB is providing China with technical assistance on these reforms.Education and skills development, especially in lagging areas and with a focus on gender equality, is a strong tool to achieve inclusive growth. ADB is currently supporting a comprehensive, province-wide reform of technical and vocational education and training (TVET) in Guangxi (a»,).Fostering small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) through microfinance and capacity building is also important. An ADB-financed project in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (ac-[deg]c-†cacˆe‡ªac²»a) is boosting traditional garment production and tourism in support of ethnic minorities, especially women.China's second challenge in the new era is to tackle climate change and promote a better environment. Indeed, China is in many respects championing a green economy and is a crucial player in global efforts to mitigate climate change under the COP21 Paris Agreement.ADB is supporting a holistic plan for the Yangtze River Economic Belt (-acŸc",a¸) based on the concept of ecological civilization. We are planning to provide total funding of $2 billion for a number of interrelated projects. ADB will support water pollution control and water resources management in the upper and middle reaches of the river.In the Greater Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area (a¬ac¥a†au[deg]a), ADB has been engaged in a series of projects and reform programs since 2015 to improve air quality. For example, in 2017, ADB approved a $500 million loan to help establish a Regional Emission Reduction and Pollution Control Facility. The facility will catalyze private sector resources and support the deployment of high technologies for major emitting industries.The third challenge I want to take up is China's aging population. The number of people aged 65 years and above in China reached a record 158 million in 2017, while China's working age population started to decline in 2014. China's elderly dependency ratio is expected to exceed 30% by the mid-2030s, from 15% in 2016.ADB has been supporting China's development needs in an aging society. Our actions include support in reforming the rural social security system, strengthening health and pension administration, and building age-friendly cities. In Hubei and Hebei (ac-aŒ—a’Œac²aŒ—), ADB has been working to support elderly care services provided by local authorities in partnership with the private sector.IV. Importance of macroeconomic stability and the marketThere are many challenges in China's new era, including the three I have just mentioned. To tackle such challenges and sustain development, I would like to stress that macroeconomic stability and an efficient market are prerequisites.Regarding macroeconomic stability, as discussed in the Central Economic Work Conference last December, policymakers clearly understand the potential risks from overcapacity in some sectors, rising real estate prices, overleveraging in parts of the financial sector, and the high debt levels of the corporate sector and local authorities.China is taking a comprehensive and proactive approach to prevent systemic financial risks. It established last year the Financial Stability and Development Committee under the State Council, comprising the Central Bank, the Ministry of Finance, and financial regulators to ensure financial stability and coordinate financial reform. A new regulatory commission will be formed by merging the existing banking and insurance regulatory commissions, to better regulate the country's banking and insurance sectors. Prudential supervision functions of the Central Bank will also be strengthened.Regarding the importance of the market, I was encouraged by Vice Premier Liu He's (a ‰e) speech when I attended the World Economic Forum in Davos this January. He stated that China will continue to "let the market play a decisive role in resource allocation." He also mentioned that China is against protectionism and that it will protect property rights, especially intellectual property rights; promote fair competition; substantially open up the services sector; ease barriers to entry in the financial sector; and increase imports.I strongly believe that government and policies should lay the groundwork for economic development. But the market is critical for efficiency, innovations, and sustainable growth. Proper incentives for economic players based on rules are essential. Industrial policies should be designed and implemented in a manner which will not constrain fair competition between companies within and outside the country and will not harm efficiency over the long term.V. ConclusionLadies and gentlemen:China's position in the world community is totally different today from 40 years ago. China has a very large presence in the areas of industry, commerce, finance, culture, geopolitics, and others. Its influence and presence may be greater than what the Chinese people themselves believe.Therefore, it is quite natural that the global community expects China to play an even more important role in multiple areas. I trust that China can support other developing countries by sharing its development experiences. And China will continue to make great contributions to the world and gain respect by continuing to learn from experiences of its own and others and absorbing beneficial results of human civilizations, whether they be from the East or West.Here, I would like to recall the famous first phrase of The Analects of Confucius or Lun Yu (e-eªž).Confucius said: "Isn't it a pleasure to learn, and then from time to time recite and practice what you have learned? Isn't it also a great joy when friends visit from distant places?"aac›[deg]'ana¸eŒac,,ai'a¸a eª¬aŽ'acu‰acuie‡ª ac-a†'a¸a ac ,aŽ'anI studied this in my high school days in Japan. At that time, I didn't fully understand the profoundness of the saying. Over the years, I have become increasingly aware that learning is important, but to recite and practice is even more important for all of us.I would like to conclude my remarks by following Confucius' second point.Seeing so many friends visiting from all over the world to exchange views is another great joy.Thank you.Load-Date: March 26, 2018End of Document

Retired cardinal hits back at Vatican over deal with ChinaAssociated Press InternationalFebruary 7, 2018 Wednesday 4:53 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: LIFESTYLELength: 135 wordsDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - The retired archbishop of Hong Kong has slammed the Holy See's negotiations with the Chinese government as a "catastrophe" that would bring suffering to millions of worshippers.Retired Cardinal Joseph Zen warned in a blog post this week that some Chinese Catholics who follow so-called underground churches are at risk of arrest even while the Catholic Church pushes for a historic breakthrough in relations with China's ruling Communist Party.Zen is a leading critic of the Vatican's outreach to China. He revealed in an unusual statement last month that the Vatican had asked a legitimate "underground" bishop to stand down in favor of an excommunicated one favored by Beijing.The proposed changing of the guard was the clearest evidence yet of the Vatican's effort to reach a deal with China.Load-Date: February 7, 2018End of Document

Asian Animation, VFX & Games Industry Report 2018: Strategies, Trends & Opportunities of the $52 Billion IndustryGlobeNewswireMarch 16, 2018 Friday 2:22 AM PTCopyright 2018 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: RESEARCH ANALYSIS AND REPORTSLength: 2681 wordsBodyDublin, March  16, 2018  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The     "Asian Animation, VFX & Games Industry: Strategies, Trends & Opportunities, 2018"   report has been added to     ResearchAndMarkets.com's  offering.    The demand for animation, VFX and gaming in Asia has expanded with the increase in targeted broadcasting hours by cable and satellite TV, availability of low cost internet access, penetration of mobile devices along with the growing popularity of streaming video. In addition, the demand for Animation and VFX content to power immersive experiences such as Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality is growing exponentially. The rapid advancement of technology has made animation, VFX & games available to the masses, and this industry has become one of the fastest growing segments in the global media and entertainment market. We are increasingly seeing more of the global animation, VFX and games production taking place in a globally distributed mode. An emerging trend in the Asian animation industry is the increasing focus towards production of local animation content for television as well as production of animated movies. A number of Asian animation studios are giving importance to owning and protecting animation content by investing in intellectual property protection mechanisms.  The total value of Asian animation industry was US$ 52 billion in 2017. Most of the segments in the Asian animation industry are growing at the rate of 2-3 % YoY. In Asia the spend on special effects as a percent of production cost is about 5-10%. In Asia, there is a sharp increase in streaming video consumption. The size of streaming market for animation content was US$ 2.4 Billion in 2017 and is growing at an annual rate of 8%. The traditional form of content viewership is giving way to a sharp increase in streaming video consumption. The production cost per animation movie in Asia ranges anywhere between US$ 3 Million to US$ 60 Million. The size of Asian video gaming industry was US$ 43 billion in 2017.STRATEGIES, TRENDS, OPPORTUNITIES, GROWTH FACTORSGlobal consumers are displaying a growing appetite for engaging, high-definition visual experiences. Moviegoers are demanding high quality productions with engaging visual effects and realistic animation and studios are including more animation and VFX shots into films. Consumers are consuming more immersive content across channels such as ultra-high-definition TVs, tablets and smartphones to head mounted devices. Animation, VFX and games content is being consumed not only on Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and Twitch, but also on YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. With the growing internet penetration and access to multimedia devices, customers are spending more time on streaming digital content. Streaming video is the fastest growing segment distribution channel for animation and is witnessing double digit growth and the same is expected to continue for the next few years. This growth is attributed to the exponential growth in the number of online video viewers throughout the world. Cloud computing is playing a key role in character rendering and modeling processes as cloud based rendering of animation films is more effective and efficient as it reduces the time and cost compared to traditional rendering.Cloud Gaming services which are growing at an exponential pace would need the right pricing model to both drive adoption and generate sufficient returns for platforms and publishers. The availability of low cost micro-payment systems is allowing users to pay for access or download small quantities of digital content and is the key for online games market to grow. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning based techniques are being used for in-game analytics, customer acquisition, retention, cross sell, churn, classify player behavior etc. Popular eSports tournaments have rich spectator interactions and immersive fan experiences for in-person and online viewers. Micro-segmentation of fans is emerging as eSports leagues and tournament are consolidating various genres, platforms and viewing experiences by careful customer segmentation, targeting and positioning. China has become a leader in eSports and several tournaments are organized throughout the year with millions participating in both online and offline modes.Key Topics Covered:

Asian Animation, VFX & Games Market Strategies, Trends & Opportunities, 2018GlobeNewswireJanuary 10, 2018 Wednesday 3:20 AM PTCopyright 2018 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: RESEARCH ANALYSIS AND REPORTSLength: 2361 wordsBodyDublin, Jan.  10, 2018  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The     "Asian Animation, VFX & Games Industry: Strategies, Trends & Opportunities, 2018"   report has been added to     Research and Markets'  offering.       Much of Asia's animation production since the 1960s has been tied to foreign interests attracted by stable and inexpensive labour supplies. For nearly forty years, western studios have established and maintained production facilities, first in Japan, then in South Korea and Taiwan, and now also in the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand, India, Indonesia, and China. The economics of the industry made it feasible for Asia to feed the cartoon world, to the extent that today, about 90% of all American television animation is produced in Asia.The usual procedure is for pre-production (preparing the script, storyboard, and exposure sheets) to be done in the United States or other headquarter countries, after which, the package is sent to Asia for production (drawing cels, colouring by hand, inking, painting, and camera work). The work is sent back to the U.S. or other headquarter country for post-production (film editing, colour timing, and sound). Asian animation companies bid fiercely for part of the global business, insisting that it provides employment and skills for young people, brings in needed foreign capital, and adds to the creation or enhancement of domestic animation. Offshore animation has led to the creating and nurturing of a local industry, as an infrastructure is built up, equipment is put into place, and skills are transferred.An emerging trend in the Asian animation industry is the increasing focus towards production of local animation content for television as well as production of animated movies.  A number of Asian animation studios are giving importance to owning and protecting animation content by investing in intellectual property protection mechanisms.The rapid advancement of computer technology has made computer animation available to the masses. The major animation markets include the United States, Canada, Japan, China, France, Britain, Korea and Germany. The outsourced computer animation production market is increasingly being tapped by North American and European film and television program producers. The major factors behind outsourcing of animation content to the Asia/Pacific region are the availability of trained skills at lower labor rates.Key Topics Covered:          IntroductionAnimation

Rep. Peters: Why a Qualcomm Takeover Could Have Grave ConsequencesTargeted News ServiceMarch 2, 2018 Friday 10:47 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 850 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyRep. Scott Peters, D-California, issued the following op-ed:San Diegans celebrate our partnership in the national defense. We're a home port for Navy vessels and a center of Marine Corps recruiting and training. We're an officially designated Coast Guard City. We're home to shipyards for construction and repair, companies that specialize in unmanned vehicle technology, and a center of cybersecurity excellence.We all know Qualcomm as the inventor of early wireless technology, the company that put the "smart" in smartphone. We know Qualcomm provides high-quality jobs for the region, with an annual economic impact of over $4 billion. The company and its founders, the Jacobs and Viterbi families, are cornerstones of our civic and philanthropic community.Less known is Qualcomm's role in our national defense; its research into next generation wireless technology -- 5G -- is critical to national security. Whether it's NASA communicating with space satellites, Navy ships communicating with submarines miles undersea, Marine commanders communicating with troops across the battlefield, or energy purveyors communicating with a grid, the integrity of those communications depends on the innovation and brainpower at Qualcomm. Its continued development of 5G wireless, artificial intelligence and other technologies that will underpin nearly every internet-connected device in the country, also makes Qualcomm a target for foreign intelligence agencies.5G research in the United States is centered at Qualcomm and we have an interest in nurturing and protecting this technology by keeping it onshore. The Department of Defense, for example, insists on keeping shipbuilding onshore; we never want to rely on potential adversaries to build or repair our naval force. The same is true for American wireless technology. There is a real and imminent danger in turning it over to a Chinese company when we know China has endeavored to steal intellectual property secrets from American companies, is likely trying to steal our military intelligence, and is aggressively closing the technology gap.Qualcomm is the global leader in development of 5G networks. What's not being done by Qualcomm is being done in Korea and China. 5G will allow for revolutionary inter-connectedness of devices in nearly every economic sector, tying our education system, vehicles, homes and personal devices to the internet. Allowing the Chinese to leapfrog the United States in 5G development through Broadcom's acquisition of Qualcomm would have serious national security implications.That's why I wrote to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin requesting a classified report to Congress via the Senate and House intelligence committees. I also asked for an immediate review of any potential transaction by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, within the Department of Treasury.CFIUS is the federal agency tasked with reviewing mergers and acquisitions of U.S. companies by foreign-controlled entities under the authority of the Defense Production Act of 1950. The act requires CIFIUS review transactions for potential effects on "critical infrastructure" and "critical technologies." It authorizes the executive branch to block transactions for national security reasons. Given that Qualcomm's 5G meets these requirements, I believe strongly that a CFIUS review is warranted.A 2012 House intelligence committee report noted the threat Chinese telecommunications companies pose to our national security. It declared that "the United States should view with suspicion the continued penetration of the U.S. telecommunications market by Chinese telecommunications companies" because of "their potential ties to the Chinese government or military." The concern was that Chinese companies could activate cameras and microphones in smartphones and televisions without user knowledge and the possibility that information gathered could be shared with the Chinese government.Penetration of Qualcomm's board of directors by the Chinese poses a similar threat and should be subject to review regardless of whether Broadcom's takeover bid is successful. And with a board of directors election scheduled for Tuesday, time is of the essence.I've contacted congressional intelligence committees and California's two senators to enlist their help. And I'm heartened by support from both Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Alpine, and Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas.I understand Qualcomm's directors have an obligation to their shareholders. As a San Diegan, I hope shareholders will see the financial wisdom of keeping Qualcomm a long-term innovation company, rather than seeking short-term profits from short-sighted corporate raider tactics.

RIGHTS GROUPS CALL FOR ILHAM TOHTI'S RELEASE ON FOURTH ANNIVERSARY OF HIS ARRESTStates News ServiceJanuary 17, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 547 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Rights activists and Uyghur advocacy groups today renewed their calls for the release from prison of Uyghur academic and blogger Ilham Tohti, who was arrested four years ago on charges of promoting separatism and is now serving a life term behind bars.An outspoken economics professor who regularly highlighted the religious and cultural persecution of the mostly Muslim Uyghur ethnic minority in northwest China's Xinjiang region, Tohti was sentenced on Sept. 23, 2014 following a two-day show trial.The court decision cited Tohti's criticism of Beijing's ethnic policies, his interviews with overseas media outlets, and his work founding and running the Chinese-language website Uighurbiz.net, which was shut down by Chinese authorities in 2014.This week, the Germany-based Ilham Tohti Initiative called again on Beijing to immediately and unconditionally free the jailed writer and professor, calling the conditions of his imprisonment a "calculated and cruel deprivation" of his rights to family visits and outside communication."[All this has] been carefully engineered to punish the Uyghur scholar with degrading treatment and psychological torture, while at the same time keeping the attention on his plight from the outside world to a minimum," Initiative President Enver Can said."We are especially concerned about the reports that his wife and children would not be allowed to visit him during the current year of 2018," Can said.Instead of urging the separation of Xinjiangthe Uyghur people's historic homelandfrom China, Tohti had called only for China to implement its own regional autonomy laws and had consistently promoted peace and dialogue between the Han Chinese and Uyghur communities, Can said."Thus, Ilham Tohti is a prisoner of conscience, who is being cruelly punished for peacefully challenging the Chinese government's policies toward ethnic minorities."Massive rights violationsIn a Jan. 17 statement, the international press freedoms watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) described Tohti's situation as "typical of the massive human rights violations taking place under [Chinese] President Xi Jinping.""[Tohti] was calling not for separatism but for a dialogue to reach a peaceful solution to his community's problems," RSF said.In his writings, Tohti had made "valuable recommendations to the Chinese government to create genuine peace and harmony in East Turkestan," the Munich-based exile World Uyghur Congress (WUC) said in a Jan. 17 statement, using the name for Xinjiang preferred by many Uyghurs to refer to their traditional homeland."He is not a criminal. He is a voice of reason and peace," WUC President Dolkun Isa said."China has no reason to fear this moderate Uyghur voice and has no justification to imprison him for life. The international community will not stay silent until the day he's free," Isa said.Ilham Tohti was awarded Liberal International's Prize for Freedom in a ceremony held in absentia in The Hague in November 2017. He was also the recipient of the Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders in 2016 and the Barbara Goldsmith Freedom to Write Award from the PEN America Center in 2014.Reported by RFA's Uyghur Service.

Cryptocurrency Finds Security Amid Underlying Mutual Distrust Common Between Trading Partners; NetworkNewsWire Editorial CoveragePR NewswireJanuary 12, 2018 Friday 8:30 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2262 wordsDateline: NEW YORK, January 12, 2018 BodyIn a global marketplace where Internet-based technologies increasingly allow businesses the means and confidence to work with each other beyond political borders and with a minimum of governmental interference, cryptocurrencies have the potential to create a B2B interdependent financing system - perhaps even a single, common digital currency someday - because of the blockchain technology that underpins cryptocurrency trade. With the beginning of market movement for the New Year, cryptocurrency started just shy of $613 billion in total capitalization and climbed steadily toward $750 billion on Jan. 4, showing an exponential rise just since April 2017 when it passed the $25 billion mark.ChineseInvestors.com, Inc.(OTC: CIIX) (CIIX profile) is one of the businesses committed to the development of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, recently announcing plans to spin-off two of its corporate divisions tied to hemp marketing and the burgeoning legal cannabis industry in order to focus on its cryptocurrency division (http://nnw.fm/5sf8Z). Other companies preparing to capitalize on opportunities in the blockchain sector includeMGT Capital Investments, Inc.(OTC: MGTI), LongFin Corp.(NASDAQ: LFIN), Bitcoin Services, Inc.(OTC: BTSC) andOverstock.com, Inc.,(NASDAQ: OSTK).ChineseInvestors.com (OTCQB: CIIX)provides innovation in real-time market analysis and educational services in Chinese language character sets, support services for advertising and public relations, and the sale of hemp-based products and other health-related products. Despite China's prohibitions on trading cryptocurrencies as a regulated central exchange, company CEO Warren Wang stated in an interview last month that many Chinese investors are trading them legally on unregulated "over the counter" platforms that connect individuals to each other. And ChineseInvestors.com showed its own commitment to cryptocurrency by installing a Bitcoin ATM in the lobby of its San Gabriel, California, headquarters (http://nnw.fm/VIa3n). Wang called it the first such automated teller for cryptocurrency within the Chinese community in the United States and said it has generated a lot of traffic.China serves as an example of the mutual distrust that drives cryptocurrencies' prospects while relying on so-called "miners" to establish a level of trust in the legitimacy of the exchanges.Despite the lack of a regulated Chinese exchange to trade cryptocurrencies and what Wang referred to as the Chinese government's "badmouthing" of bitcoin though its official TV media outlet, the CEO said Chinese-speaking people within China and North America are very interested in buying, selling and trading bitcoin among themselves and he urged entrepreneurs to be patient as the community learns the ropes."I believe Chinese investors will be the richest group in the world in (the) next 20 years, because Chinese middle class are emerging since 2000 when the country opened the door to worldwide people," he said in an interview with NetworkNewsWire (http://nnw.fm/U2Uct). "Real estate is very expensive and so are labor and rents in China. Investors have a high savings rate. They now would like to make bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies part of their assets."Blockchain technology was established on the principle that an unalterable digital ledger of transactions (arranged in blocks) requiring transparency among multiple parties would reduce the risk of fraud and prevent duplication in the transactions. It was proposed as the foundation of an alternative, people's-run economic system that would not require the security of an established storefront middleman like a bank to uphold the transactions. Critics have questioned it on a commodities basis, searching for an undeniable stability that investors can rely on.ChineseInvestors.com's ATM is one example of the company's commitment to providing cryptocurrency education. The company recently attended a Toronto cryptocurrency roadshow and educational seminar on how to buy, sell and manage the coins, and it produces a daily video from the New York Stock Exchange called 'Bitcoin Multimillionaire' that is focused on news about the currency (http://nnw.fm/Lfrx8)."In an effort to expand its media products, as the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 came to a close, the Company announced that it would be working with Wall Street Multimedia (WSM), an independent news agency located in the NYSE, to produce a daily cryptocurrency video newscast in Chinese, providing timely information and exclusive analysis regarding all aspects of the emerging digital currency world, including specific cryptocurrencies, such as 'Bitcoin' and 'Ethereum,' industry trends, price movement, blockchain technology, sector-related stocks and ETFs, etc.," ChineseInvestors.com stated in its most recent 10Q filing in October.The company has offices in Shanghai, New York and California, and has plans to expand to Canada."There's so many cryptocurrencies from China emerging, or at least on the exchange right now," Wang said, referring to a sort of anti-governmental sentiment and a "huge demand from (the) Chinese community trying to learn these assets and what (they) are about" that "gives us tremendous opportunity to bring the revenue and profitability to our shareholders."Other companies focused on the potential of blockchain's financial applications include:MGT Capital Investments(OTCQB: MGTI),which is a Northwestern United States company deeply invested in cybersecurity technologies for mobile and corporate applications. The company is also one of the largest worldwide working in Bitcoin mining and announced agreements in December to secure "reliable and adequate" electrical power in Sweden to begin bit mining operations there by the end of January. (http://nnw.fm/noP3K).LongFin(NASDAQ: LFIN) specializes in structured commodity trade finance worldwide and works to establish markets and ensure liquidity through technological advances. The company stated in the fall of 2017 that it aims to connect 70 FX and spot exchanges with 300 banks through its electronic market platform, and in December made headlines when the acquisition of Ziddu.com sparked a huge cryptocurrency fever-inspired bounce in trading (http://nnw.fm/jRr8I).Bitcoin Services(OTC: BTSC) is another company that performs bitcoin mining services, and began mining its own cryptocurrency known as Dash in early 2017. The company develops and markets blockchain-related software, and created subsidiary CryptoCapital Corp. in the fall of 2017 as a cryptocurrency holding firm, or a digital wallet, that would let users store multiple digital currencies in one place.Overstock.com(NASDAQ: OSTK) solidified its goal of bringing greater transparency and efficiency to capital markets by launching an initial coin offering (ICO), cryptocurrency's version of a stock initial public offering (IPO), in December through its exchange operator, tZERO. The "pre-sale" phase targeting strategic purchasers began Dec. 18 and a "subsequent sale period" phase seeking agreements with other accredited investors is scheduled to begin Jan. 18. Overstock is the third-most-active corporate blockchain investor worldwide, according to a CB Insights report (http://nnw.fm/Cd39K), and may even consider selling off the retail business to focus on the 10 blockchain companies it owns (           http://nnw.fm/Sx0gO).Amid a worldwide effort to conduct business across borders as seamlessly and transparently as possible, blockchain technology and its financial sector development as cryptocurrencies are building confidence in an alternative economic system built on the need to overcome mutual distrust that exists between trading partners, governments and people in general as they strive to successfully work together.For more information on ChineseInvestors.com, Inc. visit ChineseInvestors.com, Inc.

First Bauxite Announces Testwork Results From Industrial Scale Proppant Production TrialGlobeNewswireMarch 22, 2018 Thursday 2:00 PM PTCopyright 2018 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: PRODUCT / SERVICES ANNOUNCEMENTLength: 1152 wordsBodyNEW ORLEANS, March  22, 2018  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- First Bauxite Corporation ("First Bauxite" or the "Company")(TSX-V:FBX) (FRANKFURT:FBI) (BERLIN:FBI) is pleased to announce that it has completed independent third party testwork on the final industrial scale trial production campaign of ultra high strength proppant ("UHSP-11").Ceramic Proppant (UHSP-11)During the period April 2016 to November 2017, First Bauxite shipped 5,600mt of bauxite ore from its Bonasika deposits in Guyana to a ceramic proppant plant in Shanxi Province, China for processing into UHSP-11. Three trials were conducted over July 2016 to January 2017 to optimise plant and process conditions. These trials, as previously disclosed, provided encouraging results but due to processing challenges did not result in a product that was considered to be ready for this competitive market. A final production trial was conducted over August to November 2017 and approximately 800mt of conforming UHSP-11 was produced and shipped to a warehouse in New Orleans.Representative samples from the final production trial were sent to two independent recognised proppant testing laboratories in the USA and one independent recognised proppant testing laboratory in the UK for long term conductivity and permeability testing. The testwork results from the industrial scale production trials confirmed earlier favourable R&D results that, compared to the market leading ultra high strength proppant products, UHSP-11 had:• superior strength• superior conductivity• comparable sphericity and roundnessThe technical data sheet for UHSP-11 has been updated and is available on the Company's website (www.firstbauxite.com).Discussions are being held with oil and gas operators and service companies on conducting market trials in offshore deepwater wells. While this is a relatively small market at the time, the Company believes it has the potential for significant medium-term growth.Sintered Refractory BauxiteIn addition, the Company is also focusing its development activities on sintered refractory bauxite following some major fundamental changes on the supply side of the market. Enforcement of strict environmental regulations by the Chinese Central Government has led to the closure of significant numbers of sintered refractory bauxite plants in China (some on a permanent basis). This has been compounded by bauxite mine closures and a growing shortage of high quality Chinese bauxite ore. China is the largest supplier of sintered refractory bauxite and accounts for over 90% of the world's production. First Bauxite conducted a small scale production trial processing 260mt of bauxite ore from its Bonasika deposits into sintered refractory bauxite in a refractory bauxite plant in Europe. The results compared favourably to the market leading sintered refractory bauxites from China and Guyana and further large scale production trials are planned.Bonasika Production Campaign and Government of Guyana ("GOG") ApprovalsThe GOG has granted approval for First Bauxite to ship up to 40,000mt of bauxite ore to Europe, Asia and North America for further industrial scale product and market development activities in ceramic proppants and sintered refractory bauxite. Two mining contractors have been engaged and mine production commenced at First Bauxite's Bonasika deposits in March 2018.The Company will provide additional business updates as further progress is achieved on the various activities discussed above.On behalf of the Board of Directors of First Bauxite CorporationAlan Roughead President & CEOAbout First BauxiteFirst Bauxite Corporation (TSX-V:FBX) is a Canadian natural resources company engaged in the exploration and development of bauxite deposits in Guyana, South America. The Company intends to produce and sell bauxite raw ore from its facility in Guyana and intends to produce sintered refractory products and ceramic proppants for the refractory and energy industries in the future. The Company has its head office in New Orleans, Louisiana and is managed by experienced professionals with worldwide experience in the global industrial minerals industry across a number of industrial minerals.

Forward-looking statements look into the future and provide an opinion as to the effect of certain events and trends on the business. Forward-looking statements may include words such as "will", "anticipates", "believes", "intends", "expects" and similar expressions.

These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and entail various risks and uncertainties. Actual results may materially differ from expectations, if known and unknown risks or uncertainties affect the Company's business, or if the Company's estimates or assumptions prove inaccurate. Factors that could cause results or events to differ materially from current expectations expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, include, but are not limited to, effect of capital market conditions and other factors on capital availability, availability of sufficient financing to fund planned or further required work in a timely manner and on acceptable terms, continuing support of the Government of Guyana for the Bonasika Project; execution of the Company's existing plans as budgeted, including development programs for the Bonasika Project, which may change due to changes in the views of the Company or if new information arises which makes it prudent to change such budget, plans or programs, including the results of future trials and testwork or any inability to reproduce test results on a commercial scale or in the field, and other risks affecting the Company or the mining industry more fully described in the Company's continuous disclosure documents, which are available under the Company's profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.

Austin Explosion May Have Been Triggered By Tripwire; Trial Begins Over AT&T-Time Warner Merger Reviled By Trump; Should The Rich Pay More For A Speeding Ticket?; Hillary Clinton Says She Meant No Disrespect With Trump Voter Comments; Goodlatte: Will Subpoena FBI Over Missing Hillary Clinton DocumentsMORNINGS WITH MARIA MORNINGS WITH MARIA 8:00 AM ESTMarch 19, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; FinancialLength: 7889 wordsByline: Maria Bartiromo, Dagen McDowell, Adam Shapiro, Ed Rollins, Lauren Simonetti, Lori Rothman, Stuart VarneyGuests: Lee Carter, Christopher Bedford, Bill Casey, Chuck GrassleyBodyMARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Welcome back. Good Monday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Monday, March 19th. Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast. Trade tensions weighing on stocks, futures indicating a lower opening for the broader averages as a group of nearly 50 trade executives warned President Trump against implementing new tariffs against China. This is the Commerce Department says it will begin taking applications today for product exclusions from the steel and aluminum tariffs. Investors are also waiting on the Federal Reserve meeting. This is a two- day meeting today -- I'm sorry, Tuesday and Wednesday rather, where the Central Bank is expected to raise interest rates for the first time this year that will happen on Wednesday and that will be Jay Powell's first press conference on Wednesday as Fed chair.Stocks closing the green Friday meanwhile. For the week, markets were lower but Friday, the Dow Industrials was up 72 points. In Europe this morning, we've got the stocks trading down. Take a look at the FT-100 down 1-1/3 percent, and the CAC Quarante and the DAX Index down about two-thirds of one percent. In Asia overnight, mixed performances, Shanghai and Hong Kong did well, fractionally well. Nikkei Average was down almost one percent in Japan.Mueller stays in, McCabe is out. The White House says President Trump is not considering removing Special Counsel Robert Mueller, that's not the case for Andrew McCabe, the number two deputy at the FBI, Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired the former FBI deputy director over his contact with the news media regarding the FBI's investigation of Hillary Clinton e- mails. House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte praised A.G. Sessions' decision on "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES."(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA), CHAIRMAN,HOUSE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY: I think the Attorney General did the right thing, these are very serious concerns and they tie into at the overall concern about how the FBI handled investigations into the elections last year, so the steps are appropriate.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: More on the decision to fire McCabe and Mueller's investigation coming up. Austin is on edge this morning. A fourth explosion in less than three weeks, injures two in the Texas capital. The details on the blast that came just hours after police made a televised appeal for the bomber. And getting their day in court, AT&T set to face off with the U.S. government over the company's $85-billion- proposed merger with Time Warner. The very latest in the government's high profile antitrust challenge coming up.Plus this, dialed in. The shocking amount of people that are online 24/7. All those stories coming up this Monday morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, The Daily Caller's editor- in-chief Christopher Bedford and pollster and the president of Maslanksy and Partners, Lee Carter. Great to see you.LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS: Great to be here.BARTIROMO: Happy Monday.CARTER: Happy Monday. Emotional Monday.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: And we've got a Federal Reserve meeting, two-day meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. First rate hike of 2018.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: I know. But now, we were talking about in the break, now the attention of investors is turned back to Washington and not because of anything that's directly economic related but you have investors trying to grapple with what happens with the Special Counsel Mueller investigation with the back-and-forth between the news media and former and current government officials and the President of the United States and his attorneys.BARTIROMO: Yes. That's true. J.P. Morgan is telling clients this morning the two overhangs in the stock market right now is the Fed and Mueller. So we want to turn right now to Washington. Attorney General Jeff Sessions' firing of FBI official Andrew McCabe has reignited the feud between the FBI and President over the Russia investigation and Hillary Clinton's e-mail probe. Adam Shapiro is live at the White House this morning. He's got the very latest. Adam, good morning to you.ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: And a good morning to you, Maria. That firing was at the recommendation of disciplinary officials within the FBI, the President calling it a great day for the Democracy. Mr. McCabe had authorized members of the FBI to speak to a reporter about the Clinton investigation but here is his statement in which he said "as deputy director, I was one of only a few people who had the authority to do that. It was not a secret it took place over several days and others including the director were aware of the interaction with the reporter. I am being singled out and treated this way because of the roll I played, the actions I took and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of Jim Comey."Now, once again, President Trump did tweet, great day for America after the firing of Andrew McCabe but then he turned his attention to the Mueller investigation and he tweeted "why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big crooked Hillary supporters and zero Republicans." Another Dem recently added, does anyone think this is fair and yet there is no collusion. Now in Washington, a lot of people came out and said that the investigator, the Mueller needs to be protected but there's the other issue for instance Bob Goodlatte and Trey Gowdy called for an independent counsel to investigate the FBI, its handling of the FISA authority, the warrant that they have take as well as the Clinton investigation. Here is what Goodlatte said about that issue.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOODLATTE: More than text, there are other documents as well in the 1.2 million, but we've only seen a tiny percentage of that, the department and the bureau have been slow, I would say now very slow in getting them to us.(END VIDEO CLIP)SHAPIRO: And so you have this going forward but then you have former members of the FBI, James Kallstrom who say that there is need to have an investigation of the FBI. Here's what he told you on "SUNDAY FUTURES".(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JAMES KALLSTROM, FORMER FBI ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: I think we have ample facts revealed to us through in this last year and a half that high-ranking people throughout the government not just the FBI, high-ranking people had a plot to not have Hillary Clinton, you know, indicted, even this Strzok guy talked about this. And they had a backup plan to basically frame Donald Trump and that's what's been going on, this whole thing in my view is just total phony.(END VIDEO CLIP)SHAPIRO: And Maria, as you pointed out, Ty Cobb, the lawyer here for the President has pointed out that in regards to Mr. Mueller, nobody at the White House he says was talking about firing him. Back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Adam. Thank you so much. Adam Shapiro at the White House. Joining us right now to talk more about that is the Great America PAC chairman, former Reagan Chief White House Political Advisor and now Fox News Contributor Ed Rollins.ED ROLLINS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you. Good morning.BARTIROMO: So much to unpack here and talk about. Tell me where -- what you think is most important in this?ROLLINS: I think the most important thing is the president to let Mueller run his course. At the end of the day, it wasn't collusion, I think there's a lot of evidence that there is no collusion. If he does anything, I was part of the Watergate team back when many of my colleagues in White House got indicted for obstruction. I think the President (INAUDIBLE) Mueller run his course, whatever it is, battle it, it is nothing there which most of us think there's nothing there, he's way better off but by trying to take Mueller out or -- and he's kind of in a mindset now where he thinks he can do what he wants to do, I think would be a detriment to his presidency and damage Republican --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: The markets will actually get impacted as well.ROLLINS: Well, every member of Congress who is obviously, in --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: But Ed, he keeps saying he is not going to do, I mean, he figured out many times, again, I'm not going to fire Mueller.ROLLINS: Well, he needs to quit talking about it. And his lawyers needs to just shut up about it too and at the end of the day let Mueller do his course -- run his course and get it done with.(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: What I was turned off by on Saturday morning, Andrew McCabe gets fired and it's because the Attorney General Jeff Sessions is following the recommendation of the very division within the FBI that investigates wrongdoing related to the Inspector General's report but Trump's personal attorney which stays essential and just walked back with a statement that came out last night by one of his other attorneys, Ty Cobb but that John Dowd put up this weird state -- I thought it was weird on Saturday morning, talking about I pray that acting, Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is going to follow the brilliant and courageous example of the -- of Jeff Sessions and the office of -- I'm not reading it but office of professional responsibility and bring it in to the Russia collusion investigation manufactured by McCabe's boss Jim Comey. And then he goes on and on but again, they took something that was legitimate and justified based on what we know and pivoted to the Mueller investigation.ROLLINS: I think the President is not been served well by his layers. I think McCabe is a good lawyer and White House counsel but he's lawyer outside counsel pretty over their head and I -- and I -- that's my feeling if someone has been around a long time, so --CARTER: It's -- he is pivot to go the wrong thing. I mean, there is -- I mean, there's corruption, there's all kinds of things that are wrong but by -- and there's evidence of that, like he was talking about with McCabe but then you look at why is he talking about Mueller, it's so frustrating because then, you're talking about everything being vindictive rather than what is fact.CHRISTOPHER BEDFORD, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE DAILY CALLER: I don't think he's going to fire him. Did you -- BARTIROMO: I don't think so either.ROLLINS: You don't know what he's going to do. I mean, my sense is he is now feeling very -- he's had -- he had a big week for a variety of reasons, good and bad. And I think to a certain extent he now sort of feels my instinct are better than anybody else's instincts, I don't need advice from the people. I'll do what I want to do and he's had this thing about Mueller from the get-go. I'm just telling you someone has lived through something similar to this many years ago. He fires Mueller will lose the House, may be lose the Senate and he will lose his agenda. He is not going to get impeached at the end of the day here, probably not going to find anything wrong with what the campaign did, collusion would be the last thing anybody would accuse him of. And anybody who watched it closely and I think to a certain extent he needs to let it move on.MCDOWELL: A narrative that you get from some in the media and from people who used to work in White House and even in that McCabe's statement ,if you start read between the lines, you have former Attorney General Eric Holder going on Bill Maher saying, I think that Mueller will find obstruction of justice. And then you have the New York Times writing about the -- Trump asking Reince Priebus and Don McGahn how their interviews with Mueller went trying to -- create the odor of obstruction and then even in McCabe's statement he said, it is -- it is part of this administration's ongoing war on the FBI and the efforts of the special counsel's investigation to -- which continue to this day. I mean, he is talking about I'm going to push for obstruction of justice.ROLLINS: Well, he can do whatever he wants to do and the former attorney general can do whatever he wants to do. The thing that Trump has to worry about is the Mueller investigation and he wants that to be legitimate, he wants that to get to an end-game and that's the critical thing. I'm all for the special -- the calling for a special prosecutor to go look at the Justice Department because clearly there's a lot of things occurred there that need to be set straight for the future. Whatever occurred is now in the past, but make sure it doesn't happen again and I think as we sit here and watch Putin today, celebrate his victory I can guarantee you that we did not have any operatives over there playing to his election, I don't think --(CROSSTALK)BEDFORD: So Mueller's probe started out like we are just talking about -- talking about collusion and now they're looking at Russian meddling, they're looking at Kushner's business deals or looking at Trump's business deals in Russia (INAUDIBLE) it seems like there's no way at all to hold a special counsel in any kind of limits once you let it out --(CROSSTALK)ROLLINS: That's the danger of a special counsel is, they can run and run forever. The critical thing here though, even if -- even if Trump did something in Russia 10 years ago or five years ago, whatever, it has nothing do with the election.BARTIROMO: Right.ROLLINS: And the charge here was, was there any collusion in the election and he can beat that back and he can argue, you know, what I did before, American public had an opportunity to look at my record, every newspaper in the country said everything I did bad was out there and people still gave me a victory.BARTIROMO: Right.ROLLINS: I think the only way you get this resolved though is to have Mueller's report come forth and then deal with it after that.BARTIROMO: Because everybody should agree that you want to punish Russia for meddling in our election.ROLLINS: In stock and future.BARTIROMO: It's -- the waters have been muddied because the left is trying to attach Donald Trump to that and there's no attachment. Americans now want a Democratic-controlled Congress though, Ed. We want to talk you about this ahead of the 2018 midterms. This is new Wall Street Journal NBC poll out shows half of voters say they would prefer Democrats in control over Republicans. That same poll shows President Trump's approval rating has climbed to 43 percent, that's up from 39 percent in January. Your thoughts.ROLLINS: Since 1876, it's only been three times the President's party has gained seats in the election. And having run the Congressional committee for the Republicans couple decades ago, what's going on rights now is every incumbent thinks he is in a serious race and that's the way he needs to be thinking. They need to go out there and run a real campaign after Pennsylvania 18. I think there's about 70 House members in our side that are going to have races, they may not lose but they're going to have races. And the best way to win this race is go out and work the next eight months and work hard and connect with voters. Do a lot of good polling, go out and talk to people about what they care about, don't run against Nancy Pelosi who cares, who cares about Nancy Pelosi, she's got a 21 percent approval rating, Paul Ryan has only a 24 percent approval rating. To ordinary voters out there, they don't care about those things. What are you going to for me, how do you connect to my life and that's the way to win these races.MCDOWELL: Does money matter? So the RNC -- the RNC the outraised the DNC, two to one, but candidate wise, Democratic candidates in the House and Senate versus Republican, the Democrats have raised $537 million, the Republicans haven't even raised 400 million.BARTIROMO: On the individual --(CROSSTALK)ROLLINS: We just -- we just saw $10 million wasted in Pennsylvania 18 last week, more money doesn't make a better campaign. You have to have a certain amount -- to a good campaign and you got to have a good theme. Their whole theme was you left the Democrat, he's going to go be (INAUDIBLE) and he turned on a -- on a diamond and made an issue against them. So, my sense is go out and connect with voters, you need -- you need to raise as much as you can on the district and out of district, there's none of the 70, 80 races that are going to be competitive, aren't going to have a plenty of funding. Sometimes there's a tendency, you have too much funding, you spend too much on advertising and what have you and you don't run a good campaign. You got to run good campaign, it's going to connect with voters.BARTIROMO: But President Obama did put a really good infrastructure in place in terms of getting individual donations and it's helped the Democrats in general.MCDOWELL: And the Democrats are repeating that on the ground level right now.ROLLINS: The president -- the President, I wish the President wasn't running for re-election today. He's got plenty of times to run for re- election and I think the reality is he needs to be raising money for those candidates and going out and doing what is critical for them.BARTIROMO: Ed Rollins, thank you. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Austin, Texas rocked by another explosion hours after police tell the bomber to stop. Cheryl Casone with the details. Cheryl?CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes. These all happening overnight, Maria. Two men were injured in the bombing both fortunately both are in good condition at a local hospital this morning. This blast occurred just hours after law enforcement urged the bomber to turn himself in. Police say they are working under the belief that this latest bomb is related the three others this month but killed two people and seriously injured a third. But they say that this one was set off differently.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BRIAN MANLEY, AUSTIN POLICE CHIEF: And it is very possible that this device was a device that was activated by someone either handling kicking or coming in contact with a trip wire that activated the device. So that changes things.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Officials are also telling residents to stay indoors until officers can conduct the search for bombs if you do receive a package and also to just stay alert.Well, this morning's commute nightmare for drivers on Interstate 270 in Maryland. Tractor trailer overturn, losing its cargo of slate and gravel, that triggered a 20-car pileup. Officials say at least two dozen people were injured. Some have been taken to local hospitals, traffic backed up for miles, the southbound was 270 shut down for two hours. Police say, two lanes are now open traffic is just now starting to move again but as we mentioned, we're going right into the heavy rush hour time for this group.Well, a major court battle beginning today between the Federal government and a AT&T. The high-stake showdown involving AT&T's $85 billion merger with time Warner, AT&T says the deal will help consumers, AOL then is the company to compete with Amazon and Netflix. Government says AT&T is going to have too much power over distribution and will demand higher fees for time Warner's content and that of course will lead to higher cable bills for consumers. Time Warner's portfolio does include HBO, D.C. Comics and of course CNN. Shares of Time Warner are down two percent over the last year. Shares of AT&T over the last year down 13 percent.And how often do you go online? Think about this. According to the Pew Research Center, one in four American adults say they use the internet almost constantly, no breaks. That's up from about 20 percent in 2015. And young people are really heavy users. 40 percent of those between the ages of 18 and 29 say they are almost -- online, Maria, so constantly on line. I mean we're addicted. I am, I know I'm addicted to --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Oh, me too.CASONE: Yes.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Cheryl. Coming up, a tell a of two commies, we break down the competing narratives of how the former FBI director handled media interactions with reporters and whether or not he authorized them. Then Facebook is under fire this morning for how it manages third-party access user data. The backlash coming up. Back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The deal of the day according to the Wall Street Journal, CACI International is throwing their hat in the ring to upset another deal with a bid of their own information technology company, CSRA. Now, CACI's bid could knock out CSRA's all cash sale to General Dynamics. So CACI is offering $44 a share, that's higher than General Dynamics' $40.75 a share offer. Joining us now to talk more about deal flow and what's happening in business is EY Americas Vice Chairman of transaction advisory services, Bill Casey. Bill, god to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.BILL CASEY, VICE CHAIRMAN OF TRANSACTION ADVISORY SERVICES, EY AMERICAS: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Characterize the deal environment that you see in 2018.CASEY: I think it's going to be a good year. We saw January 2018 of this year, we haven't seen that level of deal activity for about 10 years. So, I think given the effect that we're seeing of tax reform already this year, I think we'll see an uptick in deals for the rest of the calendar year.CARTER: You know, I think, probably the only possible concern out there is regulation. So if there's an uptick in regulation, that might slow down the pace of it.BARTIROMO: Which is we're focused on the AT&T deal this week. Do you think that goes through?CASEY: You know, I think, you know, clearly, the -- what we've seen thus far in the regulatory environment over the last couple of months have been pretty positive. So, I would say, you know, that trend continues and I think regulations are going to be less of a concern than we've seen in the past.BEDFORD: If you're talking to some of companies, lobbyists in Washington, D.C., Comcast, AT&T, there's a lot of griping about how they're treated differently from Googles and the Amazon and how the regulations having cutting up with those companies and they really hold back -- the older companies like Comcast and AT&T. If this deal is shut down, what is that going to tell these older legacy companies about how they can compete in a -- in new economy?CASEY: Yes, I think, look, you know, I think there is a lot of good news here for legacy companies. I mean, at the end of the day what's been driving the deal markets for the last couple years is the absolute emphasis that investors have both on growth and innovation. So I think these companies are going to be compelled to do deals. So -- and I think we're still going to see these legacy companies that you're referring to continue to be very, very active in the market.MCDOWELL: I will say one thing though about regulations to your point with Facebook disclosing that a -- basically a lot -- campaign firm tied to the Trump campaign had kept data for years when it said that it destroyed it. Now Facebook has -- is going to have regulators and lawmakers. I don't care which side of the aisle you're on, breathing down its neck and it surely knows that at this point.BARTIROMO: And that's only getting worse. Regulation and technology because these companies as I've a lot, they have more power than they ever had. Are you expecting a bigger bite or regulatory bite on tech? Facebook, Google.CASEY: Yes. I mean, we haven't seen that thus far but I think when you look at the technology space, the convergence of tech with all the other sectors, so I think, you know, I think you're going to see technology companies are going to continue to be hottest sector in M&A and we're certainly expecting that in the short term.BARTIROMO: So the GOP's tax reform overhaul being hailed as a success for the administration, impacting citizens and companies, a new survey from EY, I want to shed some light on this. Shows how companies are using their cash wind fall. What can you tell us about that?CASEY: I would say, you know, first and foremost, it's, you know, it's good news from a lot of different constituents. First and foremost, you know, we're saying that the majority of the savings from tax reform, it's going to be put back in growth and innovation. Just great news for the U.S. economy. Great news for U.S. companies to remain innovative, to remain competitive and that's going to strengthen the overall economy. You we are also seeing, fair amount of -- almost two-thirds of the respondents are going to do M&A deals and I'd say, you know, the good news for American workers and consumers is that this is going to represent salary increases, one-time bonuses and also benefits -- other benefits to employees. And then some companies plan to give some of the savings back to consumers as well, so, you know, overall, for the economy it's good news.BEDFORD: That was a major concern, that was a criticism from Democrats, people opposed the tax bill is that there is no guarantee that companies would bring back business from overseas or that they were give -- pay money to the workers and it's been called crumbs and attacked politically but it doesn't seem to bear that at all.CASEY: Yes. No, we've seen 90 percent of the respondents of the survey plan to increase salaries, one- time bonuses, other benefits, so, you know, clearly for the American worker, there are clearly benefits.MCDOWELL: Crumbs to put the schmooze on --(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: Armageddon into the world.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: -- over that.MCDOWELL: I hope not.BARTIROMO: Yes. So according to your survey a high number of companies are looking to accelerate growth and innovation, what's your insight, how are they doing that?CASEY: Well, I think, you know, first and foremost, you know, wire companies doing this and we've seen so much disruption in the market and it's compelling for companies to do that. Growth isn't there just from a organic perspective and so, you know, we expect to see more deals through innovation and quite frankly, deals are -- as I said, or deals are down for strategic reasons and companies continue to need to increase their market share.BARTIROMO: All right. We'll leave it there. Bill, great to see you.CASEY: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much. Bill Casey from EY. Coming up. The investigation over Hillary Clinton's private e-mail server is heating up, why the House GOP could subpoena the FBI coming up. And then I'll speak Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley about President Trump's tariff, Andrew McCabe's firing and a lot more. Stay with us. He is up next live.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Monday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Monday, March 19th. Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the east coast. Markets are under pressure this morning. Futures pointing to a lower opening for stock prices. Dow Industrials set to be down about 100 points, down one-half of one percent. The NASDAQ is down better than one percent right now, down 77 points. Of course, we kick off a week where we're expecting the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, they have their two-day meeting, Tuesday and Wednesday. The Central Bank is expected to raise rates for the first time this year, quarter of a point higher on Wednesday. Tariffs concerns also weighing on markets but now the Commerce Department says it is beginning to take applications for exclusions, the aluminum and steel tariffs, that begins today.Check European markets right now and European indices are down across the board. FT-100 down 1-1/3 percent. CAC Quarante in Paris down two-thirds of a percent, and the DAX Index in Germany down three-quarters of a percent. In Asia overnight, mixed performances, Japan was the worst performer, Nikkei Average down one percent,New questions this morning surrounding the FBI, Andrew McCabe's firing was tied to the Clinton e-mail investigation late Friday, and now he's reaction is triggering perjury allegations against former FBI Director Jim Comey. Lawmakers are holding firm when it comes to Robert Mueller's investigation, meanwhile.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. JAMES LANKFORD (R), CALIFORNIA: It's best for the Special Counsel to be able to go through their process, it's best for the President, and best for the presidency, for this to be resolved and to be finished one way or the other.SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: If he tried to do that, that would be the beginning of the end of his presidency.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: We take a closer look straight ahead this morning. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is backtracking this morning, now she says she meant no disrespect by her comments in India about Donald Trump and his supporters. Facebook is under fire this morning. The stock is sliding. Take a look, down 3-1/2 percent after a reported data breach. We will check its status later this hour.First though, this, our top story this half an hour, getting tough on trade. The Trump administration is planning to target China with tariffs on at least $30 billion of imports as well as restrictions on Chinese investors. The measures come after Beijing pressured U.S. companies to transfer technology to Chinese firms, dozens of trade groups representing companies like Apple, Google, Nike, Wal-Mart are urging the President to reconsider. This comes as the Commerce Department says it will start accepting requests today to be excluded from the steel and aluminum tariffs. Joining me right now is Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman and Senate Finance Committee Member, Iowa Senator, Chuck Grassley. Senator, good to have you on the program, thanks for joining us.SEN. CHUCK GRASSLEY (R-IA), CHAIRMAN, SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: I'm glad to be with you.BARTIROMO: So, let's talk trade for a moment. Some of those concerned about retaliation are soybean farmers in your home state. China, one of the industry's biggest foreign customers. Your thoughts on what's to come against China from this administration.GRASSLEY: I'm a free trader. And that obviously includes you want it to be fair trade, and I think it's perfectly legitimate when another country subsidizes their products and we don't have a level-playing field for the imposition of countervailing duties to level the playing field but not to do more than just level the playing field, and that we ought to do all we can to any tool we have to make sure that state corporations in bed with the Chinese government don't have an unfair advantage. So, the extent to which President wants us to get a better deal from China or from any other country, I think we ought to welcome it, but I think it ought to be done very cautiously. And one of the things that I fear coming from an agriculture state is that I found over very many administrations both Republican and Democrat that the first challenge to any action we take on trade they tend to go after agriculture products, and since we produce one- third more food than we consume domestically, I think we have to have a good trading environment for prosperity in agriculture.BARTIROMO: So, Senator, we know that China has been trying to acquire technology, and transfer American technology to China. They're involved in 10 percent of venture deals in the last five years, and we know that we have $375-billion trade deficit with China. You think putting restrictions and trade tariffs in place on China will change that?GRASSLEY: It -- I want a level-playing field and countervailing duties would do that, but you did bring up something that's even more important, the extent to which they are stealing our intellectual property, our patents, things of that nature, and buying companies to do that instead of doing their own research, take advantage of our research, Senator Brown and I have a bill in that would make it to the CFIUS Committee within the Department of Treasury that looks at national security would look at also economic impact. And I think this is even a better tool to make sure that they play a fair game with us, and don't steal our intellectual property to take advantage of the CFIUS process to stop them from doing that.BARTIROMO: So, you're not -- you're not afraid of retaliation in that regard then?GRASSLEY: In the latter case, no, in the former case where I talked about countervailing duties or what President might do today? Yes, I'm very fearful of that.BARTIROMO: And so, what do you do? Not do anything because you're afraid that you're going to get into a trade war?GRASSLEY: I would say we move in the direction the President wants to go, but you do it very cautiously. Now, I've advocated some very prominent things like calling China out for not letting their currency fold, as example, because that's an indirect subsidy to exports, and we've been very cautious about that, both on Republican and Democrats. I don't see anything wrong with saying that they're cheating on their currency.BARTIROMO: I think you make a really important point. Senator, let me move on to something else you've been working on. You obviously have been calling for a second special counsel in the -- in the investigation into the FBI and its handling of the Hillary Clinton e-mail situation. Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe was fired on Friday, we know, after the Justice Department's own inspector general concluded that McCabe misled investigators about his role in directing other officials at the FBI to talk to the media in connection with that ongoing investigation. McCabe shot back in a statement on Saturday, and here's what he said on Saturday morning, Senator. I got to get your take about this.He said, "As deputy director, I was only one of a few people who had the authority to do that -- to talk to a reporter. It was not a secret. It took place over several days, and others, including the director -- meaning Jim Comey -- were aware of the interaction with the reporter." So, he basically said, yes, I -- you know, I spoke to the Wall Street Journal after we know that he wasn't candid about it initially, but my director knew about it -- Jim Comey knew about it. But we went back to when you questioned Jim Comey, Senator Grassley, last May, and he was under oath. Let's go through that right now and take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GRASSLEY: Director Comey, have you ever been an anonymous source in news reports about matters relating to the Trump investigation or the Clinton investigation?JAMES COMEY, FORMER DIRECTOR, FBI: Never.GRASSLEY: Question two and relatively related, have you ever authorized someone else at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports about the Trump investigation or the Clinton investigation?COMEY: No.BARTIROMO: So, Senator, no or never, who's lying? Is he lying under oath or did Andrew McCabe lie on Saturday morning?GRASSLEY: If I could, I'd like to step back a little bit and say it sounds to me like there's really a conflict here. I don't want to say people are lying, because that's going to be up to the executive branch and the prosecution of people that lie under oath or lie to the FBI. But I do know this, first of all, Ray got rid of McGrath, also the Inspector General gave some information to the Office of Professional Responsibility and both the I.G. and Office of Professional Responsibility are very basically non- political people, like for instance, the latter has been in that position for 12 years under two administrations now. So, I think you have to go back to the confidence that we have in those people being non-political to make these judgments and we better wait until we get the Inspector General's report before I can say people are lying.BARTIROMO: So, the Inspector General report, you're expecting that in April?GRASSLEY: Yes.BARTIROMO: Let me ask you about your investigation and certainly on the House side, the investigation from the Judiciary Committee and the Oversight Committee on the missing Hillary Clinton documents. Yesterday, House Judiciary Committee Chair Bob Goodlatte told me that if the FBI does not turnover more than a million missing documents that they have requested, he is prepared to subpoena the agency. Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA), CHAIRMAIN, HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: More than texts, there are other documents as well in the 1.2 million but we've only seen a tiny percentage of that. The department and the bureau have been slow, I would say now very slow, in getting them to us.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Senator Grassley, your thoughts on the investigation today?GRASSLEY: Well, for sure, if Goodlatte can do that and he ought to issue a subpoena because we do need those documents. On the Senate side, Senator Feinstein and I, in a bipartisan way, have to agree to a subpoena. And we're always talking about these things all the time but we ought to have that information because the constitutional responsibility of Congress isn't only to pass laws but under checks and balances, you study about high school government, it's their responsibility to make sure that those laws are faithfully executed, and you can't do that without having the information that we desire and maybe it will have to be subpoenaed. And for sure, particularly in the FBI and the Justice Department, there should be no political interference whatsoever. So, if there's political interference, let's say in Trump -- in regard to Russia or Trump and anything else, then it's perfectly legitimate to look into it in the previous administration. Political interference under Republican or Democrat in the Justice Department is just plain wrong.BARTIROMO: Yes, Senator, you've been calling for a second special counsel to investigate what's going on at the FBI, can you tell us what's happening in plain English? I mean, Attorney General Jeff Sessions is facing pressure to investigate these allegations of abuse by the Department of Justice and the FBI, ahead of the FISA court. Senator Grassley and yourself sent a letter to Sessions pushing for the special second counsel to gather the facts. What do we know so far?GRASSLEY: Well, we know that there's been people that have interacted both with the Clinton administration in particular, the Clinton e-mails as well as being involved in investigations within the Trump-Russia situation. And we know that several people have been removed from Mueller investigation or from various positions within the FBI. We know that there's people in the FBI that have been colluding with Fusion GPS in regard to the Steele dossier and you can go on and on.BARTIROMO: Yes.GRASSLEY: That's what we know. And the purpose of the special counsel is to give the Inspector General additional help so that -- that we can get the people that the Inspector General can't get to, those are the people that have left government.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, we know that they took the dossier to the FISA court and they used it to wiretap somebody in the Trump administration, but let me -- or the campaign. But what about these texts between Lisa Page and Peter Strzok about the judge, the FISA judge, Judge Contreras, where they're saying, "Oh, did you see, Rudy is on the FISA court. Did you know that?" Page text Strzok on July 25th. "Just appointed two months ago, I did know that, we talked about it before and after. I need to get together with him." Then they go on to talk about a party that they want to put together to get him in a personal spot so that they can discuss it. And then all of that, that conversation is redacted until we see unredacted redaction. Should that have been redacted?GRASSLEY: Well, I'm going to leave it to better experts than me, what should be redacted or not, but the extent of which I personally feel that's there's a lot of redaction just because it's embarrassing to people in the FBI or the Department of Justice, that's when it's wrong.BARTIROMO: Right. Senator, it's good to see you this morning, thanks so much.GRASSLEY: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Chuck Grassley there. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Facebook shares down this morning in the wake of reports that the personal data of 50 million users were misused by a political consultant. Lori Rothman on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange looking for a lower opening this morning. Lori, good morning to you.LORI ROTHMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Indeed, Maria, and good morning to you. A pretty substantial allegation of misuse of user data against Facebook this morning. It's pushing shares down about 3-3/4 now, down more than four percent, wow, in the premarket. It just ticked lower and really setting the tone Facebook is for the broader market, the weakness we are seeing. So, here's the deal, dealing with these allegations by a analytics company called Cambridge Analytica, that they got access to Facebook users to support now-President Trump's 2016 election campaign. For what it's worth, though, Facebook is up five percent on the year.Switch gears to a later topic, let's look at shares of Macy's this morning, trying to overcome criticism here that the traditional retailers like Macy's need to step up the tech innovation. So, they introduced an app that lets you shop for your furniture via virtual reality. Pretty cool. They're also expanding some online delivery pick-up options. Shares of Macy's over the last year or so are up about three-tenths of one percent. Back to you.BARTIROMO: All right. Lori, thank you so much. Should the rich pay more for a traffic ticket? The New York Times had an op-ed this weekend with the headline, "A Billionaire and a Nurse Should Not Pay the Same Fine for Speeding." Joining me now is the host of "VARNEY & COMPANY," Stuart Varney to weigh in on that? What?(LAUGHTER)STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, what?BARTIROMO: I mean, wow!VARNEY: Well, I call it identity punishment. At the moment the system we have for speeding tickets and fine -- the system we have is, you do this, and you'll fined that. The New York Times op-ed piece wanted a different system, you do this, and you are fined that depending on how much you make. Now, that's identity punishment, isn't it? I think this is very dangerous stuff. I went back and checked because I remember this story from some time ago. In Finland, they have this discriminatory fining policy, fining you on the basis of your income. And a guy who was a senior executive at Nokia, he was fined $103,000 because A, he made a lot of money, and B, he was going 45 in a 30 zone, driving a bright cherry red Harley-Davidson, so he was picked on by the local authorities because they knew get this guy, and you make a fortune. I mean, I can see that coming here. I can see how that will be very popular with going after the dreadful rich, I can see that, but I think it's utterly wrong, I think it's unfair.BARTIROMO: I agree with you. I mean, why do we punish success?VARNEY: Exactly.MCDOWELL: And by the way, don't dum-dums know that the real rich don't drive themselves.VARNEY: Precisely.MCDOWELL: They get somebody else to drive them around.(LAUGHTER)VARNEY: But really, eventually, they'll go after the middleclass, that you're just bound to. It's a revenue-raiser, it's get at the people who have got more than you have, it's a legacy of the Obama administration, that socialistic tendencies, jealousy at people who have success. I hate it.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, look, you didn't build that, right?(LAUGHTER)VARNEY: Right. Don't forget that.BARTIROMO: Stuart, thank you so much. I agree with you. We'll see you in 10 minutes, Stu. "VARNEY & COMPANY" begins top of the hour. Join him right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA. But first, new concerns over Hillary Clinton's private e-mail server. Why the House GOP could subpoena the FBI for the missing documents, next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. She's back: Hillary Clinton is now taking to Facebook, saying that she meant no disrespect after slamming Trump voters while she was in India. Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, the House Judiciary Committee is now demanding more documents related to the Clinton probe. Lauren Simonetti covering the story now with details. Lauren, good morning.LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Oh, Hillary Clinton won't go away. She's saying, I'm sorry, on Facebook. So, why did she tell an audience in India that Trump supporters were less-economically advantage? "I said that places doing better economically typically lean Democratic, and places where there is less optimism about the future lean Republican. The foundation of his message, 'Make America Great Again,' suggests that to be great, you have to go back to something we are no longer. I never accepted that." But guess what, key Democrats aren't accepting her and they're distancing themselves heading into the midterms.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. DUCK DURBIN (D), ILLINOIS: No, it's not helpful at all. And in fact, my friend, Hillary Clinton, is wrong. 30 percent of the people who voted for Donald Trump had voted for President Obama. Why?

This is what she wrote on Facebook. "Do I believe that some women look at a powerful woman and question whether she can lead, maybe voting for the man their husband is voting for instead? It may not be universally true or easy to hear, but yes, it's a dynamic still at play in our society.

Why do we care that China censors George Orwell&#39;s 1984 novel?CE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 8, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 686 wordsBody During the last week of February, different international media released the censorship that the Chinese government has imposed on a hundred words and works , among which the novels "1984" and "Rebellion on the Farm" by the writer George Orwell stand out.  In Chile, both works are part of the reading plan of the Ministry of Education, being compulsory readings for schoolchildren nationwide, in different stages of their formation. Along with the novels "A Happy World" by Aldous Huxley and "Farenheit 451" by Ray Bradbury are the most outstanding works of the genre known as dystopias, which covers futures where society instead of achieving general welfare has a high repression of thought and the work.  One of the most famous novels of recent years that deals with this literary genre is "The Hunger Games" which was adapted with great success to the cinema. 1984 by Orwell (AFP)  In particular, "1984" is about Winston Smith , a dystopian UK citizen, who meets Julia, who is a member of the resistance. Together in a nascent romance they seek to oppose the totalitarian regime of "El partido" , governed by "El Gran Hermano", whose "police of thought" watches over the most recondite acts of citizenship. The Nation talked with the writer Waldo Parra, author of "Masons and Libertadores" whose third installment arrives at bookstores in April. "It is a classic that have to do with ideas that are very current" because "to be able to build societies with open minds this type of novels, this type of visions, such as those raised by Orwell are essential," he said.  According to Parra, the novel proposes a reality in which "society is not willing for people to think or broaden their horizon of reflection", therefore although 1984 is science fiction "it raises very valid ideas, such as fundamental rights, among what is the freedom of expression and, in this case, freedom itself ".  Did you know that the most downloaded book of the last week in @BPDigitalDibam was "1984", by George Orwell. Download it for free to your cell phone, tablet (APP BPDigital) or computer (Adobe Digital Editions). And remember: Big Brother watches over you ????????? pic.twitter.com/qP3OXddllw  - Dibam_cl (@patrimonio_cl) February 26,2018 Orders for the book "1984" have increased by 9,500% since the beginning of the Donald Trump administration, according to Penguin. This is because the president of the United States has criticized the media for spreading "post-truth" or alternative facts, both topics discussed in "1984", a novel in which the government rewrites history and newspapers to make them coincide with the official truth . José Ignacio Silva, literary critic , sums up the "1984" argument by pointing out that the government's goal "is to control everything from a center, which is the theme of Big Brother: to achieve total and absolute control, which came to control thought and reinvent the language. This mediated by the Big Brother that controls without counterweight to society, refounded everything that was before. It's like a society that starts from scratch, deleting the past, rejecting it and installing this new way of controlled, directed thinking, where people do not have much of their own will and follow everything the leaders say. "  For Silva these three dystopias "raised forms of society that worked at that time as critical to the context in which they were written, postwar and cold war, where the hegemony was very strong", postulating "a new way of looking at society that were arising. "  According to Silva, Orwell shows totalitarian states where the idea "is to continue indoctrinating people and giving them a single official vision of what society has to be, what the state has to be like and what people have to think about society to maintain control. " So, for Silva, it is understandable that totalitarian states like China or North Korea do not want their citizens reading Orwell's work.  Meanwhile, Dibam recently announced that "1984" was one of the most downloaded books of the final week of February by Chileans , showing a current interest in the work published in 1949. Load-Date: March 8, 2018End of Document

HUMAN RIGHTS: DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO, NIGERIA AND TIBETStates News ServiceJanuary 18, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 688 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: BRUSSELS, Belgium BodyThe following information was released by the European Parliament:DRC must hold presidential and legislative elections in 2018Nigerian authorities must increase their efforts to stop ethnic and religious violenceChinese government must release detained human rights activistsMEPs call for elections in Democratic Republic of Congo, condemn violence in Nigeria and urge China to release human rights activists.Democratic Republic of Congo: government must hold elections on 23 December 2018The European Parliament regrets that the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) did not hold elections by the 2017 deadline and calls on its President Joseph Kabila, and his government to guarantee to hold presidential and legislative elections on 23 December 2018. They add that any EU contribution to the electoral process should be conditional on concrete government measures that demonstrate the political will to hold the elections in December 2018, including the publication of a realistic electoral budget.MEPs ask Congolese authorities to release all prisoners of conscience and to conduct an independent investigation into the violent repression of the demonstrations of December 2017. The European Parliament also urges the International Criminal Court and the UN to investigate the claims put forward by the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), which says Congolese security forces and government-backed militias are perpetrating crimes against humanity in Kasai province, where 40 mass grave sites have been discovered. To combat the escalating cholera epidemic in the DRC, MEPs ask the EU and its member states to increase financial and humanitarian aid through reliable organisations.Nigerian government must step up security effortsThe European Parliament expresses deep concern about the security situation in Nigeria. MEPs call on President Muhammadu Buhari and his government to:address the increasing inter-ethnic violence between pastoral communities and farmers by negotiating a national policy framework protecting the interests of both groups,step up the efforts to stop the attacks against Christian and Muslims,provide psychosocial support to the victims of Boko Haram radicalisation,reform the Nigerian state security forces and investigate abuses perpetrated by security officials, such as extrajudicial killings, torture and arbitrary arrests, andimplement a moratorium on the death penalty, with a view to its abolition.Moreover, MEPs ask the EU Commission and the European External Action Service to monitor the reintegration of Nigerian returnees from Libya, ensuring that the EU funding is spent effectively and keeping the European Parliament informed about the reintegration measures.China must release human rights activistsThe Chinese government must release blogger Wu Gan, pro-democracy activist Lee Ming-che, Tibetan language rights advocate Tashi Wangchuk, Tibetan monk Choekyi, and all those who are being detained for their human rights work, say MEPs. Pending their release, they add, they must not subjected to torture or ill-treatment and must have access to family and lawyers of their choice.MEPs call for an investigation into allegations that interrogators have used torture to force the confession of human rights lawyer Xie Yang, who was convicted on 26 December 2017 but exempted from criminal penalties after pleading guilty to subversion charges.MEPs express concern that the adoption of security laws in China will impact on minorities, particularly the Counter-terrorism Law, which could lead to the penalisation of the expression of Tibetan culture and Buddhism, and the Foreign NGO Management Law, which places human rights groups under government control. The European Parliament invites High Representative Mogherini and the EU member states to adopt the Foreign Affairs Council's conclusions on China, which would bind EU member states and institutions to a common approach towards human rights in China, thus avoiding unilateral initiatives or acts that might undermine the effectiveness of EU action.The three resolutions were approved by a show of hands on Thursday.Load-Date: January 18, 2018End of Document

All Rights ReservedLength: 887 wordsByline: feedback@businessinsider.com,  (Áine Cain)Highlight: Chinese authorities shut down Marriott International's Chinese website after the hospitality company listed Hong Kong and Taiwan as countries on its site.BodyDamir Sagolj/Reuters· Chinese authorities shut down Marriott International's Chinese website after discovering the company listed Hong Kong, Taiwan, Tibet, and Macao as countries.· Craig S. Smith, the president and managing director of Marriott's Asia-Pacific office, apologized for the incident in an interview with the state-run China Daily.· Business Insider's Tara Francis Chan reported that Marriott International CEO Arne Sorenson also released an apology.· The hospitality company's global Twitter accounts have largely remained quiet since January 11, due to the incident.Many of Marriott International's global Twitter accounts have stayed silent since January 11, ever since China accused the company of breaking its cybersecurity laws.Chinese authorities previously shut down the hospitality company's Chinese website and mobile apps, after discovering it listed Hong Kong, Taiwan, Tibet, and Macao as countries, Business Insider reported. Marriott managers were reportedly called in for questioning over the incident,            according to The Associated Press.In response, Marriott International CEO Arne Sorenson issued an apology, saying his company supported "the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China," Business Insider's Tara Francis Chan reported.President and managing director of Marriott's Asia-Pacific office Craig S. Smith also apologized in an interview with The China Daily,           a state-run media outlet."This is a huge mistake, probably one of the biggest in my career," Smith told The China Daily. "To regain confidence and trust, the first thing is to admit the mistake, then fix it, and it would come back slowly as we prove we really mean what we say."Smith has held the role since June 2015, and previously worked as the president of Marriott International's Caribbean and Latin American region."Asia Pacific is integral to Marriott International achieving its objective of becoming the world's favourite travel company," Smith said, in a 2015 interview with Travel Span.In the interview with China Daily, Smith described the company's plans to expand "employee education globally," set up complaint channels for Chinese customers, and oversee "the work of third-party agents for projects largely targeting the China market.""A freeze on its social media across the world" was also part of Marriott's "rectification plan," the China Daily reported.Marriott's main Twitter hasn't tweeted since January 10, although they have responded to customers' tweets. It's the same case for            Marriott International,            Marriott Rewards,            Marriott Rewards Latin America,            Marriott Rewards Europe,            The London Marriott,            Marriott Careers, and            Marriott Traveller Asia which all haven't tweeted anything aside from replies to customers since January 11 or before.GreatFire.org, an organization that tracks censorship in China, tweeted that the social media silence was a result of orders from the Chinese government.Tweet Embed:https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/953913844195315713?ref_src=twsrc%5EtfwChinese authorities demanded that Marriott implement a global freeze on all its social media posts.            https://t.co/UZu8QutMNQOn Twitter, Bloomberg reporter David Ramli pointed out that the move may serve as a warning sign to other international countries with operations in China.Tweet Embed:https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/953919259519799296?ref_src=twsrc%5EtfwAlmost all of Marriott's many global accounts stopped tweeting on Jan 10, followed by a capitulating apology on Jan 11. Since then, its accounts have only sent replies. If it turns out this was ordered by Chinese authorities it greatly changes the calculus of doing business here.            https://t.co/G8bf2hs6zfFrancis Chan reported that Marriott isn't the only company that's submitted to China's foreign policy. Zara, Qantas, and Delta all either released apologies or issued "corrections" after they were found to list Hong Kong, Taiwan, or Tibet as countries.But other companies, including Uniqlo, Uber, H&M, and Amazon still recognize both Hong Kong and Taiwan as countries on their sites.Marriott International did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.Do you have a story to share about working for Marriott or another international corporation with operations in China?

Hours after Musk's tweets, Trump read one aloud during the signing ceremony for his            steel and aluminum tariffs."For example, an American car going to China pays 25% import duty, but a Chinese car coming to the US only pays 2.5%, a tenfold difference," the tweet read. Trump was discussing the tariff bill and its possible effects when he read a printed copy of Musk's tweet. After reading the tweet, he seemed to criticize the Obama Administration for failing to address the import tax disparity."That's from Elon, but everybody knows it," Trump said. "They've known it for years. They never did anything about it. That's got to change."Trump then said he wants to introduce a "reciprocal tax program" that would match import taxes levied by foreign countries on American goods. The tweet followed Musk's initial message to Trump, where Musk asked Trump's opinion of the disparity between the US and China's vehicle import policies."Do you think the US & China should have equal & fair rules for cars? Meaning, same import duties, ownership constraints & other factors," Musk said.Musk also appeared to criticize former President Obama in his Twitter thread, claiming that "nothing happened" after he raised his concerns about China's foreign car tariff with the Obama Administration.Before reading the tweet, Trump praised Musk's space-exploration company SpaceX for doing a "great job" launching its Falcon Heavy rocket in February at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.Musk has faced roadblocks while trying to build a Tesla factory in Shanghai. While Tesla wants complete ownership of its factory, China's central government requires that Chinese companies have at least a 50% ownership stake in car factories built by foreign companies.NOW WATCH:  Jim Chanos says Elon Musk just told his 'biggest whopper' about Tesla yet See Also:• Elon Musk ranted about his biggest problem with China in a Twitter response to Donald Trump• Tesla investor Ron Baron thinks Elon Musk and the company are surrounded by enemies - but he's wrong• Tesla is about to make its first delivery with its all-electric SemiSEE ALSO: Elon Musk ranted about his biggest problem with China in a Twitter response to Donald TrumpLoad-Date: February 11, 2019End of Document

EXTRAORDINARY REPRESSION OF UIGHUR MINORITYStates News ServiceJanuary 19, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 437 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the Voice of America (VOA):The Chinese government uses extraordinary measures to surveille and persecute its Uighur Muslim minority in Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region. Chinese authorities have justified their crackdown on Uighurs, particularly those who practice their Muslim faith, by citing concerns over the "three evils" of "ethnic separatism, religious extremism, and violent terrorism."The government continues to closely monitor and restrict the movements of Uighurs, conduct indoctrination sessions, and confine thousands to "re-education camps" in its efforts to counteract what it considers religious extremism in Xinjiang.According to press reports, Urumqi, the capital city of the region may be one of the most surveilled places on earth. Security checkpoints with identification scanners monitor the train station and roads in and out of the city. Police use hand-held devices and software they require individuals to install, to search smartphones for encrypted chat apps and other material deemed suspicious.Under Xinjiang Communist Party Secretary Chen Quanguo, the police presence in the region has skyrocketed. Last year local police departments began ordering cameras capable of creating three-dimensional face images as well as DNA sequencers and voice-pattern analysis systems according to documents uncovered by Human Rights Watch.Chinese authorities also collect personal information from Uighurs, asking about respondents' prayer habits and if they have contacts abroad.But worst of all are the mass disappearances of Uighurs in Xinjiang since the beginning of 2017. Tens of thousands of the missing are believed to have been sent to a vast network of detention facilities, including "patriotic re-education" camps, across the region. Among those singled out are Uighurs who have studied abroad.Indeed, the Chinese government has sought the forcible repatriation of Uighur Muslims from foreign countries, many of whom sought asylum in those countries on the grounds of religious persecution. For students who choose not to voluntarily return, the Chinese government has sought for other countries to forcibly repatriate those Uighur Muslim students, many of whom had requested asylum from those countries on the grounds of religious persecution.U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has drawn attention to increased restrictions on the ability of Uighurs in China to express and practice their religion. The State Department's annual Human Rights Report also has highlighted repression of Uighurs' freedoms of speech, movement, association, and assembly.Load-Date: January 20, 2018End of Document

Rosa DeLauro:Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro (CT-03) today released the following statement regarding the Trump Administration's enforcement actions on China for stealing our nation's intellectual property."For years, I have fought to hold China accountable for its violation of our trade laws. China has systematically stolen our nation's intellectual property with regard to electric vehicles, aviation equipment, and internet servicestaking Americans' hard-earned research and development for their own countries' growth. The Chinese government has also engaged in cyberattacks directed at American companies, as well as state-directed acquisition of key American manufacturing and information technology companies. These policies and actions have hurt American workers for decades, and their voices have been absent from our national dialogue for too long. While we do not know if this Administration will follow through, today's proposed measures are the right start and long overdue.""At the same time, these actions must only represent one part of an overall strategy to ensure that we have an economy that works for everyone. A real, worker-focused agenda should include strong labor standards that are swiftly and fully enforced in a renegotiated NAFTA. It should also eliminate the outsourcing provisions in the recently enacted Republican tax law that further incentivize job losses, and put in place a net benefit review to ensure that foreign investments are not used as a tool by foreign state-owned companies to harm domestic interests. That is why Congress should immediately take up my bill, the Foreign Investment and Economic Security Act (FIESA), to ensure that foreign direct investment does not undermine America's public interests, including our national and economic security. I will continue to fight in Congress to make the Democrats' worker-centric vision for America a reality."###Load-Date: March 22, 2018End of Document

It should also eliminate the outsourcing provisions in the recently enacted Republican tax law that further incentivize job losses, and put in place a net benefit review to ensure that foreign investments are not used as a tool by foreign state-owned companies to harm domestic interests."That is why Congress should immediately take up my bill, the Foreign Investment and Economic Security Act (FIESA), to ensure that foreign direct investment does not undermine America's public interests, including our national and economic security. I will continue to fight in Congress to make the Democrats' worker-centric vision for America a reality."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6216005 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: March 23, 2018End of Document

Beijing police are using facial-recognition glasses to identify car passengers and number platesBusiness Insider USMarch 12, 2018 Monday 02:29 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 570 wordsByline: feedback@businessinsider.com,  (Tara Francis Chan)Highlight: China is drastically increasing its facial recognition technology, and hopes to eventually be able to identify any citizen within three seconds.BodyEUTERS/Thomas Peter• Beijing police began testing facial-recognition glasses last week.• They appear to be similar to those first used by police in a Henan railway station last month.• China is drastically increasing its facial recognition technology, and hopes to eventually be able to identify any citizen within three seconds.• The highly-policed region of Xinjiang serves as a warning to the rest of the country about potential surveillance measures to come.Police on the outskirts of Beijing are using facial-recognition glasses that can identify passengers and car number plates within milliseconds.The smart glasses were first tested in Beijing at a highway checkpoint last week, according to Reuters.Powered by artificial intelligence, the eyewear compares faces and cars to a "blacklist" in real time and display a red box and warning sign when a match is made.AFP/Getty ImagesThe AI-powered glasses are made by LLVision, the company behind similar police sunglasses rolled out at a Henan railway station last month. The technology was quickly praised by authorities for helping identify several individuals who had previously committed crimes, from human trafficking to traffic infringements.Surveillance and facial recognition technology is on the rise in China. There are currently 170 million surveillance cameras, and the government hopes to more than triple that number by 2020. That would be nearly one camera for every two citizens, which the Ministry of Public Security hopes can eventually be used to identify any citizen within three seconds.While experts worry about the infringement of privacy and human rights, the CEO of LLVision, Wu Fei, believes the concerns are unwarranted."We trust the government," Wu told Reuters, adding that Beijing uses the AI-powered equipment for "noble causes."But one highly-policed region of China, Xinjiang, is regarded as a warning sign of what the government could be planning across the country.Nearly 50% of Xinjiang's population are Uyghurs, an ethnic Muslim minority, which the Chinese government treats with suspicion. Facial-recognition cameras are common across the region, license plate numbers are            tracked and freedom to travel is drastically limited.Xinjiang authorities have also requested residents install surveillance apps on their phones, plus DNA, iris scans, fingerprints, and blood types have been collected from citizens, sometimes without their knowledge.In 2016, Xinjiang police bureaus also began collecting residents' voice samples. This was likely an early step toward a national voice database that could be used to identify any voice in recorded phone conversations.China's large sample population and lax privacy laws have allowed police and private companies to pioneer such technologies with few limitations - technologies that could dramatically alter how Chinese society operates.NOW WATCH: HENRY BLODGET: The NRA's extremism hurts gun owners, NRA members, and AmericaSee Also:• A former Chinese state prosecutor criticized Xi Jinping's plan to rule indefinitely and now he's been arrested• China's debt-trap diplomacy reaches the Philippines, which is likely to accept Chinese loans 1,100% more expensive than other options• China is threatening to fire back at the US in Trump's new trade warSEE ALSO: 22 eerie photos show how China uses facial recognition to track its citizens as they travel, shop - and even use toilet paperLoad-Date: February 11, 2019End of Document

The Wall Street Journal Global Economics Editor, Jon Hilsenrath. And the President of Maslansky and Partners, Lee Carter, Pollster. Great to see you.LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS: Great to be here.BARTIROMO: Good morning.JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: Great to be here, good morning.BARTIROMO: Good morning everybody.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning. Did you stay up and watch it all?BARTIROMO: A bit. I didn't stay -- I didn't watch the whole show but I did watch a little. Well as soon as they -- well, they got into the dreamers and that was it for me.MCDOWELL: Oh, there was even more topography but I'll save it -- I'll save it until later in the morning but there was some glaring, glaring hypocritical moments during the telecast.CARTER: Like Kobe Bryant winning.MCDOWELL: Kobe Bryant winning or how about the head of Planned Parenthood on the stage when Common's rapping about gun control, about the NRA, the (INAUDIBLE) for that, who thought that was a good idea? But we'll talk about -- we've got so much to talk about and then the winner in the fashion.BARTIROMO: Right. Yes, who says that was a good idea? Uh-hmm.HILSENRATH: I didn't see a single minute of it, so I'm interested to hear what you all have to say.BARTIROMO: You didn't see -- OK.HILSENRATH: Yes, I was on the train, didn't see a single minute.BARTIROMO: OK.HILSENRATH: I didn't know until this morning who won that thing.BARTIROMO: Well, we've got all that coming up. And joining us this morning to talk about a lot more, TIAA CEO and President, Roger Ferguson is with us this morning, he is the former Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve under Alan Greenspan by the way.Plus, the Chairman and former CEO of McDonald's, now the Chairman of Brands -- FAT International, Ed Rensi is here with us this morning. The Director of the Heritage Foundations, Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom, Nile Gardiner is here. And the Host of "Michelle Malkin Investigates" on CRTV.com, Michelle Malkin is here as well. FOX News Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano is here.Don't miss a moment of it, we got a big show coming up this morning. And we kick it off right now with this, President Trump's doubling down on his tough talk on trade, warning against retaliation from the European Union. The president tweeted this threat over the weekend, "If the E.U. wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on the U.S. companies doing business there, we will simply apply a Tax on their Cars which freely pour into the United States. They make it impossible for our cars and more to sell there. Big trade imbalance."Here's what Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told me yesterday on SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES about that when I brought up potential retaliation from abroad.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WILBUR ROSS, U.S. COMMERCE SECRETARY: I think what the president was saying was that because we have the big deficit and the other sides have big gains from trade, they have much more to lose in the trade war than we do. I don't think the retaliation is likely to be on seal as such. I think if it does on anything, it will be some little product in a key state to try to get Mitch McConnell or Paul Ryan feeling some pressure.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Jon Hilsenrath, obviously this was the big debate story on Friday, continued over the weekend with E.U. coming out and saying, "We're going to put tariffs of our own in place."HILSENRATH: And your interview with Wilbur Ross was really interesting because he's effectively arguing, everybody calm down, this isn't a big deal, it's $9 billion in tariffs from us, $3 billion in tariffs from the E.U. on things like Harley Davidson motorcycles, nothing's going to hurt."But the president is saying this is a big deal, he's saying this is going to change the tide of trade for the whole world and America's going to finally start winning. So there's some disconnect between what the commerce secretary is saying and what the president is saying. What really matters is what happens with prices? There's a lot of talk about these being small in amounts but are bills going to go up for cars and washing machines and beer cans?BARTIROMO: And we discuss this on Friday Dagen, after that journal op-ed where they titled, "Trump's Tariff Folly." Wilbur Ross basically said these are very insignificant price increases. We talked about the idea of case of beer, it's not one case of beer that's being consumed a year. But even he said cars are not seen the kind of significant moves that the journal has worried about.MCDOWELL: I think it's -- and I tweeted this on Friday, I think that's actually a ruse and a --BARTIROMO: Really?MCDOWELL: -- distraction away from the potentially credibly destructive impact of tariffs on aluminum and steel because it's not just about raising prices. And by the way, this could jeopardize way many more jobs anyone would ever say. But it's about the retaliation from nations with whom we trade.And, again, their slap -- plans to slap these tariffs on nations that are our allies that we need in terms of our national security. And I'll point out just a couple of things because they were -- Secretary Ross and also Peter Navarro were on TV all weekend as well and they said this is a drop in the bucket compared to the overall size of our economy. It's $9 billion -- it's only $9 billion in total tariff value.Well, do the math on that, that is essentially paying $5 million to $6 million per steel job saved, how does that math work out? And I think to the White House when you have Larry Kudlow, Art Laffer, and Stephen Moore, critical economic advisors for this president's pro-growth agenda coming out in the Hill over the weekend and writing a tariff telling him what a bad idea this is. I mean, this the -- this is --HILSENRATH: Dagen, not only them but it's interesting who we didn't see this weekend talking about the tariffs. We didn't see Gary Cohn, his top economic advisor --BARTIROMO: He's upset about this, yes.HILSENRATH: -- in the White House and we didn't see Steven Mnuchin talking about it and defending it.MCDOWELL: And also Secretary of Defense, James Mattis is up -- there have been reports that he's very upset about this because, again, you're slapping a tariff on South Korean steel and we need -- so, again, it's still -- it's more than just, "Oh, your six pack of beer's going to go up and your can of soup is going" up and I'll argue that was in terms of messaging, that was -- I don't know who orchestrated that but that did not look good last week.BARTIROMO: That was the messaging, right.CARTER: Look, the messaging was really tough, I think especially for those people who are really, really familiar with the issues. That said, I think a lot of Americans out there in the states that voted for him like Wisconsin, Ohio, Pennsylvania hear the story about trade and they're excited about it.They hear that -- they were saving jobs, that we're going to make things fair again, that we're making things right again. So I don't know why people are so surprised the president is doing it because he promised that he was going to do it. My big question really is, is this another one of the president's negotiating strategies which is let's throw something out there, create a lot of chaos, a lot of conversation, and then it gets rolled way back.BARTIROMO: And to that end, there was a headline yesterday and I didn't -- I couldn't find anything more on it but basically saying that China is going to be cutting important tariffs for vehicles as well as some consumer goods. I'm wondering if this is already stoking changes coming out of China just because of this negotiating stance. We can't move that out that this is plain poker.HILSENRATH: We also had President Xi's top economic advisor in Washington last week trying to talk the president and the White House back from taking steps like this. So this certainly has gotten the attention of the Chinese.BARTIROMO: Right.HILSENRATH: They have the most to lose in a case like this.BARTIROMO: And do you think they're cutting import tariffs on vehicles and consumer goods as a result of this?HILSENRATH: I don't know if it's --BARTIROMO: We don't know -- we don't know anything more about this headline.MCDOWELL: It could be for everybody but the United States. So let's wait -- let's wait and see.BARTIROMO: And to underline that point, Navarro and Wilbur Ross on my show were very clear to say there won't be any exemptions because there was a feeling that maybe there would be some countries that would actually be exempted on some of this.HILSENRATH: So this is one of the challenges of this whole deal is that we don't important a lot directly from China anymore because we have imposed duties on -- spherically on Chinese imports. So we get most of our steel from China.BARTIROMO: Yes.HILSENRATH: So -- I'm sorry, from Canada. So are we going to actually be hitting the culprit in this global steel glut by doing this? Our allies in Europe say no that it's just going to hurt them.MCDOWELL: We're hurting our greatest economic ally in Canada if you're doing these broad-based tariffs. But in the --BARTIROMO: And those NAFTA talks are continuing right now, there's another round going on in Mexico City right now.HILSENRATH: And the Europeans who say that the steel that isn't going to get dumped in the U.S. is instead going to get dumped on them. So they've been fighting really hard to get us to work with them to do something -- to team up on China.MCDOWELL: And it's Kudlow, Laffer, and more right Trump should examine the historical record on tariffs because they have almost never worked as intended.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: And they go through smooth Holly Tariff of 1929 that drove us deep into the great depression. The import --HILSENRATH: Well --MCDOWELL: Wait, let me finish. The stagflation in the 1970s because the import surcharge, it was put on by Richard Nixon, George Bush, again, destroyed more jobs with his 2002 steel tariff than actually existed in this deal industry at that time.And by the way Lee, you talked about Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, that's where -- those were the states during the 2002 steel tariff that was the hardest hit by the job losses in other industries, not steel but in the industries that use steel.HILSENRATH: And the thing we have to remember about those two tariffs as they might relate today, the president -- President Bush reversed them a year later.BARTIROMO: You mentioned -- that's a good point. You mentioned China, the country's 2018 economic growth target now set at 6.5 percent, compare that to what's happening here about three percent, that is down from the country's growth rate of 6.9 percent last year but 6.5 percent is a serious number Jon.HILSENRATH: So what that means, so it's March of 2018, what that means, here's a prediction I can make for a headline. In December of this year or January, we'll see the Chinese will say that their growth was 6.7 percent. So they're the only country in the world where they say, "This is what our growth is going to be and that's the number that we end up getting."BARTIROMO: Exactly what it is. Yes.HILSENRATH: It's partly because they faked the numbers but it's also partly because they'll do anything to reach their targets and you make a lot of mistakes when you set a target and we're pulling out all the stops to achieve that target.BARTIROMO: Yes.HILSENRATH: They're piling up a lot of debt right now to keep that economy growing as fast as it is.BARTIROMO: Let's talk about the deal of the day, French financial giant Axa announcing it will acquire XL Group, that's $15.3 billion. We were expecting deals to pick up Dagen. This is specific to the insurance business, stock is up 30 percent right now.MCDOWELL: Right. And I think this is a sign of things to come in finance but then also other industries, right Jon, in terms of the deals that you've seen?HILSENRATH: Absolutely.BARTIROMO: Lot more cash on the balance after the tax plan.HILSENRATH: You're talking about merger Mondays, our M&A reporters are very busy on the weekends trying to track these things down. And I think as long as interest rates are as low as they are, we're going to keep -- we're going to keep having merger Mondays.BARTIROMO: What does this mean going into the changes that we're expecting out of Dodd-Frank? I mean, here you have two insurers getting together the Dodd-Frank changes would not have impacted that but are you expecting specific dramatic changes from the Dodd-Frank legislation because the president told me he's going to be working on that in the coming weeks.HILSENRATH: I think -- that's a really good question because one of the things that hasn't been happening because of the implementation of Dodd- Frank is the Fed and the financial regulators haven't been allowing banks to merge. So as regulation (INAUDIBLE) that we might start seeing more bank deals.BARTIROMO: Well, they won't be able to go beyond a deposit limit of 10 percent, right, the major banks? I mean, that's set.HILSENRATH: Right. But the regulators having a lot of the banks to grow at all through acquisition and maybe we'll see them using up some on there.BARTIROMO: Maybe in wealth management for sure.HILSENRATH: Right.BARTIROMO: We'll take a break. When we come back, United Airlines replacing performance bonuses with a lottery? The details of the reported plan is raising more than a few eyebrows this morning.And then Hollywood's latest Washington slam, the Oscars take on republicans and illegal immigration as the award show take a political tone from the very start, back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. ISIS releasing a disturbing propaganda video. It shows last year's ambush in Niger targeting U.S. troops. Lauren Simonetti with the details now. Lauren, good morning to you.LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Good Monday morning, Maria. ISIS is releasing part of the video from a helmet camera, apparently worn by one of the U.S. soldiers killed in that ambush. This attack happened in October. It targeted a group of about 10 Americans and 30 local soldiers. Four U.S. special forces soldiers, there they are, died in that attack. Currently about 800 U.S. military personnel have stationed in Niger to train local troops.Well, the U.S. Embassy in Turkey shutting down today over security threat. Officials warning Americans in Ankara to avoid the building, stay away from large crowd and to keep a low profile. Not clear what the security threat was that prompted the closure. And we have no word on when the embassy will reopen.Well, how about this? United Airlines is replacing quarterly bonuses for its workers with the lottery system. So if you win the lotto, you can get prizes that include cash, cars, vacations and one lucky employee gets a $100,000 bonus each quarter (INAUDIBLE). Employees at the company are reportedly furious that the bonuses they rely on are being taken away from them. But United Airlines, President says the new system is designed to "Build excitement and a sense of accomplishment". We're showing their shares, down more than seven percent in the past year. I would be annoyed if the lazy person in the office wins the $100,000 bonus.BARTIROMO: Yes, me too. When it shouldn't -- it removes the whole idea of you're getting a -- you're getting a perk because you've worked hard and you've done a good job.SIMONETTI: Absolutely. But they say this is going to drum up big excitement. I don't know, you got to be lucky.BARTIROMO: Excitement? What?HILSENRATH: How about -- how about building up the anxiety? Because you don't know if you're going to miss out or be a part of it then.CARTER: And how does the lotto build a sense of accomplishment? That seems to be disconnecting messaging (INAUDIBLE)BARTIROMO: It's just like a fun thing. I mean there's --CARTER: Yes I know. It's not like I've worked hard and therefor I'm --MCDOWELL: Given the quality of United as a flyer, they ought to be handed out bonuses or discounts to the --BARTIROMO: How about the flyers? Where's our lottery?MCDOWELL: All right, we'll take a break. See you.BARTIROMO: We'll take a break. When we come back, Umer -- Uber is slamming a study by MIT. That claims drivers from the ridesharing company make less than $4.00 an hour.And then, markets this morning look like this after tough week last week. Dow Industrials pulling back by 20 points right now. S&P 500 is down a fraction. And the NASDAQ is up 11.5.We're watching markets and the reaction as the White House sheds more light on this plan tariffs on steel and aluminum. Back in a moment right here.BARTIROMO: Welcome back now on the latest on the Capitol Hill. The FBI and the DOJ accountability Republican lawmakers are calling for a second special counsel to investigate the Department of Justice and the FBI. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. TREY GOWDY (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: I don't think the Inspector General himself can answer all of our questions. Some of these witnesses have already left the department which means the Inspector General does not have jurisdiction. I think, we're trending perhaps, towards another special counsel.By this time there's already this investigation that's been open in to the Trump campaign so it's hard to believe when you have all of the people as you mentioned earlier, signing off on this investigation. How would they not know about the existence of the dossier? And that's one of the things we're still trying to get to the bottom of.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Yes, all of this following explosive release of the FISA memo surrounding the surveillance of former Trump campaign Advisor, Carter Page. Across the aisle, the Democratic party release the counter memo denying that any role in the Russia probe involved corruption. Joining me now is DailyMail.com White House Correspondent, Francesca Chambers. Francesca, good to see you. Thanks for weighing in here. You heard --FRANCESCA CHAMBERS, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, DAILYMAIL.COM: Good morning Maria.BARTIROMO: -- Trey Gowdy said to me yesterday, we're trending toward a second counsel. Is that necessary?CHAMBERS: Well, even the White House hasn't went that far, Maria, when I've asked about this in the past. It's one of the comments that the President's personal lawyers have made about the matter and the personal lawyers have suggested there might be a special counsel -- a second congressional counsel needed. But the White House haven't firmly taken that position. And even President Donald Trump hasn't firmly taken that position if you recall his Tweet, he said: Why not use Department of Justice lawyers to investigate this? But it didn't directly call for a special counsel investigation. And so I think that the interview that you played will force this issue however back onto the White House's plate and we'll have to take the position.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, the President was angry that Jeff Sessions is going to be putting it on the I.G., the Inspector General, to really investiagate this things. But Trey Gowdy, also talked about questions surrounding former FBI Deputy Director, Andrew McCabe. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOWDY: I want to know everything that happened in 2016 and whether Andrew McCabe was leaking for or against Hillary Clinton. I think it's important for all of us to know.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Andre McCabe, of course the individual Senior Executive at the FBI whose wife was running for a Senate seat and took $700,000 from the Democratic governor. Your take, Francesca.CHAMBERS: Well, and Trey Gowdy is also making a point in that interview, Maria, that some of the people that they would need to speak to are not within the direct purview of the Inspector General, so that's one reason why Republicans believe that there needs to be a second special counsel. But also at the same time, the question here is whether or not the Department of Justice is able to investigate itself thoroughly? And that's the problem that some of the Republicans are bringing up at this time, which again goes back to the President, so he's suggesting that the Department of Justice should investigate itself. So those two things are actually really at odds with each other.BARTIROMO: Well, we'll see if there's got to be another second counsel. Brought in, Lee Carter.CARTER: Yes, I think it's a really fastening time, because I think the American people and I've been talking to them are so confused by everything that's going on that they don't know how to make heads or tails of all of the facts that are out there, of all of this information, of the he said, she said. How do you simplify it for folks? So that they can say, let's cut to the chase. What would you say that's the most important thing for people to focus on right now?CHAMBERS: And at this point, I think, it's hard to make the determination when you haven't seen that FISA memo. The actual -- the application that they made for the FISA warrant. At this point, like you're saying, you just have Republicans saying one thing in a memo, you have Democrats saying another thing into memos originally classified and the underlying document, the FISA warrant is not something that we have been able to read in full. And so, until we can see that, if we ever see that, it might continue to be a he said, she said, sort of situation.BARTIROMO: Well, we know though that the FBI presented the dossier as a reason to wiretap a Trump associate and they did not -- they admit -- they omitted the information that, that dossier was paid for by Hillary Clinton and the Democratic party.CHAMBERS: And the rebuttal from the Democrats for that as well, they didn't need to know that it was specifically paid for by the Democratic party --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: -- Because there is no other side on the FISA court. The FISA court needs to know all of the information relevant because there's no, you know, other side to say -- to make a case against the wiretapping. So, that was -- that was a serious mistake.CHAMBERS: And it's impossible for us to know at this point after the fact Maria, again, when we haven't seen the underlying document. How much they did rely on Christopher Steel information to get that warrant in the first place?BARTIROMO: Right, all right, Francesca, thanks so much for weighing in this morning. Francesca Chambers, joining us there. Coming up, the cryptocurrrency gala is not just in the market itself. There's a new warning about where you buy or sell your digital tokens.Plus, pack your bags, Frontier Airlines offering flights for less than 30 bucks. Back in a minute with that.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Monday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us this morning. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, March 5th, your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast. Markets looking to bounce back this morning, a little stabilization going on despite a tough week last week, Dow Industrials, although, now, at the lows of the morning, down 30 points.The S&P 500 is down a fraction and the NASDAQ Composite this morning is up, it's up about eight points after Friday's decline. On Friday, the Dow closed down 70 points that was well off of the lows of the nearly 400 point selloff earlier in the day, S&P and the NASDAQ also bounced at the close.In Europe, markets are reacting to votes in Germany and Italy this morning, no clear winner emerged in Italy so far, and Angela Merkel securing her fourth term as the German chancellor. As you see, markets are up across the board. In Asia overnight, mixed performances, worst performer was Hong Kong, Hang Seng Index down two and a quarter percent.The volatility of Bitcoin, not the only concern for investors, another growing issue where people are buying the crypto currencies, we will tell you about it. And the CEO of Uber is fighting back this morning, why he calls an MIT study, over driver pay, incompetent. Then, scoring airline tickets for $20.00, Frontier is offering big discounts, but time is running out. We've got it all right here. Plus, if you, at first, do not succeed, try, try again.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WARREN BEATTY, HOLLYWOOD ACTOR: And the Oscar goes to, The Shape of Water.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Warren Beatty and Fay Dunaway, giving the Oscar for best picture to correct film this year, but politics and hot button issues took center stage last night at Hollywood's big night, all of the highlights and the low lights from Hollywood's biggest night, the Oscars, coming up.All that coming up this morning, but first, our top story this half an hour, of the half an hour, investors are bracing for another rollercoaster week on Wall Street, Futures have been volatile already this morning, we got a deal on the books, we have markets at the lows right now, down 40 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and, of course, new worries over trade, that after the Dow closed down for a fourth session in a row on Friday, amid fears over those trade new tariffs, joining us this morning is Tiger 21 Chairman, Michael Sonnenfeldt. Michael, good to see you, thanks so much for joining us.MICHAEL SONNENFELDT, CHAIRMAN, TIGER 21: Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: How worried are your members about the trade issues?SONNENFELDT: They are concerned because they think it may be less entries where the real war this time, is jobs from technology, computerization, A.I., that's where the real job loss is coming from, about 80 percent of the loss, only 20 percent from trade issues, so they want to make sure we're fighting the right war.BARTIROMO: You know, the President has been saying that he wants to help the steel industry, help the aluminum industry, that they are faltering right now, but you see it differently, and also in the op-ed today from the journal, they're basically saying, it is what it is, there's one CEO from a steel company saying, don't look to this industry as a job creator.HILSENRATH: Well, steel and aluminum have been losing jobs for decades. That's why we've had rounds of tariffs before, you know, 2002 by President Bush, President Carter back in the 1970s, so this is really an old story and it's not big or important part of America's industrial base right now, you know, as you say, technology is really what's driving American growth.SONNENFELDT: Yes, and like avalanche, a small amount, they talk about how small the dollars are, but a small pebble can start a big avalanche and that's a trade war that we don't want right now.HILSENRATH: Well, do you buy this argument? Wilbur Ross was on Maria's show this weekend, saying this is just a few billion dollars in tariffs, it's just -- it's in tiny part of the overall economy, don't worry about it.SONNENFELDT: I don't buy it at all because one thing can lead to another, and right now, we have very delicate relationship with China and South Korea. We shouldn't be pin-pricking and wondering where -- these are people that we need to be working with closely, given what's going on in North Korea and elsewhere.HILSENRATH: So what does this mean for markets and investors? We had a big selloff last week. Was this just a one-time selloff or is this the kind of thing that could turn a bull market into something that goes nowhere or down?SONNENFELDT: You know, we have a fragile market. It would be foolish to predict where it's going, but we know things like this can be like popping a balloon. I think if you look at fundamentals right now, we were just digesting the benefits of the tax reduction. Everybody was, sort of, on a high with that, and so this seems to have popped that balloon a bit.MCDOWELL: This is a self-inflicted error or wound, if you will, in terms of economic policy coming out of the White House.SONNENFELDT: I think so. Yes.MCDOWELL: But I'll point out, that a lot of the arguments that you've heard out of the White House, the last several days, they are furious. The steel industry last year, Newcore, made $1.3 billion profit, you go through these steel companies, and again, it's -- you're putting at risk six and a half million jobs in steel consuming industries in the United States to save 140 or 150,000 jobs or to preserve them.And it's not just about steel, it's how all of these other nations react, and when you have the very job creators in this country, like the automakers, sounding a warning saying, hey, you've been putting pressure on us to bring jobs back here, you just did something that's going to cause us to go and seek cheap steel elsewhere. They are more likely to make cars in another nation, and you just handed a victory to foreign automakers.SONNENFELDT: Yes, absolutely.BARTIROMO: Are people investing alongside these things, what are you seeing in terms of members and how they are moving their money right now?SONNENFELDT: So, most of our members only have about 23 percent in public equities and most of that is ETFs, precisely because they don't want to be market timers, the one area where they have specific concentration, Alphabet, Amazon, and Facebook, of course, Berkshire Hathaway, perennially, but the point is, these are companies that can scale, and they are not worried. These aren't going to be affected by the steel tariffs. These are technology companies that are scalable without labor.So our members are not market-timers, except the few who are real traders. Our members are focused on private equity and real estate where they can roll up their shirt sleeves, touch and feel the asset and most of those activities are not going to be too affected these tariffs.CARTER: So you said that (INAUDIBLE) you think that the market is slightly fragile, at the same time, are you telling people that they should be concerned, are you saying people, you know, this has been for the long haul, what are your members feeling about all of this right now? How do you advise them?SONNENFELDT: Equal parts optimism and concern, and when I say that, over 70 percent of our assets are in risk equity and assets, real estate public equity, private equity, over 70 percent. So they are optimistic about the long-term fundamentals. We have such strength in this country, our legal system, our transportation network, our energy complex, all gives us a real tail win for success, so the last thing we want to do is see it screwed up by something that unintentionally escalates. It's not the 9 billion- dollars that Secretary Ross is talking about. It's what the reaction may be that may start going into other sectors that could really harm our members.MCDOWELL: Again, I said this earlier, that's five to $6 million per steel job when you do that $9-billion math, how about every other worker, the millions of workers going, where is -- where is my pay-out to rescue my job?HILSENRATH: Why do you call them members, and not investors?BARTIROMO: Yes, explain Tiger 21.SONNENFELDT: Yes. Tiger 21, if you think of the major league baseball, football, basketball, those players are 1 in 17,000 people, our members are 1 to 10,000 domestically, and 1 in a 100,000 globally, in terms of accomplishment as entrepreneurs who have created great wealth. So our members come together every month in these private settings that allowed them to discuss just what we are talking about, but in a totally confidential setting and we bring in the world's best experts.We just had an annual conference, Condoleezza Rice was there, and Bill Miller was there, Charles Ellis, Howard Schultz. And this is the place where really successful entrepreneurs come as they transition out of owning a business and becoming wealth preservers and wealth managers.BARTIROMO: What are they -- what are they saying about the crypto craze, I mean, even the market places where you buy and sell digital coins, apparently, are posing a risk. According to the Wall Street Journal, investors lost one and a half million dollars after two major hacks at BitGrail and CoincheckSONNENFELDT: Yes.BARTIROMO: Bitcoin is a big topic for your client -- for your members, right?SONNENFELDT: It is. It is. But, you know, if you look at the auto industry, there are 100 auto companies that got consolidated with lots of volatility at the beginning of the auto industry. So this volatility in Bitcoin, this is a bold new beginning, it's Bitcoin, Blockchain and all the other crypto currencies. In fact, last week, I think J.P. Morgan finally acknowledged that Bitcoin and Blockchain could have a material impact on their future business. It's going to change the world to finance, so our members are looking not just at Bitcoin, the volatility is just evident of the new market coming to being. This is going to change the way business transacts.HILSENRATH: So these are leading entrepreneurs and people who started businesses who are saying, yes, this is real, Jamie Dimon is wrong, this isn't -- this isn't a fad or a craze.BARTIROMO: And he said he was wrong as well.HILSENRATH: Yes.SONNENFELDT: By the way, if you were in Venezuela or some other country, Bitcoin would be a lot more important to you when you're worried about government intervention, and government interference, and government controls. If there's a currency that can go past all of that, that's going to change the world.BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there. Michael, we will be watching that. Thanks so much, Michael Sonnenfeldt, joining us there. Coming up, Uber comes out swinging after a study by MIT claims drivers for the ride-sharing company make less than $4.00 an hour. And then glamour with a side of controversy, the Oscars take aim at the President and his policies, the highlights and the low lights from Oscar night, next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, South Korea trying to create pathway for talks between North Korea and the U.S., Lauren Simonetti with all the details this morning, Lauren, good morning.SIMONETTI: Hi, Maria, good morning (INAUDIBLE) envoys today. They are holding meetings with North Korea's Kim Jong-un, the first such meetings since Kim took power back in 2011, both countries seeking to build on the momentum created by the Winter Olympics. Now, after the meeting, the South Korea envoys will fly to Washington, D.C. to consult with the Trump administration.Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, now on his three-nation tour to woo foreign leaders, going stop number one, visiting Cairo. Saudi Arabia and Egypt now has $10 billion-dollar joint fund to develop a mega city in the South Sinai. In your interview, Maria, with him last year, the Crown Prince laid out his vision for a modern Saudi Arabia.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MOHAMMED BIN SALMAN, CROWN PRINCE, SAUDI ARABIA: We want to live a normal life, a life that translates our moderate religion, our good customs. We coexist and live with the world and contribute to the development of our country and the world.(END VIDEO CLIP)SIMONETTI: He's also going to travel to London, as well as New York, hoping to press his credentials on a global stage. After weekend of numbers crunching, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is redoing a study on how much Uber and Lyft drivers actually earn. Their report last month found that nearly three quarters of the drivers earn less than a minimum wage, we are talking about $3.37 an hour and that many of them actually lose money. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi lashed out at the methodology. He called the researchers, incompetent, forcing MIT to redo its math, so much for a kinder, gentler, Uber.All right. Anyone who wants to book cheap get away in the next few months, better hurry up. Frontier Airlines is offering $29.00 flight to different cities across the country this spring. This is what you need to know: the sale ends tonight at midnight. These are one-way flights only good for Tuesday and Wednesday, but look, other flights for other days, they start at $39.00. Where can you go? Denver, Atlanta, Cincinnati -- some of the destinations on the list.BARTIROMO: All right. Denver.SIMONETTI: Maybe.BARTIROMO: Yes.SIMONETTI: Atlanta, maybe.BARTIROMO: Good prices there. Meanwhile, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia making this world tour, Dagen, what's your take on this? Saudi is opening itself up, they say?MCDOWELL: I think that it was -- it goes back to your interview that you did with the next king of Saudi Arabia, that it was just such an incredible display of openness in terms of how he expressed himself, his views about the future of Saudi Arabia and place in the world stage. It was incredible.BARTIROMO: Big changes.MCDOWELL: It goes back to you being there on the ground when it happened, and it happened with you. Really incredible.BARTIROMO: It was. It was. I mean, I was struck, like I told you that story of the security guard coming over to me, telling me my mother was crying all night. I mean, it really went viral in Saudi, but even the world to see these different changes coming out of Saudi Arabia right now. It's a -- and they have to make change. Look where oil is, they can't no longer rely on oil revenue that they had derived in the past. So, they need to diversify their own economy and with that comes foreign capital. We'll see if it works.HILSENRATH: They have a young population, a lot of unemployed people. They have to diversify in order to give people a future.BARTIROMO: It's such a good point, Jon. 70 percent of the people in Saudi Arabia are under 30 years old.HILSENRATH: Right.CARTER: That's phenomenal.BARTIROMO: So, you either -- you either get them now or, you know, in some cases, you lose them if a terrorist mentality overtakes them. I mean, it's young people who can go one of two ways.HILSENRATH: But you know, as we've seen in places like China and places like Russia, it's very hard to open up and become a more open Democratic society and a more open economy. So, this isn't going to be -- this isn't an easy challenge that they've got in front of them.BARTIROMO: Not at all. All right. We'll take a break, when we come back, from the White House to DACA, to the time's up movement, Hollywood's biggest night left no political hot button untouched. But there were many light and historic moments during Oscars. We've got all the highlights right after this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A stunning Lupita Nyong'o, she was born in Mexico and raised in Kenya. Let the tweet storm from the president's toilet begins.JIMMY KIMMEL, TELEVISION HOST: Oscar is 90 years old tonight. Which means, he's probably at home right now, watching Fox News.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: That was the Host of the Oscars, Jimmy Kimmel last night. He mocks the president as politics took center stage on Hollywood's biggest night. Joining us right now with more on the Oscar top moments is "IN THE FOX LIGHT" Host, Michael Tammero. Michael, great to see you. Thanks for getting up early for us.MICHAEL TAMMERO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL VICE PRESIDENT OF MARKETING AND HOST: Hello, my Maria. How are you?BARTIROMO: I'm good. Things got heated right from the beginning, right? What did you make of Kimmel taking a jab at the president? Was it what you expected? Your takeaways?TAMMERO: No, I'm angry at Jimmy Kimmel, because he promised a nonpolitical Oscar this year, and he did the complete opposite. You know, at one point, he went on the say only two of the best pictures made more than $100 million, and that's not the point, we don't make films for money, we make them to upset Mike Pence. Well, you know what, I'm sure there's a lot of studio executives out here and shareholders who disagree, especially after the worst summer box office in over 25 years. You know, there was an attempt last night, if you look at the production value of that opening number, and then the sets, and then sort of the bringing out of some of the legends like Rita Moreno. There was an attempt to remind audiences around the world and in America of what they love most about Hollywood, but then that was quickly forgotten with every speech last night.BARTIROMO: I think somebody needs to remind Hollywood that the country doesn't necessarily agree with them. I mean, they have all of these expectations and they just speak as if everybody agrees with everything they say because they're so self-informed.TAMMERO: You know, we have seen politics; it's the merging of politics and pop culture; actors are now activists and I don't see it changing any time soon. It will, at one point, as audiences turn off the Oscars and don't go to the movies. It's going to have to change at some point.BARTIROMO: What do you think, Lee?CARTER: I think it's going to have to change. I think they tried to make some subtle changes but they couldn't stick with the plot. I mean, when Jimmy Kimmel was talking about how -- he was making fun of how out of touch they were, when he talked about how there's 45,000 crystals and all that whole joke that he tried to make. They did salute the military. They tried to do some things, I think, to get themselves in touch with people: go visit the average people that were across the street in the movie theater, do you think that came through at all?TAMMERO: You know, it started -- there are so many issues and so many causes that they were addressing last night. It's starting to take -- it's hard to keep up with it all. And it's starting to take on an -- at one point on the red carpet, everyone had a ribbon, everyone had lapel pin for something different. And I asked one actor who had this really fancy lapel pin, I said, you know, what was -- what did it mean? And he was just like, it's a David Yurman. And I was like, oh, OK.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: It didn't mean anything.TAMMERO: We forgot. There is that aspect to it. It didn't mean anything. It looked good.MCDOWELL: Michael, I can never get over the fact -- it's Dagen -- watching all of the celebrities. It's like they're so insulated that it's -- I heard a very progressive podcast host say this the weekend that when it comes to Hollywood, it's all these, like, overly -- like overly groomed little, yippie toy dogs eat their dog park with each other just sniffing themselves, and like, they have no concept of what's going --(LAUGHTER)MCDOWELL: -- and I'm putting that delicately because it's 6:54 in the morning. That's what it's like.TAMMERO: It's 3:00 in the morning for me, Dagen, thanks.(LAUGHTHER)MCDOWELL: But it's like that all -- like, in the dog pen, the dog park together just smelling themselves.BARTIROMO: Well, I mean, and they addressed the big political debates of the year. Listen to this on immigration.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And like everyone in this room and everyone watching at home, we are dreamers. Dreams are the foundation of Hollywood and dreams are the foundation of America.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And to all the dreamers out there, we stand with you.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: So, that's when I turned it off because they didn't acknowledge the fact that we're all dreamers.TAMMERO: You know, Maria, I think a lot of people turned off the show last night. Last year was the worst ratings for an Oscar telecast in over a decade. I can't wait to see what the numbers are like this year. And Dagen, you make a great point. You know, I asked a lot of stars yesterday on the red carpet: you know, do they -- how do they feel about using a celebrity for political causes? And none of them had an issue with it. They don't -- they have not been held to account at this point. They really do sort of live in a -- in insulated bubble.MCDOWELL: You know what did win last night, though, I want to point out is the "Icarus", the documentary that --BARTIROMO: I saw -- you know, I knew you were going to bring that up today. I saw that.MCDOWELL: So, again, that was a huge win in terms of politics. That's how you make change if you're in Hollywood, is you make a documentary that exposes basically that Russia doped the entire Sochi Olympics.TAMMERO: Yes, that was a big win last night. And you know, and "Shape of Water", we should mention, won the most nominations and come out with top prize for best picture.BARTIROMO: What were you going to say, Jon?HILSENRATH: I wanted to know why ratings have been so soft? When they look at this, and what are they doing to change it?TAMMERO: You know, look, Sunday night, you're asking people to sit for three and a half hours to four-hour show, and then they insult half of the country in the process. I mean, that's sort of a tough ask to make of people. You know, the first Oscars was in 1929, they gave out 15 statutes in 15 minutes. There's got to be a compromise between that first telecast and what we saw last night.BARTIROMO: Yes, good point. All right. Michael, hopefully it was funny anyway, for you.TAMMERO: It's always fun.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: We're glad to see you, when you get back, Michael Tammero.TAMMERO: It's fun to be with you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Always. I'll see you later. Michael Tammero joining us there. Stay with us. We'll be right here. More right here.BARTIROMO: Good Monday morning. Welcome back, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.

House Foreign Affairs Committee Issues Testimony From Ex-Under Secretary of CommerceTargeted News ServiceMarch 14, 2018 Wednesday 7:04 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1642 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe House Foreign Affairs Committee issued the following testimony by Mario Mancuso, ex-under secretary of Commerce for industry and security, at a hearing entitled "Modernizing Export Controls: Protecting Cutting-Edge Technology and U.S. National Security":"Chairman Royce, Ranking Member Engel, and other distinguished members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify this morning. I'm delighted to be with you, and with my distinguished fellow panelists."My name is Mario Mancuso. Over the course of my career in government, I have had the privilege to serve in a variety of roles across the US national security and foreign policy enterprise, including as Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Combating Terrorism, a member of the Global Markets Board of the National Intelligence Council, and as a forward deployed military officer during Operation Iraqi Freedom."In these roles, I learned a great deal about how US national security is conceived, debated and articulated in the interagency; how statecraft is operationalized; and how U.S. national security objectives are advanced "on the ground." I also learned a great deal about the difference between ideas and execution; inputs and outputs; the importance of legal authorities, resources and accountability; and the need for modesty, especially in presuming what we know and do not (and cannot) know and do."Today, I am a Visiting Senior Fellow for International Security at the Hudson Institute, where I continue to work on questions relating to US strategy and statecraft in the emerging security environment. I am also a partner at Kirkland & Ellis LLP, where I advise clients with respect to matters that may implicate the US's national security regulation of international business activities, including with respect to CFIUS and export controls."To be clear, I am here today in my personal capacity. The views I express here are mine alone, and should not be understood to be the views of Kirkland & Ellis or of its clients. I am here to offer some observations, in my capacity as a former government official, about these topics and to answer your questions about the imperative of US technology leadership, the international security profile and interests of the United States, and the role that CFIUS and export controls play in serving those interests. I will not discuss any specific case or matter that has been, or is currently before, the US government."As this Committee knows well, both CFIUS and export controls are important instruments of US national security statecraft. By design, they aim to effectuate a selective "denial strategy," which itself is premised on an important assumption: that the US has certain things that others want but do not have."While globalization has rendered that assumption outdated in many areas, for certain emerging and foundational technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence, robotics, augmented/ virtual reality, etc.) that assumption is still generally true."On the other hand, while globalization has diminished our lead in certain technology areas, it has also been central to our economic and, by extension, our national security success. One need only look at US overmatch advantages in nuclear and electronics-enabled capabilities at critical junctures in our history to see how economic scale and technological superiority worked hand in hand in service of our global preeminence."In this connection, as this Committee considers the contribution of CFIUS and export controls to US national security, I would invite the Committee to keep in mind two national security-related questions which may help frame its deliberations:* At this time in our history, what is the optimal balance for the US to strike between economic openness and restrictiveness in order for the nation to secure the most important advantages of openness while mitigating its greatest risks?; and* Whether, in light of that desired equilibrium, CFIUS and the current export control regime is, by virtue of their respective legal authorities and resources, properly configured to effectively implement and maintain this balance in the current environment? In the interest of facilitating our discussion today, I wanted to offer some preliminary observations:* Foreign direct investment (FDI) is critical to U.S. economic vitality. Not surprisingly for an advanced industrial economy, the largest proportion of FDI into the U.S. occurs as M&A activity. In the US, FDI accounts for approximately 7 million domestic jobs and other positive, ancillary economic impacts. The collective economic strength and vitality of our economy-- to which FDI clearly contributes-- helps resource our investments in national defense and extends our "soft-power" reach around the world.* While the US remains a preferred global destination for FDI, our global share of FDI has declined in recent years. Because of its many direct and indirect benefits, this should be concerning to US policymakers, including US national security policymakers. Indeed, nations today must compete for FDI. A failure to consistently attract sufficient (benign) FDI into the US would present a long-term, systemic national security risk to the US.* While FDI is generally good, certain transactions do, in fact, present transaction-specific national security risks. The policy question to consider in the context of FDI, therefore, is not primarily how to balance economics and national security interests, but how to balance systemic and transaction-specific national security risks.* In recent years, strategic competition between the U.S. and China has increased across multiple domains--economic, political, and military. There is no reason to believe that such competition will abate in the coming years.* China is actively pursuing a well-resourced, coordinated science and technology strategy that seeks to bolster "indigenous" Chinese innovation and to position China to be the world's technology and innovation leader. A number of pillars of this strategy are described in various official Chinese government pronouncements, such as "Made in China 2025", a number of Five-Year Plans, and certain published technology roadmaps. If successful in its articulated form, this strategy would have important Chinese economic and social benefits, contribute positively to the US-China economic relationship, and have deleterious impacts on US national security.* Export controls have a long history in the US. In recent history, their defining policy challenge was during the Cold War, when they helped to manage strategic competition with the Soviet Union. During this period of Western solidarity and significant technological change, export controls worked reasonably well to prevent the illicit export of technology to Warsaw Pact countries. Since the Cold War, export controls have been significantly updated from time to time to address a broader set of US national security challenges. During this period, export controls have sought to balance, among other things, a complex bilateral relationship with China and the imperative to secure U.S. access to foreign technology markets in order to sustain scale economies to help fuel U.S. technology innovation, all against a backdrop of rapid and significant technological change and economic competition with strategic allies and others.* As a matter of legal authority, export controls apply to the transfer of specific or general types of technology to foreign persons generally. In other words, their reach is not limited by law to a prescribed set of commercial circumstances (e.g., a corporate transaction). The controls themselves vary by technology type, end-use and end-user, and are designed to advance one or more national security, foreign policy or other goals. The system is highly complex and nuanced.* Historically, most FDI in the US came from Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, many of whom are formal US allies. By contrast, in recent years an increasing number of investors have come from Asia, especially China, as global liquidity has moved east. This macro-economic trend is generally considered a secular one and expected to continue, despite periodic political or cyclical economic volatility.* As a matter of legal authority, CFIUS has legal jurisdiction over many, but not all, transactions. Three things must be true for a transaction to be a "covered transaction," and thus fall within CFIUS's jurisdictional perimeter: (a) the buyer or investor must be "foreign person"; (b) the transaction must be a "control" transaction; and (c) the target business must be a "US business." Each of these are terms of art, and broadly construed as a matter of agency practice. While CFIUS's reach is broad, it is not infinite.* Export controls and CFIUS have different, independently important, and complementary responsibilities. As Congress considers reforming one or both, it should focus its review primarily on gaps in resources as well as legal authorities.* US technology leadership is essential, particularly with respect to certain emerging and foundational technologies, to long-term US national security interests. To achieve this, the US should pursue a whole-of-government strategy that does not rely exclusively on CFIUS and export controls--or see these as the exclusive vectors of risk-- but builds "strength on strength" by countering illicit technology transfer (however that may occur) and enhancing the US's economic competitiveness and technological superiority."Thank you, again, for the opportunity to be with you today, and for your commitment to exploring these important issues. I look forward to your questions."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6204644 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: March 15, 2018End of Document

Good Friday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Friday, February 16th. Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast: bulls on the run, stocks rallied again yesterday. Take a look in the market, up 306 points at the close yesterday, 1-1/4 percent. It has gained almost 6 percent in just the past five trading sessions, the largest percentage again for the Dow for that timespan since December 2011.All right. Check today, and the Futures indicating the momentum continues this morning. We've got the Dow Jones Industrials Average up almost 50 points right now. Fractional move up, S&P 500 also expected to open up quarter of a percent higher, as is the NASDAQ up one-quarter of a percent, 17 points higher on NASDAQ. Green across the board in Europe, take a look at the major indices there. We see money moving into stocks to the tune of two-thirds of a percent higher on the FT; better than one percent higher on the CAC Quarante, and two-thirds of a percent higher on the DAX Index in Germany. In Asia overnight, all the major indices and the were closed for the Lunar New Year except Japan. Japan was up. It was up better than one percent overnight on the Nikkei Average.Battle at the border, senators failed to pass a compromise yesterday even a bipartisan effort which would have provided a pathway to citizenship for DREAMers as well as provide billions of dollars in border security, it could not get the votes, White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley just spoke with me about it, and weighed in on the lack of a deal.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HOGAN GIDLEY, WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY: This is up to Congress. This is Congress's mess. But the President has outlined a generous framework with both sides that should be able to get behind it, and for whatever reason, Democrats continue to stonewall the debate. But I will say one more thing, Maria, and that is this, it exposes Democrats for what they are, people who use politics and put that over people, because quite frankly, this is a fix for DACA that they've been dying for a long time.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: More this morning on the new efforts to reach a deal, coming up. And I will speak with Attorney General Jeff Sessions this weekend about the immigration debate and lot more this weekend "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES" over on the Fox News Channel. Join me at 10:00 a.m. Eastern for that special interview of the Attorney General.Meanwhile, overnight concerns, what you need to know is FedEx warns that data breach could have delivered your personal information to the wrong hands. Plus, are we alone? Space lovers rejoicing as NASA discoveries nearly 100 new planets beyond our solar system. Cool stuff to tell you about. All those stories coming up this morning. And joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, The Wall Street Journal's Assistant Editorial Page Editor James Freeman. And we welcome to the program MacroMavens' President, Stephanie Pomboy. Good to see you.STEPHANIE POMBOY, PRESIDENT, MACROMAVENS: Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: Thanks for being here. We've got a lot to talk about this morning with you in terms of the economy, the tax plan.POMBOY: Lots going on and the markets are moving, for sure.BARTIROMO: Yes.POMBOY: You know, we've talked a lot in the past about what I view as this huge gap between the fundamentals and asset prices and it looked like we were starting to get that, we solved a little bit last week, and, of course, you know now markets are rebounding, and I guess, you know, I'll be watching closely to see how things pan out. But it feels to me like natural buy-the-deep bounce where the market gods try to sucker every last person in before the final push.BARTIROMO: Well, it's funny because the J.P. Morgan morning note this morning telling clients they're attributing it to FOMO, fear of missing out.POMBOY: Yes.BARTIROMO: That this fear of missing out had people coming right back to the stock market after those 2,000 points deadline.POMBOY: And The Wall Street Journal's piece today about the correlation increase and, you know, put that together with low volume, and it does make you feel like a lot of this is just a momentum sort of computer driven bounce, more than, you know, sincere interest in buying for value.JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I mean, I wouldn't say stocks are cheap but S&P 500 trading high teens multiple of earnings.BARTIROMO: Not so cheap.FREEMAN: Well (INAUDIBLE) but this fast growth we've been talking about, you know, shouldn't stock prices go up if earnings come in much better than expected?MCDOWELL: But, you know what, those earnings aren't -- you're not willing to tolerate earnings that quite such rich multiples if you think interest rates are going to keep going up.POMBOY: Well, that's the thing.MCDOWELL: That that's very calculation of how much those stocks are worth.BARTIROMO: Don't underestimate the big buyers from corporations because now that we got out of the quiet period in terms of earnings, a lot of companies are in there buying back stock.POMBOY: For sure. That's --BARTIROMO: I think that's one of the reasons that we're seeing this gain, $170 billion in stock buybacks announced just since the President signed the tax bill. So, we got all of that coming up this morning. Joining the conversation this morning, House Ways & Means Committee member, New York Congressman Tom Reed is here, of course, the host and Varney of -- "VARNEY & COMPANY", Stuart Varney will weigh in as well. We've got a lot to talk about this hour, so stay with us.We're going to kick it off right now to the latest on Wall Street despite the inflation concerns of investors. Technology stocks driving the market on a fifth straight day of gains. Futures are indicated to look at more gains this morning. Take a look, Dow Industrials expected to be up 30 points, S&P 500 up four, and the NASDAQ up 14 at the close -- at the open this morning. So, Stephanie, do you think that people have just put the inflation worries aside for now?POMBOY: You know, I think that -- again, it's really more of a momentum- driven bounce to me, you know the fundamentals, I have to say, on the inflation side right now, while the CPI did pick up, the real pressure is on the input side and that's probably going to persist because you still don't see the households' ability to absorb substantially higher inflation.So, right now, you've got the CPI running basically a full percentage point below the PPI on year-over-year basis, and that is really a margin squeeze for corporations if their input costs are going up faster than their ability to pass them on. So, I think we need to see where that flushes out but right now, it's really an input story. So, I think the market, the bond market may have overreacted to inflation because if it remains in the pipeline, it's really not as big a problem for the Fed. This has been the issue so far, is that we've seen these increases in PPI inflation that haven't been able to really translate through, and I don't see that dynamic changing.FREEMAN: The -- I'm just wondering about if you see any hope here on productivity improving. It's been terrible without getting more investment, I think, because of the tax cut. This is obviously a way that companies could pay people more without it being inflationary, is if those people are producing more stuff.POMBOY: Yes, it doesn't seem to me like you're getting much evidence of that. I mean, I think what we're seeing right now, again, is you got companies announcing that they're going to use this money for share buybacks more than you see in a real increase appetite for CAPEX. And I guess on the productivity side, so much of it gets into that whole larger debate about automation and, you know, whether that ends up being in that positive for employees or not, you know, is another raging debate. So, you know, I guess what I keep coming back to is what is going to drive this three percent growth forecast? CAPEX is only going to increase if consumer spending is there to meet the -- you know, increase the demand for the products that companies are going to --BARTIROMO: Even with the extra money saved after the tax plan?POMBOY: Well, yours -- your poll, I'm jumping ahead here, but your poll asked people what are they going to do with the tax cuts and 61 percent are either going to pay bills or save it. I think only eight percent said they were actually going to spend the tax cuts. So, I think your poll really speaks loudly to the situation households are in. They don't have as much discretionary spending to throw around.BARTIROMO: I just -- I just want to -- I want to point out this headline that we're getting right now, Qualcomm is rejecting Broadcom's latest offer of $82 a share. Qualcomm and Broadcom obviously have been talking about a deal. Is that one place that you think companies will spend money on deals, Stephanie, given the fact we are seeing these savings from the tax cut?POMBOY: Yes, we've seen a ton of deal activity, and I think, you know, when you think about the broader inflation picture, that's a -- that's really setting the kindling for a major inflation problem down the road because you're setting up these oligopolies and monopolies in industry after industry. And obviously, at some point, you know, Amazon, for example, can say, you know what, we're going to raise prices at Whole Foods. We own the whole market now, so we can -- we can do that. So, I mean, obviously, that's the direction they're going right now.(CROSSTALK)FREEMAN: But everyone has been disinflationary at this point, right?BARTIROMO: Absolutely.POMBOY: Yes, but I think what they're doing is they're smart, they're setting up basically these oligopolies in various sectors. And at some point, they control markets.MCDOWELL: Well, we can't raise prices at a supermarket like that, the treats -- it tricks the customers so badly and it's quite frankly in need of a massive overhaul, but you raised the issue of the Federal Reserve, so you don't think that consumer inflation is a big of a problem that the bond market overreacted to the Fed potentially raising short-term interest rates faster. However, do you have the Federal Reserve that's reducing its balance sheet, that it's -- that built-in demands that the bond market has had that the Treasury market, the U.S. Treasury has had for bonds, and shorter term instruments for years is disappearing.POMBOY: Right.MCDOWELL: And that balance sheet, if they're going to let $400 billion, 420 this year roll off, doesn't that automatically send longer-term interest rates higher?POMBOY: Well, I think there are two sides of the story. One, I think it's -- this is the story in my view. You know, we've been focused on fiscal policy and the tax cut to the exclusion of what's happening on the monetary side. And $420 billion, you know, the multiplier on the Fed's queue, the increase in the balance sheet was about 3.7 times. So, every dollar they expended, their balance sheet credit increased $3.70. And that has a huge ripple effect for the economy, obviously, because this economy thrives on credit fuel in the tank.So, as they're taking 420 billion out, I mean, it's probably incorrect to assume that math works the same in reverse, but we're talking about what would be $1-1/2 trillion in reduced credit growth, which is huge for an economy that actually is consuming more credit to go each additional mile. So, that's a huge story that no one is really talking about. And the idea is we don't have to worry about it because it's been clearly telegraphed, it's quantifiable, it's on a schedule, and therefore, it somehow doesn't have an impact. And I think that's totally wrong and that the decrease in credit growth is going to be a huge headwind for the economy that really offsets a lot of the stimulus from the tax cuts.MCDOWELL: Does it result in a deflation or basically a bursting of these asset bubbles, because again, it was all this monetary policy, it resulted in asset bubbles but it never really wound up in the pockets of the people who we grew up with, any of like the real people in this country.POMBOY: Exactly.MCDOWELL: Does it hurt the -- hurt them or does it just hurt the speculators?POMBOY: Well, I think there are two -- there are two prongs to this. Obviously, there's the Q.T. part now and the interest rate part. And on the quantitative tightening, I think, you know, clearly, Q.E. was designed to increase credit and spur the appetite for risk by punishing people for seeking safety in cash. So, why wouldn't Q.T. do exactly the opposite? It would reward people for being less risk or more risk averse, let's say. They would favor cash versus buying a junk bond at six percent, and it would reduce the supply of credit.On the consumer -- on the economy side, they have been feeling the impact of higher rates since the Fed started tightening in 2015, but you know, for all of us who traffic on Wall Street, we have been watching high-yield bonds, investment-grade bonds, go down in the face of Fed tightening, and Treasuries basically going nowhere. So, we view tightening as had no impact. Meanwhile, consumer debt service has moved up sharply because mortgage rates, credit cards, auto loans, all of that has followed the tightening.FREEMAN: So, I would say the supply-side stimulus, tax cuts, deregulation is kind of our only hope to manage this transition. I know you're generally pessimistic but are you a little encouraged that maybe the impact of the tax cuts on businesses is a little better than you thought or that it might have been?BARTIROMO: Unless the market sells off.POMBOY: Well, this is the thing, this is the problem now, is we're in this catch 22. Let me just say this, I think it's a blessing that we go into this situation with the administration we have now that's so pro-business, that's out there slashing regulation, that's enacted this tax cut, and hopefully, it's going to go back to the well and try to do more. Let's see. And once we get the immigration stuff and whatnot taken care of. But I think that is a huge positive. It -- at least the White House isn't operating in contravention from what we're trying to achieve here. Now, we got someone on our team. But like Maria said, I think the biggest risk now to the economy is the stock market. If we have a repeat of the 2008 sort of collapse in financial assets, that's going to blow back to economy hard.BARTIROMO: So, that will eliminate the savings of the tax plan you believe?POMBOY: Well, just a 10 percent sustained decline in the stock market, the wealth effect from that eliminates a hundred billion in spending, that's the tax cut increase for the year right there.BARTIROMO: All right. We'll take -- talk more about that, it's important stuff, Stephanie Pomboy. We'll take a break. When we come back, disturbing new details out of Parkland, Florida. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. New details this morning in the Parkland, Florida school shooting. Officials say that the gunman confessed to the killings and revealed important details on the timeline. Fox News' Rob Schmitt with the very latest on the ground in Parkland right now. Rob, good morning to you.ROB SCHMITT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Maria, good morning. You can see behind me as the sun comes up, the scene, a lot of it is still kind of frozen in time from right after when this happened about 40 hours ago. You still see the cars in the parking lot, the scene is still being processed here, and what happened inside. And, yes, we are getting a look at a very disturbed young man, a very sick individual who said that the demons in his head told him to do this. And a timeline of exactly how this went down has also been made available to us.Police saying that on Wednesday, on Valentine's Day when this happened at 2:06 in the afternoon, this 19-year-old took an Uber to the school, by 2:21, he was in the building, and he started firing on the first and second floor inside classrooms, then moved up to the third floor where he dropped the gun, and then blended in with students as they left the building in a panic to get out of the way of the bullets to try and escape.Thousands of kids go to the school, something like 3,000 students in this school. He escaped with them and at by 2:50, he was at a nearby Wal-Mart where he bought a soda at a subway. And then by about 2:00 -- about 3:01, he was at McDonald's, he hung out there for a little bit. And then by 3:41, he was arrested without incident by a police officer who was just paying close attention. So, he knew what he was looking for. Found this young man in neighborhood not too far away.Had first court appearance yesterday afternoon, had a public defender standing next to him consoling him. He looked very timid, very afraid, not what you'd expect to see of somebody that committed such a heinous act. That's for sure. And that public defender then came out of that hearing, and showed a lot of compassion for her clients who -- and let's listen to that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MELISA MCNEIL, PUBLIC DEFENDER: He's a broken human being, he's a broken child. This sadness that this community is feeling, I mean, my children, are -- they go to school in this community. I feel horrible for these families and Mr. Cruz feels that pain.(END VIDEO CLIP)SCHMITT: A tremendous amount of sympathy there and compassion for somebody that just did such a horrible act. There were a lot of missed warning signs that we've been talking about all morning, Maria, and that's what will have to be analyzed now, is exactly how all this was able to come together into such a horrible event when so many people say that they saw something like this coming. We'll send it back to you.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's pretty incredible. Rob, thank you. Rob Schmitt with the latest there. We'll take a break. When we come back, we're taking a look at data, delivering your data. Top security firm now warning an unsecured FedEx server could have exposed thousands of customer's personal information. Then a discovery that is truly out of this world, astronauts have now located nearly 100 new planets outside of the solar system! Back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, a high school student has been arrested for allegedly plotting to attack a high school. Police are thanking his grandmother. Cheryl Casone with the details now and headlines -- Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR: Yes, Maria. So, this is 18-year-old Joshua Alexander O'Connor. He's behind bars today because his grandmother called authorities after seeing an entry in his journal. It reportedly detailed plans to shoot students and use homemade explosive devices at Aces High School event in Everett, that's about 30 miles from Seattle. The grandmother also discovered a rifle stored in a guitar case. Authorities arrested O'Connor at the school where he was found carrying marijuana and a knife.Well, the SEC has blocked the sale of the Chicago Stock Exchange to a group led by Chinese investors over security concerns related to the Chinese government, but the Chicago Stock Exchange claims the Chinese government is not involved in the deal. Some critics say that letting a Chinese company take a major stake in the exchange would create a backdoor for the government to influence the American financial infrastructure. I should add here, the Chicago Stock Exchange handles only 0.5 percent of trades of U.S.-based equities.Well, FedEx, the latest big company to get hacked. The company says an unsecured cloud server was breached, it exposed thousands of customers' personal information, including passport numbers, drivers' licenses, and security IDs. The breached data belonged to Bongo International which FedEx actually bought back in 2014, it's now FedEx Cross Border. FedEx says the sever has, at least, been secured for now. Shares of FedEx up about 25 percent from just the last year. Bless you. Bless your chart.And then finally this, it's kind of fun, NASA's K2 mission has discovered 95 new planets beyond our solar system. The latest haul captured by the Kepler spacecraft, an international team of scientists studied 275 possible exoplanets. 95 were found to be entirely new. More exoplanets mean more opportunities to study different types of atmosphere, saying if they have molecules similar to ones that are found here on Earth, Maria. So, nice pictures for you. Those are your headlines.BARTIROMO: All right. Cheryl, thank you so much. I want to get to this breaking news right now, Mitt Romney has made it official, he is just tweeting out right now, "I am running for the U.S. Senate to serve the people of Utah and bring Utah's values to Washington." Mitt Romney running for the Senate, and that is, of course, the seat that Orrin Hatch occupied, and Orrin Hatch has announced that he is stepping down. So, Mitt Romney is out there, officially running for a Utah Senate (INAUDIBLE)FREEMAN: Should be interesting. He's got an interesting relationship with the President.BARTIROMO: He's been a never -- he was a Never Trumper.FREEMAN: But before that, he -- and I -- and I remember Mrs. Romney thanking Donald Trump for his support in 2012. So, there's some flexibility here.BARTIROMO: I mean, I think that the President wanted Orrin Hatch to say for that reason, everybody figured Mitt Romney would take the seat and maybe he wouldn't be as agreeable to President Trump. Obviously, that didn't happen, Orrin Hatch announced he's stepping down and Mitt Romney is running for that seat.MCDOWELL: And Orrin Hatch was a very great politician in terms of pushing things through. Remember, he worked with Ted Kennedy in the 1990s, passed CHIP, the Children's Health Insurance Program. He was a -- he was a force in getting tax reform done on the Senate. And get in -- and pulling those votes to yes last year.FREEMAN: Yes. And not very similar to the President in terms of personal style, but I think he really did appreciate not just the legislative agenda but the judicial picks from the President. I think that really won over Mr. Hatch and maybe that'll cause Mr. Romney to be a little more amendable this time around.MCDOWELL: I'm curious to see what President Trump says about Mitt Romney and this campaign that he is up. Is he here to be friend or foe?BARTIROMO: Well, exactly. Well --MCDOWELL: Because he loves Twitter at 6:00 a.m.BARTIROMO: We -- we'll see about that. All right. We'll take a break. When we come back, no deal after a week of debate, the Senate rejects three immigration measures including a bipartisan proposal that President Trump vowed to veto. The message for some Republicans, it's now or never.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There's some crazy people around here. Just shut them out. This is the best shot you'll ever get.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The fate of the so-called DREAMers now in the balance ahead of March 5th, and that is the deadline. That's next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Friday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Friday, February 16th. Your top stories right now, 8:30 a.m. on the east coast: The immigration debate hitting a wall, Senators failed to strike a deal despite a bipartisan push to provide a pathway to citizenship for DREAMers and provide billions of dollars in security for the border. Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle voicing their frustration after the votes fell through.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We've waited a long time and worked very hard for the chance to vote on a bill to protect DREAMers. I regret that the only bipartisan effort of the group of moderate senators to come up with a bipartisan compromise couldn't get the necessary 60 votes.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I just don't get it, it's not fair to the American people, it's not fair to the DACA immigrants, it's not fair to anybody. I mean, we just wasted an entire week.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The very latest on the DACA fight, coming up. Plus, I will be talking with Attorney General Jeff Sessions this weekend about the immigration debate and a lot more. "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES" join us on the Fox News Channel at 10:00 a.m. Eastern this Sunday. Mitt Romney has made it official this morning. Just moments ago, Mr. Romney tweeted this, "I am running for the U.S. Senate to serve the people of Utah and bring Utah's values to Washington." Mitt Romney running for Orrin Hatch's seat. How this -- his bid could shake up Congress coming up this morning?Meanwhile, the rally rolls on in terms of markets. Markets closed in the green for a fifth day in a row yesterday. The Dow was up 300 plus points 1-1/4 percent. NASDAQ was up 1-2/3 percent. The momentum is continuing this morning. We're just getting housing starts underway, hitting the tape right now, and it is better than expected. The markets are up but well off of the highs of the morning. Dow Industrials expected to be up 16 points. We have been up a lot more earlier, better than 40 points. Earnings, the focus on Wall Street, of course, Coca-Cola is trading up after beating expectations on earnings and revenue, stock is up 2-1/2 percent. That is a Dow component. That will be important for the market opening this morning.In Europe, green across the board. Take a look at the indices there, where we see money moving into stocks. The FT-100 up 50 points, CAC Quarante up 50 points, and the DAX Index higher by 65, that's one half of one percent. In Asia overnight, the major markets were closed for the Lunar New Year Holiday except for Japan. Japan was up better than one percent on the Nikkei Average.And in the box office Marvell, the King of Wakanda poised to rule the theatres this weekend. The stunning amount "Black Panther" is expected to bring in just on opening weekend. We've got that for you coming up. But first, this news this half an hour, immigration reform stalling, Senators failed to pass a compromise on any of the possible three bills that could have passed, with the President's proposal getting the least support. Blake Burman is at the White House right now with the very latest -- Blake.BLAKE BURMAN, FBN WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Maria, good morning to you. One Senator described this as a crash and burn experience, and even that might be generous, because this was a failure for the United States Senate but also this was a failure for this White House as well. Three different proposals that were taken up yesterday by the Senate, did not get the necessary 60 votes. And now, the White House is pointing the finger at Democrats.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It exposes Democrats for what they are, people who use politics and put that over people, because quite frankly, this is a fix for DACA that they've been dying for, for a long time, and the President gave them three times what President Obama offered them, and for whatever reason, they still don't want it.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURMAN: However, the problem for this White House is the plan that got the least amount of support was the one that was supported by the President. The President's framework picking up just 39 votes in the Senate, 21 short of what they needed and 15 votes shy of that bipartisan measure that would have given money to the wall and also protection for DREAMers. Here was Chuck Schumer on the Senate floor.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER: There's only one reason why the Senate will be unable to reach a bipartisan solution to DACA, President Trump. If there was ever a time for Presidential leadership, this was it. President Trump has failed this test of leadership spectacularly.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURMAN: Bottom line here, Maria, is there are a whole lot of questions now going forward. You've got the Senate in an apparent stalemate. The House will get to take this up also but the measure that is promoted by conservatives there is what was just essentially voted down in the Senate. And then you've got this March 5th deadline in which the protections expire for DREAMers, but then there's also the courts who have weighed in on that, saying, well, the administration cannot necessarily unwind DACA. Where this goes from here, really anyone's guess. Maria?BARTIROMO: All right. We are -- we are watching it. Blake, thank you. Blake Burman is at the White House this morning. Joining us right now to talk more about that is New York Congressman, Tom Reed. Good to see you, Congressman, thanks for joining us. What's your reaction to what took place?REP. TOM REED (R), NEW YORK: Well, you know, I've also watched the Senate like everyone else, and the problem is that you got to get six more votes, and it's incumbent upon the Senate to resolve this issue. And they came up short, and they should keep working at it in my humble opinion.BARTIROMO: Well, should the President keep working at it? I mean, the Wall -- I don't know if you -- surely, you've seen The Wall Street Journal op-ed this morning, titled "President Miller's Immigration Veto." And the editorial board blames the President for being inflexible on immigration for the failure. They write this, "Whatever --REED: Oh, Maria, I can -- I can --BARTIROMO: Here's what they write, "Whatever happened to the art of the deal, if Mr. Trump isn't happy with everything in the Collins-Rounds bill, why not engage, why not negotiate, Congressman?REED: Well, I think, absolutely, we've been doing this in the problem solver (INAUDIBLE) for example, we went to the White House, had numerous conversations with the White House. Coming up with a bipartisan proposal that hopefully can see the light of day in the House. But we'll -- I think you have to wait until on the Senate to act. And I think the White House wants to do a deal here, they want to get to a yes, but they came up six short on the closest package. They're going to keep working at this, and the bottom line is this also tells me that maybe what's going on here behind the scenes, they don't want to solve it. Democrats, Republicans, they want to keep it alive as a campaign issue because for whatever reason, they think it appeases their base and their extreme politics.FREEMAN: Well, I guess that's the thing. James Freeman here with The Journal. In terms of trying to figure out what the President's goal here is or his bottom line, it seems like he could have had the deal this week with wall funding, with enforcement, especially against criminals who are here illegally with some limits on what he calls chain migration. Is he just not going to be satisfied until he reduces substantially even legal immigration?REED: No, I don't believe so. I mean, obviously, you're touching on some issues that need to be addressed, but you also are going down the path of comprehensive immigration reform, and that's not really what we're talking about here. We're trying to fix the problem for the DREAMers, mitigate it so it doesn't happen again in the future, and deal with our border security to make sure that we keep American citizens safe.And I think there's a deal there, and I think the White House knows there's a deal there. But the Senate isn't getting the 60. And I would put the question out there to the American people, this is probably more about politics. What do you think about it? Because I think they could have solved it but they don't want to. And that's where leadership needs to step up and take the lead and get this done for not only these kids but keep our citizens safe by securing our border.FREEMAN: Well, I mean, he is the President. In terms of leadership, isn't -- doesn't he have some responsibility here to try and get that 60?REED: Oh, you -- and you've seen him bring folks down, brought Chuck Schumer down, brought Nancy Pelosi down to the White House, I think they're in communication, but it also shows a tremendous amount of dysfunction in the U.S. Senate. You know, I've been a long advocate for removing that 60- vote barrier down to 51, but the fact is they have to get to 60 votes. That is where compromise in the Senate right now -- if they really wanted to get it done, I am confident they would have. Maybe what's going on here is a little bit more about politics than substance.MCDOWELL: But in the Senate, Congressman, the amendment that had best chance of bipartisan support and passing was shot down by the administration in a mid-morning statement, even though it handed the Trump administration a lot of wins on immigration, so the very amendment that had the best shot of passing the Trump administration and The Journal suggests that it's all Steven Miller with hands on the wheel. Basically because it doesn't restrict legal immigration.REED: Yes, the point is, Maria, it still didn't get 60, so I don't care if you get 54, I don't care if you get one vote, it didn't get 60. So, the problem is on the U.S. Senate. If they want to show that they can lead and solve this problem for those DREAMers as well as keep our American citizens safe by fixing some of our border problems, then they'll get it taken care of, but I just don't think that will is there because this is more about politics than actually solving problems. I hope. Maybe they will.BARTIROMO: So, is it just -- is it just -- is it just his way or the highway? I mean, that's what we're talking about.REED: Oh, absolutely not.BARTIROMO: Yes, we know it takes 60 votes. The President is the leader of the free world, is he going to help to get to 60 votes by giving something, giving in on something? The Art -- what happened to "The Art Of The Deal"?REED: Oh, I think -- look at where they've moved -- look at where they've already moved, Maria. Look at where they've recognized, they give citizenship positions for DREAMer kids, you're seeing great movement there. That was even -- he was offering more citizen opportunity to DREAMers than President Obama. This is a significant move to get a deal done, and I think the opportunity is there, they just have to keep working at it.BARTIROMO: I want to switch gears, ask you about the Florida school shooting because the gun control debate obviously has been reignited on Capitol Hill. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi says that the victims are paying for the price, paying the price of lawmakers' inaction. Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy said that Congress needs to get off of its butt and do something. Where do you stand on this?REED: You know, I'm a firm believer in our second amendment rights and I think if you're going to attack this problem by limiting those rights and taking away our freedoms, I don't think they're going to get to a solution, nor do I think it moves the needle on solving this problem. First and foremost, these are horrific tragedies, there's not a human being in Congress that doesn't want to solve this issue for our kids, and including myself. My hearts goes out to these families, goes out to these folks. What we need to be focused on, let's have a substance conversation about how do we deal with mental health in our communities, how do we get these individuals, not only the treatment, but how do we get the medical community to embrace it as a medical condition where there can be a cure for this mental illness.And in the meantime, we got to make sure those resources are there, so the treatment occurs, remove these threats to us, as citizens from our society. That is a very difficult proposal and that's why it hasn't happened, because people don't want to take on the hard issues, they want to take on the object which is a gun, a knife, or a weapon. Taking on the issue to address the human health -- mental health component is significantly harder.BARTIROMO: Well, we've been talking about that and the fact that this administration rescinded an important rule a year ago. And you know, why rescind something where, you know, it precludes someone with mental health issues getting a gun?REED: And what are you doing about that individual's mental health condition that raises the issue to begin with? What are we doing? Now, we have put money in regards to National Institute of Health, we have put resources in prioritized treating mental health, but we have to go to the next step. We have to talk about cures for mental illness because it is a medical condition. It's just like cancer in my humble opinion. It is a disease, it is an illness that needs to find a cure but in the meantime, we need to make sure there's treatment there, and as you're going through the treatment, if there's a threat to our fellow American citizens, especially our children, we need to mitigate that threat, and that is a difficult path to take.BARTIROMO: Yes, I know that. We know that. And there were threats, that's the thing. There were threats. He said it on YouTube. He said I want to be a school shooter. I mean, there were threats so obviously there were mistakes here. But look, we want to -- you want to say something, Dagen, real quick, because we're going to move subjects.MCDOWELL: No, I think one of the (INAUDIBLE) have been. Do you believe -- do you believe in a database put together of people who are being treated by psychiatrics, doctors, who have mental health issues who should not own guns? Do you -- do you back that?REED: Well, I'll go one step further. I'll go one step further. Maybe we need to have a database and to have some type of supervision of these individuals, so that we make sure we know where they are until they get the treatment and get illness cured, so that they can be a safe member of society.BARTIROMO: Who's supervising? The government, the family?MCDOWELL: Yes. But you know what, you -- the Republicans --REED: That's the hard issue right there.BARTIROMO: Yes, who's going to supervise that? I mean --MCDOWELL: The Republicans are upset that gun control regulations at the federal level basically defy the second amendment rights of every Americans, however, that also violates somebody's civil liberty.BARTIROMO: That's right.MCDOWELL: You're going to -- what, are you going to install a chip in some individual who is diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and track them around --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Yes, and who's tracking, some government bureaucrats tracking them?REED: Now, you're getting -- now, you're getting to the heart of the debate.BARTIROMO: Yes. Let me move on because I'm not sure we're going to get answers on this topic here, but Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin (INAUDIBLE) with your committee, House Ways & Means, and he said that the President feels strongly about taxing online purchases. Where do you stand on an online sales tax, sir?REED: I lost your audio there.BARTIROMO: Oh, OK. Online sales tax, what do you think about it?REED: Oh, I think there is an opportunity for us to solve this, this to me a question of fairness, this is a question treating our brick-and-mortar folks on main street across America the same as our online retailers. And I think this was almost solved a couple years ago bearing some hard work we did and we are very supportive of trying to find a solution to make sure that the tax that's being imposed is collected fairly across all retailers.FREEMAN: All right. Congressman, as you know giant retailers like Amazon are already collecting in most of the country because they have physical presence all over the place with their warehouses, there's something like 10,000 taxing jurisdictions in the United States, when you count city, states, localities, are every -- is every one of these 10,000 going to be able to reach outside their borders, tax, and audited small people trying to operate a Web-based business?REED: What you're looking at is where is the tax collected, where is the tax imposed. And you're going to have taxes crossing state lines, you're going to -- on the internet, you're going to have destination-type issues to be resolved, but you can do it. And what you don't get on one transaction, you're going to pick up on another transaction. The fact is the mechanism need to be deployed, the technology needs to be deployed to account for where these taxes are, get them in the right hands of the tax and jurisdictions that do rely upon them and need them. And then also rightfully entitled to them.BARTIROMO: Congressman, real quick, Stephanie Pomboy is a very high-end economist here. She just made a comment. I want to ask you your thoughts on it. Do you agree that a 10-percent selloff in the stock market basically wipes away the benefits of the tax plan, a sustained 10 percent decline? That's what you said, right, Stephanie?POMBOY: Yes.REED: Yes. No, I don't believe that's the case because long term, I'm looking at tax reform in the long term, not short term market type of impacts. But what I am concerned about with the market sell-off is, is this the day of reckoning? Is this the debt crises starting to go off where the investors recognize with interest rates going up, and no fiscal accountability in Washington, D.C., now with the tax reform plus the uncontrolled spending being added to it, is this that debt crisis that's causing a lot of uncertainty in the marketplace?BARTIROMO: You said it, I didn't, out of control spending. Thanks for that, Congressman.(LAUGHTER)REED: That's why I voted against the bill last week.BARTIROMO: You know what, one of the few. Thank you, Congressman. We're going to talk more about that.REED: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Next time you come back, we got to talk about spending. Thank you for joining us, Congressman Tom Reed. Be sure to tune in Sunday morning on Fox News Channel. I'll be talking with Jeff Sessions, the Attorney General on "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES" over on the Fox News Channel. But first right here on Fox --BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Coco-Cola shares climbing this morning after the company reported fourth quarter earnings that were above expectations. We are looking for a pretty good rally at the start of trading. Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York stock exchange now. Nic, good morning.NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN ANCHOR: Good Friday morning to you, Maria. We're watching Coca-Cola this morning pretty upside after a beat on both the top and bottom line. And the last eight quarters is beaten seven of those quarters, it's up 1-1/2 percent right now over the last 52 weeks. Up about 8-1/2 percent. When we think of Coca-Cola, you think of Fanta and Diet Coke and some of those fun sodas but it was really the other areas that did well for Coke and that would be the vitamin water, the (INAUDIBLE) or coffee, the teas. That's really where they saw the strength. And they did see strength in North America which offset some losses in other areas. So, globally, it was pretty much unchanged. But a beat on the top and bottom line helps Coca-cola moved to the upside this morning.Then, we take a look at another big one and that is Wal-Mart. And this is that Wal-Mart is in talks to buy more than 40 percent of India's Flipkart. Flipkart is the idea of Amazon and this -- to take on Amazon directly which Amazon had said it's willing to commit about five billion dollars in India's market. And this would help Wal-Mart to take on Amazon because in this -- in India, Flipkart has about 40 percent of online retail. They have two huge fashion lines in addition to so many other products and is thinking about expanding into groceries. Wal-Mart has been a real winner up about 50 percent over the last year. And you can see at this morning, the bid/ask is on the upside as well so they're looking into buying more shares of this one and having a deal with Flipkart, which then would be the biggest -- one of the biggest overseas deals and its valued at roughly just over $12 billion but the terms of the deal are not being disclosed. Maria?BARTIROMO: All right. Thank you so much, Nichole. We'll be watching this market if they open, certainly.Turning to tax policy out of Washington, President Trump, his openness to an online tax, consumption taxes. Under the discussion is possible $0.25 increase in a gasoline tax, implementing in online sales tax.Joining us now to weigh in all of that, a host of "VARNEY & COMPANY", Stuart Varney. Hey, Stu. We just got through a tax cut plan and now this.STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST: It's intriguing, isn't it? Because I don't expect we're going to get a consumption tax, and then, a gas tax, and the online sales tax. And that's pretty farfetched but the very (INAUDIBLE) that they're discussion is intriguing because it's a shift. Now, currently, we tax income and we tax businesses, we tax profits. But now, we're thinking about taxing consumption. In other words, what we buy. I don't -- again, I don't expect this to go through but this is a radical shift in our tax policy. It's an indication of where we are going in the future.Look, you don't win popularity contests by putting up a price of gas or charging an online sales tax, which used to be free. You don't win a popularity contest but you do bring in extra revenue for the treasury. You might not have to borrow so much from China and that probably looks good.BARTIROMO: Yes.VARNEY: Again, I don't expect it to happen but it's a shift.BARTIROMO: Well, a shift because you're talking about out of control spending and they've got to do something in terms of getting --VARNEY: That's what I'd like. I mean, we'd all likes spending cuts or the reform of Social Security.BARTIROMO: Right.VARNEY: The reform of Medicare.BARTIROMO: Exactly.VARNEY: But that's not on the table.BARTIROMO: I know you want to talk about this in about nine minutes time, Stu.VARNEY: Sure.BARTIROMO: We'll see you then.VARNEY: You will.BARTIROMO: "VARNEY & COMPANY" begins top of the hour right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Join Stuart at 9:00 A.M.Coming up, the most tweeted about movie of the year landed in theatres this weekend. "Black Panther" set to break box office records this weekend. Did you know Marvel almost gave up all the movie rights to the Sony? Back in a minute with that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What happens now determines what happens to the rest of the world.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: There it is. The year's biggest movie. "Black Panther", finally hitting theatres today not only is it getting rave reviews. You heard Michael Tammero earlier. It's also the most tweeted about movie of 2018. Lauren Simonetti with all the details now.Good morning, Lauren.LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN ANCHOR: At Presidents' Day weekend, we are talking about what could be a $200-million opening. One of the largest, not only for a holiday weekend, but the largest opened ever. Because "Black Panther" -- it's a pretty good story and it's got a great backstory. So, let me take you back 20 years ago.Marvel is bankrupt at the time. They tried to sell movie rights to all of its sup5eroes, so Black Panther, Spiderman, Iron Man, the whole thing for $25 million. But buyer Sony, they only wanted Spiderman and they eventually got it for $10 million but to think the mistakes that you make in hindsight. So, if you fast forward to 2010, Disney comes in, they've swooped up all of Marvel for $4 billion, but look, this is what they did with it. 17 blockbusters and counting.Here are the biggest money makers: "The Avengers" back in 2012, global box office, $1-1/2 billion; "Iron Man 3;" "Captain America;" "Spider-Man," which Marvel actually wound up producing for Sony -- long story, all in the top five with about $1 billion. And now, we're talking about the "Black Panther". It's the movie that is rooted in black culture, mostly black cast, and it is about to become a global blockbuster. To think Sony once said, nobody really care about a B- list character like the Black Panther. Everyone cares about it right now. It is the most tweeted movie of the year. It's got its own emojis on Twitter. (INAUDIBLE) she tweet this, here's her character. (INAUDIBLE) and then Killmonger. He has another emoji. He's the villain played by Michael B. Jordan. Rotten Tomatoes says this is the most satisfying comic- book adversary since Heath Ledger's Joker. So, the review -- I haven't found of that review.BARTIROMO: It's incredible.SIMONETTI: I know.BARTIROMO: Yes, and then, the acquisitions that Disney made --SIMONETTI: Really paying off.BARTIROMO: The animation acquisitions were incredible.MCDOWELL: They saved the "Star Wars" franchise by getting away from George Lucas who (INAUDIBLE) --BARTIROMO: Right.MCDOWELL: -- the cost of destroying it.BARTIROMO: He was.(CROSSTALK)BANFIELD: And then he -- and then he made comments like he didn't like where it went. Meanwhile, it was a huge success. Remember George Lucas made some comments he didn't like where they were taking it?SIMONETTI: And the Marvel's strategy with all of this is not just what's on the screen but what the kids actually play with. So the retail own it, too.BARTIROMO: That's the Disney way. It really is. Lauren, thank you. Lauren Simonetti.Final thoughts on this all-star panel next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, final thoughts. Stephanie Pomboy?POMBOY: I'd be watching data for the next few weeks to see if the fever breaks here in terms of the consumer --BARTIROMO: You think it's going to break, you just said?POMBOY: I do.BARTIROMO: All right. Stephanie Pomboy, James Freeman, Dagen, McDowell. Have a great weekend, everybody. Here's Stuart and "VARNEY & COMPANY".Load-Date: February 16, 2018End of Document

All Rights ReservedSection: COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENTLength: 1054 wordsBodyNEW YORK, Jan.  03, 2018  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NetworkNewsAudio, via NetworkNewsWire ("NNW"), a multifaceted financial news and publishing company that delivers a new generation of social communication solutions for business, today announces the online availability of its interview with ChineseInvestors.com (OTCQB:CIIX), a leading financial information website for Chinese-speaking investors in the United States and China that is also laying the groundwork to capitalize on unprecedented opportunities in the cryptocurrency and cannabis sectors.The interview can be heard at http://nnw.fm/ciix-interview-jan-2018                                                                                                                                        Kicking off the interview, Kraig Rasmussen introduces ChineseInvestors.com CEO and founder Warren Wang, whose 20 years of experience in the financial markets industry includes management, projectdevelopment, sales, marketing, accounting and administration. Wang reviews the company's history, describes several recent successes and shares plans for a prosperous 2018.                     "After I left the investment banking firm, I decided to establish a Chinese language content, commentary and analysis (service) because I believed Chinese investors would be the richest group in the world," Wang says, noting his prediction came true once the Chinese government opened the country's doors to "the world's people" in 2000.                          ChineseInvestors.com now has more than 60 employees with offices in Shanghai, China, California and New York. Through its primary website, www.ChineseInvestors.com, CIIX offers a variety of investor education products and services, including real-time market commentary, analysis and educational related services in Chinese language character sets; consultative services to smaller private companies considering becoming a public company; and advertising and public relations related support services.                                              "Any assets people are trading with, we provide content and commentary," Wang says. "The most interesting part we are involved with is cryptocurrency. It's very, very hot right now, basically because Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen said cryptocurrency is an emerging digital asset  :We think that's a tremendous opportunity (for us) to establish a cryptocurrency division."                                                                The company's recent installation of a Bitcoin ATM at its headquarters in San Gabriel, California, provides the perfect illustration to Wang's assessment that interest is high in cryptocurrencies.                           "A lot of people are showing interest with large transactions through that machine," Wang says. "That's the first one in a Chinese community in the United States."                                             CIIX is also leveraging its financial expertise by entering the cannabidiol or CBD oil industry within China, offering hemp-infused skin care products there. Wang noted the endeavor has been so successful the company is spinning off its subsidiary - CBD Biotechnology and ChineseHempOil.com, Inc.    with the intention of listing the new company's common stock on the OTCQB. The company's core market of Chinese-speaking investors continues to request more information about CIIX's plans to enter the cryptocurrency sector, Wang said, adding shareholders can easily get more information by logging onto the company's website.                                                                    "I am still very excited about that and what we are doing," Wang says in conclusion. "There is a huge demand from the Chinese community who are trying to learn what this digital asset is all about, so this gives us a tremendous opportunity to bring revenue and possibilities to our shareholders."                                                                             About ChineseInvestors.com                                               Founded in 1999, ChineseInvestors.com endeavors to be an innovative company providing: (a) real-time market commentary, analysis, and educational related services in Chinese language character sets (traditional and simplified); (b) advertising and public relation related support services; and (c) retail, online and direct sales of hemp-based products and other health related products.

(OTCQB:CIIX), a client of NNW.To view the full publication, titled "Cryptocurrency Finds Security Amid Underlying Mutual Distrust Common Between Trading Partners," visit: https://www.networknewswire.com/cryptocurrency-finds-security-amid-underlying-mutual-distrust-common-trading-partners/                                                                    ChineseInvestors.com (CIIX) provides innovation in real-time market analysis and educational services in Chinese language character sets, support services for advertising and public relations, and the sale of hemp-based products and other health-related products. Despite China's prohibitions on trading cryptocurrencies as a regulated central exchange, company CEO Warren Wang stated in an interview last month that many Chinese investors are trading them legally on unregulated "over the counter" platforms that connect individuals to each other. And ChineseInvestors.com showed its own commitment to cryptocurrency by installing a Bitcoin ATM in the lobby of its San Gabriel, California, headquarters (http://nnw.fm/VIa3n). Wang called it the first such automated teller for cryptocurrency within the Chinese community in the United States and said it has generated a lot of traffic.                                                              China serves as an example of the mutual distrust that drives cryptocurrencies' prospects while relying on so-called "miners" to establish a level of trust in the legitimacy of the exchanges.                           Despite the lack of a regulated Chinese exchange to trade cryptocurrencies and what Wang referred to as the Chinese government's "badmouthing" of bitcoin though its official TV media outlet, the CEO said Chinese-speaking people within China and North America are very interested in buying, selling and trading bitcoin among themselves and he urged entrepreneurs to be patient as the community learns the ropes.                                                About ChineseInvestors.com                                               Founded in 1999, ChineseInvestors.com endeavors to be an innovative company providing: (a) real-time market commentary, analysis, and educational related services in Chinese language character sets (traditional and simplified); (b) advertising and public relation related support services; and (c) retail and online sales of hemp-based products and other health related products.

Tires Market Procurement Research - Market Trends and Spend Analysis by SpendEdgeBusiness WireJanuary 4, 2018 Thursday 8:15 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Business Wire, Inc.Distribution: Business Editors; Automotive WritersLength: 786 wordsDateline: LONDON BodyGlobal procurement intelligence advisory firm, SpendEdge , has announced the release of their '            Tires Market Procurement Research Report. ' The insights and data in this report provide a strategic analysis of the supply markets, factors influencing purchasing decisions, procurement best practices, pricing models, supplier landscape, and an analysis of the supplier capability matrix for the            components and spares industry . This report breaks down the data and analysis behind the procurement of tires and acts as an all-inclusive guide for making smart purchasing decisions.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180104005689/en/Global Tires Procurement Market Intelligence Report (Graphic: Business Wire)"The global demand for tires is expected to increase due to the growing passenger vehicle sales in developing countries and the rise in specialty vehicle sales across different industrial segments such as agricultural and mining sectors," says SpendEdge procurement analyst Tridib Bora. "Also, suppliers are increasingly investing in R&D to build tires that can provide value to their buyers by improving fuel efficiency and performance of their vehicles," added Tridib.Looking for more insights from this report? Request a free sample reportSpendEdge sample reports are free of charge and provide insights that focus on cost-saving aspects of procurement and optimization of category spend.Procurement analysts at SpendEdge highlight the following top three market trends that are contributing to the growth of the Global Tires Market:• Countries are promoting tire labeling regulations• Suppliers are trying to reduce rolling resistance in tires• Chinese government seeks a reduction in tire production through consolidationThis report is available at USD 1000 discount for a limited time only: View the report snapshot before purchasingCountries are promoting tire labeling regulations:Nations across various geographies are increasingly promoting tire labeling regulations that require manufacturers to mention factors such as wet grip rating, fuel efficiency, and external rolling noise performance. China has adopted labeling regulations based on EU label requirements, this only measures wet grip, fuel economy, and external noise. Adopting this practice enables the buyers and end-users to make informed purchasing decisions based on the labeling provided on tires.Suppliers are trying to reduce rolling resistance in tires:Reducing the rolling resistance of tires helps the tires to spin freely, which will result in the vehicle using less energy while moving forward. Suppliers across geographies are trying to maintain a balance between low resistance and endurance, as the cost of building a tire with less rolling resistance will be relatively higher. Using tires with low-rolling-resistivity also helps the buyers enhance vehicles' fuel efficiency. Moreover, with the improvements in technology, the buyers will not have to trade-off between low-resistance and quality of ride.Chinese government seeks a reduction in tire production through consolidation:China had been experiencing overcapacity in the tire sector. This overcapacity is a result of increased number of smaller tire manufacturers in the country, to consolidate the tire market in the country, the government plans to introduce stringent regulations on new tire manufacturers. Also, this will help them set high barriers for new entrants and small manufacturers, which might enable consolidation in the tire market in China. This helps to ensure that suppliers are compliant with regulations prevalent in their region of operation.Get unlimited access to all our reports.

Sizzling Crypto Market Invites Regulators' AttentionCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 11, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1187 wordsBody       Runaway trends in the price of cryptocurrencies have brought them under the regulators' scanner in several countries, clouding the outlook for what was touted as the next big thing after Internet. South Korea and China, which are among the most active markets for cryptocurrencies, are leading the list of countries that are initiating crackdown measures.  Latest on the regulation front was an announcement by South Korea on Thursday that the justice ministry is planning a legislation to curb the excessive speculation in the cryptocurrency market. The measures include a ban on all cryptocurrency exchanges in the country, thus effectively preventing trading in digital currencies.  "We have great concerns about virtual currency," Justice Minister Park Sang-ki said at a press conference. The ministry was preparing legislation that bans any transactions based on virtual currencies via exchanges, he added. The price of Bitcoin plunged as much as 14 percent to below $13,000 following the news. As of 8.06 am ET, Bitcoin was down 0.49 percent at $13.877.64 on coinbase. The total market cap of cryptocurrencies fell to $628.38 billion early Thursday, which was roughly $100 billion less than the level at the same time on Wednesday. Market cap recovered to $683.44 billion as of 8.13 am ET. There were also reports this week suggesting that Chinese authorities have stepped up their clampdown on cryptocurrencies. A multi-agency task force, apparently including the People's Bank of China, has asked provincial governments to "guide" companies in their regions to shutdown cryptocurrency mining activities, reports said citing various sources. Mining is the process using which new bitcoins are created by a competitive and decentralized process by individuals or groups of individuals using freely available special software to solve mathematical problems to verify and confirm each bitcoin transaction in a block.  Verified blocks are entered into the "blockchain" for others to accept. The first miner to solve the mathematical puzzle will receive new bitcoins as reward. But, Bitcoin mining is an expensive process requiring high processor speeds, time, and intensive use of electricity.  China mines more than three quarters of world's bitcoins as the country provides cheap electricity in several regions, and has a cooler climate that favors cryptocurrency mining.  In September last year, China had ordered a closure of bitcoin exchanges and banned initial coin offerings, or ICOs, a crypto-equivalent for the initial public offerings of shares. While the Chinese government makes huge investments in new era technology and wants to project the country as a hub for artificial intelligence and robotics, going forward, it seems not very interested in promoting cryptocurrencies.  One main concern China has about digital currencies is that these are decentralized and cannot be regulated. The government is also worried about the huge financial risks such a boom entails. In South Korea, the government has been voicing concerns over the past several months as the cryptocurrency surge gained steam despite severe falls in between. The country has witnessed intense interest in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, and several crypto exchanges are located there. Prices of cryptocurrencies in the South Korean market tend to be much higher than elsewhere, reportedly over 40 percent, as buyers exceed those willing to sell.  "Cryptocurrency trading has started to resemble gambling and speculation," Park said. The minister said foreign investors are considering the Korean trade in virtual currencies as abnormal due to the excessive prices relative to other markets across the world, a gap that is dubbed the "Kimchi premium", in an allusion to the famous Korean dish of spicy pickled cabbage. Different Korean market regulators have initiated a joint effort to curb the unbridled trading in cryptocurrencies.   At the start of the week, South Korea's Financial Intelligence Unit and Financial Services Commission launched a probe into six commercial banks, which were offering trading accounts to crytpocurrency exchanges in the country.  Joint inspections were planned for Woori Bank, Kookmin Bank, Shinhan Bank, NongHyup Bank, Industrial Bank of Korea and Korea Development Bank from Monday through Thursday. Officials said they wanted to check whether these banks complied with their anti-money laundering obligations in their transactions with cryptocurrency exchanges. They also wanted to inspect whether the banks have implemented appropriate measures to verify their customers' identification in regard with cryptocurrency trading. "Cryptocurrencies are highly likely to be used as a means to money laundering due to their nature of anonymity and non-face-to-face transaction," the FSC said.  Authorities hope that a shutdown of crytptocurrency exchanges would minimize side effects of cryptocurrency trading such as fraud using cryptocurrencies, cyber hacks on cryptocurrency exchanges, and irrationally overheated speculation.  As the so-called "virtual accounts" offered to cryptocurrency exchanges were making it more difficult to identify real names of account holders, the country is implementing new rules that will require real-name cryptocurrency transactions, starting January 20. Leading digital currency exchanges, Bithumb and Coinone, confirmed on Thursday that tax authorities had visited their offices. The number of accounts linked to cryptocurrency exchanges totaled 111 with a combined deposit value estimated around 2 trillion won or $1.8 billion, Yonhap, a South Korean news agency, reported. More than 2 million Koreans own digital currencies. Late December, the South Korean government had said that it was planning to implement special measures to curb speculation in the virtual currency market.  The country has sought deeper co-operation with regulators in China and Japan in curbing intense speculation in cryptocurrencies.  Virtual currencies have been around for nearly a decade with the Bitcoin, the largest digital currency in value that transacts on the blockchain network, emerging in 2009. Over the years, several new avatars of crytpocurrencies came into view such as Ether that works on the Ethereum protocol, and Ripple that run on the RippleNet payment system. In its initial years, cryptocurrencies, mainly Bitcoin, were seen as something reserved for geeks and tech junkies. Later, its emerged as a darling of the darknet, thanks to the perceived anonymity assigned to it.  It is the recent surge in prices of cryptocurrencies that caught the attention of regulators whose main fear is that an asset bubble is looming.  Billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who is the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, has warned that cryptocurrencies are set to have a bad ending and he would not bet any money on them. Whether or not the cryptocurrencies survive the crash and boom cycle, businesses and investors are confident that their underlying distributed ledger technology called blockchain, would ride out the storm to emerge as the next big thing.        Load-Date: January 12, 2018End of Document

WeChat will struggle to add users after hitting 1 billion markCNN WireMarch 6, 2018 Tuesday 10:49 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 450 wordsByline: By Sherisse PhamDateline: HONG KONG (CNNMoney) BodyHONG KONG (CNNMoney) --  China's most popular social media app has amassed 1 billion users. But it's going to have trouble attracting another billion.WeChat's number of monthly active users popped above the milestone during the Lunar New Year holiday in February, its parent company, Tencent, said this week.It's an impressive number, but it's still well short of Facebook's 2.1 billion monthly users or WhatsApp, which has more than 1.5 billion. Catching up with those totals will be tough. WeChat is the dominant messaging platform in China but has struggled to win over large numbers of users outside its home market."The growth on WeChat has been slowing down consistently for the last two years," said Matthew Brennan, founder of ChinaChannel, a WeChat-focused research firm. "It's really topped out, I feel," he said. "It's not going to go much further."WeChat's success in China has been helped by the government's decision to shut out Facebook, Twitter and other rival social media platforms that are popular in the rest of the world. But the WeChat app is fast approaching the limits of China's vast population of smartphone users. Wireless industry group GSMA estimates that 98% of China's 1.4 billion people already own a smartphone, and sales of the devices started to decline last year.Meanwhile, WeChat has failed to catch on in other markets. It arrived late in many countries around the world, where Facebook, WhatsApp and other rivals had already won over large numbers of users. The features that made WeChat so popular in China -- being able to do everything from booking pet-grooming appointments to sending money to friends -- have failed to attract users in overseas markets where people can use established platforms like Paypal for specific needs.International users may also be wary of using an app in which messages can be monitored or potentially censored by the Chinese government.Because WeChat is tailored to the Chinese market, the people who use the app in other countries are mostly Chinese citizens who are keeping in touch with friends and family back home, or foreigners who do business in China, analysts say. But user growth hasn't been a priority for WeChat for some time, according to Brennan. Instead, Tencent is focused on pushing users to turn to the app for more and more activities, such as gaming, entertainment and payments. By getting people to spend more time and money on those services, WeChat has a lot of "untapped potential" for bringing in greater revenue, according to Brennan. "It's not about new users anymore," he said.-- Qiaoqiao Yu contributed to this report.TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

WeChat will struggle to add users after hitting 1 billionCNNMoney.comMarch 5, 2018 Monday 6:53 AM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: TECHNOLOGYLength: 431 wordsByline: Sherisse PhamBodyChina's most popular social media app has amassed 1 billion users. But it's going to have trouble attracting another billion.WeChat's number of monthly active users popped above the milestone during the Lunar New Year holiday in February, its parent company, Tencent, said this week.It's an impressive number, but it's still well short of Facebook's 2.1 billion monthly users or WhatsApp, which has more than 1.5 billion.Catching up with those totals will be tough. WeChat is the dominant messaging platform in China but has struggled to win over large numbers of users outside its home market."The growth on WeChat has been slowing down consistently for the last two years," said Matthew Brennan, founder of ChinaChannel, a WeChat-focused research firm."It's really topped out, I feel," he said. "It's not going to go much further."WeChat's success in China has been helped by the government's decision to shut out Facebook, Twitter and other rival social media platforms that are popular in the rest of the world.But the WeChat app is fast approaching the limits of China's vast population of smartphone users. Wireless industry group GSMA estimates that 98% of China's 1.4 billion people already own a smartphone, and sales of the devices started to decline last year.Meanwhile, WeChat has failed to catch on in other markets.It arrived late in many countries around the world, where Facebook, WhatsApp and other rivals had already won over large numbers of users.The features that made WeChat so popular in China -- being able to do everything from booking pet-grooming appointments to sending money to friends -- have failed to attract users in overseas markets where people can use established platforms like Paypal for specific needs.International users may also be wary of using an app in which messages can be monitored or potentially censored by the Chinese government.Because WeChat is tailored to the Chinese market, the people who use the app in other countries are mostly Chinese citizens who are keeping in touch with friends and family back home, or foreigners who do business in China, analysts say.But user growth hasn't been a priority for WeChat for some time, according to Brennan.Instead, Tencent is focused on pushing users to turn to the app for more and more activities, such as gaming, entertainment and payments.By getting people to spend more time and money on those services, WeChat has a lot of "untapped potential" for bringing in greater revenue, according to Brennan."It's not about new users anymore," he said.-- Qiaoqiao Yu contributed to this report.Load-Date: March 7, 2018End of Document

Is This the Beginning of the End of the Bitcoin Bubble?Atlantic OnlineJanuary 16, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 858 wordsByline: Derek ThompsonBodyBitcoin is a bubble.That much was clear to economists, investors, and analysts for quite some time. But one of the shortcomings of such analysis is that certainty of an economic bubble offers little insight on how, when, or why that bubble will pop. "I can say almost with certainty that they will come to a bad ending," Warren Buffett            said last week, to the great consternation of crypto fans. "When it happens or how or anything else, I don't know."Maybe-maybe-it's finally happening.The price of bitcoin plummeted by as much as 20 percent on Tuesday to $12,000, or about 40 percent below its all-time high in December. Other popular cryptocurrencies, like ethereum and Ripple, also posted double-digit losses.What's the reason? With stock-market analysis, there is sometimes an instinct to invent causality ("stocks fall on X," "stocks slide amid Y") when markets are driven by a matrix of inextricable factors. But in this case, the cause of bitcoin's collapse seems pretty clear. Just as the currency's hysterical price rise was driven in large part by            demand out of China, Japan, and South Korea, its latest fall seems similarly tied to developments in Asia.South Korean Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon            said the government is considering shutting down cryptocurrency exchanges, or at least introducing new regulations to the nascent crypto market. The Chinese government is also           cracking down on bitcoin and other tokens, not only because citizens can use them for laundering money and evading capital controls, but also because the computer power required to process transactions and create new tokens-which is often called "mining"-is extraordinary intensive. The global bitcoin market uses           more energy than the nation of Denmark, according to one analysis.Bitcoin's price rises and falls like a plastic bag in a hurricane, so it's silly to attach too much significance to one day's fluctuation. But today's news still reveals a subtle crack in the bull case for bitcoin. The digital currency was designed to be stateless and leaderless-"rules without rulers"-to evade single points of failure, and to remain impervious to government control. But the great irony is that bitcoin is plunging today in part because it's failing on all three accounts.First, bitcoin is designed so that digital transactions are approved by a network of computers rather than sanctioned by a single government. But its price is so volatile in part because its ownership is quite consolidated. Approximately 40 percent of bitcoin is held by about 1,000 users, and the top 100 bitcoin addresses-some of which may belong to the same person-control about one-sixth of all the issued currency,           according to Bloomberg. One reason why bitcoin can fall by 20 percent in a day-which is practically unheard of for most equities, and certainly of most currencies-is that if any one of these huge investors sells, it can move the market. Bitcoin's extraordinary price fluctuation is possible because ownership of nominally decentralized technology is, in fact, quite concentrated.Second, bitcoin exchanges-online marketplaces where bitcoins are held and traded-are all potential points of failure. And they fail, all the time. In 2014 thousands of bitcoins were stolen from            Mt. Gox, an exchange based in Tokyo. In 2016, bitcoin           plunged after an exchange in Hong Kong said it had been hacked. Today, bitcoin plummeted again when several governments threatened to regulate or shut down exchanges based in Asia.Third, while the cryptocurrency was designed to be stateless and leaderless, state leaders are largely responsible for its latest plunge. The currency requires no central bank, as new tokens are issued by computers running bitcoin software. But bitcoin's fortunes are still tied to the decision-making of central banks and other government regulators. In late 2013, after several senators           praised bitcoin and other virtual currencies at an official hearing as "legitimate financial services," the value of bitcoin tripled within the month to $900. But government rulemaking giveth and taketh away. On Tuesday, bitcoin's value fell after a Chinese central bank official           reportedly said that the government should ban the trading of digital currencies. Perhaps that's the most ironic thing about bitcoin: A system designed to distribute value away from individual authorities is exquisitely sensitive to mere rumors about individual regulators.An asset becomes a bubble when fundamentals yield to FOMO-a "a fear of missing out" on the action. But bitcoin's FOMO bubble is popping, even as economic fundamentals charge forward. Look at the countries most responsible for bitcoin's collapse. Both           commodity demand and           state-enterprise profit in China have reached record highs. Korean stocks have grown by more than 20 percent in the last 12 months, while Japan's Nikkei Index has popped, growing from about 23,000 to about 24,000 in the last four weeks. Meanwhile, in the U.S., the stock market just screamed past 26,000 for the first time in history. Blockchain might be the technology of the future. But it has practically nothing at all to do with the economy of the present.Load-Date: January 17, 2018End of Document

FCC chief opposes Trump administration 5G network planCNN.comJanuary 28, 2018 Sunday 8:44 PM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICSLength: 623 wordsByline: By Maegan Vazquez, Joshua Berlinger and Betsy Klein, CNNDateline: Washington BodyThe chairman of the Federal Communications Commission has come out against the Trump administration's desire to nationalize a secure 5G network.Any 5G plan would require FCC approval, leaving the future of the Trump administration proposal in serious doubt.A National Security Council official presented senior members of the Trump's administration with information suggesting that the United States needs to centralize its 5G network by the end of President Donald Trump's first term as a safeguard against Chinese cybersecurity and economic threats.Axios first reported the proposal.A PowerPoint presentation and memo obtained by Axios argue that a centralized 5G system would be easier to protect from cyberthreats. A White House official, however, said the memo reported by Axios is "dated" and "not representative of the administration's thinking." The official declined to provide further details.White House press secretary Sarah Sanders addressed the 5G network presentation during Monday's press briefing."As we outlined in our national security strategy ... we discussed the need for a secure network," she said, adding that "a lot of things are on the table.""Right now we are at the very earliest stages of the conversation. There are absolutely no decisions made on what that would look like, what role anyone would play in it, simply the need for a secure network. And that is the only part of this conversation that we are up to right now," she said.Government control of 5G infrastructure would be unprecedented and highly controversial, as the industry has traditionally been privately controlled.Ajit Pai, the FCC chairman, opposed the move in a statement Monday, saying "the market, not government, is best positioned to drive innovation and investment."He added, "Any federal effort to construct a nationalized 5G network would be a costly and counterproductive distraction from the policies we need to help the United States win the 5G future."All four FCC commissioners also came out in disapproval of the plan on Monday.AT&T and Verizon, two of the country's largest telecommunications companies, have both announced plans to roll out 5G coverage in the US this year. AT&T told Axios that work to launch 5G service in the United States "is already well down the road."Fletcher Cook, a spokesman for AT&T, said in a statement that the company "can't comment on something we haven't seen." The Justice Department has sued to block AT&T's purchase of Time Warner, which owns CNN, and a trial has been set for March.Verizon declined to comment on the Trump administration's potential move.In the presentation, two options were suggested: have the American government pay for and build a network, or have wireless providers build their own 5G networks. In the first scenario, the government would rent access to carriers like AT&T and Verizon, Axios reported.The memo called the nationalization of 5G "the 21st century equivalent of the Eisenhower National Highway System." At the time, the interstate highway project was considered one of the most ambitious public works projects in American history.In a December speech outlining his National Security Strategy, Trump labeled China a "rival power" seeking to "challenge American influence, values and wealth."When asked about allegations of hacking by Chinese entities and the Axios report Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said "the Chinese government strictly prohibits and severely cracks down on all forms of cyberattacks.""We think the international community should strengthen dialogues and cooperation to face up to cyber threats and maintain cyber peace and security based on mutual respect and trust," she said.This story has been updated.Load-Date: January 30, 2018End of Document

Happy Monday, everybody, thank you so much. Happy to be back in New York. Good morning and happy Monday, I am Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, January 29. Your top stories right now, 6 a.m. on the East Coast.Getting tough on trade, President Trump's America First message already being tested as Mexico and Canada are rejecting a proposal by the White House to rework a key part of the North American Free Trade Agreement. This comes as a commander in chief targets Europe signaling possible payback over what he called unfair trade policies with the EU.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I've had a lot of problems with the European Union. And it may morph into something very big from that standpoint, from a trade standpoint. The European Union has treated the United States very unfairly when it comes to trade. The European Union has been very, very unfair to the United States. It will turn out to be very much to their detriment.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The president will address the trade debate assaults the United States economic boom during his first State of the Union address Tuesday night. That will be of course live, and we'll take it for you. The address comes as a major indices all close at record levels again on Friday. Take a look at Friday's performance up 223 points on the Dow, up almost 1 percent. 26,616, a new record there. S&P 500 in unchartered territory with a 33-point rally. The Nasdaq as well.This morning a bit of a pull back from those numbers futures indicating a lower open for the broader averages we have about 25 points on the Dow, down about 18 on the Nasdaq. We are watching the yield on the benchmark 10-year treasury. It is as you can see rising, it broke 2.7 percent for the first time since early 2014 building on Friday's again after the fourth quarter GDP came out, and that was up 2.6 percent. Yields on the rise and stocks lower.In Europe this morning, take a look at the indices, as we watch rates moving higher even if fractionally, FT 100 it is up fraction, quarter of a percent. The CAC Quarante and the DAX index all over again fractional move here.In Asia, overnight stocks were mostly lower with the exception of Korea. As you can see there, the worst performer was China, Shanghai composite done about one percent.Terror strikes in military school in Afghanistan. The details on the attack that left 11 dead, over a dozen injured. And is technology putting our troops in danger? The new concern this morning or free fitness app that is being used on devices like Fitbit better actually tracking our military. We will get into it.Then Intel's morning over critical security flaws came after it first flagged the issue to several Chinese businesses including Alibaba. The news leaving the United States government with a chip on its shoulder over Intel.Hillary Clinton using the Grammy stage to mock President Trump. The appearance that is leaving many feeling fire and fury of their own this morning. Although stories coming up this morning. And joining me to talk about it fox Business network's Dagen McDowell. PwC partner, Mitch Roschelle and Maslansky and Partners president, Lee Carter.BARTIROMO: Great to see you.LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS: Great to see you welcome back.BARTIROMO: Happy to be back.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CO-HOST: Welcome back. Amazing work.BARTIROMO: Thank you, I missed you, it was a really good trip. I can't wait to get back here and talk about all the issues of the day we talk about every morning.MCDOWELL: Everything we are fired up about. Fire and fury.BARTIROMO: You were at the Grammys.PWC PARTNER, MITCH ROSCHELLE: I was at the Grammys.BARTIROMO: So, you saw all of the readings of "Fire and Fury" up close and personal.ROSCHELLE: I did. Yes, I was rolling my eyes.BARTIROMO: I don't know why they do that or they make an assumption everybody agrees with them.ROSCHELLE: The crowd there definitely did base upon a response. I was actually assuming. My bet was Obama was going to be -- I knew something was going on.BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes, that's a good point. I am surprised Obama wasn't there actually.MCDOWELL: He can't run again.CASONE: I know I think your generally classier than that.BARTIROMO: Yes, well, Hillary Clinton their reading right from the book. And Cher as well. I will get into it, a big night at the Grammys, coming up this morning former senior advisor to the Clintons, the Stagwell Group, president and managing partner, Mark Penn is with us this morning.Former presidential candidate, Mike Huckabee is here, and Trump for President senior advisor, Lara Trump making an appearance. Plus, a Fox News senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano. And Joy Villa was at the Grammys last night, singer and songwriter, former Trump Campaign Advisory Board member, Joy Villa.And the COO of Lamborghini America, Alessandro Farmeschi, is joining us this morning. We've got some hot wheels on the plaza, don't miss a moment of it, that's all coming up. But first this top story this hour and that is trade, Mexico and Canada now rejecting a proposal by the Trump administration to rework the corporate arbitration system. A key part of the North American Free Trade Agreement also known as NAFTA. It comes as the president himself is speaking out an unfair trade practices with the European Union even hinting at retaliation there.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I have a lot of problems with the European Union.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You have done business with them.TRUMP: Not a question of doing business, but I will tell you representing the United States. It is a very unfair situation. We cannot get our product in. It's very, very tough. And yet they send their product to us. No taxes, very little taxes. Very unfair. I have a lot of problems with European Union and it may morph into something very big from a trade standpoint. The European Union has treated the United States very unfairly when it came to trade.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: end of course trade expected to be one of the key elements in the present state of the union speech tomorrow night, Dagen, I guess infrastructure is the bigger headline. And he is not going to withdraw from NAFTA at the speech. But were expected from the state of the union tomorrow night?MCDOWELL: In "The Wall Street Journal" the headline about Canada and Mexico rejecting a proposal which is kind of one of the linchpins in the renegotiation of NAFTA, about how you handle corporate arbitration.We would prefer it that these disputes go through domestic courts but again this is one huge stumbling block. I would say that trade in any foul-up with trade with other nations around the world is one of the three biggest risks to the market in our economy in the next year. You have the 11 remaining countries in the Trans Pacific Partnership, which we withdrew from, cutting a new deal last week, it will be signed in March.The European Union and Japan, the end of last year making giant trade deal that will reduce scrap duties on cars coming in from Japan to Europe, scrap duties on cheese and wine being imported into Japan. This is one of the great truths that we start cutting ourselves off from the rest of the world.I know that President Trump talks about bad trade deals, but how about some trade deals. We need to also deal with NAFTA and also ink that trade deal with South Korea before we can move ahead with any other bilateral deals with nations around the world.BARTIROMO: Yes, which is why last week, Mitch, there was some worry that there will be some more to tariffs on solar panels and tariffs on washing machines. Maybe aluminum and steel are next and little by little discrete creates a real trade issue.ROSCHELLE: If you look at the GDP numbers that came out last week they would've been a whole percentage point higher if it wasn't for trade imbalance. Obviously, the president is very focused on trade balance and he campaigned on that, and he is pushing forward to try to make things a little bit more fear around the planet.BARTIROMO: It's a balance low. I mean, Lee, the White House says that the tone of the president's State of the Union message tomorrow night is going to be one of bipartisanship. One very forward-looking in terms of his agenda. How much of that includes these issues over trade remains to be seen.CARTER: I think were going to see a lot about trade, immigration, I think it's going talk about infrastructure, I think you will talk about jobs and the economy, I think he is going to spend time talking about what he is most comfortable with. What I think is going to be notably absent from the speech, healthcare. The reason for that is that is a really partisan issue right now and I think you can see the administration is making a lot of progress in some of these other negotiations with Democrats on immigration.There was an interview last week with Chuck Schumer where he said he was willing to talk to the president about these things. Of course, they get upset when the terms change, but I think that he is really going to focus on those issues that are first and foremost in people's minds right now. But I think it's really interesting that he is not going to be talking about healthcare.BARTIROMO: You would think infrastructure a sort of along both party lines, and that would be a positive, but there debating over the cost, right. According to a new Politico Morning Consult poll, by the way, a majority of voters want to hear the president talk about healthcare and economy. You don't think that is front and center. You have got to believe there is a lot on infrastructure though. Isn't there a lot there to talk about infrastructure?ROSCHELLE: In theory, and we have been talking about since the election, infrastructure should be a bipartisan issue that everybody is going to get behind. But I don't think anything is bipartisan anymore.BARTIROMO: First it was supposed to be $1 trillion deal, now we are talking about $1.7 trillion, but we should point out that the federal money is 200 billion. The number is largely expected private and public partnerships. We'll see.MCDOWELL: It remains to be seen how those work out because public-private partnerships work if it is for say a toll road, where there is revenue generation from that project. In terms of just throwing money, I think you have 2.7 percent could hire on the 10-year yield. That is related, so watch tariffs driving up costs. Watch talk about the weakening dollar which imports inflation into this country.I think the Trump administration, and this is a warning to them. They need to be careful of anything in terms of driving up inflation in the United States borrowing costs at this point, and also how much more money you are going to borrow after we doubled it out during the last administration. Those are very, very big concerns because President Trump love talking about the record breaking run in the stock market. The one thing that will throw cold water on it is much higher borrowing costs. And 2.7, let that be a warning.BARTIROMO: You are right, and we already saw a come back from South Korea, LG comes out last week and says, oh, guess what we are going to raise prices. So that was as a result of the tariff.MCDOWELL: I want to say really quickly one thing. These are companies like Samsung that have jobs in the United States. They have a new appliance plant in South Carolina. Part of these tariffs on imported parts above a certain level. If you try to import parts into this country and assemble washing machines and create jobs in the nation, the Republican Governor of South Carolina is very concerned about these tariffs.BARTIROMO: They have to figure out a way, what's the cost because you can't keep putting a terror retirement crosses the border, because reports are coming from different places. Same issue with autos. Because the parts are coming from different places, so you have got to come up with one tariffs and not have overly done tariffs, if you will.More to come on that. Coming up terrorism strikes a military school in Afghanistan. We have got that story, the details on the attack that left 11 people dead.Then the dangerous discovery that is putting our soldiers at risk. A new report shows the fitness devices are exposing sensitive military locations, you've got to hear this. And then Hillary Clinton surprise appearance at the Grammys, the former presidential candidate's latest jab at the commander-in-chief. That is all ahead. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back another deadly attack in Afghanistan to report. Militants reading a military Academy in Kabul. Cheryl Casone with the details in headlines. Cheryl, good morning to you.CHERYL CASONE, FBN:AM CO-HOST: Good morning. Maria, another attack to talk about there. At least seven soldiers have been killed, 16 others wounded. It was an early morning assault on a military compound in Kabul. The Islamic State group claiming responsibility in this comes only two days after more than 100 people were killed in a suicide attack in the afghan capital. This month alone, more than 200 people have been killed and hundreds wounded in a series of attacks unleashed by the Taliban and their rival, ISIS.Meanwhile, this is interesting, a popular fitness app is revealing top- secret information about the location of the U.S. military bases. "The Washington Post" reports that the apps draw heatmaps, pinpoint soldier's workouts near previously undisclosed military bases, and some spy outposts. This is part of Strava GPS dealer gathering available on smart phones and yes, the Fitbit. Which a lot of soldiers wear because it's Fitbit.And there is more fallout today from security flaws that Intel found in its chips. "The Wall Street Journal" reporting that Intel told some Chinese technology companies about the potential problems but not the U.S. government. Security experts say they may have given the Chinese government a heads up about the flaws known as inspector and meltdown. Remember those laws allow hackers to access personal data and researchers say there's no sign the information was ever exploited, shares of Intel Laura new premarket right now more than half a percent.Apple reportedly cutting its iPhone 10 production in half in the first quarter, this is due to disappointing holiday sales in Europe, the U.S. and China. Japan's Nikkei is reporting that Apple is lowering its production targets to 20 million units. Part of the problem could be Apple's price tag which starts at $1000. Remember, guys, the stock took a hit last week as well. Shares of Apple trading slightly lower in the premarket. Almost half a percent they are reporting by the way later on in the week, guys.And then finally this, the Grammys. Typically, it is all about music, right. Well, he got really political. Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hip-hop, real talk. That is love, baby. Jay for president.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Tonight, in this room full music dreamers, we remember this country was built by dreamers, for dreamers chasing the American dream, and all I know, it is just like dreams, these kids can't be forgotten. And are worth fighting for.HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: We have a longtime fear of being poisoned. One reason why he like to eat at McDonald's. Nobody knew he was coming, and the food was tastily made.(END OF VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: And we should say United States Ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, was not happy about this. Here's her tweet, she said I always loved the Grammys, but how artists read the "Fire and Fury" book killed it. Don't ruin great music with trash, some of us love music without the politics thrown in it.Now back to the music, the big winner of the night was Bruno Mars, he earned the top three awards, he got album of the year for "24k Magic", and he won 6 Grammys told, singer and songwriter Joy Villa, by the way, wore a make America great again dress, remember at the Grammys last year. Well, she's coming up later on the show you new dressed that she wore last night. She is getting a lot of buzz, Maria, about her latest outfit.BARTIROMO: Yes, her purse said choose life, enter dress was another extension of that. So, she is going to join us and talk more about that. You were the Grammys.ROSCHELLE: I was.BARTIROMO: Tell us about it.ROSCHELLE: It was awesome. Bruno Mars, he was incredible. That was great. But the highlight for me was Elton John, everybody my generation was hanging on for Elton John's performance.BARTIROMO: And he did a duo with Miley Cyrus. Right before that it's when you saw the "Fire and Fury" book readings, and that's when I turned it off, although my TV was still on and I did see it.Once I saw the readings on "Fire and Fury", I was like, OK, that's it, I'm done. Did you watch it?MCDOWELL: I watched some of it. This is what we expect, music is politics. A lot of these musicians there, and for the last 50 years, the music has been filled with political statements, so again that is what you're going to get. Kendrick Lamar, if he hadn't done what he did and that opening number which was incredibly powerful, the people would've been disappointed.BARTIROMO: You know what though, Bruno Mars did not get political.MCDOWELL: But his music isn't political. It's when a singer starts making political statements that's out of character. But U2 again, their entire career has been tinged with making political statements.BARTIROMO: Going into the show, Jay Z it's all about negatives about President Trump. The president actually fought back at them on Twitter.CARTER: I think it is interesting now that the new elites are in Grammys, are in music or entertainment, in the are completely out of touch with the American public. In it continues.MCDOWELL: Would they have been able to rally votes, Hillary would have won.CARTER: That's right.MCDOWELL: If all the people who listen to their music would have gone out there and voted, she might have won.BARTIROMO: That's right, they didn't come out. All right, we will take a break, when we come back market momentum rages, the Dow, the Nasdaq, the S&P 500 trading at record highs even we're looking at a fractional pullback this morning. What if anything slows things down for going let take a look at that, the risks. Stay with us.(BENIN VIDEO CLIP)DAVID BURROUGHS, MECUM AUCTIONS AUTOMOBILE AUTHENTICATION EXPERT: It's about the size of the tip of a ballpoint pen.JAMIE COLBY, FBN HOST: David Burroughs, Mecum Auctions automobile authentication expert, pinpoints the problem for me.BURROUGHS: So, if you count in 13 of these ribs would be right about in the center of this little gutter.COLBY: But it's missing.BURROUGHS: So restored cars could get all sanded off to make it pretty and shiny, and found that little fingerprint gets obliterated, so that implies that this car has either been restored or at least something is fishy.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: That was a clip from tonight's all new "Strange Inheritance" on Fox Business Network host Jamie Colby set out for Chicago to meet the son of a Vietnam vet was left in mint condition Corvette, in joining us right now, the host of "Strange Inheritance," Jamie Colby. Jamie, what a great story, tell us about this.COLBY: What a cliffhanger that was.BARTIROMO: 1967 Corvette Stingray.COLBY: And they have a little dimple under the hood that was part of the original mold. This car, it was missing. With the son of this Vietnam veteran who sent his combat pay home to give him an incentive to come out alive and make it back, he treated this as well as his five children. In the son inherited it and realized he could not divided into three, for his kids when he passed, so he finally decides to sell it. But he only wanted to go to a family that will appreciate story behind it about his father.And Mecum Auctions actually did propose that this car was special, not only it sold $675,000 but it had incredible military story behind it, and what an honor for me to pay tribute to our troops by telling the story of this Vietnam veteran tonight. But that little divot missing. It is an authentication issue.BARTIROMO: Wow.COLBY: You have to watch to find out.BARTIROMO: We will. It's a great story. All of these stories are so fascinating, I want to take a clip of the second episode airing at 9:30 eastern tonight. What's this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHARLOTTE SMITH, COLLECTOR OF CLOTHES: I just lost my job. And I thought I am actually a two homeowner because my collection actually cost me more than maintaining my house.COLBY: Charlotte can only afford to keep one.SMITH: It was awful, but you know what I just thought there is no way I would inherit a collection like this for no reason. I made the decision I'd rather sell my house than my collection.COLBY: Now, think about that. First addresses cost her, her shop, next the cost her, her husband, now for cost her, her house.(END OF VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: She's giving everything up except the clothes.COLBY: Here's the amazing thing and we are learning a lot from viewers writing us, her godmother was a Quaker. The last fashionista that you would imagine. She got $25 from her parents and bought her first dress, in turn it was out of control.3000 dresses that were left to Charlotte Smith who was an antique shop owner in Australia, and she has one of the most significant and historic fashion collections. Her husband said, it's me or the clothes, babe. And she said. Bye bye.And she has made a career, she said this is not just a collection, it is a calling. She has written a book on Dior, she has written a book on Chanel, the collection is priceless we saw it here in New York at Parsons. And wait until you see what she's done with it, but a Quaker very unlikely, but a great story of her and Matt, also the first gentleman who inherited the Corvette wanted to do the right thing. Twists and turns tonight, Maria. If you watch one night of "Strange Inheritance" this season, this is it.BARTIROMO: I'll be watching. Jamie, great show. Congrats.COLBY: Thank you, Maria, great to see you, don't forget that money collection you have, the coins and the dollars. I'm waiting.BARTIROMO: I collect currency. One of these days I'm going to bring it in and show everybody. Thank you so much, Jamie Colby there. Check out "Strange Inheritance" tonight.We had a great week last week, if you missed it, here are some of the top moments from our program live from the World Economic Forum last week in Davos, Switzerland.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: In Davos, welcome to this morning's panel.BRIAN MOYNIHAN, CEO, BANK OF AMERICA: 2018 it is going to be a little bit about United States trying to make itself a bit more competitive, as that changes the dynamic is going to reverberate a little bit in the world. And so, there is an attitude are you here from the administration about free trade policy has to be fair trade, but that has to settle back to the real question how do you get those imbalances straightened out.TIDJANE THIAM, CEO, CREDIT SUISSE: We have already portrayed recently because actually investors in Europe trade grew more slowly than world GDP. Which was very worrying. But I remain optimistic, I think we are in an exceptionally favorable context.BARTIROMO: You said that there have always been trade wars, were you suggesting that the United States is engaging somewhat in a trade war or this is just the way the people look at it?WILBUR ROSS, COMMERCE SECRETARY OF THE UNITED STATES: What I meant was this, every time someone violates trade rules that to me is an act of war. Things are changing, I think they know we are not going to be suckers anymore.STEPHEN SCHWARZMAN, CEO, THE BLACKSTONE GROUP: Countries outside the United States are recognizing that the United States competitive posture has changed quite dramatically. And we are going to be seeing on anticipated foreign investment into the United States because we will be the best of developed market in the world.BARTIROMO: Were you surprised at all to get all of this focus and questions hammered about your comments that are weaker dollar is good for trade.STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY OF THE UNITED STATES: Again, I am a bit surprises because my comments on the dollar has been completely consistent going back for a number of years. The Treasury Secretary has just kind of commented on strong dollar, strong dollar, strong dollar. And again, my perspective is there is a free market, where it is a short-term is not a concern of ours.ELAINE CHAO, TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY: The transformative nature of technology in transportation is very exciting. But it also cautions us to address issues about safety, security, accessibility and also privacy.BARTIROMO: How soon before we see driverless cars on the road as the norm?CHAO: I think it will come not as fast as some people say, but sooner than many expect.GINNI ROMETTY, CEO, IBM: I wish it wasn't called artificial intelligence, Augmented intelligence. That it is really going to propel the world forward. I think this is a really important inflection point in time for companies but for the tech industry, society at large. This idea that it is our job to steward in these new technologies and guide them safely into the world.BARTIROMO: I've got to get your take on the employment situation right now. Because there is this whole debate about DACA.BILL GATES, FOUNDER, MICROSOFT: We got the country and immigrants. We are very lucky country where lots of highly energetic and talented people want to come to our country. I certainly believe that we should all want them to stay and contribute. We could get the Dreamers, solve them, we could look at immigration more broadly.KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY: America first is not America alone. We need a partner. You know, as I've said earlier, not one of us has the ability to do this alone. So we need to partner with private sector, we need to partner with our allies.RANIA AL ABDULLAH, QUEEN CONSORT OF JORDAN: America being great again, it comes from America engaging with the rest of the world and sharing its -- the principles that it represents. I'm looking forward to seeing how the United States will continue to set the -- to be the moral authority and leader in the world.RICK PERRY, SECRETARY, U.S. ENERGY: You have to understand what America first means to the president of the administration and it's really pretty simple from my perspective. This is about America being competitive around the globe when folks are thinking about where you want to buy your energy from, where do you want that next load of L&G to come from. We want you to think about America, first.MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Welcome back, good Monday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, it is Monday, January 29th, your top stories right now 6:30 on the East Coast.One day away, President Trump's first State of the Union Address, this Tuesday night, he's expected to bring up the booming economy, the soaring market and an infrastructure plan. We will have full coverage, live, from our nation's capital, tomorrow and Wednesday, right here.And meanwhile, take a look at markets pulling back from another record- setter on Friday. Futures pointing to weakness to kick off the week, as interest rates move higher. Dow Industrials now down 40 points. Investors are watching a very busy week. It is the busiest week for fourth quarter earnings. For example, take a look at rates right here, 2.72 percent up 5 basis points.And we've got a slew of economic data leading up to the monthly job's report on Friday, we've got the FOMC meeting and, of course, the State of the Union, so yes, it is a very busy week for markets. We are watching yields and rates move higher, the 10-year treasury topping 2.7 percent, first time receiving this level since 2014. This after the major indices closed at record highs on Friday due to strong corporate earnings that's really been leading this market, Dow Industrials at 26,616, NASDAQ at 7505.Global action this morning, a little weaker, in Europe, mixed performances, you've gor the FT 100 up a quarter of a percent, and the CAC Quarante up fractionally but the DAX Index in Germany is lower by a fraction. In Asia overnight, markets closed mostly lower with the exception of Korea, the KOSPI Index up almost one percent.Closer look at earnings this morning, a third of the Dow and more than 100 S&P 500 companies will report this week. On tap today, Lockheed Martin, we will bring you the numbers as soon as they hit the tape. These defense contractors have been soaring in the last week and there's a chart just in the last three months of Lockheed Martin.Our top story this half an hour, the red-hot start to 2018, markets have only gained momentum through January building on last year's historic rally. Since January 1st, the Dow Industrials has seen 11 record closes, the NASDAQ, 13 record closes and the S&P 500 has seen its biggest gains in more than 30 years with these markets up from the start of trading, not the mention since the election. Joining us right now SkyBridge Capital Senior Portfolio Manager, Troy Gayeski, Troy, good to see you.TROY GAYESKI, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, SKYBRIDGE CAPITAL: Good to see you too, Maria.BARTIROMO: What takes this market off track?GAYESKI: Well, you know, this week, we're going to test the week with rates backing up, so, you know, our opinion would be the rate move so far as confirmation of better economic growth, better earnings, a rotation out of bonds and to equities. But you start seeing the 10-year approach, 2.8, 2.9 that would certainly decelerate the rate of gains at least, and maybe cause a longer consolidation period.BARTIROMO: Dagen, what's the magic number? I mean, when do investors go out and say, OK, I can get a better deal if i put money in treasuries because interest rates are at this level, I'm going the take my risk out and take the money out of stocks? Do you have a magic number?DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Since the financial crisis, it's been pretty close to the yield that we see right now that when you get a sustained move above 2 1/2 percent, this is the highest, 2.7 percent is the highest we've seen the 10-year yield in four years.So this is always been -- but, again, this was in a very slow-growth environment where the U.S. economy never grew in any one calendar year, three -- even three percent since 2005, I think. So it's more than a decade. There's -- I think that when you start to get closer to three percent that that is danger zone at least in the short run.GAYESKI: Yes, which should cause a pause, again, when you think about the gains we've had, since the election last year, and in the la six weeks, they've been historic. So, you know, one of the justifications for the strength of bull market has been how low rates were and how there's an alternative, but now you have rates backing up, again, you get around, three or above, that's when you could have at least a mild correction, but by mild, several percent, not five, six, seven or eight.MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC: Troy, one of the things that I also worry about is this, sort of, strategy around depressing the value of the dollars, while it's good for corporate profits and multinationals, it may not be good for our economy. What are your thoughts on the cheap dollar strategy?GAYESKI: Well, that's back to the capital flows argument, whether there's enough inflows to fund their budget deficit but also to keep equities trending higher. And look -- I think -- you know, we are talking about (INAUDIBLE) the comments that Mnuchin made, and those comments only weaken the dollar buy a percent, percent and a half.I mean, in the big picture, don't forget the dollar had tremendous gains in 2013, '14 and early '15, since then, it's been weakness, in fact, the dollar is actually weaker now than prior to when the fed first hiked back in 2015. So, you know, we don't want to get in a trade war.We don't want to see the dollar decline by five, six, seven, eight percent from here, because that would start to set off, you know, concerns about inflation. But in the meanwhile, it's just trading weaker in a relatively sustained range, so we don't see it as a huge threat right now.BARTIROMO: You know what? I want to get your take on whether or not to put money into this market right now or to take money out.GAYESKI: Yes.BARTIROMO: But first, let's give some context on the backdrop because Blackstone Group Chairman and CEO and co-founder, Stephen Schwarzman, told us about the next fundraising cycle for the Blackstone Group, listen to what he had to say in the future of his business.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STEPHEN SCHWARZMAN, CHAIRMAN AND CEO OF BLACKSTONE GROUP: We started out just doing the highest return-type of investing, in real estate, it's called opportunity fund investing, in private equity. It's like normal private equity. And those returns, sort of, have ended up close being to 20 percent after fees --BARTIROMO: Every year.SCHWARZMAN: which is every year and this is in pre-fees, of course, you know, just really pretty amazing, and what happened is that we've done that and now we've discovered some interesting things, that there are investors who don't necessarily want those types of returns.They are much more comfortable and are looking for returns in 11, 12, 13- type of area for different types of things, some as private equity that compounds over the long-term, you don't sell it after four or five years, you can hold it for 10 or 20, and some in the real estate area.There are also mezzanine securities that can get you in that type of area. So what's happening is we are now developing products and aggressively expanding in that 11 to 13 to 14 range. Now, there's a lot more to do there because it's easier to have lower returns if you're used to manufacturing very high returns.So we continue to do the high-return business but all of the sudden, we've got a much bigger potential market in these other lower returns and still, there are people in the lower-rate environment who are quite happy making seven, eight, nine, because they're exceeding what they need for pension funds and other pools of capital. And if you can do that in a secure way, that market is even bigger. So, what's happening is we used to just be at the top and now we're addressing a pyramid, and it keeps getting bigger as we go down. And we develop those products, and then we take them around the world. So, Blackstone is going to be experiencing, I believe, a period of very substantial growth for a very long time.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: They are about to go on a fundraising move, they're going to raise $200 billion. An incredible number.GAYESKI: It's remarkable. Yes, remarkable firm, right?BARTIROMO: Yes.GAYESKI: And, oh, back to the question you were going to ask, I mean, one of the challenges for investors right now is, you know, equities have done fantastically well, there's some nervousness creeping in and volatility has been exceptionally low. Everybody knows that, you know, this economic boom won't continue forever and they'll be a correction, or at least a bear market or mild correction. So, where else are they going to put their capital? And back to the point on bonds, I mean, bonds, you're looking at -1, -2 to up 1. So, part of the growth for firms like Blackstones or alternatives in general, how do you make, you know, a high single digit return that's at least competitive with equities but has far less downside in the event of the ultimate bear market. So, you know, we're seeing some people start to peel money off from equities. For the last two years, investors have been peeling money out of bonds, and that came alternatives that way.BARTIROMO: So, would you put new money to work in stocks right here or not?GAYESKI: Well, look, I mean, $600 billion has saved the year by consumers has got to go somewhere, so you should continue to follow your asset allocation. I don't think you want to be hyper overweight stocks right now. You made good money, you have to be realistic, you're looking at low to high single digits the next 12 months given where multiples are. So, you know, right now, we're advocating the clients, just take a little bit of money off the table and allocate to alternatives. And that way, you'll have less downside when the ultimate correction comes.BARTIROMO: I've got to tell you, even though there's feeling of complacency, worries about higher rates which you point out, worries about inflation at some point, I could not find one person to say take money out of the market in 2018.GAYESKI: Yes.BARTIROMO: Because they think that the tax plan is going to have legs for this year, that we're still going to see another good market. I don't know what that means and if it's a contrary indicator, but I can't find anybody to say short this market in '18.GAYESKI: Yes, some of those people were also saying, if Trump got elected, the market would collapse.BARTIROMO: Yes, good point.GAYESKI: So, I don't know how much you would them as future indicators here.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much.GAYESKI: Great to see you. Yes.BARTIROMO: Great to see you, Troy, Troy Gayeski. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. To get a sense of the runway for telecom across the world, this next company proves it, connecting emerging markets, Channel I.T. helps under-developed regions for providing micro finance lending solutions to mobile network subscribers. I caught up with the Chairman and CEO of Channel I.T. in Davos, Bassim Haidar, at the World Economic Forum about business today in the emerging markets and how it's opening up a whole new opportunity.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BASSIM HAIDER, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, CHANNEL I.T.: We're emerging market business and we're creating product that have a lot of pull, so customers need the products. We're not trying to push something onto someone they you don't need. When you have 2.5 billion people in emerging markets that are unbanked, simply providing them a way into banking or into loans, or into the financial systems, empowers them and allows us to actually sell and cross sell more services. So, take for example, we just launched in Pakistan a mobile financial service. The uptake has what we're supposed to do in the first six months. We've done already in one month after launch. So, it just tells you that because all this lack of infrastructure lack of focus from the very big global players, the cost of acquisition of customers to bring them into the banking sector of small loans is very high. We do it via technology, via big data.BARTIROMO: So, tell me about that. How do you connect the dots from telecom services to micro finance lending?HAIDER: So, basically for more than 25 years since GSM is out there, there's been a huge amount of data gathered by the telcos. This data was never really used. It was just dumped onto service and was never ever used to say how do we understand these customers? In a country where you have no data on the consumer, the only way you can reach them is via their behavior and usage of their mobile phones. And the amount of data you can actually get from that almost exceeds what you got on Twitter, for example, and therefore taking that data, making sense out of it, scoring these customers, and then, say, we're going to provide loans, services, we're going to provide you content, digital content that you've never had access to. We do, for example, onto our big services today is we provide loans for customers to go from a simple feature form onto a smartphone. Can you imagine what that brings to them? It brings the whole world. In countries where you have no electricity, watching videos and getting onto YouTube, and Facebook, and social media via your phone and enable you to do this at any time anywhere is a very powerful proposition?BARTIROMO: So, what kind of growth are you expecting in the coming years?HAIDAR: This year, 60 percent growth.BARTIROMO: Wow! 60 percent.HAIDAR: 60 percent growth in our business. We closed the year with about 400 million people interacting with our platform this year. We honestly believe we're going to finish more than 620 million people interacting with our platform by the end of this year, and it's already in sight -- we can already see it happening the way we're growing. So, we're probably going to hit, probably, a billion in the next two years -- users in our platforms.Geopolitical events don't affect us as much as I was saying earlier, because even though when economies are affected, we're not even affected as much. I think the biggest concern for us is the lack of regulation in what we're doing today, and perhaps maybe too much regulation coming in which would slow down what we're doing, because it's a gray area; it sits between the banking, the telco regulators, and so on. So, it's an area we're constantly watching and working very closely with the regulators on the ground, trying to put laws actually in places.In Bangladesh, for example, there are no laws against -- or with -- for data usage. So, when we've met government officials, they're saying, OK, we need to understand this a bit more and how it works and what it means for us. So, passing laws is even, for us, a big issue because then we can't actually grow in that market because, you know, you're not sure what's going to happen down the road.(END VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: My thanks to Bassim Haidar for joining us. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Music's big night last night. The Grammy's going into the show. I was able to catch with Will.i.am, he's the founder of I Am Plus, the CEO of the foundation, will.i.am, in Davos last week where we spoke everything from A.I. to new music.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: The last time we talked, you were really lifting up the neighborhood that you grew up in -- trying to inspire young people when it comes to science and technology, how's that going?WILLIAM JAMES ADAMS, FOUNDER OF I AM PLUS AND CEO OF WILL.I.AM FOUNDATION: It's going great and it's the reason why I started I Am Plus, because if I'm going to inner cities and telling kids that they should apply themselves down the path of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. And then I go off, and, you know, go on stage, they're going to look at me sideways, like, Will, you know, I want to do music like you. So, I'm like, no, you want to do tech like me. Like, this is the way not out of the ghetto, but to change the ghetto forever.Since then, you know, the company that I have, we went from, you know, when I acquired a company out of Bangla, India after we sold beats to Apple, we were 40 employees. Now, we're 300 employees across six different locations around world. We raised $117 million. Our A.I., voice operating system is being used by (INAUDIBLE 54:19) telecom to improve customer service, working alongside customer service agents, so they have A.I. to augment and enhance experience. So, that's really exciting.BARTIROMO: What's the next big thing? I know you're working a lot on artificial intelligence, where is that leading you?ADAMS: So, A.I. is the next big frontier. Right now, your iPhone is the Internet phone and there's a bunch of Internet devices. A.I. devices are around the corner. We're about to deploy ours, shortly, this year, and really excited for our launch.BARTIROMO: Do you worry that A.I. and all this machine learning that we're talking about is leading to a loss of jobs for people? I mean, we're really going high-tech here in terms of machines.ADAMS: Imagine it's 1918 and your family were candle stick makers, and they've been making it for years, thousands of years -- because candles been around forever, and lanterns, and then Nikola Tesla and Edison are fooling around with lights. Imagine the fear of how many jobs it's going to replace, but just look at how many jobs it created. Imagine you were horse and buggy, and you made buggies and you made equipment for the farm in 1918. And then, Hemi Ford came around with an automobile. Imagine how many people were afraid of how many jobs are going to be replaced, but look how many jobs it created. The same is going to happen with artificial intelligence. We just can't imagine the jobs yet -- and the jobs are going to come from folks that have been left behind. When you encourage kids and educate them around these skill sets, they will create jobs. CoBARTIROMO: There's a lot of conversation here in Davos about France, about Europe coming back economically. Will 2018 be the year of France, the U.S., Europe, Asia? What do you think?ADAMS: My eye is on 2030.BARTIROMO: OK, why?ADAMS: Because, that's when my kids will be old enough to create jobs. The ones that I'm focused on right now, 9-year-olds, right? So, 2030 -- I'm looking further. I'm committed further.BARTIROMO: Are you going to go to the Grammy's this year?ADAMS: I'm committed further.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: You don't want to talk about the Grammy's?ADAMS: That was the past. I think that was like, 20 to 40 --BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, you have enough Grammy's under your belt to basically do what you want.ADAMS: Speaking of Grammy's people are going to get up there this year and thank everybody and their mom and ignore Edison, who's responsible for the grammaphone which is our Grammy award. We forget the sciences, we forget the innovators and the inventors. We thank everybody, God, except for the folks that are responsible for the innovation and bringing it to life.(END VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: Will.i.am, thank you so much for joining us. More MORNINGS WITH MARIA, we come right back. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Monday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. Happy Monday!

All Rights ReservedLength: 1246 wordsByline: Tony OwusuHighlight: The Dow and S&P broke a nine-quarter winning streak.BodyClosing Bell The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 ended the first quarter of 2018 in the red, breaking a nine-quarter streak for the two indices. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq suffered its worst month of trading since January 2016.U.S. stock markets will be closed Friday, March 30, for Good Friday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 324 points, or 1.65%, to 24,160, the S&P 500 was up 1.64% and the Nasdaq rose 1.64% after stocks finished to the downside on Wednesday, March 28.Sears CEO Received Raise in 2017 Sears  CEO Eddie Lampert saw his 2017 bonus increase by $850,000, a 24% raise over the previous year. Lampert gets a salary of only $1, but he also gets a stock bonus. Lampert was given 606,000 shares in 2017 more than double the 265,000 that he received in 2016. The value of the options fell precipitously last year, however, as Sears stock tumbled 60%. Shares of Sears were having a strong performance this week, rising nearly 40% at its peak over the past five sessions. However, the stock is down 5.5% in afternoon trading Thursday. McDonald's Triples Employee Scholarship Program McDonald's  is using the benefits from its tax cuts to triple its tuition assistance program to $150 million. Previously, employees had to be on the job for at least nine months before being eligible for the tuition assistance, the company now requires that employees be on the job for just 90 days. "By tripling tuition assistance, adding education benefits for family members and lowering eligibility requirements to the equivalent of a summer job, we are sending a signal that if you come work at your local McDonald's, we'll invest in your future," David Fairhurst, McDonald's chief people officer, said in a statement.Snap Inc. to Layoff 100 More Workers Snap Inc.  announced another round of 100 layoffs Thursday mainly affecting the company's sales department. This round of layoffs follows the reconstruction of the company's content teams in January and the layoffs off about 120 engineers earlier this month. "These changes reflect our view that tighter integration and closer collaboration between our teams is a critical component of sustainably growing our business," Chief Strategy Officer Imran Khan said in a statement. "While this process has required us to make some really tough decisions, we believe that rigorously ensuring our team structure always aligns with our goals will make us stronger."Snap shares were down 0.7% Thursday afternoon. Barclays to Pay $2 Billion Fine Over Mortgage-Backed Securities Fraud The Justice Department announced that British bank Barclays  agreed to pay a $2 billion fine over claims of fraud in the sale of residential mortgage-backed securities.The Justice Department charged Barclays with fraud in conduct related to the underwriting and issuance of the RMBS between 2005 and 2007 in the run-up to the financial crisis. The settlement comes following a three-year investigation in which Barclays was found to have caused billions of dollars in investor losses by engaging in a scheme to sell 36 RMBS deals while misleading investors about the quality of the mortgages underlying those contracts. "The substantial penalty Barclays and its executives have agreed to pay is an important step in recognizing the harm that was caused to the national economy and to investors in RMBS," said U.S. Attorney Richard Donoghue. Volkswagen to Offer Buybacks for Diesel Vehicles If German Cities Ban Them German automaker Volkswagen  announced that it will offer buybacks for diesel vehicles should German cities choose to ban the vehicles. Volkswagen's announcement follows a German court ruling that cities could issue the ban if they so choose. Volkswagen is offering to buy back diesel vehicles purchased between April 1 and the end of the year if the city a buyer lives in chooses to ban the vehicles. Diesel car sales plunged 19% in Germany last year thanks to fears over the ban, even though diesel vehicles emit less CO2 than their gasoline engine counterparts. Jobless Claims Fall to Lowest Level Since 1973 Initial jobless claims in the U.S. fell by 12,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted mark of 215,000, according to data released by the Labor Department. The current unemployment benefits level is the lowest its been since January 1973. Data from last week was also revised down by 2,000 claims. Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting claims to fall to 230,000 last week. Claims have been below the 300,000 threshold, considered to be a sign of a healthy job market, for 158 consecutive weeks. It is the longest such stretch since 1970 when the labor market was much smaller. Amazon Is in the President's Sights, Scaring Investors Away Amazon  shares continued their downward trajectory Thursday after President Trump took to Twitter to denounce the company's avoidance of state and local taxes.I have stated my concerns with Amazon long before the Election. Unlike others, they pay little or no taxes to state & local governments, use our Postal System as their Delivery Boy (causing tremendous loss to the U.S.), and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)  Amazon shares were falling 1.3% in early market trading Thursday after falling more than 4% Wednesday. Boeing Hit by WannaCry Malware, Attack Caused Little Damage Boeing  says that its computer network was infected by the WannaCry computer virus, but the attack only caused minimal damage.The attack initially caused widespread alarm within the company that its vital airplane-production equipment might be affected, but the company quickly realized that the attack was contained. "We've done a final assessment," said Linda Mills, the head of communications for Boeing Commercial Airplanes. "The vulnerability was limited to a few machines. We deployed software patches. There was no interruption to the 777 jet program or any of our programs."WannaCry first surfaced during a global attack in May last year. The virus attacks Windows systems and infects them with ransomware. Airbnb Grants Chinese Authorities Access Guest Info Room-booking service Airbnb has capitulated to Chinese authorities, allowing them access to guest information like passport details and the dates of bookings. Airbnb said that it is cooperating with the Chinese government, "like all businesses operating in China."In China, Airbnb users have to provide their passport information while booking. It is not like this in other countries. "The information we collect is similar to information hotels in China have collected for decades," an Airbnb spokesperson told the BBC. "[It is] one step we are taking as we explore ways to help our hosts and guests follow the appropriate rules and regulations [in China]."Premarket U.S futures were once again showing signs of life Thursday, however, markets have not followed the futures' lead for the previous two sessions, closing the day lower after strong premarket trading. Dow futures were rising 0.29%, indicating an open 69 points higher, while Nasdaq futures gained 0.66%, indicating an open 42.5 points higher, and S&P futures were rising 0.34%, indicating an open 9 points higher. World markets were able to rebound.

INTERNATIONAL MAIL AND POSTAL PRACTICES: A RECAP OF NOTABLE RECENT DEVELOPMENTSStates News ServiceJanuary 12, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1039 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: ARLINGTON, Va. BodyThe following information was released by the Lexington Institute:Paul SteidlerThere have been several significant developments on international mail and postal delivery in the past year.Opioids in the MailDue to the opioid epidemic in the United States, there is significant and growing pressure to scrutinize all in-bound mail from China via advanced electronic data (AED). In Congress, a bipartisan measure, the Synthetics Trafficking and Overdose Protection Act, a.k.a. The STOP Act, would tighten security on drugs in international mail shipments by requiring seven AED information points. With this data, law enforcement would be better able to identify and confiscate fentanyl and related narcotics.President Donald Trump's drug abuse commission explicitly endorsed this measure. In 2017, former Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and incoming Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, both testified that the measure would be helpful in curtailing drug inflows. Introduced by Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) and Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), The STOP ACT has 29 Senate cosponsors and 252 cosponsors in the House.The U.S. Postal Service opposes the measure while acknowledging it receives inbound AED on 40 percent of shipments. There has been increasing pressure on the Postal Service to work more closely with U.S. Customs and Border Protection to increase drug interdiction.The leaders of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee have also been closely monitoring cooperation between the Postal Service, Department of Homeland Security and the State Department to prevent synthetic opioids from entering the United States.Terminal DuesOn January 1, 2018, the new payment system on terminal dues, formulated by the Universal Postal Union in the Fall 2016, went into effect. Terminal dues is the system by which post offices in different countries divide up the revenues from international mail, defined as all items up to 2 kilograms or 4.4 pounds.Most notably, the price for small packages sent from China to the United States increased 13 percent as of January 1, 2018, and will increase 13 percent more each year from 2019-21. This comes at a time when there is growing scrutiny over terminal dues in the United States and other countries. Because of terminal dues, it costs less to send a small package from China to the United States than to send a package within the United States.The U.S Chamber of Commerce is opposed to terminal dues in their current form and filed an October 16 motion with the Postal Regulatory Commission, requesting that documents about international mail be unsealed. The motion states, "The (U.S.) Chamber is increasingly concerned that U.S. merchants and manufacturers are placed at an economic disadvantage to foreign merchants and manufacturers due to artificially low rates paid by foreign shippers for delivery of their merchandise within the U.S. at rates not available to domestic shippers."The Canadian Parliament has also taken notice of terminal dues. In evaluating steps to promote e-commerce, both liberal and conservative members have expressed strong concerns about low postal rates from China and their impact on Canadian businesses. These matters were addressed at a trade committee hearing where Canada Post outlined the upcoming terminal dues price increases. There is also concern that Chinese e-commerce companies are often evading taxes and duties.On a related note, rigorous inspections by Canada Post and the Canada Border Services Agency of e-commerce from China has resulted in some customers having to wait months for packages. CBC News reported this continued to be a problem during the recent Christmas season.Royal Mail StrikeIn the United Kingdom, mediation continues between Royal Mail and the Communication Workers Union (CWU) to halt a potential strike and to reach agreement on retirement and other issues. A court injunction prevented an October 2017 strike.The central issue pertains to Royal Mail's proposal to close the defined benefit or pension program in April 2018. Royal Mail is a for-profit business, traded on the London Stock Exchange. Since December, both sides have spoken positively about developments in negotiations.DronesDrone delivery, which could potentially revolutionize postal delivery, is now a reality in some places.Since March 2017, Swiss Post has been using drones to deliver laboratory samplesbetween two hospitals in Lugano, a city along the Italian border. Swiss Post is also using drones to make deliveries for Jelmoli, a premium department store, within the City of Zurich.Japan Post plans to use drones for transportation from post office to post office, and possibly also for home deliveries. It believes drones will significantly cut costs and expects they will be widely used in cities by the 2020s.Japan Post is also testing self-driving cars.Other Significant Technology DeploymentsAnother intriguing and potentially far-ranging development, is the introduction of digital address systems.Mongol Post faces significant delivery challenges as the country is geographically large, sparsely populated and a quarter of the country's citizens are nomadic. In June 2016, NPR reported that the Mongolian government has partnered with a British startup, What3Words to overhaul its postal and address system. Each 9-square meter plot of land receives its own three-word identifier.The Financial Times reports the system has been successful, especially for package deliveries which were previously often returned. Similar digital address systems have been implemented since 2016 in Sint Maarten, Djibouti, Solomon Islands, Ivory Coast, Tonga and Nigeria.India Post has also launched a pilot project to provide six-character alphanumeric digital addresses. A private mapping company has been hired.Banking DevelopmentsMany postal services also provide banking and other financial services.On January 1, 2018, the South China Morning Post reported that China's Postal Bank was fined $80 million by the Chinese government for fraudulent bond guarantees.India Post plans to enter the banking sector by providing savings and insurance services at 650 branches, as reported by the Times of India on November 20.Load-Date: January 12, 2018End of Document

CLASHES BETWEEN MYANMAR ARMY AND ETHNIC MILITIAS ENSUE IN KACHIN, SHAN STATESStates News ServiceFebruary 5, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1068 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Much-needed development programs for Myanmar's remote, war-torn Kachin state have been hindered by fighting between the national army and an ethnic armed group, the state's chief minister said Monday.Myanmar's northernmost state bordered by China and India has been rocked by a resurgence of conflict since 2011 when a 17-year bilateral cease-fire agreement between the two sides broke down. The clashes have left hundreds dead and more than 100,000 displaced.The latest round of fighting began early this year when government soldiers launched air strikes in the Tanaing township gold and amber mining region, an area controlled by the KIA which relies on its natural resources as a source of income through the levying of a five-percent tax on mine operators.State media have reported that that the KIA, which controls large swathes of territory in the state, including its lucrative mining areas, has conducted assaults on the regional military headquarters in Kachin since late January.The government army has accused the Kachin rebel group of illegally using the area's natural resources and taking money from mining businesses that should otherwise have gone to the state.The KIA, however, has charged that Myanmar forces have attacked territory it controls in hopes of gaining control of it before a national peace conference later this month.Despite the hostilities, representatives from the Myanmar military held informal talks with KIA leaders on Feb. 1 in southwestern China's Yunnan province with the support of Chinese government authorities, the online news service Democratic Voice of Burma reported, citing KIA spokesman Colonel Naw Bo.But on Feb. 3, about 50 Kachin Independence Army (KIA) soldiers used small arms and heavy guns to attack Myanmar army camps in Lwele village in Myitkyina district's Moe Kaung township, with some injuries reported, Myanmar's Mizzima news service reported.While answering questions about the situation in Tanaing, Kachin state Chief Minister Khet Aung told RFA's Myanmar Service said the recent flare-up in hostilities has stymied development projects that would benefit those whose lives and livelihoods have been disrupted."Development programs in Kachin state are really stalled," he said. "We must work to have peace. We have to work on development projects while we are working to forge peace. We will have the same problems as long as we don't have peace."Myanmar's Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief, and Resettlement, the Red Cross, and government and civil society organizations are currently trying to help internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the Tanaing mining region, he said.At least four civilians were killed during the fighting between the Myanmar army and KIA between Jan. 19 and 27, Democratic Voice of Burma reported.March in MyitkyinaMeanwhile, about 5,000 ethnic Kachins, including local residents, members of religious organizations, and civil society groups, marched in the state capital Myitkyina on Monday, calling for an end to the national army's offensives and the rescue of people trapped in war zones, the online journal The Irrawaddy reported.Though more than 3,000 miners and their families were initially prevented from leaving the mining region by the Myanmar army after the current round of fighting started, the Myanmar army recently permitted about 1,000 to leave on foot and go to Tanaing town.But about 1,000 mine workers and their families are still trapped in the Tanaing region where they face food and water shortages, and about 1,000 others are stuck in Sumprabung township, The Irrawaddy said."We have sent a letter to state government and Northern Military Headquarters to rescue people who are trapped in Tanaing and Sumprabung townships," said Zaw Jut, chairman of the Emergency Relief Committee."If the government doesn't allow us to go into the war zone to rescue people, then we can't go because it is a government army-controlled area," he told RFA. "Whenever we have fighting in the region, people become victims and suffer. We want to rescue them, and we want the international community to know that we have these refugees in Kachin."The KIA is one of several militias with which the Myanmar government is trying to end decades of ethnic separatist civil wars and forge peace in the country through a series of peace negotiations launched in August 2016 by de facto national leader Aung San Suu Kyi.The Kachin Independence Organization (KIO), the KIA's political wing, has not signed the government's nationwide ceasefire agreement (NCA) that eight of the country's more than 20 ethnic armies inked in October 2015.Chopper attack on TNLAAlso on Monday, government forces used helicopters to attack another ethnic militia in the Kutkai region of neighboring Shan state in eastern Myanmar, in the first chopper assault of the year, an officer from the rebel army told RFA.Fighting between the national army and Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) occurred in Kyaukme, Namhsan, Namtu, and Kutkai townships, said Colonel Mine Aik Kyaw."We engaged in hostilities with the government army at around 7 a.m. in Pharpon Village of Kutkai township," he said. "Many government troops were injured, although we don't know the numbers.""Around 10 a.m., two helicopters came in and opened fire on us for about 30 minutes each," he said.The government army has used choppers to attack TNLA forces in Shan state about 50 times in the past, he said.Around the beginning of the year, TNLA and KIA soldiers attacked government military headquarters in Kachin state government army base camps and the Lashio-Muse Highway, a main thoroughfare in northern Shan state.The offensive prompted Myanmar forces to launch counterattacks via aircraft, according to an announcement at the time by the office of Myanmar's commander-in-chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing.The TNLA has been excluded from signing the government's NCA because of its ongoing hostilities with Myanmar's armed forces.The TNLA and KIA are members of the Federal Political Negotiation and Consultative Committee (FPNCC), which has called for a political dialogue with the government and for peace talks as a coalition rather than as individual members.Reported by Aung Theinkha, Wai Mar Tun, and Kyaw Myo Min for RFA's Myanmar Service.

Release of Tibetan Poet Shokjang Overdue Welcome DevelopmentTargeted News ServiceMarch 20, 2018 Tuesday 8:04 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 339 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK BodyPEN America issued the following news release:The news that Tibetan writer Shokjang has been released after three years in prison is a cause for celebration, even as the atmosphere for free expression in Tibet remains dark, PEN America said in a statement ?today.Tibetan writer and poet Druklo, who goes by the pen name Shokjang, was sentenced on February 17, 2016, to three years imprisonment for the charge of "inciting separatism." Shokjang was originally arrested on March 19, 2015, making him due for release on March 19, 2018, and Tibetan advocacy groups have indicated that he has been released as scheduled. According to the court, Shokjang's crimes included writing an essay on freedom of religion, sharing online book extracts and news articles, and posting online video footage of police brutality."This is a joyful day for those who support free expression in Tibet, as a writer whose only crime was peacefully expressing himself is now out of prison," said Summer Lopez, Senior Director of Free Expression Programs at PEN America. "However, Shokjang should never have been in prison for his writings and online activity in the first place, and China still routinely and unacceptably labels peaceful cultural or creative expression from Tibetans as a crime. We call on the Chinese government to release all those who remain imprisoned for their writings, in Tibet and throughout China."Shokjang is still under the penalty of two years "deprivation of political rights," limiting his right to be involved in political activities.PEN America's newest report, Forbidden Feeds: Government Controls on Social Media in China, an examination of Chinese censorship of social media, includes an analysis of Chinese policies in Tibet that are abusive of the right to free expression. The report, released March 13, 2018, included Shokjang as an example of Tibetans imprisoned for their online speech.Contact: Anoosh Gasparian, external relations coordinator, agasparian@pen.orgCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6212843 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: March 21, 2018End of Document

Professor creates political commentary through artThe Signal: College of New JerseyFebruary 20, 2018 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 812 wordsByline: Erin KamelBodyBy Erin KamelStaff Writer Multimedia artist Joyce Yu-Jean Lee presented footage of her art installations, which exemplify how visual culture shapes notions of truth and the "other" on Friday, Feb. 16 in Kendall Hall as part of the College's Brown Bag series.Multimedia artist Joyce Yu-Jean Lee presented footage of her art installations, which exemplify how visual culture shapes notions of truth and the "other" on Friday, Feb. 16 in Kendall Hall as part of the College's Brown Bag series.Lee, who teaches at New Jersey City University and the Fashion Institute of Technology, had no plans to become an artist in her early life. She attended the University of Pennsylvania as a double major in communications and psychology with plans to work in fashion marketing. Two weeks after she returned to school from her summer internship in New York City, some of Penn's Wharton School of Business alumni who worked at the World Trade Center were killed during the 9/11 attacks. This changed the way Lee saw the world."If I die tomorrow, with no warning whatsoever, what do I want to be in the middle of doing?" Lee recalled asking herself at the time.Lee turned to art to process what was happening and make sense of the influx of information and images coming from the media following the 9/11 attacks.Lee's interactive illustrations reflect the media's influence on Americans. (Meagan McDowell / Photo Editor)Today, Lee is highly selective in the way she consumes news. She does not watch or own a television. Lee believes our relationship with the media has a profound impact on the way we understand society and view others."While contemporary media washes over us, we can sometimes get lulled to sleep and we don't realize what's happening," Lee said.She encouraged the audience to pause and consider how media influences their perspective of the world around them.Lee's recent project, FIREWALL, a pop-up interactive art installation, was displayed at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City and the Oslo Freedom Forum in Norway. The project compared the disparities of America's Google search engine to China's Baidu in an effort to shed insight on how internet censorship produces different results in different countries, and to create discussion about internet rights and freedoms.FIREWALL garnered the attention of Chinese authorities when Lu Miaoqing, the only lawyer to win two cases over China's single child policy, prepared to participate on Lee's feminist activists panel. The night before the panel, the Chinese government reached out to Miaoqing's law firm and forbade her to work with Lee or to ever speak publicly again. Miaoqing is now on academic asylum in the U.S.Lee's latest exhibit, State of the DysUnion, is on display at NJCU's Visual Arts Gallery until March 1. This project presents a snapshot of today's journalism, advertising and the internet influenced by "alternative facts" and "fake news" discussed in the media.The project is displayed as an eight-foot cylindrical screen.The first chapter shows a variety of news clippings, that include both liberal and conservative articles.The piece rotates front-page international news stories from the day Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election.The next chapter of the installation shows drone footage of the first Women's March in 2017, from every location around the world, overlaid with footage from this past summer's California wildfire. The piece showcases the magnitude of the reaction to Trump's election while the wildfire footage represents how the media builds energy of its own.Lee uses her art to help figure out how to navigate personal agency in the midst of today's confusing media landscape.In her 2012 performative activist exhibition, Made in China, at (e)merge Art Fair, Lee dressed up as a Chinese factory worker with a peddler's cart who created limited edition works of art. Behind her, a screen displayed other factory workers making the products she was selling. This project served as an effort to point at the hypocrisy surrounding the U.S.' relationship with China and trade."Why is it that the pinnacle of American design, which we know of as Apple, is not affordable to the Chinese?" Lee said, challenging the damaging concept of elite design. "And why is it that even though most of the objects are manufactured in their country, they have to make fake stores in order to buy these black market, bootleg items?"Lee feels that artists have a specific role in society - to function as a mouthpiece. They produce works based on the emotions and conditions of the present day, operating as a societal barometer.Through her art, Lee hopes to continue to serve American culture by highlighting important issues that often go undiscussed, and by challenging our country's standards for communication.Related• Brown Bag Series• China• Google• multimedia• politicsLoad-Date: February 20, 2018End of Document

Trade issues affecting soybean exportsOttumwa Courier (Iowa)March 6, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 Ottumwa CourierDistributed by Tribune Content AgencySection: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWSLength: 601 wordsByline: Aaryn Frazier, Ottumwa Courier, IowaBodyMarch 06--OTTUMWA -- America's trade war and soybean exports from Brazil to China could mean trouble for Iowa soybean farmers.Wendong Zhang, assistant professor in the department of economics at Iowa State University said China is an indispensible trade partner. America receives 14 billion from soybean exports alone, but the trade war could have a negative effect on soybean trade and local farmers."If soybeans are retaliated against, there is a direct correlation to Iowans through price and market discovery," said Mark Jackson, previous director of the Iowa Soybean Association. "But whole soybeans are just as important to China's economy as to ours, they have growing hogs and chickens which need protein and soy oil for cooking, though China maintains large soybean inventories."Local farmers are unsure where China's retaliation will strike. New developments in China have leaders and trade members uneasy."Kind of unfortunate but interesting timing," said Zhang. "This week China essentially changed their constitution to remove the two term limit for the Chinese president."The change brought a power play according to Zhang. He said the Chinese government has a diverse range of trading partners to have the opportunity to shop for the best prices. Due to this, America's share of trade with China is declining."I don't expect a major disruption, or to suddenly announce a stop to exports," Zhang said. "But I do think it's moments like this that show how agriculture heavily relies on trade and is highly competitive in the global market."Despite Zhang's assurance there is still cause for concern. If a significant amount of trade is stopped by President Trump's trade tariffs agricultural trade will be open to retaliation."China is well known to protect its own whether through (IPR) Intellectual Property Rights infringements, currency manipulation or total restriction of social media providers other than their own (Baidu vs. Google), to name a few," Jackson said. "Someone always loses short term."Jackson and Zhang agree there has been limits and regulations to past retaliations. But political factors make the 2018 tariffs different than past issues."It all will depend on trade tensions," said Zhang. "History would tell us it is more rhetoric than actual frictions, but now it is a little more unpredictable."Zhang said not to worry too much. The tension opens the door for China to lean more towards Brazil's soybean trade along with Argentina and Uruguay. However, they cannot supply the demand, and Zhang said this should secure a space for American soybean trade."All U.S. farmers and agriculture people in the industry should stand up for trade," Zhang said. "We excel in production and exceed the amount we need here at home. Almost all sectors of agriculture (grain, corn and soybeans) are heavily dependant on trade."Jackson also said keeping peaceful trade is important because solar panels, sorghum and soybeans could be part of trade ban discussions. Halting those trades would be detrimental to U.S. markets."The farming community is watching with trepidation that we are not drawn into the fray, nor that the WTO apply sanctions as well," said Jackson. "However, with Iowa's former Governor Brandstad, current Ambassador to China and Secretary of Ag Perdue and even with Iowa Soybean's China delegation soon to travel to China, maybe the Trump administration will play this differently than his predecessors."___ (c)2018 the Ottumwa Courier (Ottumwa, Iowa) Visit the Ottumwa Courier (Ottumwa, Iowa) at www.ottumwacourier.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.Load-Date: March 7, 2018End of Document

CHAIRMAN ROYCE ON EXPORT CONTROL REFORMSStates News ServiceMarch 14, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 601 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs:Today at 10 a.m., House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce (R-CA) will convene a hearing entitled "Modernizing Export Controls: Protecting Cutting-Edge Technology and U.S. National Security." Live webcast and witness testimony will be available HERE.Below is Chairman Royce's opening statement, as prepared for delivery at the hearing:"Today, the committee will review our export controls and foreign investment review process, which are critical to protecting both our national security and our economic edge.The United States is the world's largest exporter of goods and services. Our trade relationships and our leadership in science, engineering and manufacturing support tens of millions of good-paying American jobs.Alarmingly, our competitive edge is increasingly under attack by policies from China, Russia and others that seek to obtain advanced technologies and intellectual property by hook or crook. As some may recall, in 2011 this committee held a hearing on China's 'indigenous innovation' policy. Then, I noted 'The Chinese government has been turning-up the pressure on U.S. and other foreign businesses to share sensitive technology with Chinese state-owned enterprises as the cost of selling in the Chinese market.' This is especially true today.Making matters worse, our outdated regulatory safeguards have potential gaps that could permit transfers to potential adversaries of the 'know-how' essential to sensitive emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and robotics.In this global economy, turning inward is not the solution to these challenges. But we also cannot allow others to cheat U.S. employers or worse, use our sensitive technology to undermine our national security.That's why Ranking Member Engel and I have introduced the Export Control Reform Act of 2018, which would repeal the expired and Cold War-era Export Administration Act of 1979 and replace it with a modern statutory authority to regulate 'dual-use' items. Under our approach, modernized U.S. export control laws and regulations will continue to have broad authority, governing the transfer of less-sensitive military and dual-use items and technology to foreign persons, whether that transfer takes place abroad or here in the U.S.As governments like Beijing pursue sweeping strategies to acquire advanced technologies from the U.S. and our allies, our bill utilizes unilateral controls where necessary. It will also improve coordination with allies to strengthen export controls and inward investment security.Meanwhile, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) would continue to review certain 'covered transactions' that are defined as the acquisition or control by foreign persons over a U.S. business. The vast majority of these investments are productive and should be welcomed.Modernized U.S. export controls and appropriately crafted CFIUS reforms are complimentary responses to the challenges we face, and together would improve the ability of the U.S. to remain a leader in innovation, strengthen the industrial base and protect technologies essential to national security. Our goal is an efficient regulatory system that promotes both our national security and economic prosperity.We have with us today three practitioners in the field with long experience in the CFIUS process and with U.S. export controls, and we hope their testimony today will provide the committee with insights into how to proceed on these important and challenging issues."###Load-Date: March 14, 2018End of Document

Human Rights: Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria and TibetTargeted News ServiceJanuary 18, 2018 Thursday 7:02 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 655 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: BRUSSELS, Belgium BodyThe European Union's European Parliament issued the following news release:MEPs call for elections in Democratic Republic of Congo, condemn violence in Nigeria and urge China to release human rights activists.Democratic Republic of Congo: government must hold elections on 23 December 2018The European Parliament regrets that the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) did not hold elections by the 2017 deadline and calls on its President Joseph Kabila, and his government to guarantee to hold presidential and legislative elections on 23 December 2018. They add that any EU contribution to the electoral process should be conditional on concrete government measures that demonstrate the political will to hold the elections in December 2018, including the publication of a realistic electoral budget.MEPs ask Congolese authorities to release all prisoners of conscience and to conduct an independent investigation into the violent repression of the demonstrations of December 2017. The European Parliament also urges the International Criminal Court and the UN to investigate the claims put forward by the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), which says Congolese security forces and government-backed militias are perpetrating crimes against humanity in Kasai province, where 40 mass grave sites have been discovered. To combat the escalating cholera epidemic in the DRC, MEPs ask the EU and its member states to increase financial and humanitarian aid through reliable organisations.Nigerian government must step up security effortsThe European Parliament expresses deep concern about the security situation in Nigeria. MEPs call on President Muhammadu Buhari and his government to:* address the increasing inter-ethnic violence between pastoral communities and farmers by negotiating a national policy framework protecting the interests of both groups,* step up the efforts to stop the attacks against Christian and Muslims,* provide psychosocial support to the victims of Boko Haram radicalisation,* reform the Nigerian state security forces and investigate abuses perpetrated by security officials, such as extrajudicial killings, torture and arbitrary arrests, and* implement a moratorium on the death penalty, with a view to its abolition.Moreover, MEPs ask the EU Commission and the European External Action Service to monitor the reintegration of Nigerian returnees from Libya, ensuring that the EU funding is spent effectively and keeping the European Parliament informed about the reintegration measures.China must release human rights activistsThe Chinese government must release blogger Wu Gan, pro-democracy activist Lee Ming-che, Tibetan language rights advocate Tashi Wangchuk, Tibetan monk Choekyi, and all those who are being detained for their human rights work, say MEPs. Pending their release, they add, they must not subjected to torture or ill-treatment and must have access to family and lawyers of their choice.MEPs call for an investigation into allegations that interrogators have used torture to force the confession of human rights lawyer Xie Yang, who was convicted on 26 December 2017 but exempted from criminal penalties after pleading guilty to subversion charges.MEPs express concern that the adoption of security laws in China will impact on minorities, particularly the Counter-terrorism Law, which could lead to the penalisation of the expression of Tibetan culture and Buddhism, and the Foreign NGO Management Law, which places human rights groups under government control. The European Parliament invites High Representative Mogherini and the EU member states to adopt the Foreign Affairs Council's conclusions on China, which would bind EU member states and institutions to a common approach towards human rights in China, thus avoiding unilateral initiatives or acts that might undermine the effectiveness of EU action.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6133698 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: January 19, 2018End of Document

Sino-Global Outlines 2018 Logistics Strategy in Open Letter to ShareholdersPR NewswireMarch 21, 2018 Wednesday 8:30 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1525 wordsDateline: Roslyn, New York, March 21, 2018 Body Sino-Global Shipping America, Ltd. (NASDAQ: SINO) ("Sino-Global", the "Company" or "us"), a non-asset based global shipping and freight logistics integrated solution provider, today announced that its Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Lei Cao, released a Letter to Shareholders highlighting current activities and to outline its corporate strategy for 2018.  The letter is included in its entirety below:To Our Valued Shareholders:We delivered strong results for the fiscal year 2017. We launched an internet-based logistics platform where shippers can connect with independent trucking organizations. We streamlined our operations and improved cash flow. We strengthened our relationships with COSCO as well as several other leading state-owned China companies and have transitioned from a traditional shipping and freight agent company into an integrated global logistics solutions provider. I thank all of our shareholders for their ongoing support. As your company's CEO, I would like to take this opportunity to recap some of the highlights from the previous fiscal year as well as provide you with an update on a few of our recent developments during the fiscal 2017 year and outline our goals for the remainder of fiscal 2018. FY 2017 HighlightsOur turnaround efforts first began in fiscal year 2016.  Our management team and Board of Directors conducted an in-depth review of Sino-Global's business model amid a changing industry landscape in global logistics. We outlined the Company's core strengths and weaknesses and, with the assistance of an outside consultant and the support of our Board, we developed a three-year strategic plan in an effort to transform the Company and expand our focus to an increasingly global strategy, as opposed to a centralized view solely based on the Chinese markets.At the end of 2016, we decided on a new business model with a specific focus on producing revenues from our operations in the U.S. The new model will generate profits via an automated yet powerful online-driven portal by connecting short-haul container trucking companies with clients at the demand end. Our initial steps as a part of our new profit generating business model was to capitalize on management's relationships with China Ocean Shipping (Group) Company ("COSCO"), a world leader in shipping and logistics services. We wanted to offer our shipping partners a solution to the "port to door" transportation dilemma that many of them face. In Sino-Global's fiscal year 2017, we developed and launched a fully functional website-based platform where shippers can connect with independent trucking organizations to arrange for goods to be transported from U.S. ports to their final destination.An ever-present challenge for importers into the United States is an imbalance of goods being transported into the country.  Approximately 90% of the containers that COSCO shipped back from the United States are returned empty, with the 10% often filled with waste-based products. However, the Chinese government recently set new environmental regulations that strictly prohibit the import of such products. As a solution, COSCO has adopted a new way to containerize goods that used to be shipped in bulk ("bulk-to-container"). As mentioned in previous releases, containerization offers suppliers a competitive price to transport their goods from the U.S. to China by utilizing the high rate of empty containers along these routes.Given our long-standing relationship with COSCO, Sino-Global partnered again with the company to cross promote its "bulk-to-container" models on routes from the U.S. to China. Through this partnership, we are able to leverage our newly established on-line portal to strengthen our relationship with a leading shipping conglomerate by providing door-to-door logistics solutions. The effectiveness and profitability of our newly-established business model is evidenced by the improvement of our financials throughout the trial operations period. By fiscal year end, revenues had increased over 56% as compared to the prior year, profit margins had risen to 56.5% as compared to 48.9% (at fiscal year-end 2016) and Sino-Global had turned an operating loss into an operating profit.  Our online logistics platform is off to a great start and we have entered into several agreements to further its growth with COSCO subsidiaries, an in-land transportation company, and with U.S.-based suppliers.In 2017, we leveraged our relationship with COSCO to assist in the build-up of our internet portal. With the portal, we secured the service volume of the container-trucking online portal on demand. We believe this is a great start, but in order for the portal to remain successful we need to continue to provide a significant stable supply of participants on both sides of the platform.On March 14, 2018 we completed a $3 million direct offering and sale of our common stock concurrent with the private placement of Series A and B Warrants to certain accredited investors.   We intend to use a portion of the capital raised towards the further development of our business in the U.S.FY 2018 Prospects:Growth CatalystsOur main objective for the calendar year 2018 is to continuously increase our business in the U.S. and to enhance the core competitiveness of our company in its market sector. To achieve this, we plan to further integrate technology into our business model to yield additional benefits for the Company and our clients. With the aid of specialized technology, we aim to strengthen our profit margins even further and to create efficient profitable opportunities between our logistic service networks in the U.S. and China. Over the long run, we hope to revolutionize and lead the market segment in which we specialize through the precise matching of our clients' needs with service providers.In light of COSCO container shipping route from the U.S. to China, and the rising demand in China for U.S. based products combined with COSCO's empty container shipments rate along these routes (U.S. to China unutilized shipments currently averages around 80-90%), another key objective for 2018 and into fiscal year 2019 is to assist COSCO in the wide spread adoption of containerization. We intend to do this by continuing to build relationships and to partner with suppliers.We have signed two agreements with leading suppliers for trial "bulk-to-container" runs, which were successfully completed and have started the new calendar year with a significant purchase order that we expect will generate approximately $10 million in gross revenue for the Company.  By leveraging our platform and relationships, we believe we can utilize an online-driven platform to take advantage of this trade imbalance on behalf of Sino-Global's primary customers.On behalf of our board of directors and management, we thank you for your continued confidence and interest in Sino-Global. We also ask for your support for our transformation effort, allowing us time and a stable environment to reshape our business model and bring profitable returns for you, our shareholders. Sincerely,Mr. Lei Cao,Chairman and CEOFor a current review of the Company and a copy of this letter, management invites you to access it the Company's websitehttp://www.sino-global.com.About Sino-Global Shipping America, Ltd.Founded in the United States in 2001, Sino-Global Shipping America, Ltd. is a company engaged in shipping, chartering, logistics and related business services.

TIBETAN WRITER HANDED THREE-YEAR PRISON TERM FOR 'INCITING SEPARATISM'States News ServiceFebruary 20, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 420 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:A Tibetan journalist and former political prisoner held incommunicado for over a year in northwestern China's Qinghai province was sentenced last month to a three-year term in prison for "inciting separatism," Tibetan sources said.Tsegon Gyal, 55, was sentenced on Jan. 10 by the People's Intermediate Court in Tsojang (in Chinese, Haibei) Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and was taken to a prison in Qinghai's capital Xining to serve his term, a Tibetan living in exile told RFA's Tibetan Service."Before he was sentenced, he was allowed to visit with his family for the first time since he was taken into custody more than a year ago," RFA's source said, citing sources in the region and speaking on condition of anonymity.First detained on Dec. 9, 2016, Gyal was held for eight months in Qinghai's Kangtsa (Gangcha) county and then tried on May 3, 2017, RFA's source said."The Tsojang People's Intermediate Court put him on trial in secret, with no notice given to his parents or relatives," the source said, adding, "The Chinese government didn't follow due process or allow him a defense attorney."No explanation was given for the long period of time that passed between Gyal's trial last year and his sentencing last month.Gyal had most likely been charged because of a blog post he had published criticizing China for implementing a restrictive policy of "ethnic unity" in the Tibetan areas under its control, the Dharamsala, India-based Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy (TCHRD) said in a Feb. 18 statement."Successive policies and campaigns implemented by Chinese authorities have shown that the unity promoted among 'ethnic groups' is essentially aimed at diluting the distinct cultural and religious identity of Tibetans and other so-called ethnic groups," TCHRD said.Formerly a freelance journalist for newspapers and other media outlets in Qinghai, Gyal also founded a performing musical group for Kangtsa county residents with disabilities which he was later required to hand over to Chinese authorities for management, RFA's source said."In 2015, he offered free food to pilgrims coming to Qinghai Lake from all over Tibet," he said.China has jailed scores of Tibetan writers, artists, singers, and educators for asserting Tibetan national identity and civil rights since widespread protests swept the region in 2008.Reported by Lobe Socktsang for RFA's Tibetan Service.

Experts from 20 countries gather to provide Belt and Road related education for business ownersPR NewswireMarch 30, 2018 Friday 4:30 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 381 wordsDateline: HONG KONG, March 30, 2018 BodyBusiness organization leaders and top entrepreneurs from France, Portugal, Hungary, Poland, Spain and other countries along the Belt and Road region has joined forces under the umbrella of OBOR Education Holdings Limited to launch an online application that would contain highly relevant and customized knowledge geared towards equipping Chinese entrepreneurs with the methodology of carrying out investment and business operations in the region.Since the Chinese government launched the initiative back in 2012, more than 100 countries had expressed their support and willingness to participate in the building of the BRI project.Experts identified that cultural differences result in different sets of business etiquette and ethical practices from country to country will pose a major challenge to foreign business investments targeting the BRI regions. Sun Yusheng, Vice-President of China Central Television pointed out during the BRI International Seminar that there is a need to respect and adopt these practices from different cultures. This will eventually lead to a business's success along the Belt and Road.In mid 2017, experts from 20 countries pooled together expertise and resources to provide Belt and Road related business education. These educative resources are housed in a mobile application - OBOR EDU, made available on iOS and Andriod platforms. The aim of this project is to help Chinese entrepreneurs learn native business knowledge, thereby power the next wave of Chinese business activity in the region.These resources include native business terminology, hiring practices, in depth analysis of sunrise industries, unspoken local business practices and more. The information is provided by highly experienced business organization leaders and successful local entrepreneurs, and curated by a highly acclaimed publisher in China.Business owners across the Belt and Road regions have expressed keen interest in the idea and look forward to making use of these educational resources, in hopes of speeding up their efforts in penetrating the BRI regions. View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/experts-from-20-countries-gather-to-provide-belt-and-road-related-education-for-business-owners-300621540.htmlSOURCE OBOR Education Holdings LimitedCONTACT: Lois, +86-153-1316-0304Load-Date: March 31, 2018End of Document

Citi Will Refund $335 Million in Card Charges: LIVE MARKETS BLOGRealMoneyFebruary 23, 2018 Friday 1:57 PM EDTCopyright 2018 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1300 wordsByline: Tony OwusuHighlight: The charges were related to an interest-rate problem.BodyCiti to Pay Back $335 Million to Customers for Fraudulent Credit Card Charges An interest-rate problem that overcharged customers will force Citigroup  to pay back $355 million, the bank said Friday. The bank failed to lower interest rates on the cards as was required by federal law, resulting in the overcharges. Citigroup increased annual interest rates for customers who missed payments, but federal law requires card issuers to reduce the rate back to the original level if customers begin paying their bills on time. The company said that it delivered about for 90% to the customers affected. The issue affected about 1.75 million credit card accounts. On average, affected customers will receive about $190. China Seizes Control of Anbang Insurance, Owner of Waldorf Astoria Chinese regulators seized control of Anbang Insurance Group due to the precarious nature of the company's finances following suspected illegal activity. Anbang is the owner of the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York, among other high profile holdings. The company will now be overseen by a working group of regulators from various agencies for at least one year. "All transactions of your company, asset trading, information dissemination, contract signing other than traditional insurance business are subject to the consent of the working group," a statement from China's regulators read.  Chinese regulators had slowed the company's ambitious acquisition spree in recent years because of its reliance on the sale short-term investment products and its plan to expand outside of insurance. BMW in Talks to Build EVs in China German carmaker BMW said that it is in talks to build battery-powered electric vehicles in China, which would mark the first time the cars will be made outside of Europe. BMW delivered 560,000 vehicles to China, the world's largest auto market, in 2017, of which, 35,000 were Minis. The Chinese government has stipulated that it wants 20% of vehicles sold in the country to be electric or rechargeable by 2025. New FCC Rules Governing ISPs Goes Into Effect April 23 The Federal Communications Commission will implement its new rules governing how internet service providers administer broadband services to their customers on April 23. The FCC has famously scrapped Obama-era net neutrality rules that mandated against ISPs slowing down internet services for products that may originate from competitors. The practice is known as "throttling." The 60-day delay in implementation does give opponents of the new rule an opportunity to push back against the new directive. On Thursday, the Federal Register, a collection of 23 state attorney generals, filed a lawsuit against the FCC's decision in the U.S. Court of appeals for the D.C. circuit. "An open internet, and the free exchange of ideas it allows, is critical to our democratic process," said Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney general who is leading the charge. "Repealing net neutrality will allow internet service providers to put corporate profits over consumers by controlling what we see, do, and say online. Consumers and businesses in New York and across the country have the right to a free and open internet, and our coalition of attorneys general won't stop fighting to protect that right."Opening Bell U.S. markets were looking to capitalize on the bit of momentum that the Dow and S&P built in trading Thursday while the Nasdaq was looking to avoid a five-session losing streak Friday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average started trading up 0.55%, or 137 points, to 25,100 out of the gate, while the S&P 500 rose 0.57%, or 15 points, to 2,719 and the Nasdaq rose 0.66%, or 46 points, to 7,256.The Dow's gains were driven by strong sessions from Intel Corp.  , up more than 2%, and McDonald's Corp.  , up 1.5%.The Dow and S&P are still down overall for the holiday-shortened week.Commodities markets were mixed Friday. After starting the day in negative territory, industry benchmark Brent crude prices were flat at $66.39 per barrel while West Texas crude prices fell 0.06% to $62.73.PlayStation Videogame Network Goes Down for 4th Time This Year Gamers looking for access to Sony's  PlayStation Network were frustrated last night after the network went down for the fourth time in 2018 and the second time in February. "You may have some difficulty launching games, applications, or online features," Sony's PSN page said last night. "Our engineers are working to resolve the issue as soon as possible, and we thank you for your patience."Sony has since restored service to the network. Oil Prices Fall on Record U.S. Output If the steady 10.27 million barrels of oil a day the U.S. produced last week is confirmed by monthly figures then the bull rally in oil prices could hit a snag.Industry benchmark Brent crude prices fell 0.23%, or 15 cents, to $66.24 while West Texas crude declined 0.1%, or 6 cents, to $62.71. Major oil plays were not moving premarket Friday, but could face pressure Friday.A supply glut dropped oil prices as low as the high $30's in recent years, but crude prices have steadily risen over the past 18 months as the OPEC oil cartel has cut production in order to increase prices and spur demand.However, those efforts have been stymied by a suddenly robust U.S. oil market. U.S. shale plays are producing oil at record rates as exports have also increased. Crude exports rose to more than 2 million barrels per day last week, close to the record of 2.1 million barrels that was reached in October.In spite of the steady production, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that crude stocks fell unexpectedly by 1.6 million barrels last week. The decline was blamed on low import figures.Toyota Takes Top Spots in Consumer Reports Rankings Toyota Motor  may not be the biggest car maker by sales volume anymore, but it is the best, according to Consumer Reports 2018 rankings.The consumer magazine named Toyota vehicles top in their class in four of the 10 categories that were ranked.The Toyota Corolla was ranked best compact car, the Camry was ranked top midsize car, the Highlander won best midsize SUV and the Sienna was the industry's top minivan."Part of what helps Toyota is just really impressive reliability across the board," said Jake Fisher, director of automotive testing for Consumer Reports."Our continued commitment to bringing quality products with key safety technologies to our customers remains a top priority," Toyota said in a statement.General Mills to Purchase Natural Pet Food Co. Blue Buffalo Consumer food product maker General Mills  announced plans to purchase natural pet food maker Blue Buffalo Pet Products  in an all-cash deal worth nearly $8 billion. General Mills offered $40 per share for the company, a 17.2% premium over the company's Thursday closing price. Shares of the company were up nearly 18% premarket to $40.15. General Mills says that the deal will be neutral to its cash earnings per share in 2019 and will begin to add to its bottom line in fiscal 2020. Premarket U.S. futures indicated a positive opening for markets Friday as the Dow and S&P look to build momentum off of Thursday's volatile day of trading. Dow futures were rising 0.32%, indicating an opening 81 points higher to 25,094 while S&P futures rose 0.21%, indicating an open 6 points higher to 2,717. Nasdaq futures rose 0.26%, indicating an open 18 points higher after the Nasdaq was the lone index to fall in trading Thursday.Asian markets had a strong day of trading with the three major average all closing the day well into the green. The Shanghai Composite rose 0.63% while the Hang Seng jumped 0.98% and the Nikkei gained 0.72%. Markets in Europe were struggling with the FTSE 100 and CAC 40 both falling about 0.2% while the DAX in Germany was basically flat. Load-Date: February 25, 2018End of Document

Samsung found guilty of infringing on 4G technology patents owned by HuaweiThe Acorn: Drew UniversityJanuary 14, 2018 SundayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 384 wordsByline: Joey PayneBodyAs a result of its lack of deals with any major carriers, Huawei has an insignificant market share in the USA, the world's second-largest market after only China.Shortly before Huawei was expected to announce its partnership with AT&T at the Consumer Electronics Show this week, reports said the carrier suddenly exited the deal.Media speculation alleged that the company is in talks to release its Huawei Mate 10 Pro in sales through the AT&T operator.The letter to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, which was signed by 18 lawmakers, noted concerns about Chinese companies in the USA telecommunications industry. Huawei said it complies with the law.Richard Yu, the chief executive of Huawei's consumer products division, did not beg off from his scheduled appearance at the CES Expo, and proceeded to address Huawei's failure to clinch the U.S. carrier deal.It's a likely good and interesting phone, but AT&T's reported late-inning desire to back out of a deal with the company leaves Huawei in a lurch in a country where the vast majority of smartphone purchases are still done through carriers at subsidized rates.The Huawei's CEO of the Consumer unit, Richard Yu, told a broad audience at the CES Technology Fair in Las Vegas that the deal with a United States operator "unfortunately" has not been achieved.The letter notes the committee's concerns "about Chinese espionage in general, and Huawei's role in that espionage in particular"."We win the trust of the Chinese carriers, we win the trust of the emerging markets. and also we win the trust of the global carriers, all the European and Japanese carriers", he said. According to the Wall Street Journal, AT&T pulled out of the deal at the last minute due to concerns relating to Huawei's ties with the Chinese government. In the meantime, Huawei Mobile celebrated and welcomed the New Year and also took the opportunity to officially inaugurate the Huawei Mate 10 Pro at Aeon Mall in Phnom Penh. Other countries around the world do not have that issue with Huawei.It has to allocate some budget to enhance its public image in the United States, and even seek the assistance of partners like Google to promote its business.The US continually criticises China for not opening its market wider and not providing a level playing field for foreign companies.Load-Date: January 14, 2018End of Document

Ctrip CEO Jane Sun Article on Female Presence and InnovationPR NewswireMarch 7, 2018 Wednesday 7:45 PM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 938 wordsDateline: SHANGHAI, March 7, 2018 BodyCtrip continues to enhance female presence and gender equalityAs 2018's International Women's Day approaches, Ctrip's CEO Jane Sun shared her thoughts on women's presence, their contributions to innovation and the importance of tackling the issue of the 'Glass Ceiling' in the workforce.Ctrip CEO Jane Sun's ArticleShattering the 'Glass Ceiling': Greater female presence needed for innovationBy Jane Sun, CEO of CtripWomen have been asking for equal labor right and social status since the establishment of the International Women's Day in 1910. It is common sense for a responsible company to provide equal career development and remuneration for women. According to the report by theEconomist, the rate of Chinese women's participation in the workplace is almost 70%, higher than most of developed economies like the US, EU and Japan.We are now in the midst of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, an era characterized by technological fusions and the integration of Artificial Intelligence, Big Data and Cloud Computing. This has catalyzed our creativity and bridged the physical gap between individuals. Men and women have equal rights in intelligence and competency.Technology advancement has provided women with more opportunities and broader platform for career development. We have discovered that women also play a crucial role in internet companies. In Bloomberg's report, 17% of venture capital companies' partners are female in China. In the US, this number rests at 10%. While 80% of venture capital companies in China have at least one female partner, in the US, this is only 50%.Ctrip is a leading internet travel company in the world and China's largest. Women represent over more than half of our 30,000 plus employee base. This rate far exceeds the average internet companies in China and Silicon Valley. Ctrip from day one, 18 years ago, have promoted gender equality. We recruit based on each employee's competency level and we have a series of policies to encourage workplace growth for women. We adhere firmly to United Nation Women's Empowerment Principles.From our experience, women have played important roles driving good corporate governance and fostering a culture of teamwork. Decisions made by female leadership are more meticulous and balances risk and reward better. Actions are execute with more communication, consideration and organization. Fiscal policies are gear towards long-term sustainability.Our female employees have foster teamwork and communication, and are more open to different perspectives. This has complemented well with our male employee base that are generally very good at fast execution. Our organizational diversity and the qualities that women bring to the table has help enable Ctrip to generate large and sustainable investment returns for our stakeholders through the years. I feel it is critically important to encourage and incorporate the female voice. It will also help greatly to have more women leadership devote more time to provide guidance and become role models for aspiring women.Disconcertedly, figures show workplace gender equality still has a long way to go. Only 10% of Fortune Global 500 Companies have female Directors on their boards. And only 3% of these companies have female CEOs. Internet companies' female representation is even lower. In many of these companies, it is rare to see any female leadership in key management positions.Technology companies represent innovation and revolution. I think it is only fitting that we see more and more technology companies take on leading roles in fostering equal rights for women, provide processes for women to grow their careers, and most importantly, shatter any sort of 'glass ceiling'. And to further reinforce the point, shattering the 'glass ceiling' is not just about recruiting more women. It is about giving women equal opportunities to take on more leadership roles. There are more than 1,000 executives represented in the Top 100 US companies. The large majority of women are in supportive roles such as HR, PR and legal adviser. Seldom do we see women taking on key management roles.We are making some breakthroughs though. In recent years, a quarter of entrepreneurs in China are women. And I am most delighted to learn that 55% of new internet companies are started by women in China, according to the Chinese government. We are progressing as an industry. For Ctrip, female leadership, is already well represented, with nine women leaders including myself, forming our key management team. Women also help lead many of the technological developments and innovations at Ctrip. Out of our 7,000 engineers, roughly 30% are female engineers. Ctrip has demonstrated that women can be as good as men in technology development too.As the Women's Rights Movement continues, and in light of International Women Day, I hope more and more women can be liberate from traditional family roles and given more opportunities to work alongside their male counterparts in driving growth and innovation. Every company has the responsibility to instill a gender equality foundation to create a fair environment for our future generations. Ctrip will continue to lead the charge for equal rights for women and provide a broad platform for females to contribute and grow meaningfully in the workforce.For further information, please contact:International PRCtrip.com International, ltd.Tel: (+86) 21 3406 4880 ext 196455Email:Pr@ctrip.com View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ctrip-ceo-jane-sun-article-on-female-presence-and-innovation-300610404.htmlSOURCE Ctrip.com International, Ltd.Load-Date: March 8, 2018End of Document

Focusing on 5G End-to-End Solutions, ZTE Establishes Industry Leadership on Eve of 5G CommercializationPR NewswireFebruary 6, 2018 Tuesday 3:05 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1561 wordsDateline: SHENZHEN, China, Feb. 6, 2018 BodyZTE Corporation (0763.HK / 000063.SZ), a major international provider of telecommunications, enterprise and consumer technology solutions for the Mobile Internet, was early in identifying the opportunities opened by 5G and on developing a 5G strategy, as commercial deployments of 5th generation mobile networks, more widely known as 5G, approaches.  With a focus on 5G end-to-end solutions, the company has pulled out all the stops in terms of standards formulation, research and development and validation of 5G technologies, in a move to establish industry leadership in the core technologies, the commercialization and the economies of scale for the next generation of mobile networks.Continuously Setting Industry Benchmarks with Leading 5G TechnologiesZTE has placed a strong bet on 5G and has backed up that bet with a team of more than 4,500 high-tech talents devoted to 5G research backed by an annual investment of three billion yuan.In addition to taking the lead in promoting massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology, which will be key to significantly improving spectrum efficiency as well as expanding network capacity and coverage in the 5G era, ZTE was the first to apply 5G technology on a 4G network, enabling commercial 5G deployments ahead of schedule and improving the spectrum efficiency of the 4G network by a factor of eight.The early moves have helped both operators and users benefit from 5G technology, while accelerating progress of Massive MIMO deployments amid continuous innovation, in addition to contributing technology proposals including test data results to 5G standards.In order to meet the requirement for massive network access across 5G networks, industry-wide non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been proposed, with the Multi User Shared Access (MUSA) solution, the one proposed by ZTE, being the selected candidate. The solution enables the system to support 3-6 times of number of user accesses using the same time-frequency resources, allowing for genuinely conflict-free scheduling and greatly reducing terminal power consumption.In China's second phase of 5G testing, the MUSA technology achieved a performance of 90 million connections/MHz/hour, far exceeding the benchmark defined by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).Because of the originality of the leading edge MUSA technology, ZTE, as the first drafter, led the adoption of NOMA by the 3GPP RAN Working Group 1, the group responsible for the specification of the physical layer of the radio interface (radio layer 1) for 5G New Radio (NR), driving the development of industrial standards.At the same time, with strong chip design and development ability, ZTE launched the industry's highest integrated next generation baseband unit (NG BBU) based on a proprietary high-performance vector processing baseband chip developed in-house, and followed with the development of the industry's lightest and smallest 5G active antenna unit (AAU) based on a highly integrated digital IF chip.In China's first and second phase of 5G testing, ZTE's 5G base station not only fulfilled the basic requirements, but also completed the 26 GHz high-frequency field test, with outstanding void performance results. Today, ZTE launched China's third phase of 5G testing with a full range of 5G products, and completed the roll out of equipment to the market and end-to-end debugging of commercial solutions.Taking theLead in 5G Commercialization andPuttingTogether aGlobalPortfolio byEnteringHigh-endMarketsBased on ZTE's many 5G innovations, several of the world's leading mobile network operators have chosen to partner with ZTE.In 2017, ZTE partnered with more than 20 of the world's leading mobile network operators in terms of 5G collaborations, including opening China's first 5G pre-commercial base station with China Mobile, initiating the first 5G field test with Japan's SoftBank and building Europe's first 5G pre-commercial network, among others.Operators have lined up to collaborate with ZTE on commercializing 5G, including designing the strategy and rolling out field tests. Citing a few examples, Telefonica and ZTE have completed the 5G network architecture and load bearing test, and will further validate 5G end-to-end solutions. Orange plans to conduct a multi-site 5G independent networking architecture test with ZTE in Europe during 2018. China Mobile and ZTE have built an experimental network closely mirroring the real environment of 5G in Guangzhou province in a move to validate the 5G continuous networking capability, and plan to further expand the scale of the experimental network to cover most of Guangzhou in 2018. When carrying out the first 5G pre-commercial test in Xiong'an and Suzhou, China Telecom chose ZTE to explore innovative applications in vertical segments of the industry. In addition, the first 5G NR new open field test site constructed by China Unicom and ZTE has also completed service verification, achieving a peak rate of 2Gbps for a single UE.In November 2017, ZTE partnered with Qualcomm and China Mobile to jointly complete the world's first end-to-end system test based on the 3GPP R15 standard, making full use of the ultra-high bandwidth and zero wait capability of the 5G network.ZTE has already launched a series of products for 5G commercial applications, including a 5G series of access equipment, diversified 5G bearing solutions, a flexible and efficient 5G core network, among other products covering high and low frequency bands, fully preparing operators whose goals are to achieve large-scale commercial deployment of 5G in 2019.Creating theMostCompetitiveCommercialNetwork withLeading 5GEconomies ofScaleThe goal of all governments and operators, as things stand today, is to generally have 5G in commercial use by 2020. The Chinese government plans to establish the world's largest 5G commercial network by then. In anticipation of the economic benefits that can be expected as a result of large-scale 5G deployments in China, ZTE plans to accelerate the pace at which the company reaches a level of maturity with its 5G infrastructure products and massively improve the scalability, providing operators worldwide with the most competitive 5G commercial network while taking a leadership role in terms of economies of scale.In the 5G era, time-division duplex or TDD will play an even more important role in new 5G spectrum. Leveraging advanced TDD technology, ZTE offers all-line, multi-scenario and flexible 5G solutions, all of which were developed on the back of the firm's extensive experience in product development and network operation. Its TDD shipments have, for several consecutive years, accounted for one third of the world's total. ZTE plans to make full use of its advantages that the company developed during the 4G era to lay a solid and industry-leading foundation for 5G's advanced commercialized use and cost savings.The largest 5G commercial network in China is expected to bring economies of scale, offering operators benefits in experience and cost.Currently, ZTE's 5G-line solutions flexibly support different scenarios and provide the most cost-efficient network deployments. ZTE's leading role is highly acclaimed by the renowned consultant firm Ovum. According to the latest report released by the consultancy, in terms of six 5G product lines - Massive MIMO technology, 5G-line base stations, 5G carrier, backhaul/fronthaul, 5G core networks and terminals -, ZTE is one of only two vendors worldwide that can offer comprehensive 5G end-to-end solutions, as a result of their having a more comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the demands of every aspect of a 5G network.Relying on the leadership that ZTE has across the three key drivers of 5G technologies - commercialization, economies of scale and innovation in the core technologies -, the international telecommunications provider anticipates that it will maintain its leadership position in the 5G era, promoting commercialization of 5G worldwide.About ZTEZTE is a provider of advanced telecommunications systems, mobile devices, and enterprise technology solutions to consumers, carriers, companies and public sector customers. As part of ZTE's strategy, the company is committed to providing customers with integrated end-to-end innovations to deliver excellence and value as the telecommunications and information technology sectors converge.

Giant mobile phone was denounced for espionageCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 26, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 217 wordsBody The president of the Huawei telecommunications company, Ken Hu, left Monday in defense of his company in the face of accusations of espionage and assured that there are no facts to corroborate them .  "The discussions and the debates have to be based on facts, not on suspicions," Hu told reporters in Barcelona, ??where the Mobile World Congress is held , the largest show in the world in the sector , according to his words translated from Chinese into English. .  "We provide products for 400 operators, we have a solid history in terms of safety, safety is one of our top priorities," he added.  According to the press, Huawei lost a contract with telecoms operator AT & T that would have allowed it to enter the US market because of suspicions that the company provides information to the Chinese government . The founder of the group is an ex-engineer of the Chinese army and is credited with close relations with the army and government of Beijing, something that Huawei denies.  The US authorities even asked Australia not to use Huawei material to deploy a 5G mobile internet network in the country, according to the Australian press.  "The Huawei headquarters are in China and if that is enough to be considered as a group that can not be trusted, it is very problematic," Hu said in Barcelona. Load-Date: February 26, 2018End of Document

Nokia CEO: U.S., China lead 5G race, but U.S. needs to make midband spectrum availableFierceWirelessFebruary 26, 2018 Monday 9:20 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Questex Media Group LLC All Rights ReservedSection: ARTICLELength: 627 wordsByline: Monica AllevenHighlight: BARCELONA, Spain—The U.S. and China are leading the race to 5G, but the U.S. needs to get more aggressive when it comes to spectrum, according to Nokia CEO Rajeev Suri, who kicked off Mobile World Congress 2018 on Sunday.BodyBARCELONA, Spain—The U.S. and China are leading the race to 5G, but the U.S. needs to get more aggressive when it comes to spectrum, according to Nokia CEO Rajeev Suri.“It’s a neck-and-neck race between the U.S. and China to see who will be first to deploy," Suri said on the eve of the Mobile World Congress 2018 trade show.While it’s very hard at this point to say who will be first, he said he could say two things with confidence. The first is that the U.S. needs to be more aggressive on spectrum and make 100 megahertz available per operator in the mid bands—particularly in the 3 to 4 GHz range—in order to complement the low and high bands that are already available. “This should be an urgent priority for policy makers in the U.S.,” he said.The second thing is both China and the U.S. will move fast, they will be big and they will be well ahead of pretty much every other part of the world. Beyond that, Japan and South Korea also will be fast movers; Japan has a clear eye on making 5G ready for the 2020 Olympics, and Nokia is there working with NTT DoCoMo. In South Korea, Nokia is working with Korea Telecom with a focus on immersive experiences at large sporting events, among other things.Clearly, Suri is disappointed that Europe is not leading; Nokia’s home base is Finland, and even though it has always been on the cutting edge of technology in the mobile industry, the country is not leading the race to 5G.Part of the problem in Europe, according to Suri, is there are too many operators; plus, the average revenue per user is far lower than the U.S. or Japan. There will be 5G in Europe—there’s no doubt about that—it’s just mostly lagging. Consolidation is needed among operators, for one thing, he said.Suri ticked through the 5G work Nokia is doing with carriers around the world and in the U.S.—he specifically called out Verizon and T-Mobile. With Verizon, Nokia has a lot of activity underway and recently celebrated the first 5G call based on the 3GPP standards. The 4K video call used Nokia 5G network technology and a 5G NR prototype device provided by Qualcomm Technologies on Verizon’s licensed 28 GHz spectrum. RELATED: Verizon boasts first 5G call using 3GPP-based standardsWith T-Mobile, Nokia’s partnership includes deployment on 600 MHz and Nokia was involved in a 5G data session using 28 GHz on a commercial radio system in the busy downtown corridor of Bellevue, Washington. Separately, Nokia and T-Mobile recently reported progress on the LAA front after they had achieved download speeds of 1.3 Gbps using Nokia’s commercial AirScale platform to support 14-layer transmissions.   RELATED: T-Mobile achieves 1.3 Gbps speeds with Nokia using LAADuring a media question-and-answer session, when asked to comment on the status of its work with AT&T, Suri declined to reveal any specifics but said the vendor is working with all the big and some of the smaller operators in the U.S.Nokia also just inked an agreement with China Mobile. And Suri said Nokia would release early this week more information about a special project with Vodafone, which will be “out of this world,” literally, he said.He was also asked to comment on how ZTE and Huawei have been effectively banned from the U.S. market by a government worried about Chinese spying, and whether that gives Nokia and fellow European vendor Ericsson an unfair advantage. “Not really,” he said, noting Samsung is also a player in the U.S. “This is a competitive industry, period. There’s no easy market.” Huawei and ZTE have denied their equipment could be used for espionage.All in all, while other things are going on besides 5G, Suri's message was clear: 5G is coming faster than the industry expected even eight months ago and Nokia expects to be there in a big way.Load-Date: February 27, 2018End of Document

Huawei fails to clinch smartphone deal with AT&TCNNMoney.comJanuary 9, 2018 Tuesday 4:25 AM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: TECHNOLOGYLength: 534 wordsByline: Sherisse PhamBodyHuawei's hopes that AT&T would sell its smartphones in the United States have been dashed.The Chinese tech firm was trying to clinch its first partnership with a major U.S. mobile carrier, but the talks "fizzled out at the last minute," according to a person familiar with the matter.Huawei has struggled to make a meaningful entry into the U.S., partly because of official concerns that its technology could be used by the Chinese government to gather intelligence -- allegations Huawei has repeatedly denied.Deals between smartphone makers and wireless carriers fall through on occasion for a variety of reasons, and it was not immediately clear what caused the talks with AT&T to fail.They had not been publicly confirmed but were reported by The Information and Bloomberg last year.The collapse of the talks -- first reported by The Wall Street Journal -- comes at an awkward time for Huawei."We have been harmed again," Richard Yu, head of Huawei's consumer business, was quoted as saying by the South China Morning Post.Yu is expected to announce Tuesday at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas that the company's latest high-end smartphone will go on sale in the U.S.The phone, the Mate 10 Pro, sells for about $800 in China, where it is a direct competitor to the iPhone X.A deal with AT&T would have helped boost sales of the splashy new device. Having the backing of a major wireless carrier is key to making inroads in the U.S."The U.S. market presents unique challenges for Huawei, and while the Huawei Mate 10 Pro will not be sold by U.S. carriers, we remain committed to this market now and in the future," Huawei said in a statement. "U.S. customers need a better choice, and as a leader in technology and innovation, Huawei is prepared to fill this need."AT&T declined to comment.It is battling in court to save its $85 billion deal to buy CNN's parent company, Time Warner. The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit to block the takeover.Related: Investors to Apple: Fight iPhone addiction among kidsHuawei is the world's third largest smartphone maker behind Samsung and Apple. It is also a leading provider of telecom equipment in Asia, Europe and Latin America.But the U.S. market has proved to be a tough one to crack.Huawei's telecom networks business remains effectively shut out from selling equipment to big American telecom companies after Congress issued a critical report in 2012. Lawmakers suggested that Huawei equipment could pose a threat to national security -- allegations that the Chinese company described as "baseless."As for smartphones, Huawei already outsells both Apple and Samsung in its home market of China. It also makes the second most popular Android phone in France, Italy, Germany, and Spain, according to Kantar Worldpanel.But Huawei has less than 1% of the U.S. smartphone market, according to the research firm.Currently, U.S. consumers have to buy Huawei's smartphones without a wireless plan at Walmart or Best Buy.In an interview with CNN last February, Yu said the company wanted to become the world's number one smartphone maker in the next five years. Lack of progress in the world's largest economy will make that much harder to achieve.Load-Date: January 11, 2018End of Document

Why Trump's tariffs on China are a big dealCNNMoney.comMarch 20, 2018 Tuesday 3:06 PM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: ECONOMYLength: 685 wordsByline: Patrick GillespieBodyMain Street and Wall Street are bracing as the United States prepares to levy more tariffs on China.President Trump on Thursday directed the US trade representative to level tariffs on about $50 billion worth of Chinese imports.What's expected to happenIn the next 15 days, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer will publish a list of products that his team intends to hit with tariffs. It's not clear how high the individual tariffs will be.The United States also plans to impose new investment restrictions and take action against China at the World Trade Organization.Related: Trade war would wipe out the gains from tax cuts, Penn analysis saysWhy it matters1. The Trump administration is turning its tough talk on trade into action this year.2. Chinese officials are warning that they will retaliate with tariffs on US exports to China. They haven't been specific yet, though.3. Investors, economists and policymakers are worried about a China-US trade war that could embroil the global economy.4. Americans buy lots of Chinese-made goods. Prices will likely go up for shoppers. How much is anyone's guess.So there's a lot at stake, from Wall Street to your local Walmart.Trump administration officials say fears of a trade war are overblown. And the tariffs are essentially delivering on a campaign promise: Trump told voters he would get tough on China, accusing it of stealing US jobs.The $50 billion question is whether Trump's tariffs, and the likely Chinese retaliation, will create or kill more American jobs.What does China have to say about this?China sharply warned Trump again on Tuesday."A trade war does no good to anyone. There is no winner," China's Premier Li Keqiang said at a press conference in Beijing.China can push back on the United States. For example, it is one of the biggest buyers of US crops, including soybeans or sorghum. China could put a tariff on those, or decide to buy more soy from places like Brazil and Argentina.China is also the biggest creditor of the United States: It owns more US government bonds than any other country. And it recently cut some of its US debt holdings, though investors don't currently expect China to immediately dump its US debt.How we got hereIn August, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer launched an investigation into Chinese theft of US intellectual property, including software, cell phone apps and technology patents.The US economy is driven by businesses that provide services like technology companies. So China's theft of intellectual property hits at a real strength in the US economy.The United States focused on four allegations by American companies against China. The companies allege:1. Chinese firms force them into partnerships, then steal their technology and eventually end the joint venture.2. Chinese companies are using government funds to steal American tech secrets and innovation.3. China uses "cyber intrusions" into US commercial networks to spy on US commerce.4. American companies operating in China don't have the same property rights that Chinese firms do.The Trump administration said Thursday it found ample evidence that China is guilty of each accusation.Trump invoked a rarely used 1974 trade law to justify the case. President Reagan used the law 49 times during his administration, but it gradually fell out of practice after the World Trade Organization was created in 1995. It's one of Trump's many tools to hit other countries with tariffs without congressional approval.In this particular case, trade experts widely agree with the Trump administration that China has cheated and stolen, and that it should pay a price. The administration's diagnosis is correct, economists say. The remedy is where people differ.? CNN's Steven Jiang and Tim Schwarz contributed reporting from Beijing. Jeremy Diamond contributed reporting from Washington.? Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly said that Ronald Reagan was the last president to invoke the Trade Act of 1974. It was last used by President Barack Obama in 2010, although President Reagan was most famous for invoking it.Load-Date: March 27, 2018End of Document

Global Clinical Decision Support Systems Market to Reach $10.82 Billion by 2025; Global Clinical Decision Support Systems Market to Reach $10.82 Billion by 2025PR NewswireJanuary 9, 2018 Tuesday 4:52 PM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2050 wordsDateline: LONDON, Jan. 9, 2018 BodyDownload the full report:https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/5272864The global clinical decision support systems (CDSS) market comprises of software and services which help healthcare providers reduce the rate of medical errors during the healthcare delivery process. This, hence, significantly aid in improving clinical outcomes and facilitate reduction in healthcare costs.The market has evolved dramatically as a result of rising number of deaths due to medical errors, changing reimbursement models and healthcare delivery framework. These changes have fuelled the level of investments in the clinical decision support systems.Although, the major contributors to these changes remain rising healthcare costs and rapidly increasing rate of hospital readmissions. In order to combat these adverse events, healthcare organisations are now more focused towards achieving evidence based clinical outcomes with the help of CDSS tools which generate alerts to prevent any misdiagnosis during any medical process.The healthcare system is also expected to witness the shortage of physicians in the upcoming years enhancing the need of decision making tools in order to effectively manage physician time and prevent the overcrowding of hospitals due to increased medical needs.Management of physicians' time is an important aspect in clinical diagnosis and is reflected from the fact that approximately 32% of the medical errors are caused due to shortage of physicians' time for the patient's assessment which significantly enhances the chances of misdiagnosis or an adverse event.Despite the benefits of clinical decision support systems, these decision making tools are experiencing a low adoption rate because of challenges pertaining to their implementation. CDSS tools are perceived by physicians as a threat to their professional autonomy.In addition to this, physicians do not appreciate the idea of overreliance on a device and prefer to rely more on their own expertise gained over the several years of medical practice. Another barriers for low adoption of CDSS solutions include lack of integration with existing patient information systems and perceived disruption of clinical workflow, among othersHowever, the demand for these systems will be catalysed by the ongoing healthcare reforms across the world to improve patient care and satisfaction, reduce hospital readmission rates in order to reduce increasing healthcare costs. With the seamless integration of CDSS with EHR systems, their adoption rate is likely to increase in the upcoming years.Furthermore, the global CDSS market is expected to expand manifolds in the upcoming years with Artificial Intelligence powered automation which has the potential to automate entire clinical workflow of an organisation. Hence, the day is not too far when diagnosis and prescription orders given by a physician will be replaced by intelligent systemsThe market report is well designed to provide an all-inclusive field of vision for the market in terms of various factors influencing it such as recent trends, technological advancements, and regulatory environment of the market. The scope of this report is centred upon conducting a detailed study of the solutions allied with the global clinical decision support systems market.The market has been segmented into Product, Mode of Delivery, Application, Model, User Interactivity and Geographical Regions. The report presents the reader with an opportunity to unlock comprehensive insights with respect to the market and helps in forming well informed strategic decisions. The research uncovers some of the substantial parameters that must be taken into consideration before entering into the market.This research report aims at answering various aspects of the global clinical decision support systems market with the help of the key factors driving the market, threats that can possibly inhibit the overall growth of the market and the current investment opportunities that are going to shape the future trajectory of the market expansion. The study considers the growth-share matrix model for a comprehensive study of the global clinical decision support systems market and assesses the factors governing the same.The answers to the following key questions can be derived from this report:· What is the Total Addressable Market (TAM), Segmental Addressable Market (SAM) and the potential market opportunity of the global clinical decision support systems market?· What are the major market drivers, challenges and opportunities in the global clinical decision support systems market and their case studies?· What is the market share of the leading segments and sub-segments of the global clinical decision support systems market in 2017 and 2025?· What did the CDSS market evolve and what are the factors that necessitated its evolution?· How will each segment of the clinical decision support systems market grow during the forecast period and what will be the revenue generated by each of the segments by the end of 2025?· What will be the consumer preferences in terms of adoption of clinical decision support systems during the forecast period?· What are the key developmental strategies implemented by the key players to stand out in this market?· What is the preferred model used for building clinical decision support systems and how will this segment grow during the forecast period?· How will the most preferred mode of software delivery grow during the forecast period?· Which application segment will be the highest revenue generator in this industry during the forecast period?· What will be the scope of clinical decision support systems market in the emerging countries during the forecast period?The key players who have significant contributions to the Global Clinical Decision Support System industry are Cerner Corporation, McKesson Corporation, Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc., The National Decision Support Company, Zynx Health, VisualDx, FirstDataBank, Elsevier B.V, IBM Corporation (through acquisition of Truven Health Analytics).Executive SummaryDespite great measures undertaken in the development of healthcare information technologies, uncertainty still lies at the core of most of the aspects of medical decision making. For instance, globally, preventable medication errors cost over $1 trillion each year, of which the U.S. economy alone incurs $21 billion.Dosing errors, drug allergies and harmful drug interactions account for over 50% of these errors. This has prompted the need to provide means for clinicians to receive the relevant knowledge and research based evidence necessary for safe, effective and efficient clinical decision making.Technology interventions through deployment of clinical decision support systems (CDSS) such as e-prescribing systems, Bar Code Electronic Medication Administration System (eMAR) and Computerized Physician Order Entry (CPOE) could reduce these errors by over 85%.The healthcare reforms across the globe have forced organizations to rapidly re-evaluate how physicians, nurses, and other providers access and utilize clinical information. CDSS is considered to be one of the key drivers of meaningful healthcare reforms in the recent times. CDSS is a health IT system that assists physicians and other health professionals with clinical decision-making tasks, supporting them in diagnosis and treatment.CDSS has proven to be effective at improving outcomes at several state-of-the-art health care institutions by reducing adverse drug events, medication-related errors and costs by millions of dollars per year even within single hospitals. The global CDSS market is expected to expand manifold during the forecast period with the emergence of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Machines capable of deciphering physicians' notes from hospital or clinic encounters, radiology and procedure reports, prescriptions and lab result data are expected to become common within the next decade.Despite promising initial advantages, a majority of clinical decision support systems has not provided features beyond general alerts, reminders, summary dashboards, and automated information retrieval systems. CDSS technology is still in its nascent stage and continuous input from clinicians, patients, and other stakeholders will be essential for correctly implementing the technology to enhance meaningful uses, reduce costs and improve treatment outcomes.The global CDSS market is being driven by the increasing demand for IT solutions to effectively reduce the healthcare costs. The rising number of chronic diseases and technical advancements in big data such as use of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) are further propelling the growth of the market. While there has been considerable proliferation of CDSS in North America, the lack of tech savvy medical professionals in the emerging countries is inhibiting its adoption in these markets.However, with the rise in the awareness campaigns conducted by local governments such as those of Brazil, and Mexico, the adoption rates are expected to surge. Moreover, as most of the hospitals operate on tight budgets, high costs of CDSS have been limiting their integration. Furthermore, recent security breaches is one of the major concerns for CDSS vendors which can be overcome by the development of data exchange solutions using Block-Chain technology.The need to reduce medical errors and patient readmission is the main driver for the use of any decision support system in a healthcare organization. In the U.S. alone, hospitals spent more than $50 billion in 2015 to treat patients readmitted within 30 days of discharge.By promoting post-discharge medication adherence and more consistent follow-up appointments, CDSS helps prevent deterioration that may contribute to avoidable readmissions. This is especially valuable for patients with chronic conditions. With intelligent CDSS platforms, hospitals and health systems have new capabilities to support clinical decision-making and potentially save millions of dollars in the post-discharge patient managementIn the global CDSS market, a plethora of opportunities is presented from the emerging countries such as India and China.For example, China is struggling to deal with the problems associated with cataract faced by the ageing population. The nation currently accounts for 18% (approximately 5 million) of the global population suffering from blindness, thus providing the key players an opportunity to work closely with a local partner to develop dual language decision support systems which could be adopted easily by the clinics in China.Furthermore, development of different versions of CDSS using multiple language is a great way which a company might use to explore various opportunities in different regions across the globe.The opportunities for investment are substantial in number in the CDSS market with untapped demand from various verticals within the healthcare industry.

Best Buy will stop selling Huawei smartphonesCNN WireMarch 22, 2018 Thursday 1:55 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 421 wordsByline: By Sherisse PhamDateline: HONG KONG (CNNMoney) BodyHONG KONG (CNNMoney) --  Huawei's toehold in the US smartphone market is shrinking further.Best Buy has stopped ordering new phones from China's biggest smartphone maker and will stop selling its products over the next few weeks, according to a source familiar with the situation. Best Buy's decision was reported earlier by Reuters and CNET. "We don't comment on specific contracts with vendors, and we make decisions to change what we sell for a variety of reasons," said a spokesperson for the electronics retailer.Huawei did not dispute the reports. In statement to CNN on Thursday, a spokesperson said Hauwei "values the relationship it has with Best Buy and all our other retail partners. As a policy, we do not discuss the details of our partner relationships." Huawei has struggled in the US market in large part because of official concerns that the Chinese government can use its smartphones and other products for intelligence gathering -- allegations Huawei has repeatedly denied. US consumers can still buy Huawei's smartphones without a wireless plan at Walmart, but the loss of Best Buy is just the latest blow to Huawei's US ambitions. Huawei's hopes of clinching its first deal with a major US carrier were dashed in January when talks with AT&T collapsed at the last minute. Then in February, US intelligence agencies warned Americans not to buy smartphones made by Huawei or ZTE, another Chinese tech company, saying the devices pose a security threat to American customers. And only last week, President Donald Trump killed a $117 billion hostile takeover of US chip-maker Qualcomm by its rival Broadcom, after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States warned the deal could allow Huawei to gain ground in 5G technology. In 2012, Congress released a report saying Huawei and ZTE, another Chinese tech company, should be viewed "with suspicion." The companies both strongly disputed the reports' findings at the time, with Huawei calling them "baseless."Huawei said on Thursday it has "won the trust and confidence of individuals and organizations in 170 countries around the world."The company is the world's third largest smartphone maker behind Samsung and Apple. It is also a leading provider of telecom equipment in Asia, Europe and Latin America.Huawei is "committed to earning that same trust with US consumers and making our products accessible in as many ways as possible," a company spokesperson said. TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Trump's Broadcom Dust-Up Could Actually Be Good for Tech: Market ReconRealMoneyMarch 13, 2018 Tuesday 9:21 AM EDTCopyright 2018 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1304 wordsByline: Stephen GuilfoyleHighlight: It might boost M&A activity.Body"Problems are not stop signs, they are guidelines." -- Robert H. SchullerBouncing BallAny of you kids ever play rugby as youngsters? An ancestor of American football, rugby is played with a ball that's somewhat like an American football, only thicker and a little more difficult to handle. Due to its shape, it can often bounce unpredictably.Well, the ball definitely bounced against Singapore-based Broadcom Ltd.  on Monday night -- although I'm not sure that we could say "unpredictably" -- when President Trump blocked the firm's attempts to buy U.S.-headquartered Qualcomm  ."There is credible evidence that leads me to believe that Broadcom, [a] limited company organized under the laws of Singapore, through exercising control of Qualcomm Inc. ... might take actions that threatens to impair the national security of the United States," the president said.Trump's move should have come as little surprise to anyone, as the U.S. Treasury's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (or "CFIUS") had already made plain its concerns over allowing Broadcom to acquire Qualcomm.And in a move to get ahead of something like this, Broadcom had just announced that the firm was in the final stages of moving back to the United States from Singapore. AVGO announced that this move would be completed by April 3 instead of a previously announced May 6.Broadcom also wanted the world to know that the firm's executive team is made up entirely of American citizens, and that all of its largest shareholders are U.S. concerns as well. And while the company's U.S. headquarters is in Silicon Valley, the firm employs more than 8.600 folks across 25 U.S. states.In case you're wondering why AVGO is based in Singapore, the answer is that Avago Technologies -- which merged with U.S.-headquartered Broadcom Corp. in 2016 to create Broadcom Ltd. -- had been headquartered there.Broadcom CEO Hock Tan grew up in Malaysia, but was educated at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is now a U.S. citizen. Tan also announced early on in the Trump presidency that he would move AVGO's global headquarters to the United States.The China SyndromeThe issue at the heart of this matter is that Broadcom has ties to several Chinese firms, most notably Huawei, the world's largest telecommunications-equipment manufacturer.Huawei overtook Ericsson for that title in 2012, and last year, the firm briefly surpassed Apple  as the world's No. 2 cell-phone maker. The Chinese company is also working toward becoming a major player in the cloud space as well.Why would doing business with such a firm represent a problem? Simple: Huawei's relationship with the Chinese government remains murky.For openers, Huawei was founded by Ren Zhengfei, a former Red Army engineer. The firm also claims to be employee-owned, although it's said that Huawei's employee-shareholders have little information regarding their holdings. Huawei also refers to itself as a "collective" rather than a private company.What I ThinkGeopolitical concerns aside, what concerns me as a trader and investor is whether Trump's move enhances or diminishes valuations across the tech space, as well as what it means for tech mergers and acquisitions.Does it now make sense for Broadcom to split into an Asian concern and a U.S. one? That would be one way for the firm to retain all of the relationships already in place while perhaps appeasing U.S. national-security issues.Meanwhile, Intel  has made M&A overtures toward Broadcom. Is that for real?I believe that while markets initially viewed Trump's move negatively, his decision actually makes the semiconductor space even hotter than it was before.After all, I think there will potentially be an even greater push toward consolidation. And as hot as the semis have seemed, they're for the most part trading at valuations below the rest of the market (including firms that service the group).I haven't yet seen a comment from Broadcom CEO Hock Tan, but I think it's likely that this is far from over. Broadcom could file lawsuits claiming that the president acted beyond his powers, or that CFIUS didn't take the time to properly investigate the matter.A Macro Look at MicronWill any potential tech consolidation land squarely on Micron Technology  ?You might recall that I wrote a piece on Feb. 27 about how Micron is  . Well, I took my own advice and bought some MU shares they they were trading at $47.98 -- a good move, as they're trading around $60 in premarket action Tuesday after rallying almost 9% Monday.It's not just the potential for consolidation that's boosting MU. Rather, demand for its products keeps on going and going. DRAM is as hot as ever, while margins are expanding for NAND.Valuation concerns? It doesn't seem like any exist for Micron. Price-target increases have been raining down on this stock in recent days from the likes of Instinet and Evercore ISI.The Broadcom news also potentially heats things up for the likes of Lam Research  , Applied Materials  and MU competitor Western Digital  . Of course, regular readers already know that I like the chips and chip-makers for the long term.In fact, the biggest problem for those who invest in this space has been adding on dips, because the "dips" are usually far above many an investor's net cost basis. Let's see what I mean by looking at Micron's chart.Chart Of The Day No. 1: MicronWhat a beauty Micron's chart has turned out to be in the two weeks since I last wrote about the stock!I've left the blue Fibonacci levels and the orange Pitchfork in place from my Feb. 27 chart:As you can see, this name has obeyed and even exceeded the support that I projected on Feb. 27. Just look at the daily Moving Average Convergence Divergence oscillator (MACD). Parabolic!Combine that with Relative Strength Index that now stands above 80 on crazy volume and you either have an overbought stock or one where some major news is about to break about the company.Even if MU reached a short-term peak at Monday's highs, I won't be taking profits at this time. On the contrary, I'm far more likely to add should the stock retrace to the $52.50 area, despite that spot being well above my entry point of two weeks ago.As for those of you still flat the name but looking to get involved, I wouldn't step to the plate with a fistful of capital asking in the aftermath of such a sharp move higher. That's asking to get smacked in the teeth.What you can do instead is write $52.50 puts expiring March 23. Those went for 63 cents Monday night.Why would puts expiring in 10 days with a strike price seven bucks out of the money trade with such a premium? Simple, MU reports second-quarter earnings after the bell next Thursday (March 22). If you get run over by those, you'll still pay less than a net $52 for MU shares.Chart Of The Day No. 2: NvidiaSticking with the semis, check out this chart of Nvidia  :After meandering to the right for a few weeks, NVDA has developed a triple top while repeatedly finding support at higher lows. And do you know when I first drew the Pitchfork above for you? Jan. 8, when the formation was  .Less than three months later, NVDA continues to obey this formation. And according to this model, NVDA's Monday closing price should be the stock's new support within a month should its sector remain strong and the market not fall out of bed.As a result, my price target for the name is $280. Rock 'n' roll!Sarge's Trading LevelsThese are my levels to watch Tuesday for where I think that the S&P 500 and the Russell 2000 might either pause or turn:SPX: 2808, 2796, 2789, 2780, 2770, 2753RUT: 1619, 1613, 1604, 1597, 1590, 1583Economics (All Times Eastern) 1 p.m. -- Thirty-Year Treasury Bond Auction: $13 billion.Today's Earnings Highlights (Consensus EPS Expectations)After the Close: SMTC (.41), WSM (1.61), YRD (.88)Load-Date: March 14, 2018End of Document

Tessa Lyons, a product manager at Facebook, said that the company has invited representatives from the U.S. fact-checking groups it has partnered with to its Menlo Park, California headquarters in early February to discuss, in part, what information could finally be shared. Going ahead and doing so would represent a major shift for the social media giant.

"The Democrats and their lapdogs, the Fake News Mainstream Media are taking out the old Ronald Reagan playbook and screaming mental stability and intelligence," he wrote Saturday on Twitter. "Actually, throughout my life, my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart." So more than okay, in his opinion. But, as Trump noted, others have expressed doubts. His tweet may have been in reaction to a new book, "Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House," which says that some of the president's advisers have privately belittled his sanity and intelligence.

Thick clouds of dark smoke could be seen billowing out of the Sanchi tanker, engulfing the vessel as rescue efforts were hampered by bad weather and fire on and around the ship, officials said.

He'll be gone from this year's Golden Globes - denounced, derided, joked about - but his presence, and questionable legacy, will be everywhere. Back in the days of VHS, he helped pioneer the practice of sending out screener copies of his movies, asking his staff to hunt down the addresses of members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Disney acquired his company, Miramax, partly because it wanted the Oscars that Mr. Weinstein would win; the 1993 sale gave Mr. Weinstein vastly more cash and power. He ran awards campaigns like wars, winning six best picture Oscars along the way. Even in recent years, when his power began to wane, Mr. Weinstein threw one of the splashiest parties after the Golden Globes ceremony. What no one knew was that Mr. Weinstein allegedly used the awards as an instrument of harassment - luring the French actress Judith Godreche to a Cannes hotel room, for instance, on the pretext of discussing his strategy to pursue an Oscar for her.

Continue reading Electronic Security Market Forecast to 2024 Reveals 10% CAGR GrowthMarketStudyReport.com adds a new Electronic Security Market research report for the period of 2017-2024 that shows the market is growing at steady CAGR to 2024.The state and central governments of various countries are placing high focus on the development and adoption of advanced systems in high-traffic locations such as public roads, transit stations, and malls, contributing to the growth of the Electronic Security Market. For instance, the Indian government in 2014 set up a USD 125 million fund solely devoted to the prevention of sexual violence among women through the installation of security equipment such as surveillance systems at high-risk public locations. These hardware systems are equipped with video analytics and advanced algorithms that allow the detection of criminals. Furthermore, technological advancements have also aided in the improvement of existing technologies such as high-resolution 4k cameras and IP surveillance units.  Request a sample copy of Electronic Security Market Research Report @https://www.marketstudyreport.com/request-a-sample/668596/?utm_source=icrw-SKElectronic Security Market size is set to exceed USD 60 billion by 2024; according to a new research report.Crime rates across the world are heavily impacted with the rising penetration of these systems in residential and commercial settings and is anticipated to drive the electronic security market growth. End-users across the world are replacing conventional security systems such as guards and physical body checks with high-tech solutions. Physical body checks in malls and airports can be cumbersome and increase customer discomfort, primarily among women. X-ray body scanners, on the contrary, requires the person to pass through an electronic frame.The rising trend of the development of smart cities in countries such as China and India is contributing to the high growth of the electronic security market. For instance, the Chinese government has undertaken large construction projects for the development of smart cities imbued with advanced security solutions in cities such as Dalian, Hangzhou, Nanjing, and Tianjin. The rise in traveler population across the world is also leading to the growth of the electronic security market.Enquire about this report @https://www.marketstudyreport.com/enquiry-before-buying/668596/?utm_source=icrw-SKThe surveillance and alert system market is anticipated to exhibit substantial growth during the forecast timeframe. The reduction in component and raw material costs is contributing to the decline in the electronic security market price trend. Remote monitoring systems are increasingly finding application in developed regions such as U.S and Western Europe. Installing a home security solution with remote monitoring capabilities allows the homeowner to access security cameras and video units situated inside the residential location in real-time.Public-sector applications are the largest revenue-generating segment. Various government bodies are making use of advanced solutions for surveillance and criminal detection applications. For instance, in September 2017, a police department in Arkansas was reported to be using drones for highly specialized missions such as the tracking of a suspect or obtaining an inside view and additional information in a hostage situation.The North America electronic security market is projected to dominate the global business landscape owing to the government initiatives to integrate these systems into their public safety segment. For instance, the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 contains provisions to make the unmanned aerial systems (UAS) licensing process easier and quicker for law enforcement officials. Various U.S states are currently conducting trial operations on drones to understand their capabilities and their operational efficiency.Players operating in the global electronic security market include Axis Communications, BOSCH Security Systems, Hitachi Ltd, OSI Systems, Inc., SDMS Security Products UK Ltd., Siemens AG, MilliVision Technologies, ASSA ABLOY, Scanna MSC Ltd., Thales Group, RedXDefense LLC, etc. Industry players conduct strategic moves such as mergers and acquisitions to sustain growth. For instance, in July 2017, Assa Abloy announced the acquisition of Arjo Systems SAS to strengthen their physical and digital identity solution provisions.Related Reports:  Global Electronic Security Systems (ESS) Market Size, Status and Forecast 2022This report studies the global Electronic Security Systems (ESS) market, analyzes and researches the Electronic Security Systems (ESS) development status and forecast in United States, EU, Japan, Chin https://www.marketstudyreport.com/reports/global-electronic-security-systems-ess-market-size-status-and-forecast-2022/?utm_source=RR-SKAbout Us:Centralize market research purchases across your entire organization in one place.

Global Power Is Shifting From the U.S. to ChinaUSNEWS.comMarch 6, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 U.S. News & World Report All Rights ReservedSection: OPINION; World Report; Vol.; No.Length: 812 wordsByline: Lawrence J. HaasHighlight: Events in Washington and Beijing show the tectonic plates of global power may be shifting.BodyUnfolding events in Washington and Beijing raise the disturbing specter of a global passing of the torch from the United States to China, one with frightening implications for freedom and democracy. First, President Donald Trump seemed to applaud from afar as China's leader consolidates his power over a more authoritarian government at home, while the regime promotes its model of governance in increasingly aggressive terms abroad. Second, Trump announced that he will slap steep tariffs on steel and aluminum and welcome a trade war that most of the world, and most of his own Republican Party, dreads. These events may seem unrelated, but they're really sides of the same coin, for they both signal a U.S. retreat from defending the Western liberal order of free-market capitalism and democratic government that it did so much to nourish in the decades since World War II. Let's take these one at a time. In Beijing, the Communist Party is amending China's constitution to end presidential term limits, enabling Xi Jinping to remain as party chief and Chinese president for as long as he likes and, thus, become China's most powerful leader since Mao. The Communist Party, in turn, is exerting greater control over the basic sectors of Chinese society, including the government, military and the private sector. With the West roiled by division, Chinese officials are also promoting their nation's governing model -- the "China solution" -- as an alternative for the wider world. That alternative offers fewer opportunities for free expression. Beijing, which has long imposed a Great Firewall to restrict what the Chinese can see online, is expanding its efforts. At home, it's monitoring social media tools like WhatsApp and retaliating against those who use them to criticize the government. Abroad, it's pressuring such companies as Google and Facebook -- both of which are blocked in China -- to delete content accessible to the Chinese diaspora and others outside its borders that Beijing considers insulting. It's similarly pressuring foreign companies that sell their products in China; German carmaker Daimler apologized last month after its Mercedes-Benz brand used Instagram to quote the Dalai Lama, whom Beijing considers a threat for promoting Tibet's independence. At a closed-door fundraiser in Florida over the weekend, Trump mused about developments in China, praising Xi's power grab. "He's now president for life," he said. "President for life. No, he's great. And look, he was able to do that. I think it's great. Maybe we'll have to give that a shot some day." All joking aside, Trump also announced steel and aluminum tariffs of 25 and 10 percent, respectively, late last week while Xi's top economic advisor, Liu He, was meeting with Trump's economic team at the White House to ease U.S.-China trade tensions. Trump's tariffs will clearly undercut those efforts. But while China is the world's largest steel producer, it provides just 2 percent of America's steel imports, and Beijing criticized Trump's move in only muted tones. Far more striking was the outrage expressed by America's allies in Canada (America's largest foreign supplier of steel and aluminum) and Europe, who promised retaliation. Administration officials have since made clear that the tariffs would apply to all countries, though they raised the possibility that companies could seek exemptions for certain products. In response, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker promised that Europe would slap tariffs "on Harley-Davidson, on bourbon and on blue jeans -- Levi's," while a leading Canadian trade expert suggested that his country target wine. More frightening than the tit-for-tat details, however, are the broader implications. "With this," said Bernd Lange, a German Social Democrat who runs the European Parliament's trade committee, "the declaration of war has arrived. They [the United States] have a mercantile trade model that dates back 200 years." That Trump's move rattled stocks reflects investor concerns over where U.S. policy is headed. After all, the steel and aluminum tariffs came after Trump signaled in late January that he will begin implementing his "America First" trade policy by slapping tariffs on solar panels and washing machines, which affect not just Chinese and South Korean manufacturers but also those in Canada, Mexico and Europe. Together, all these developments force the uncomfortable question of whether the tectonic plates of global power are shifting, with Beijing poised to exert more influence across its region and far beyond at the expense of a Washington that, unlike Beijing, doesn't seem to understand what's at stake.Lawrence J. Haas, a senior fellow at the American Foreign Policy Council, is the author of, most recently, "Harry and Arthur: Truman, Vandenberg, and the Partnership That Created the Free World."Graphic Picture, (Nicolas Asfouri/AFP/Getty Images)Load-Date: March 7, 2018End of Document

Stories from Slate; China's "duplitecture" trend aimed to create perfect copies of foreign cities like Paris and Venice. They've become something much more interesting.Slate MagazineJanuary 22, 2018 Monday 1:45 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Washingtonpost.Newsweek Interactive Company, LLC. All Rights ReservedSection: ROADS & KINGDOMS; News and PoliticsLength: 2442 wordsByline: Bianca BoskerHighlight: China Tried to Build a Perfect Copy of Paris. It's Become Something Much More Interesting.BodySky City, the replica of Paris on the outskirts of Hangzhou, was supposed to be empty. The development had been built in 2006 to house 10,000 people in a community modeled after France's capital, complete with its own Eiffel Tower, Champs-Élysées, and white Haussmann-style apartments. Yet word was that hardly anyone had moved in: It was too far, too inconvenient, too weird. In 2013, a video surfaced showing Sky City's long boulevards empty of life and its Eiffel Tower choked with weeds, and news sites generated more than 60 copycat stories declaring Sky City a failure. They described the clip as a rare glimpse at China's "           eerie," "           abandoned," and "           post-apocalyptic" City of Light. "Paris, now virtually a ghost town-streets empty, stores vacant," repeated a 2016            story, panning over bleak gray plazas populated only by fountains copied from Parisian gardens. (Full disclosure: I was a talking head for the segment.)For many, Sky City's demise was an "I told you so" moment. I've spent the past decade tracing China's "duplitecture"-the replica White Houses, Versailles Palaces, and even foreign cities, from Venice to Jackson Hole, Wyoming, that have multiplied through the country-and from the start of my research, planners and architecture critics have assured me the movement was on its last legs. "It's really just a trend and it's not sustainable," an architect at Ben Wood Studio Shanghai told me in 2008; soon after, a different Shanghai-based planner asserted duplitecture was "already outdated even within China."Sky City became the poster child for other themed developments that had allegedly met the same fate: intended to house Chinese families in surroundings inspired by Orange County or Barcelona, these communities were said to have languished as ghost towns. An op-edin the Global Times asserted, "These 'fake cities' are just so ridiculously similar to their Western originals that rather than anyone taking them seriously, they turned into residential amusement parks"-empty backdrops for wedding photos and tourist selfies.Then again, overseas reporting on Chinese culture has a tendency to turn into a game of telephone. (That 2013 video of Sky City was in fact filmed in 2008 by artist Caspar Stracke.) When a documentary filmmaker who'd read my book  invited me to join him to revisit these duplitecture developments, some of which I hadn't seen in years, I leapt at the chance to check in on them firsthand. Had they been abandoned? Remodeled? Razed to the ground? Liaoning's            Holland Village-which installed windmills, canals, and a double of the Hague on an area three times the size of Brooklyn's Navy Yard-had been demolished 10 years after its construction. Sky City had just celebrated its 10th anniversary. This past May, I set out to see what I'd find.Once in China, I did not have to go hunting for duplitecture. I caught my first glimpse while in line for customs: The flat-screen TV mounted overhead played footage of starched Chinese soldiers saluting a government building that appeared to be the lovechild of the U.S. Capitol and the White House. En route to Hangzhou, I spotted sprawling Italian palazzos the color of Easter eggs; a British hamlet; a red-domed structure that could have passed for the Duomo in Florence; another U.S. Capitol; and, in line for taxis at the Hangzhou train station, an airbrushed ad for the be-fountained villas of Cam-Town Riviera.A taxi driver who had last traveled to Sky City two years ago-and never with a foreigner-took me out of the dense thicket of Hangzhou's skyscrapers into the gangly, mismatched landscape of its suburbs, past a ball-bearing factory, a pink house frosted by white balustrades, and, at last, to a four-lane boulevard, at the end of which sat Sky City's Eiffel Tower, rising 35 stories into the air.Both sides of the road were flanked by row after row of high-rise apartments girded by scaffolding and waving cranes from their roofs. The walls bordering the buildings advertised homes in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower ("Don't wait!") and reminded passers-by to pursue the "Chinese dream." For a deserted ghost town, construction was booming.Expecting to find Sky City an empty shell, I'd stocked up on water and peanuts at the train station. Instead, the streets hummed with the mosquito-whine of scooters and bustled with pedestrians: Parents pushed strollers, young couples queued for Pocky, teenage boys lounged on shady benches, and elderly women shuffled under their neon umbrellas. I snuck into the back entrance of what I thought was an abandoned hotel, only to discover myself in the chandeliered consulting room of a plastic surgery clinic. It advertised a procedure of "exquisite carvings" that would give patients a "U.S.-nose."Long populated by Juliet balconies and Art Nouveau streetlights, Sky City had added other sights common to French towns. I passed grocers, barber shops, day cares, cafés, a cosmetics store, a "Baby Bilingual Education Center," and a boutique with a mannequin dressed in chic black shorts and a Yves Saint Laurent purse. Just like France's Paris, Hangzhou's Paris was also filled with Chinese tourists snapping photos.I learned it had been two years since a new management company had taken over the town. Where an earlier breed of "build-it-and-they'll-come" developer had judged success in concrete poured, this more enlightened manager had recognized the importance of luring services and stores that would attract residents. The company's chairman promised he would bring Sky City a Montessori school, "French research institutes," and spas offering the "world's most authentic and advanced beauty treatments"; a year later, he pegged the town's population at nearly            40,000 people-though a bored twentysomething at Madenjoy Real Estate told me that between 14,000 and 18,000 residents had moved in. Still, it appeared something was working: According to           Hangzhou Daily, when 663 new units went on sale in August, they sold out in less than four minutes for an average of 14,000 yuan per square meter-about $200 per square foot, slightly more than the            average price in Houston. (The average price-per-square-foot for apartments in downtown Hangzhou, two hours away by public transportation, is about            triple that, which might explain the high proportion of young families-Paris as starter home.) The developers behind the Hangzhou Paris did not consider it an "           eerily depressing ghost town." They described it as the foundation for a new satellite city.In its early years, Sky City had, like other themed communities, pushed a European lifestyle to match its European surroundings. British-style Thames Town courted English pubs, German-themed Anting Town served bratwurst, and Sky City hosted crash courses on Gallic customs, from the time of day French diners take their meals (according to the organizers' website: "Most French restaurants offer lunch between 12:00 and 14:00") to how they savor caviar ("use the tip of the tongue to slowly crush each individual grain one by one").Since then, however, tastes had evolved. I stopped into a bakery just a few steps away from the Eiffel Tower, imagining I'd pick up a baguette or brioche to pair with my Parisian stroll. But not a single thing in its glass cases could reasonably have been described as "French"-not the rolls of taro-infused "Purple Cake," not the triangles of Barbie-doll pink cream, not the fluffy mounds of dough uniting mayonnaise and hot dog in a stunning number of permutations. These were hybrid pastries with a Chinese sensibility. Like Sky City itself, this pâtisserie had taken a European classic, then reconceived it to suit Chinese tastes.Other duplitecture developments had undergone similar transformations. The ghost towns had both filled out-I hit traffic getting into Shanghai's Thames Town-and mellowed out, the Western surroundings giving way to local habits.These communities had once emphasized their foreign themes by courting businesses with ties to Western culture, or adopting strict design covenants meant to preserve their foreign look and feel. Planting vegetable gardens, hanging laundry outside to dry, or enclosing balconies-all common sights in typical Chinese neighborhoods-were usually prohibited. Now, at Hangzhou's Venice Water Town, nearly every Moorish window had a view of glass-encased porches or underwear fluttering in the breeze. One middle-aged woman had planted yuzu, pomelo, peaches, mint, chives, and squash in a yard no bigger than a bus stop.In Thames Town, where British pubs and wine stores had once far outnumbered Chinese restaurants, couples and families now perused pu'er tea shops, slurped down noodles, and lined up for bubble tea, or Baskin-Robbins. The 27-year-old owner of a boutique selling clothes by up-and-coming Chinese designers told me Thames Town had grown busier since 2014, thanks in part to the expansion of the subway system, and in part to the swelling population of Shanghai proper. (Between 2000 and 2016, the city had grown by the population of New York City, pushing the city limits closer to Thames Town.) When I asked whether Thames Town had tried to court British restaurants to match its English architecture, he choked, midbite, on his sticky rice. Why would anyone want that? "But the English don't have anything good to eat!" protested the owner's friend. "All they have is fried fish and french fries! British food is disgusting."Not every former ghost town has come to life. In Shanghai's Holland Village (no relation to Liaoning's), most storefronts along the main street stood empty or deserted, their dusty concrete floors littered with desiccated bouquets or curled posters. Like something out of fairy tale fever dream, I met an elderly woman who lived inside the town's wooden windmill-the previous tenant, a wedding photography studio, had left it in her care after business went south. Several buildings, including replicas of Amsterdam's Maritime Museum and De Bijenkorf department store, were under construction-just as they had been during a previous visit in 2008. Since then, the developers had successfully completed a stone cathedral, which they'd outfitted with crucifixes, a crèche, and a wooden altarpiece, then rented to local businesses for use as offices.A 36-year-old entrepreneur, one of the few shop owners in Holland Village, had chosen the ground floor of a brick townhouse for the headquarters of her wine-importing firm. Since wine was European, she explained, it was appropriate to bring clients to drink in a European setting. And besides, she thought Holland Village was beautiful-a glimpse at a continent she'd never experienced firsthand. "I think there's a lot of foreign architecture in China because people who can't afford to see the world can see what it's like overseas," she said. "It's a great thing that we now have all these different styles of buildings in China. It's not just architecture. It's also a cultural exchange in a way."Anthony Mackay, a British architect and urban planner who worked on Thames Town, is less enthusiastic about the "cultural exchange" duplitecture represents. I visited Thames Town with him one afternoon, and we followed the curving cobblestone streets past columned apartments drawn from London's Belgravia, past black-and-white Tudor-style inns, and past a replica of Bristol, England's Christ Church. (The original is a 20-minute drive from the offices of the firm, Atkins, that planned Thames Town, and it seems the designers conveniently opted to copy from their own backyard.)"When I discovered that the architecture of Thames Town was a pure imitation of buildings around Bristol and England, I felt ashamed. I felt ashamed that we-I mean Atkins-had succumbed to the client and built such a place," said Mackay, stressing that he did not design Thames Town's buildings but consulted on the urban plan for Thames Town and the larger suburban district, Songjiang, to which it belongs.To Mackay, while the original, British buildings were authentic to the time and place from which they emerged, this Chinese interpretation was copy-and-paste architecture-a rootless imitation. "These buildings have no history. They are pure theater. They are pure replica," he said. "Tourists in Paris and Venice know that beyond the façade is a genuine history. They are trodding on the ground that Henry the Eighth trod on. Here, you're trodding on the ground that was a duck farm."I considered this while treading the sidewalks of Thames Town. It's true the landscape houses more than its fair share of absurdities: the statues honoring British greats, like Princess Diana, Winston Churchill, and Harry Potter; the limestone façade of an English school that commands students to "Conquer English to Make China Stronger"; the dozens of brides dressed like princesses and oversize Tinkerbells, feigning surprise as photographers instruct grooms to proffer fake-flower bouquets. Like "uncanny-valley" robots that unsettle us by falling just short of being human, these buildings represent "uncanny architecture," arousing suspicion because they are nearly identical to the originals, yet a smidge too big, or too new.But then we forget the originals were once off-putting and conspicuous themselves. We expect columns and crenellations to have the respectable patina of age. They didn't always. Remarking on the flashy newness of J. Paul Getty's Malibu villa, a copy of an ancient Roman country house, Joan Didion observed that the ornate surroundings sparkled a little too much with the shine of wealth and status-just as the original would have. "Ancient marbles once appeared just as they appear here: as strident, opulent evidence of imperial power and acquisition," she writes.Over time, the glitter and strangeness of duplitecture will fade, until its inhabitants all but forget the replica ever belonged anywhere except its adopted milieu. Back in the U.S., on my drive home from the airport, I pass New York's own duplitecture-Joseph Pulitzer's copy of a Venetian palazzo on East 73rd, Gertrude Rhinelander Waldo's Loire Valley chateau on Madison Avenue. (Of course, there is a double standard, and while the creators of these buildings were "inspired by" European landmarks, China's developers have been "knocking off" the greats.) Europe's aristocrats might never have trod in these duplicated structures. But it doesn't matter: They've acquired a new history and transformed into Manhattan's treasures, rather than Europe's.China's duplitecture will also grow old. Already, its Paris, its Holland, its Venice, and its England have become Chinese in spirit, if not in appearance.Load-Date: January 22, 2018End of Document

Trump&#39;s fight with Huawei puts Slim&#39;s TracFone in the middleCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 27, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 782 wordsBody The US commercial confrontation with China and its high-tech companies could soon affect the smaller operators of the telecommunications sector or with owners of other nationalities, now faced with the Trump government's attempt to eliminate subsidies for telephone companies that they serve rural areas, users in poverty or those with low incomes. América Móvil's TracFone subsidiary is an example of an operator that focuses on those niche markets.  Washington and Beijing have had a diplomatic and commercial pulse for weeks because of the United States' refusal to allow Huawei and ZTE telephones and other telecommunication equipment to enter their territory through the sales channels of the giants AT & T, Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint, with the argument of addressing possible violations of user privacy, but also as a way to force China to negotiate new trade agreements that end up reducing the deficit of Americans with the Chinese.  The Trump government already achieved in January that AT & T broke an agreement to distribute Huawei's phones among its 130 million customers and goes for more.  The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is now preparing a plan to remove subsidies to companies that carry the Internet, cable TV and telephony to rural areas or low-income markets, when it is demonstrated that they used equipment Huawei, ZTE or other Chinese brands to meet these objectives, according to the US press.  The FCC plan is still under evaluation and for the time being it has officially contemplated the Universal Service Fund, an 8,000 million dollar fund per year with which the State supports operators to bring broadband Internet to rural areas. Affordable service plans.  But in the United States media it has not been ruled out that the government, through the FCC, also puts a magnifying glass on the LifeLine program that subsidizes with 9.2 dollars per month the telephone companies that provide mobile services to low-income users and one of them. The companies that have benefited most from LifeLine are the mobile virtual operator TracFone, a subsidiary of the Mexican América Móvil.  With these intentions, the FCC aims to prevent the money from the subsidies of these programs ending up in the hands of Chinese manufacturers and not US companies such as Cisco Systems, forcing small operators to end their commitments with brands such as Huawei or ZTE, which does not they only build telephones but servers, antennas, wiring and other infrastructure elements to configure telecommunication networks.  If the FCC plan is approved-according to the US press, more will be known at the end of the month-TracFone will have to maneuver quickly to avoid being among the victims of the China-US trade war.  The Republican Party, for its part, already tries since 2017 to bring down or modify the LifeLine program and affirms that AMX has benefited from this subsidy beyond what was imagined.  TracFone is the leading mobile virtual operator or MVNO in the United States. Between 2010 and 2017 its customer base grew 30.5%; from 17.7 million to 23.1 million users, although at the end of 2015 it reached a peak of 25.7 million. The ARPU or monthly average consumption per user expanded 71.4% between 2010 and 2017, from 14 to 24 dollars and its income moved from 2,800 million dollars in 2010, to 7,800 million in 2017, a rise of 178.5% in that period.  The MVNO TracFone is a jewel for América Móvil, since it exceeds, for example, three times the revenues of subsidiaries of its Claro brand in Central America or six times of Claro in Ecuador.  América Móvil, controller of TracFone, Telcel, Claro and other recognized brandsof telecommunications and content in America and Europe, has a bargaining power to respond to a possible decision of the FCC that is not beneficial for its subsidiary in the United States, said Juan Gnius, director at the telecommunications analysis firm Telracom.  There is a precedent that in March 2015, América Móvil broke up with Motorola, after Lenovo, the company that controlled that brand, decided to sell its phones over the Internet, which led AMX to sell these equipment at the counter. Claro in Central and South America and then Telcel in Mexico. Motorola decided to return with Telcel in May 2017.  "In principle, TracFone could desist from selling Huawei and ZTE as a way not to generate a confrontation with the government and see how the conflict progresses. Government subsidies are key to this operator's income. I do not see, for now, that Slim confronts the government. Wait until it is clear. América Móvil has sufficient purchasing power to negotiate with other manufacturers, "said Juan Gnius of Telracom.  erp Load-Date: March 27, 2018End of Document

This segment primarily reflects the results of NetEase's two e-commerce platforms, Kaola.com and Yanxuan, which were established in January 2015 and April 2016, respectively. The Company now reports four reporting segments: online game services, e-commerce, advertising services, and e-mail and others. This change in segment reporting aligns with the manner in which the Company's operating decision maker ( CODM ) currently receives and uses financial information to allocate resources and evaluate the performance of reporting segments. This change in segment presentation does not affect consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of income or consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company retrospectively revised prior period segment information to conform to current period presentation.Fourth Quarter 2017 Financial ResultsNetRevenuesNet revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were RMB14,607.6 million (US$2,245.2 million), compared to RMB12,477.8 million and RMB12,099.0 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively.Net revenues from online games were RMB8,004.4 million (US$1,230.2 million) for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to RMB8,111.7 million and RMB8,959.1 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. Mobile games accounted for approximately 68.0% of net revenues from online games for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 68.3% and 64.4% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively.Net revenues from e-commerce were RMB4,653.7 million (US$715.3 million) for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to RMB2,667.5 million and RMB1,691.2 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively.Net revenues from advertising services were RMB736.6 million (US$113.2 million) for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to RMB631.4 million and RMB664.8 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively.

The year-over-year increase in gross profit margin was mainly due to the one-off recognition of certain royalty expenses related to licensed games in the fourth quarter of 2016, which was partially offset by increased staff-related costs. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in gross profit margins was mainly due to increased staff-related costs.Gross profit margin for e-commerce for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 7.4%, compared to 11.5% and 12.5% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter decreases in e-commerce gross profit margin were primarily due to the larger-scale promotions and certain sales discounts in the fourth quarter of 2017, such as Singles Day on November 11, 2017.Gross profit margin for advertising services for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 71.2%, compared to 68.0% and 66.5% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases in gross profit margin were mainly due to NetEase's enhanced monetization efforts and better economies of scale.Gross loss margin for e-mail and others for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 3.3%, compared to gross profit margin of 13.1% and 46.9% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter decreases in gross margin were primarily due to the decreased revenue contribution from certain online platform businesses, which have relatively higher gross profit margins, as well as the one-off recognition of expense related to certain copyrights in the fourth quarter of 2017.Operating ExpensesTotal operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were RMB4,317.8 million (US$663.6 million), compared to RMB3,397.9 million and RMB2,596.6 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases in operating expenses were mainly due to increased selling and marketing expenses and research and development investments, and higher staff-related costs, as well as increased operating expenses related to NetEase's e-commerce businesses. Shipping and handling costs included in selling and marketing expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were RMB393.3 million (US$60.4 million), compared to RMB294.8 million and RMB177.2 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively.Income TaxesThe Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB290.4 million (US$44.6 million) for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to RMB225.5 million and RMB882.0 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 18.2%, compared to 8.1% and 19.2% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. The changes in the effective tax rate were mainly due to the fact that certain subsidiaries of the Company were recognized as Key Software Enterprises in the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2017, and subject to a preferential tax rate of 10% for 2016. The Company recognized related tax credits in the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2017 accordingly.Net Income After TaxNet income attributable to the Company's shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled RMB1.3 billion (US$197.6 million), compared to RMB2.5 billion and RMB3.7 billion for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled RMB1.9 billion (US$288.8 million), compared to RMB3.0 billion and RMB4.0 billion for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively.During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company had a net foreign exchange loss of RMB159.1 million (US$24.5 million), compared to a net foreign exchange loss of RMB109.9 million and a net foreign exchange gain of RMB90.5 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter changes in foreign exchange gains and losses were mainly due to unrealized exchange gains and losses arising from the Company's U.S. dollar-denominated bank deposits and short-term loan balances as the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the RMB fluctuated over the periods.NetEase reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$1.50 and US$1.49, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$2.95 and US$2.93, respectively, for the preceding quarter, and basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$4.31 and US$4.28, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2016.

These statements are made under the  safe harbor  provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these forward-looking statements by terminology such as  will,   expects,   anticipates,   future,   intends,   plans,   believes,   estimates  and similar statements. The accuracy of these statements may be impacted by a number of business risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or anticipated, including risks related to: the risk that the online game market will not continue to grow or that NetEase will not be able to maintain its leading position in that market, which could occur if, for example, its new online games or expansion packs and other improvements to its existing games do not become as popular as management anticipates; the ability of NetEase to successfully expand its mobile internet offerings; the ability of NetEase to effectively market its games and other services and achieve a positive return on its marketing expenditures; the risk that NetEase's affiliates will not be able to continue operating Minecraft, World of Warcraft®, StarCraft® II, Hearthstone®, Diablo® III: Reaper of Souls , Heroes of the Storm®, Overwatch® or other games licensed by it for a period of time or permanently due to possible governmental actions or the risk that such games will not be popular with game players in China; the risk that changes in Chinese government regulation of the online game market and the market for NetEase's e-commerce businesses may limit future growth of NetEase's revenues or cause revenues to decline; competition in the online advertising business and the risk that investments by NetEase in its content and services may not increase the appeal of the NetEase websites among internet users or result in increased advertising revenues; the risk that NetEase may not be able to continuously develop new and creative online services, including its ability to maintain and enhance the popularity of its e-mail, mobile and e-commerce businesses and develop attractive mobile games; the risk that NetEase will not be able to control its expenses in future periods; competition in NetEase's existing and potential markets; governmental uncertainties (including possible changes in the effective tax rates applicable to NetEase and its subsidiaries and affiliates and the ability of NetEase to receive and maintain approvals of the preferential tax treatments and general competition and price pressures in the marketplace); the risk that fluctuations in the value of the Renminbi with respect to other currencies could adversely affect NetEase's business and financial results; and other risks outlined in NetEase's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. NetEase does not undertake any obligation to update this forward-looking information, except as required under the applicable law.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresNetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS, as supplemental metrics in reviewing and assessing its operating performance and formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ).NetEase defines non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders as net income attributable to the Company's shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses and impairment on long-term investment of available-for-sale securities. Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders enables NetEase's management to assess its operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses and impairment on long-term investment of available-for-sale securities, which are non-cash charges. NetEase believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating the Company's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP financial measure facilitates investors' assessment of its operating performance.Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders is that it does not reflect all items of expense that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses and impairment on long-term investment of available-for-sale securities have been and may continue to be incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. See  Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results  at the end of this press release. NetEase encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. Contact for Media and Investors:Margaret Shi NetEase, Inc.Tel: (+86) 571-8985-5201Brandi PiacenteInvestor RelationsTel: (+1) 212-481-2050See Campaign:http://corp.netease.comContact Information:NetEase, Inc.Tags:,            Wire,            Disclosure Newswire,            United States,            EnglishLoad-Date: February 8, 2018End of Document

House Small Business Subcommittee Issues Testimony From George Washington UniversityTargeted News ServiceFebruary 15, 2018 Thursday 8:30 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1948 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe House Small Business subcommittee on Agriculture, Energy and Trade issued the following testimony by Michael Fernandez, senior fellow with the Food Institute at George Washington University, at a hearing entitled "Restoring Rural America: How Agritech is Revitalizing the Heartland":"I would first like to thank Chairman Blum, Ranking Member Schneider and the members of the Committee for giving me the opportunity to testify on an important and timely topic: how technology can help revitalize rural America. My name is Michael Fernandez and I am a Senior Fellow with the Food Institute at George Washington University."We live in an age of unprecedented technological advancement. I grew up at a time when the idea of a personal computer seemed like something out of science fiction. Today we all carry around devices that let us watch live as Chloe Kim flies through the air in Korea, or connect instantly with almost anyone on the planet, or buy almost any product with the touch of a finger and have it delivered to our door in 2 hours."Agricultural technology is critical for the future of rural America, revolutionizing how our farmers, ranchers and foresters go about their business. Whether it's high tech, internet connected tractors used in precision farming or robotic milking machines or genetically engineered crops or "big data," technology now touches every aspect of farming and ranching. But even while technology has flourished, many rural communities have been left behind. Members of this committee know very well, for example, that 40% of rural Americans do not have high speed internet access. As we begin a national discussion about infrastructure, we need to be asking whether we are doing enough to support our agricultural science and technology infrastructure and whether that new technology is helping to build vibrant rural communities."One thing that isn't up for debate is that supporting agriculture R&D is a great investment - the Economic Research Service says the rate of return on food and ag research can be as high as 60%. And we have seen private sector money flow into ag R&D and new agrifood technology startups like never before. According to the ERS, between 2008 and 2013, private ag R&D funding jumped 64% in real, inflation adjusted dollars."Unfortunately, during that same time period public investment, including federal and state spending, dropped by about 20%. Public funding now accounts for less than 25% of all food and ag R&D funding in the US, and is at a level below where it was in the 1980's."Private funding plays an important role, particularly in translating scientific breakthroughs into commercial products, but it is publicly funded research that has been the engine driving innovation. Public investment supports basic research that isn't driven by short short-term economic reward, and helps maintain the scientific talent pipeline that is critical for our future. The steady dwindling of this important part of the public infrastructure necessary to support vital, growing rural communities threatens our long term competitiveness."The U.S. is, in fact, already falling behind our international competitors in terms of public support for ag research. China became the world's largest public supporter of ag research in 2008, and the Chinese government now invests about twice as much public funding in ag R&D as we do."Today we are on the cusp of a new revolution in agricultural technology: gene editing. Gene editing is a suite of tools, the most well-known of which is CRISPR Cas-9 (and usually just referred to as CRISPR), that allows scientists to make precise changes at specific locations within the target plant or animal genome."And it is this precision that gives gene editing its power and what differentiates it from earlier forms of genetic engineering. In the first generation of genetic engineering technology, which has yielded the GMOs that are so ubiquitous in American farming, large sequences of DNA, usually from another organism, are inserted into the target genome to confer the desired trait. That insertion happens at a random location within the host genome, which give rise to one of the biggest concerns about first generation GMOs: that the random insertion can lead to unpredicted and unintentional consequences. This is also one of the reasons why current GMOs require such extensive risk assessments and safety testing, to ensure that the end product doesn't differ in any meaningful way from its conventional counterpart other than the desired new trait."Gene editing works in an entirely different way. Derived from a kind of bacterial "immune system," gene editing technology like CRISPR, allows scientists to target specific sequences within the host genome for changes. Those changes can include adding new genes, as we do with current GMOs, but also making targeted changes within the host genome itself. Scientists can make small changes at a specific location within the DNA sequence to knock out or alter the function of a given gene. Some have likened it to the "search and replace" function of a word processing program, where you can find the word you are looking for and change a few letters. There are questions about the level of specificity, including scientific reports that gene editing can result in "off-target" DNA changes outside the desired location, but it is this combination of relative specificity and the ability to make small changes within the target genome that gives gene editing the potential to be truly transformative."Since the ability to use CRISPR in plants in was first demonstrated 2013, there has been a flood of gene editing research, with more than 50 scientific papers appearing in peer-reviewed journals and a number of companies seeking to develop new products using the technology."DuPont Pioneer has used CRISPR technology to develop improved varieties of waxy corn, a type of corn hat already on the marketplace and that yields starch with unique properties for food and industrial purposes. As referenced earlier, U.S. researchers aren't the only ones in the game: Chinese scientists have reported using gene editing to confer resistance to powdery mildew, a destructive fungal disease, in wheat. Scientists at Penn State have produced mushrooms that don't brown when cut. Minnesota-based Calyxt has used a different form of gene editing to generate soybeans that create healthier oils, with levels of monounsaturated fats comparable to olive and canola oils. And new developments haven't been limited to plants. Researchers at the biotech firm Recombinetics have used gene editing to create hornless cattle, potentially eliminating the need for the painful de-horning process."Looking further into the future, exciting practical applications of CRISPR tools for sustainable agriculture can now be envisioned. Caribou Biosciences, the company set up by one of the original developers of the technology, has partnered with Pioneer-DuPont to work on drought resistant corn and wheat."These are amazing technical achievements, but how will they contribute to revitalizing rural America? I'd like to offer four ways to think about this question:"Farmer bottom line First of all, and perhaps most obviously, these new technologies should contribute positively to farm income. One feature of gene editing technology is that it promises to be relatively easier and cheaper than earlier genetic engineering methods. That should, in theory, lead to lower cost products for famers. The relatively low cost and ease of use of CRISPR tools are also spurring research in academia and in companies of all sizes, essentially democratizing crop-trait development. If up-front costs are indeed lower that could create more incentive for companies to develop applications for lower volume crops like fruits and vegetables, and therefore bring benefits to a wider array of farmers."Ownership Second, we must pay attention to how ownership of this new technology plays out. We are already seeing conflicts over who owns the underlying intellectual property rights to CRISPR, and the biggest ag companies are inking licensing deals with competing developers. A promising cross-licensing deal on ag applications of CRISPR that was struck late last year may ease those concerns. But as we see even greater concentration in the agritech industry, driven by economies of scale, there is a risk that the technology will be locked up in the hands of only a few large players. There are companies, like Benson"Hill Biosystems that are looking to bring the power of gene editing to smaller companies, including work on a so-called "CRISPR 2.0" that could bypass intellectual property fights, but it is important that we keep an eye on how this progresses."Scale neutral As our farming population ages and a new generation of farmers and ranchers takes over, we must think about incentives for technology that will meet their needs. These younger farmers are likely to be even more technologically savvy than their predecessors, and open to new approaches, but they are also likely to be operating at a smaller scale. Most studies suggest that adopters of first generation biotech products have seen economic benefits, but it is less clear that those benefits have accrued equally across farm sizes. What policy incentives do we need to be thinking about to make sure that new technology will meet the needs of small and medium scale operations?"Consumer acceptance Finally, the products of this new gene editing technology must be acceptable to consumers. The first generation of biotech products was geared more towards farmers, not end consumers. As American consumers are ever more focused on food - what's in it, where it comes from, and how it is produced - we need to make sure that new products offer tangible benefits that consumers can embrace. We also need to be sure that consumers can have confidence in the underlying regulatory system that reviews these new products. A sound, credible regulation approach alone won't guarantee acceptance, but it is a necessary foundation."The products of gene editing will be different than the earlier GMOs, and we will need to tailor our regulatory approach accordingly. A robust, scientifically justifiable, and transparent system is absolutely critical to ensuring success at home and to accessing markets abroad. Scientists are rapidly developing new products and are starting to knock on regulators' doors, but there is no clear answer for them. The Department of Agriculture has already told developers of some new gene edited products that they fall outside USDA's regulatory authority. To be clear, USDA regulators have not made a determination of safety, but rather have said that existing regulations tailored for the first generation GMOs simply don't apply. The Food and Drug Administration, on the other hand, has signaled its intention to use its rigorous, and often protracted, new animal drug approval process to evaluate animal products of gene editing."The window to craft a clear, credible pathway to market is narrowing rapidly. Although it may be counter to our current trend towards deregulation, the history of biotech development shows us the importance of regulations. I would argue that the US biotechnology industry has been a success because of our regulatory system, not in spite of it. A system that allows products onto the marketplace without a clear and transparent evaluation of risks and benefits will not fly with today's consumers, and risks killing this technology before it even starts to deliver on its real promises."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6170607 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: February 16, 2018End of Document
