Editor's Corner—Here are the U.S. wireless carriers currently using Huawei equipmentFierceWirelessJuly 5, 2018Copyright 2018 Questex Media Group LLC All Rights ReservedSection: ARTICLELength: 980 wordsByline: Mike DanoHighlight: As a group of lawmakers reportedly prepares to voice concerns about how the proposed merger of Sprint and T-Mobile might be affected by China's Huawei, there's something they should know: Huawei already commands a substantial business among a range of smaller U.S. wireless carriers. BodyAs a group of lawmakers reportedly prepares to voice concerns about how the proposed merger of Sprint and T-Mobile might be affected by China's Huawei, there's something they should know: Huawei already commands a substantial business among a range of smaller U.S. wireless carriers.Moreover, a significant number of Huawei's U.S. carrier customers—which offer wireless services to tens of thousands of Americans in rural locations across the country—are collectively happy with Huawei's services and argue that the company poses no threat to U.S. national security.“There is no evidence that Huawei equipment is a threat to national security, and southwestern Kansas residents rely on such equipment used by United TelCom to provide them with reliable wireless services not only for public safety purposes, but also for daily business and personal communications,” said Todd Houseman, the CEO of United TelCom, in a recent FCC filing.United TelCom counts around 20,000 wireless customers across 17 southwest Kansas counties, and has said that Huawei supplies nearly all of its wireless network.And United TelCom isn't alone. The company is one of roughly half a dozen rural wireless network operators that have come out in support of Huawei(PDF). More importantly, these carriers are unapologetically current Huawei customers:Why are so many smaller U.S. wireless companies working with Huawei, even after a2012 government report(PDF) warned that equipment from Huawei and ZTE could be used by the Chinese government for espionage? That's simple: Huawei equipment is apparently good and cheap.“JVT chose Huawei because it was the most cost-effective option with a 40% savings versus the 2nd most cost-effective option,” wrote James Groft, the carrier's CEO. “Huawei is also consequently our primary provider of customer support services, such as installation of new equipment and software upgrades. Huawei is highly cost-effective and it provides excellent customer service. Before contracting with Huawei, JVT had a series of terrible experiences with another, higher priced vendor. Huawei's service record, while not perfect, has resulted in fewer and less severe coverage outages for our customers. Huawei is there when our customers need them.”The fact that more than half a dozen smaller wireless operators across the United States are currently using Huawei equipment is important because a group of lawmakers in the U.S. House is reportedly preparing a letter related to the proposed merger of Sprint and T-Mobile. As noted by Bloomberg, the lawmakers are worried that Sprint's parent, SoftBank, has ties to China's Huawei."The Sprint, T-Mobile merger would increase telecommunications risks associated with third-party foreign entities, including Huawei, being utilized in the development of U.S. 5G infrastructure," the letter read.The letter is bound for Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, who leads the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS). The CFIUS has already shown a willingness to step into the telecommunications industry—it stated that Broadcom posed a national security threat as that company worked to close a hostile takeover of Qualcomm. That paved the way for President Trump to scuttle Broadcom's efforts.Interestingly, as Recon Analytics analyst Roger Entner pointed out, the letter to Mnuchin apparently makes no mention of Deutsche Telekom, T-Mobile's parent company and the firm that will own 42% of the combined Sprint and T-Mobile.Deutsche Telekom has made no secret of its ongoing work with China's Huawei.Unsurprisingly, one of Huawei's top wireless network executives in the United States, Thomas Dowding, argued the company does not threaten U.S. national security. He said in an FCC filing(PDF) that the company employs an internal cybersecurity lab that looks for security leaks, and that Huawei's products “are intrinsically secure because they are incapable of routing or redirecting user data traffic or because they do not permit visibility into data or packets transmitted or handled by such equipment.”Added Dowding: “In my 15-year tenure of executive positions at Huawei Technologies USA, the U.S. Government has never identified any particular deliberately compromised Huawei product. Likewise, I am not aware of any product backdoor identified by the U.S. Government to our customers. Also, the U.S. government has never requested a forensic examination of any Huawei product for security vulnerabilities. But the U.S. government is not alone. In fact, I'm not aware of any government in any country that has ever found an implanted backdoor in any of our products.”So what to make of all this? First, for Huawei's U.S. business and its U.S. customers, the situation is serious. The FCC is considering a ruling that would ban any U.S. company that receives government money—which would cover all of Huawei's customers listed above—from using equipment from companies that are deemed a threat to national security. Such an action would “have a severe and detrimental impact on residents living in remote, underserved locations in United TelCom's wireless service area,” according to United TelCom's CEO.That might not be enough to stop the anti-Huawei momentum though—consider the case of ZTE, Huawei's fellow Chinese equipment supplier, which is right now in the process of completely overhauling its front office in order to re-enter the U.S. market.Finally, it's hard not to link all the current noise over Chinese threats to national security back to Trump's brewing trade war with the country. It seems clear that companies like ZTE and            Qualcomm are probably being used as chess pieces in a broader game.And if that's the case, companies like United TelCom, Viaero and NE Colorado Cellular might need to prepare themselves to enter a chessboard where they will probably serve as pawns, not queens. – Mike |            @mikeddanoLoad-Date: July 20, 2018End of Document

NAWG JULY 12, 2018 WEEKLY UPDATESStates News ServiceJuly 12, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1564 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the National Association of Wheat Growers (NAWG):NAWG Board Member to Testify at Ways and Means Hearing on Trade House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee Chairman Dave Reichert (R-WA) announced on July 11th that the Subcommittee will hold a hearing entitled "The Effects of Tariffs on U.S. Agriculture and Rural Communities." The hearing will address the effects on American agriculture and rural communities of both U.S. tariffs imposed under Sections 232 and 301 as well as retaliation imposed by other countries against U.S. exports. It will take place on Wednesday, July 18, 2018, in 1100 Longworth House Office Building, beginning at 2:00 PM. NAWG Board of Director and Montana Wheat Grower Michelle Erickson-Jones will be testifying at the hearing on behalf of Farmers for Free Trade and NAWG. The hearing will also be available via webcast here. NAWG Board of Director Participates in APHIS Stakeholder Meeting On Tuesday, July 10th, NAWG Board of Director and Maryland Wheat Farmer Eric Spates, along with NAWG's Trade Policy Advisor Molly O'Connor, attended an APHIS Stakeholder meeting on trade. Held at the USDA, the purpose of the meeting was to discuss the current export of U.S. grain and oilseeds to China and other markets. Representing NAWG, Spates spoke on the importance of trade to growers, the damaging impact of tariffs, and how the Agency can help improve our trade relationship with China. NAWG Participates in FFA New Century Farmer Conference On Tuesday, July 10th, NAWG's Government Relations Coordinator Craig Berning participated in the 2018 Future Farmers of America (FFA) New Century Farmer Conference. This year's conference was held in Des Moines, IA and allowed participants to network with industry experts, presenters, and other aspiring farmers. Berning talked to FFA attendees on his position at NAWG, the role of the organization, and his experience in the industry as well as what it is like to pursue a career in agriculture. NAWG and U.S. Wheat Jointly Speak Out on Recent Trade Issues On Friday, July 6, 2018, the United States' tariffs on Chinese goods went into effect. NAWG and U.S. Wheat issued a joint release discussing the damaging impact that these tariffs will have on farm-families. In fact, the threat of the tariffs alone has already hurt the wheat industry. In our release, we note that "from March to June over the past three years, Chinese flour milling companies and their importers purchased an average of about 20 million bushels of U.S. wheat, returning well over $145 million to American farm families and grain handlers." However in 2018, "Chinese customers stopped making new purchases of U.S. wheat last March, after the Chinese government threaten a 25 percent import tariff on U.S. wheat in retaliation to the threat of U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports." Additionally on Friday, Japan became the second country to ratify the CPTPP, which could be implemented in early 2019 after six of the 11 countries that signed the agreement have ratified it. In our joint release, NAWG and USW argued that "once implemented, the agreement calls for incrementally discounting the effective import tariffs that Japanese flour millers pay for imported Australian and Canadian milling wheat from about $150 to about $85 per metric ton (MT). Imported U.S. wheat effective tariffs would remain at about $150 per MT." Canada and Australia, which are major competitors to the United States in the Japanese wheat market, are also parties to the agreement, meaning implementation would put U.S. wheat farmers at a severe disadvantage in our second biggest wheat market. U.S.-China Trade War Escalates This week, President Trump has moved ahead with his commitment to impose additional tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods. This announcement from the U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer increases the total to $450 billion on Chinese goods. Read more here. USDA to Ensure All Have Equal Access to Crop and Livestock Reports On July 10, 2018, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced new procedures for the release of market-affecting crop and livestock reports from the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) and World Agricultural Outlook Board (WAOB) to ensure that all members of the public have access to the information at the same time. Under current "Lockup" procedures, information is released to the public at 12:00 p.m. (Eastern), though the news media are allowed access approximately 90 minutes early, with their reports embargoed until the noon release time. Beginning August 1, 2018, USDA will provide media the same access to the NASS and WAOB reports as the public, with the information becoming available to all at 12:00 p.m. on days the reports are released. NAWG has received some media inquiries around this announcement and responded by stating that we have no current policy on this issue but will monitor it once it is enacted on August 1st. House Appropriators Look to Defund IARC As reported in AgriPulse, House Republicans inserted a provision in a fiscal 2019 appropriations bill which could cut U.S. funding to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) following its controversial finding that the herbicide glyphosate is a probable carcinogen. "The provision would block the National Institutes of Health from funding IARC until the NIH submits a report to Congress outlining transparency and conflict-of-interest requirements.'" Critics of the IARC's review process say it's antiquated and that the agency used data that supported its conclusion on glyphosate while ignoring other data that didn't. NIH and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provide about $6 million of IARC's approximately $54 million annual budget. NWF Blog: Making the Case for Research Funding for Wheat NAWG Director of Research and Technology, Steve Joehl, was featured in a Farm Journal article about why research funding is important for wheat. The article analyzes the gap between research funding dollars for wheat in comparison for that of corn and soybeans. As farmers make production decisions based on yield, research makes an impact on opportunities for the wheat industry in the future. NWF recently published a blog on this interview. NAWG/USW Co-Founder Passes On July 6, 2018, John Sullivan, a wheat farmer from Wallace, Nebraska, passed away at the age of 86. Sullivan was a founding member of National Association of Wheat Growers; and a key member who helped combine Great Plains Wheat and Western Wheat in to what is now U.S. Wheat Associates. He also helped to establish the Nebraska Wheat Growers Association, where his son and grandson are currently members. To learn more about John and his family, a link to his obituary can be found here. Washington Post: Four of the World's Largest Food Companies Have a New Plan for Fixing Food and Farm Policy The Sustainable Food Policy Alliance, or the U.S. divisions of Danone, Mars, Nestle and Unilever, says it will fight for progressive food policies from conservation programs to prominent nutrition labels that have long been eschewed by major food-makers. In doing so, the new alliance is likely to tangle with the mighty and well-moneyed Grocery Manufacturers Association, which Mars, Nestle, Unilever and seven other major firms abandoned amid high-profile philosophical disagreements in 2017. But with combined annual revenues of more than $200 billion, the four companies in the new alliance responsible for such well-known brands as Dannon yogurt, Snickers candy bars and Hellman's mayonnaise could prompt other food-makers to foreground nutrition and sustainability. Read more in The Washington Post. Homegrown by Heroes Celebrates Farmer Veterans The Farmer Veterans Coalition has started a new program, Homegrown by Heroes that pays tribute to farmer veterans. The program, sponsored by Farm Credit, allows for a label to be put on ag products indicating that the good was produced by a farmer has or is serving in the military. Homegrown by Heroes provides a way for consumers to support veterans in a unique and creative way. It also provides opportunities for veterans to get the word out about their products. Agri-Pulse Trade Series "Export or Bust" E-Book Available Agri-Pulse has made its five-part series on trade, "Export or Bust," available in one E-Book. U.S. Wheat, NAWG, Washington Grain Commission, Idaho Wheat Commission and North Dakota Wheat Commission were co-sponsors of the third article in the series which includes a significant amount of background and quotes from USW and NAWG. As a marketing partner of this series, USW and NAWG were able to provide an ad which linked to NAWG/USW Factsheet on TPP. NAWG encourages you to share this among your growers and your social media platforms. National Wheat Yield Contest: Spring Wheat Category As the 2018 National Wheat Yield Contest spring wheat deadline quickly approaches on August 1, the National Wheat Foundation is encouraging wheat growers to aim higher and register their crop in this year's contest. Think your spring wheat harvest might be a bin buster? Don't forget you can submit more than one entry to the contest for the chance to become a nationally recognized grower!

Mobile shares rise amid 5G deal with EricssonStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeSeptember 13, 2018 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: HI-TECH; Pg. 1Length: 466 wordsByline: Sandy MccarthyBodyThe press made it seem like T-Mobile gained ground on AT&T and Verizon in the 5G race, but 7 hours later, Verizon set the record straight by outlining its plan to launch 5G internet on october 1.Kit vendor Ericsson has announced a major deal win in the form of a $3.5 billion contract to bring TMUS into the 5G era.In its statement on the T-Mobile deal, Ericsson said it would supply 5G New Radio hardware and software to the operator, as well as various digital services, including dynamic orchestration technology, business support systems and its Ericsson Cloud Core."While the other guys just make promises, we're putting our money where our mouth is", said Neville Ray, T-Mobile chief technology officer, in making today's announcement. "With this new Ericsson agreement we're laying the groundwork for 5G - and with Sprint, we can supercharge the 5G revolution".United States network carrier T-Mobile and networking and telecoms provider Ericsson have signed a multi-year contract worth £3.5 billion. Verizon will also have a 5G phone around that time thanks to the 5G Moto Mod for the Moto Z3. Telstra, which is hosting the event, claims to have its 5G network already up and running using 13 mobile towers in the Gold Coast, one in Toowoomba, and one in Brisbane, with 200 more to go live by year's end.9 killed after SUV plows into crowd in central ChinaBut the Chinese government has long anxious about the potential for extremists or separatist groups to carry out similar attacks. The government statement called the attack a "malicious case of intentional driving" and said a man had been taken into custody.Indeed, this deal follows one the USA wireless operator made with Nokia, earlier in the year.Juniper's security products will also be part of Ericsson's solution to secure its customers' mobile networks as part of its end-to-end approach for securing existing and new 5G networks.Fredrik Jejdling, Executive Vice President and Head of Networks at Ericsson, says: "This accomplishment shows that 5G is ready for business".ERS now supports spectrum sharing which allows operators to power 4G and 5G services within the same spectrum band simultaneously. "Together with our partners we are continuing to prove the readiness of both the underlying technology and the ecosystem". In contrast, North East Asia will have 34 per cent and Western Europe 21 per cent. Ericsson says forecast for cellular IoT connections has almost doubled since November 2017, and is now expected to reach roughly 3.5 billion by 2023. AT&T also announced a successful 5G data transfer in Waco, Texas over millimeter wave using standards-based, production equipment with a mobile form factor device, utilizing a Qualcomm Technologies' smartphone form factor test device and Ericsson 5G-NR capable radios.Load-Date: September 13, 2018End of Document

Wal-Mart, Microsoft Take Aim At Amazon With Cloud Tech; Microsoft CEO Calls For A.I. Regulation Of Facial Recognition TechnologyMORNINGS WITH MARIA MORNINGS WITH MARIA 8:00 AM ESTJuly 17, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; DomesticLength: 7729 wordsByline: Maria Bartiromo, Jon Hilsenrath, Nicole Petallides, Dagen McDowell, Stuart Varney, Connell McShane, Deidre Bolton, Kristina PartsinevelosGuests: Lindsey Bell, Ian BremmerBodyMARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good Tuesday morning. Welcome back, everybody. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, July 17th. Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast. Taking on Amazon, Wal-Mart and Microsoft team up on a new cloud deal. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella telling me in an exclusive interview why the partnership is crucial.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SATYA NADELLA, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, MICROSOFT: Everything that we think about, every places being digitized whether it's a retail outlet or a hospital, a stadium, your home or your workplace is increasingly comPuting, it's getting embedded in the real world. And in the case of Wal-Mart is a good example because if you think about Wal-Mart they have an amazing need today when it comes to anything around off-line commerce but they're increasing the momentum online.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: More of my exclusive interview with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella straight ahead. Earnings in focus this morning on Wall Street. Three Dow components reporting their second quarter ahead of the opening bell. Johnson & Johnson, Goldman Sachs, and UnitedHealth are all out. Goldman Sachs President David Solomon will become CEO on October 1 according to the New York Times. The handoff to David Solomon was expected and now we know the date October 1 a change in leadership at Goldman Sachs. Markets this morning look like this, futures edging lower. The Dow Industrials now at the low of the morning here down about 30 points. The S&P 500 down three and the NASDAQ down 3-/2. This after the markets finished the day mixed yesterday. Take a look, Dow Industrials picked up 45 points but the S&P and the NASDAQ fractionally lower on the session.And in Europe this morning, markets are lower across the board. The FT-100 down nine points, the CAC quarante down 25, that's a half of a percent. And the DAX Index in Germany down a quarter of a percent. In Asia overnight, mixed performances, take a look the best performer was Japan, Nikkei Average up one-half of one percent. Amazon prime day will under way but it got off to a rock start outages prevented customers from making purchases yesterday. The fallout for the retail giant on the biggest sales day of the year.And it was a wild night at the Home Run Derby, Bryce Harper pulling off a last second win at his home stadium. We have all the highlights. All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, The Wall Street Journal global economics editor, Jon Hilsenrath and CFRA investment strategist, Lindsey Bell. Great show so far guys.LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA: Good to be here. And earnings are doing very, very well, 19.6 percent on the S&P 500. 90 percent of companies beating the bottom line.BARTIROMO: And revenue?BELL: And revenue, 87 percent finish top line.BARTIROMO: Just for the second quarter.BELL: Nine percent revenue.JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: The estimates are for earnings of 26 or 27 percent, isn't it?BARTIROMO: Not second quarter.(CROSSTALK)BELL: the numbers --(CROSSTALK)HILSENRATH: -- getting better as the new numbers comes.BARTIROMO: So you think the earnings period gets even better for the second quarter?HILSENRATH: Could be.BARTIROMO: All right. We're going to keep watching that. We want to look at Microsoft which is of course is reporting earnings later this week. It is teaming up with Wal-Mart to take on Amazon. The retail giant looking to accelerate its digital transformation with the help of Microsoft's cloud technology. I spoke exclusively with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella for his take on the partnership, privacy concerns facing technology today and where Microsoft can continue to grow.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)NADELLA: The core mission of our company really comes through in the momentum we have. If you think about it, we sort of describe our mission as empowering every person in every organization on the planet to achieve more. In our words, our success, whatever we have of it is dependent on our costumers succeeding in an increasingly digital world. That's what you see what's on the examples like Wal-Mart who's patterned deeply with us and others.BARTIROMO: It's interesting because this announcement with Wal-Mart, a strategic partnership, it's a digital transformation for Wal-Mart but you're calling this a 4-1/2 trillion opportunity. This transformation to digital.NADELLA: Yes, it's actually frustration. If we think about it for all the success of digital technology companies on a percentage basis of the GDP, the worldwide GDP, I think the text banned is just around five percent. It is expected to go to 10 percent next 10 years. But the real question is, what is the opportunity for the other 95 percent of GDP or the 90 percent of the GDP. How are they going to use the digital technology, doing some sense digital companies in their own right. Whether it's any retailer like Wal-Mart or any health company, 81 across all industries is going to look to digital technology to bring about the next level of experience innovation or cost savings.BARTIROMO: And for Wal-Mart, this is a critical transition as it battles with Amazon who of course, has been incredibly aggressive in that space. Tell me about I.T. budgets today. Are you seeing that increase in technology spending? I know that there was a pretty good lift when the tax plan first came out in anticipation of the tax cut plan but there was worries that things have slowed down. Are you still seeing I.T. budgets increase and are you seeing the kind of spend that you would expect?NADELLA: No, I mean, on a long-term basis, if I had to sort of look at it, tax spend or digital spend is absolutely going to increase just because everything that we think about every place is being digitized whether it's a retail outlet or a hospital, a stadium, your home or your workplace is increasing comPuting, it's getting embedded in the real world. Every experience is being driven by more and more A.I. capability. So that's what's going to keep driving more tax spend. It's going to essentially -- I think over the world's operating expense as well as cogs are being digitized. And in the case of Wal-Mart is a good example because if you think about Wal-Mart, they're having amazing lead today when it comes to anything around off-line commerce. But they're increasing their momentum online.BARTIROMO: Is the priority for companies today whether big or small, because let's not forget Microsoft is really the priority for smaller and midcap companies as well in addition to the G.E.s and the Wal-Marts of the world. But is the spend priority in terms of security right now or is it cloud? Where would you see the priority is in terms of corporate spending?NADELLA: I would say the number one priority is around productivity and digital transformation.BARTIROMO: Was it the tax cut plan that encouraged you to take some money back to the U.S.?NADELLA: I mean, I think we've had a pretty balanced approach. First and foremost we are being very aggressive spenders in R&D dollars and operating expenses right here in the United States. And if you look at what we do, we do (INAUDIBLE) $30 plus billion spend every year, and majority 85 percent of it is right here in the United States. And so we continue to bet on the organic growth and innovation but we are complementing that, whether it's with LinkedIn or pending acquisition or GitHub or what you did earlier with Minecraft. We are looking for assets that can complement what we do well and as well as dividends and buybacks. So, we think having that approach which is some in some sense more stable across all various different forms and spend patterns in business cycles is important. But at at the end of the day what matters to us is continue to drive the innovation and growth in this company.BARTIROMO: You have been in China for a long time and I have a stat here, someone said to me that there was expectation that 97 percent of companies in China use Microsoft Windows and more than 90 percent do not pay for it. You have been dealing with piracy this for a long time. What can you tell us about it?NADELLA: I mean, I think one of the fundamental things that been -- have been our approach in China is to be able sort of to look to how -- what do their customers and the government there value and how do we in some sense adapt the business models that allow us to succeed there. I think intellectual property needs to be protected. I think it's China's own interest to given that they now are big intellectual property creators themselves to help ensure that intellectual property like software is protected and that's something that we have a good dialogue with the Chinese government. And I think the voices coming out of Washington are all good which is we want fair trade between countries. I believe that the next 10 years, 20 years, 30 years whatever your time frame is is going to be defined by how the United States and China not only create an equilibrium between themselves but also for the rest of the world.BARTIROMO: But, you know, China won't even admit that they're stealing our I.P. So how do you change that behavior? Is there any way to stop that?NADELLA: Yes. I mean, absolutely. I mean, first of all, for example as we move to the cloud, you see a shift in how people acquire intellectual property and that by itself I think is very helpful but overall, I think every country that's going through a massive transformation internally and socially and economically, I am of the belief that when you get to a certain level of GDP and GDP growth, comes with it responsibility for protecting things like intellectual property.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, most people understand the issues around China because of that intellectual property theft but the aluminum and steel tariffs are something different. Are you expecting an impact as a result of these tariffs?NADELLA: You know, for us, we don't see anything today in our outlook. The overall I think, this entire world order so to speak that we've seen is based on a predictable model of how goods are produced and distributed and how well you add work. And I'm hoping that we'll come back. I think the President has said that what he wants is fair deals, and so I hope that as we negotiate them that we come back to a stable environment.BARTIROMO: Satya, obviously privacy has become the issue within the text base and in Silicon Valley particularly after the Cambridge Analytica scandal over at Facebook. A lot of people are expecting a heavier hand as it relates to technology. Are you expecting a new round of rules or regulations coming out of Washington and how will you adapt?NADELLA: You know, privacy in my opinion is now become a human right and that's how I think of it when it comes to our products and services. And the customers and consumers everywhere are going to demand it and expect it in our products. That's why we were very, you know, aggressive and in terms of responding to GDPR, in terms of implementation and we don't even think of GDP as just a one point in time regulation. It requires an ongoing commitment to compliance around privacy. And I think that -- I fully expect that more countries and more geographies including the United States are going to take a, you know, a lead from what the Europeans have done.BARTIROMO: Let's talk about your contract with the U.S. Immigration and Customs enforcements. Obviously a lot of noise around this, given the separation of families. I know your contract with ICE involves the legacy mail, e-mail, calendar, messenger and documents. Is there a potential for using the facial recognition as well?NADELLA: We have been very clear, in fact, a multiple years ago is when I wrote about RAI principals and how we are going to make sure that A.I. technology that we build and how it's used is always going to be driven by set of enduring principles. Now, one of the things that we recognize is with A.I. technology with all the benefits comes from unintended uses. Like bias or facial recognition. And so therefore, we are very clear that we will not participate in any project that is going to be against, you know, fundamental human rights. And in this case, what we are doing with ICE is to support them in the core infrastructure around e-mail but we are not at all involved in any of the facial recognition technology and their use cases. But more importantly we think that its' not just about a single company having principal approach which we do but it's also having a set of rules and regulations especially in a democracy like ours. Instead of us trying to govern the government, I think the legislative process should govern the companies and their technologies and the uses. That's what the blog, the Brad Smith wrote last week really outlines and we in fact welcome any regulation and any expert comedy that the legislative process creates. And then the rules and policies that come out of it.BARTIROMO: Yes. I was looking at Brad Smith's post and the truth is is we are in sort of an uncertain term -- time. When you look at A.I. and machine learning, there's a balance to walk here that these things are making our lives so much easier but at the same time people worried that it is in fact infringing on our privacy. There is that balance that Microsoft, the entire tech sector has to -- has to walk.BARTIROMO: That's absolutely correct. When it will comes to things like security or cybersecurity, privacy in A.I., I think in all of these cases two things need to happen. One is companies like us at Microsoft, we need to take responsibility and protect privacy as a human right, ensure things like we are doing with cybersecurity, like the Tech Accord. I think cover as like the Geneva Convention in the cybersecurity world. As well as have ethical principles that drive the development and the use of A.I. But on top of it, I think the governments around the world also have their role.BARTIROMO: As Congress plans to come up with a new solution here going into midterm elections, what kind of a legal immigration system would you like to see?NADELLA: You know, first of all, Maria, I am a product of I think two amazingly unique things, American, one is American technology that reached me where I was growing up and letting me dream the dream and American immigration policy that then allowed me to come here, get an education and live that dream. So I'll always come from that personal experience to advocate for and enlighten immigration policy that allows the -- for the best and the brightest to come to the United States, participate in our economy, pay taxes, create innovations that are going to make us more competitive globally.BARTIROMO: Are you finding employees that you need to put in the jobs that you have open? Recently we learned that there are more job openings than actually people to fill those jobs.NADELLA: I mean, I think we are seeing definitely growth is much faster and so therefore we have always have insatiable need for new talent and better talent. Be definitely can employ more people but at the same time I think this fantastic people in the right here in the schools in the United States as well as in the industry. So I think that yes, immigration, policy reform is required but I would not sort of use that as only thing that is required in order for us to continue to grow in the united states.BARTIROMO: Well, final question here, Satya. Obviously you're doing a lot, right? How does it feel sitting on the doorstep of a $1-trillion market value from Microsoft right now?NADELLA: For us I think, Maria, is going to come down to what I said which is how can we ensure that we stay focused on building technologies that are relevant in helping our customers.BARTIROMO: Satya, it's great to see you today. Thanks so much. And congratulations to you.NADELLA: Thank you so much, Maria.(END VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: We'll be right back. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. As we told you earlier, Goldman Sachs announced that David Solomon will take over for Lloyd Blankfein as CEO beginning October 1. Nicole Petallides is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with details looking at the stock. Nicole, good morning.NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria. So it's finally official, I mean, David Solomon has been speculated to be the succession to Lloyd Blankfein in this top role particularly after the Goldman co-President Harvey Schwartz was out. And so now, he is going to take the helm on October 1st. He will be the third Goldman CEO since it went public in 1999. Of course, Hank Paulson who have gone on to be treasury secretary under George W. Bush, then Lloyd Blankfein and now David Soloman. Veteran investment banker will be taking over on October 1st. Now we're also -- by the way, he's also a D.J., that was another underlying story on his spare time which I thought was really cute in Miami, New York, and Bahamas. Let's take a look also at the numbers. You can see that the stock is down about a quarter of a percent. They did beat on profit and revenue. Revenue was listed by fixed income where they're not able to make it as the trading revenue clients are just a little spooked by the sharp price moves and so the strength certainly with investment banking and that was a winner. Johnson & Johnson, that is up right now after a beat strong dollar did hurt, defending itself in the talc issues. And last but not least, you are seeing UnitedHealth to the downside. The premiums missed and also medical loss ratio missed estimates but they did raise a forecast and did have some good numbers but a couple of misses weighing on the stock. Back to you.BARTIROMO: All right. Stock down almost two percent UnitedHealth. Thank you, Nicole. Coming up. Amazon prime day starts with a glitch. Problems with the retail giant's Web site. Shoppers searching for deals later this hour. Then there is, Bryce Harper making an epic comeback. The highlights from last night's Home Run Derby coming up.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Trade tensions escalating in the United States. Filing complaints against trading partners including Canada, China, the European Union. This after lawsuits were filed against the U.S. through the World Trade Organization over the steel and aluminum tariffs. Joining us right now is Ian Bremmer, President of the Eurasia Group and GZERO Media. Ian, great to see you this morning.IAN BREMMER, PRESIDENT, EURASIA GROUP: Hi, Maia. Good morning to you.BARTIROMO: What progress is being made on the trade front? Where are you in this trade dispute whether if it would with China or our allies on aluminum and steel?BREMMER: So far, as you say, we have a dueling suits that have been put in place with the World Trade Organization. The the good news is that for those that were saying that there is draft, you know, sort of order going around from -- in the White House saying that Trump wants to withdraw the United States from the WTO, that was never feasible in terms of Congress. And it was never something that the Trump administration in any had a consensus in moving towards. They are using the WTO as the allies are, as China is and if this ends up getting resolved by the established multilateral trade organization over years, that's a much better place to be than unfettered escalation on trade.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Ian, it's Dagen McDowell. The commerce department under President Trump is studying this potential tariff on automobile imports into the United States, maybe 20 percent, maybe higher. They're looking at it right now. I believe there is a hearing even later this week. Do you think that just ultimately gets tabled because again they would try to argue that it's a -- that auto imports are risk to our national security potentially which just seems ludicrous.BREMMER: Yes. But it seems ludicrous to make that argument for steel and aluminum with say the Canadians but they still made it. So, I mean, the fact is that you have a regulation and you've got people that are looking to find any way to press forward with a political posture that they want to pursue. Look, we know that when you talk to CEOs and businesspeople in the U.S., it's not the Helsinki meeting between Trump and Putin that they're worried about, they're worried about Trump's stance on trade. And they certainly believe and it's a -- it's true that if we press forward with these automotive tariffs that you're going to see, a significant hit to American workers, a significant hit to a lot of these American businesses.BARTIROMO: By the way, Kevin Brady said that, he said that that's' going to show up in the economic numbers later this year, Jon.HILSENRATH: Well, you know, you raised Helsinki and I want to -- I want to ask you about that. The President goes to Europe and he calls the European allies foes and then turns to Helsinki and has a pretty compatible interaction with Putin. How do you think America's European allies are looking at that Helsinki meeting and how does that shape the way they're going to respond to our trade stance and the challenge that the President is putting in front of them on autos and all these other goods?BREMMER: Well, look, I mean, to be clear, it was very strange when Trump referred to the E.U. as a foe but then after that, he said China is also a foe, Russia is also a foe. So, the problem is that Trump clearly has a better set of relationships personally with authoritarian leaders around the world like Erdogan who he fist bumps at the NATO Summit in front of everyone else. Like Kim Jong-un, like Putin then he does with a lot of the allies. So obviously, the toxicity of the transatlantic relations, despite the fact that we have much closer relationships is a problem. On the other side, you look at Putin, it's very clear that Trump wants a better relationship with Putin. It's also very clear he's not going to get one. There is a reason why Trump spent over two hours with Putin in private and not with his advisories. It's not because he was worried that the advisers were going to say something out of turn that was more hawkish. Those advisers don't say boo unless Trump turns to them and says Mr. Pompeo, Mike, do you want to comment and say something, right? The issue is they don't agree with him. They have a harder line policy on Russia as the Republican Party does and they would have leaked like crazy if they were in that room. U.S. sanctions against Russia are still in place and there are harder line than they were under Obama. U.S. defense spending is up. Trump didn't say anything on recognition of Crimea, he didn't suspend NATO or U.S. military activities in the Baltics. He certainly didn't say we're going to take U.S. troops out of Syria. So as embarrassing as yesterday was from the perspective the of American President standing on the stage and providing moral equivalency with President Trump -- Putin, we need to recognize that the -- that actually U.S. policy towards Russia under the Trump administration is likely to be harder line at the end of 2018 than it was today.(CROSSTALK)HILSENRATH: Do you think we dial up --BARTIROMO: That's a really good point.HILSENRATH: Do you think we dial up sanctions on the Russians? We did it earlier this year when previous allegations of interference in our elections came out. Do we take these latest Mueller allegations and add to the sanction list?BREMMER: I think we do. I think that Congress will continue to move in that direction as we see evidence -- intelligence evidence of the Russians engaged in the creation of more fake accounts and disinformation and cyberattacks around the midterm elections. Certainly in terms of cyberattacks against American critical infrastructure which is the single piece I was most concerned that Trump did not bring up publicly. It's the one that's the greatest danger in area of confrontation between the two countries. Congress is not backing off from that, Trump's own advisers are not backing off unless they all resign, there's no question that's where most of the Republican Party across the board is heading this year. I think we will see tougher sanctions, another round that comes down from the Americans against Russia later this year irrespective of whether that's what Trump wants or not.BARTIROMO: That's what Jon Hilsenrath actually said earlier. Yes. That's a really good point, Ian. Thanks so much for joining us this morning, Ian.BREMMER: My pleasure, guys.BARTIROMO: Good to see. Ian Bremmer there. Coming up. President Trump headed to the Hill to discuss tax reform 2.0. We'll head to Washington, D.C. as well for all the details next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, July 17th, your top stories right now 8:31 on the east coast. Trade tensions taking a backseat as investors are focused on earnings season today. Futures are indicating a fractionally lower opening for the broader averages. It's going to a big week for second-quarter reports, and we've already heard from three Dow components this morning. In Europe, this morning, markets are lower across the board, take a look, as you see, the FT-100 right around even, the CAC Quarante is down a third of a percent in Paris, and the DAX Index is down a fraction in Germany. In Asia overnight, mixed performances there as well. The one best performer was Japan, Nikkei Average up half a percent.Amazon Prime Day starts with a glitch. Problems with the retail giant's Web site as shoppers search for deals later this hour. Plus, Jeff Bezos becomes the richest man alive. Details on the jaw-dropping net worth of the Amazon founder. And then, Bryce Harper staging an epic comeback in this year's Major League Baseball home run derby.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There it is! Centerfield, and Bryce Harper has thrown his bat in the air, and won the 2018 T-Mobile home run derby.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: More of the highlights as we head live to Nationals Park in Washington, D.C., coming up. But, first, President Trump is putting another round of tax reforms on the fast track. Kristina Partsinevelos is in Washington this morning with all the details. Kristina, good morning.KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Good morning. That is Tax Reform 2.0. That's what they're calling it. You have some Republicans that are going to be meeting with the President this afternoon. What they're going to expect to some changes from the first set of tax cuts that happened about a year ago. What am I talking about changes? They were, we know, the corporate tax rate went from 35 percent to 21 percent. We know individual tax rates changed for the vast majority of Americans.And I'd like to highlight just two income brackets. You have those that made around $38,000 to about $82,000, they saw their tax bracket dropped from 25 percent to 22 percent. However, if you're also, you know, making a little bit more money over $500,000, you saw your tax rate drop from 39.6 percent to 37 percent as well. So, both sides of the income brackets -- for across the board, they did benefit from these tax cuts. The problem is these individual tax cuts are set to expire in 2025. President Trump weighed in, listen to what he had to say about these tax cuts.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're doing a phase two, we'll be doing it probably on October, maybe a little sooner than that. And it will be more of a middleclass. We did a lot for the middleclass but this will be even more aimed at the middleclass. One of the things we're thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20, and then, for the most part, the rest of it would go right to the middleclass.(END VIDEO CLIP)PARTSINEVELOS: And what we know is Tuesday, they want to extend these individual tax rates, there's possibility about having universal savings account. There's also talk about small businesses and how small businesses can help retirement plans, specifically, encouraging small employers to offer retirement savings programs as well as annuities that would turn workers' savings into a guaranteed annual income. I know, Maria, you spoke on Wall Street to Kevin Brady, he's the chairman of the tax rating committee, and he also weighed in about how this could be beneficial to future growth in the American economy. Listen in.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. KEVIN BRADY (R), TEXAS: President Trump's tax cuts and reforms was about changing the economic direction of the country for the better, 2.0 is about changing the culture in Washington, where we don't wait 30 years between fixing the tax code, we get better every year, we continue to lead the rest of the world here. And so, you're going to see, I think, permanence of the middleclass cuts and the small business cuts will be the centerpiece of this. And people, I think, overlook the growth impact long term. That alone could help create a million and a half new jobs in America, continue to raise paychecks significantly in the long term. So, that will be the centerpiece of it. We're working with the President on the rest of the elements of 2.0.(END VIDEO CLIP)PARTSINEVELOS: So, Kevin Brady did highlight that they want to make it permanent. That's going to be the huge obstacle within the House because a lot of people have discussed, how high the deficit has ballooned because of these tax cuts. So, they're going to need about 60 votes and a lot of even Republicans have voiced some unease regarding this deficit. They want to push this forward before midterms as well. Maria?BARTIROMO: Yes. How do you pay for it? The question keeps coming up. Kristina, thank you.PARTSINEVELOS: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Kristina Partsinevelos. Let's turn to North Korea's nuclear ambitions hours after the Helsinki summit with Russia's President. President Trump revealed that Vladimir Putin will help the United States deal with North Korea and nuclear weapons. Here's what the President told Sean Hannity last night.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: You know, if look at Russia and the United States, that's 90 percent of the nuclear weapons. And --(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: -- doing something and working on other countries. And he also said he wants to be very helpful with North Korea. We're doing well with North Korea, we have time. There's no rush. You know, it's been going on for many years.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me now is the former deputy defense secretary under George W. Bush and former ambassador to Indonesia, Paul Wolfowitz. Ambassador, good to see you this morning, thanks very much for joining us.PAUL WOLFOWITZ, FORMER UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO INDONESIA: Nice to be with you.BARTIROMO: Your reaction to what you just heard?WOLFOWITZ: Look, we've been dealing with the North Korea issue for many years. I thought the whole idea was to try to get it behind us then to do it reasonably quickly. I'm worried that we're getting now mired in this strategic patience of waiting step-by-step and the North Koreans will continue to extract more and more as we go.BARTIROMO: So, what should the President do then at this point? I mean, it was pretty historic that they met. We thought that we would see more progress. Are we seeing progress?WOLFOWITZ: It seems to me we're not seeing progress. If anything, things seem to be going backward in terms of what the North Koreans are saying when they denounce the Secretary of State as a gangster after their meetings with him, and we're trying to pretend the meetings were fine. There's something wrong there. You know, in his own book, President Trump wrote years ago that in negotiating, it's important to know when to walk away, otherwise you start to seem desperate. And I worry that we may be starting to seem too eager for an agreement, and that's a bad way to get there.BARTIROMO: That's interesting. And your thoughts on the Helsinki meeting, and the -- and the press conference with Putin?WOLFOWITZ: Well, of course, we don't know much about the meeting except the press conference. But the press conference by itself is very important. And I hate to say this, but I think -- well, I don't hate to say this part, Putin is a classic KGB bully, with former President Bush, he even showed him his big Russian wolfhound and said, see, bigger, faster, stronger than your little scotch terrier. That's the kind of man he is, and I think, Americans often make the mistake, and I think maybe President Trump made this mistake, of thinking the way to improve relations with someone like that is to be nice to them. They just interpret that as weakness.We have a lot of business to do with Russia, it's true. We could do with a better relationship, we could do with less close relationship between Russia and China, but that's not come -- going to come about by having Putin underestimate us and I'm afraid if the tone of the private meeting was like the press conference, where Putin dismissively said, what makes you think after Trump had said everything changed four hours ago, Putin dismissively says, why do you think we trust one another? It doesn't bode well.BARTIROMO: Yes.WOLFOWITZ: It reminds me, actually, Maria, of when President Kennedy met with, I guess, he was called General Secretary at the time, Nikita Khrushchev of the Soviet Union.BARTIROMO: Yes. Right.WOLFOWITZ: In Vienna in 1962, I think. It was interpreted as Kennedy being weak and was followed not so long afterwards by the Cuban missile crisis. You need to make sure he takes this deadly serious.BARTIROMO: But what do you think about the policies? When you look at the policies that the U.S. has put in place, as it relates to Russia, whether it'd be sanctions, or troops, or you know, poking the Germans for having the gas pipeline deal? When you look at the policies versus the appeasement that we saw onstage yesterday, they're very different, aren't they?WOLFOWITZ: They are somewhat different. They're not as different as they might be, but -- I think -- I mean, part of the problem, to be fair to the President, our President is that we're in a pretty deep hole in Syria and in Ukraine, and it's not clear how you dig out of that hole but we do need more pressure, and I think tougher sanctions would be appropriate. But I think something else we ought to be looking at is exposing what we know about Putin's corruption which I believe goes very, very deep. And the U.S. Justice Department has an ability to expose that which would be a huge pressure on Putin. We ought to think about doing something like that in my opinion.BARTIROMO: Really interesting. Let me -- let me move over to the border crackdown. The National Guard which has been part of the stepped up immigration efforts has helped border agents arrest more than 10,000 illegal immigrants just since April. This comes as House GOP leaders are set to hold a vote tomorrow in support of all the Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and denounce the calls by Democrats to abolish the ICE agencies. What do you make of the democratic attempt to abolish ICE? I mean, obviously, that stance has quicklu fallen apart.WOLFOWITZ: I think you've just said it right there. We have to have immigration enforcement, we have to have border enforcement. I think sometimes ICE officials may get too aggressive about keeping people out of that treating immigrants -- or treating everyone as the illegal one whether they are or not. And certainly, we made, if nothing else, a mistake in this handling of the children that we separated from their parents. I think we're on the way to correcting that, and I think -- I think at the heart of this immigration issue, unfortunately, is a kind of canyon between the two sides, of one side saying, we really don't need any border enforcement at all, and I think that enrages most Americans who'll say, what the heck are you talking about here?BARTIROMO: Yes, I totally agree with that. Let me ask you, Secretary, look across the world for us, where do you see the biggest risks in terms of foreign policy right now for the United States?WOLFOWITZ: You know there's a big difference between the risks right now and the risks further in the future. Further -- and I'm going to go further in the future first because I think that is where China is potentially our biggest problem, it's a huge strong country that is clearly on an expansion in a kind of imperial mode. And that's the reason, by the way, in defense of trying to improve relations with Russia, to see if we can separate the two of them, instead of having them be close buddies which is where they are now. But I think in terms of immediate risks, North Korea is clearly one of the most serious ones. And I don't think we're making a progress with the speed that we thought we could, or that we should be able to do. So, I think we need to think about a tougher policy probably with North Korea than we've had.BARTIROMO: What's the tougher policy? Like, what would be the most important policy this President could adopt?WOLFOWITZ: Look, I think that regime is very vulnerable to economic sanctions. It's a miserable economy but they have to keep paying their policemen and their guards, and when they start running out of money to do that, I think it -- something that has to make them very nervous. And we went further with sanctions under this President than we have in the past, but I think there's still a long way that we could be going. So basically shut them out of the international financial system and to shut down people who are helping them like Chinese companies.BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes, really good point. Ambassador, it's great to see you this morning, thanks very much for your insights.WOLFOWITZ: You're very welcome.BARTIROMO: We appreciate it very much. Paul Wolfowitz joining us there. Coming up, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is crowned the richest man alive. Richest man in the planet. The details on the jaw-dropping net worth of the founder of Amazon. Then, Bryce Harper making an epic comeback, the highlights from last night's home run derby, coming up.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. So, Amazon's Prime Day wasn't exactly ready for primetime. Deirdre Bolton is in New York City with all the details on that. Deirdre, hello, good morning to you.DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Hello, Maria, good morning. I'm in front of Whole Foods which as you will remember, Amazon bought for upwards of $13 billion last year, but you mentioned these glitches for Prime Day which started yesterday at 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time, yes, for about three hours, Maria. If you were trying to buy something, you actually couldn't pay for it which I'm pretty sure is about the worst thing can happen to a retailer. Social media, you have this whole #goingaround which was #PrimeDayFail. But I want to let you know that statistically, it was still a win for Amazon even in those dicey three hours, shoppers have still spent more than 54 percent more in those first three hours than they did on Prime Day this time last year. So, you may wonder or for our viewers who may wonder, what exactly is Prime Day, this is the fourth annual run at it for Amazon, it equals Black Friday as far as the numbers go.Amazon has more than a million deals today, Maria, they want you to buy Fire Stick, Echo Dot, that was the big seller last year. They also want you to buy groceries. They didn't buy Whole Foods for nothing. So, if you show up here, if you're an Amazon Prime Member who has not yet gotten a grocery deliver from Whole Foods, if you go today, you spend more than $10.00, you get $10.00 off of future order and another one as well. All of this, glitches included, we have to say have not hurt the founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos. He is the world's richest man, at least measured in modern U.S. dollars of 150 billion U.S. is his worth. The stock is up 55 percent this year, Maria, that has added $50 billion just to his pocket alone.So, he has passed Bill Gates, of course, the founder of Microsoft. Jeff Bezos has also passed the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett, he has passed Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook. And a lot of people somewhat critical of Jeff Bezos saying, OK, well, how come he isn't giving more of his money away, all of those other people that I mentioned obviously have plans in place. But he is working on building infrastructure in space, that has been the answer untold but that takes a lot of money. Maria?BARTIROMO: That's incredible, Deirdre, $150 billion value -- net wealth of Jeff Bezos. Pretty incredible. Deirdre, thank you, we will be watching Amazon shares and where Bezos' wealth goes next. Can you believe that, you guys, $150 billion?(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Here's to Varney about to weigh -- and you predicted it. Once again, you predicted yesterday you said it was going to be a big day, and you've been positive on Amazon for some time.STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: I remember, a half century ago, when I was brought up on the idea that if you are truly rich, you could live on the interest from the interest from your capital. I suspect that Mr. Bezos can live on the interest on the interest on the interest on the interest from his $150 billion, but I digress. Look, I think that big tech investors face a bit of a problem right now, can big techl keep on scoring 30, 40 percent increases in their profits and their revenue? That's a very tough row to hoe, but that's the situation as of now.If you look at Netflix, which I consider a big name technology company, they're going to be down, what, 10, maybe 11 percent this morning because they missed their expectations, they missed their new subscribers. So, there's a big question here for all of big tech, is it the end of the road or should I buy more, or just do nothing and let it ride? Very interesting question today.BARTIROMO: Well, maybe the expectations have to come in just a little. When you have expectations all the way up there, hard to have any room for error.VARNEY: I hate expectations. You know what I feel about that.BARTIROMO: Stu, we'll see you in 10 minutes.VARNEY: You will.BARTIROMO: I know you got a lot more on "VARNEY & COMPANY." Join Stuart top of the hour at 9:00 a.m. right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA. But first, Bryce Harper winning this year's home run derby. More of the highlights next as we head to Nationals Park in D.C.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Fireworks at the home run derby. Hometown hero, Bryce Harper, wowing the crowd as Washington, D.C., gets ready for tonight's all-star game. Connell McShane with the details from Nationals Park. Connell?CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Hey, there, good morning, Maria, kind of fun to be here in Washington talking some baseball instead of politics for a change. 89th Major League Baseball all-star game will be tonight on the Fox broadcast network, and the first time they've had it here in D.C. since back in 1969 when it was the Senators, not the Nationals playing in this city. But as you said it, last night, a lot of fun with the home run derby. Let's take a look at some of the highlights, Bryce Harper, obviously with the favorite go again given the hometown guy and he came out dressed for the occasion with stars and stripes bandana. But I got to tell you, for Harper got a run from his -- for his money from the Cubs' Kyle Schwarber.Now, Schwarber, the power left-handed hitter hit more than 20 home runs in the semi-final run of the derby and then in the final, he kind of set the pace. He went first, did Schwarber, and he put 18 on the board. So, Harper knew he had to make a good run at it. He got off to a slow start in the final. When Harper came up, his dad pitching too him, just couldn't get the rhythm. Took a time-out which you're allowed to do in the home run derby, kind of take a deep breath, set himself, and then he really got going on some kind of a run, and hit the game-winning home run with two hands in the air. The big celebration in front of the hometown crowd.So, sometimes that's more exciting, Maria, than the game. We'll see how things go tonight but I know there was a lot of buzz here in the stadium for the derby last night. We'll have plenty more throughout the day (INAUDIBLE) the game is on Fox tonight, so we'll speak to some of the stars there (INAUDIBLE) Alex Rodriguez and others, and maybe a few surprise guests, so we'll see you throughout the day here from Nationals Park.BARTIROMO: Awesome. Great coverage, Connell, thanks. We'll be tune in. Have fun, Connell McShane. Remember to watch the MLB All-Star game tonight at 8:00 p.m. Eastern on Fox. Coming up, we got final thoughts from this all-star panel. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Final thoughts from this all-star panel. Lindsey Bell?BELL: I think Netflix -- we're getting a gift. This is a buying opportunity. They're spending more on content than anyone else, and I think they will bode guidance.BARTIROMO: Wow. Even the stock is where it is. All right, Jon Hilsenrath?HILSENRATH: 9:15 we're going to get really strong data on manufacturing sector. 10:00 a.m. we're going to have Jay Powell saying the economy is in great shape. Despite all of these angsts right now about what's happening on the trade front, the economy is in pretty good shape.BARTIROMO: It sure is. And we're going to get a 4-1/2 percent number on GDP, you said.(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: Right. That's the estimate from the Atlanta Feds for now. But the reason that there is so much optimism is because those tax cuts for corporations, they're permanent. Regardless of what the President says or does not say, that's something that companies can take to the banks.BARTIROMO: And today, they're going to try to come up with Tax Plan 2.0 and make the individual cuts permanent.MCDOWELL: Right. And maybe turn the attention to the economy and away from what happened in Helsinki.HILSENRATH: I'm waiting for them to do something about the deficit. It's nice to have those tax-cuts but we've got very good --(CROSSTALK)(LAUGHTER)MCDOWELL: Good luck.BARTIROMO: Yes, good point. Thanks, everybody. Great show. Right to Varney we go. That'll do it for us. Have a great day, everybody. Here's Stuart. Stu?VARNEY: Here I am, and good morning, Maria, and good morning, everyone.Load-Date: July 18, 2018End of Document

Clean200 Weathers Perfect Storm, Holds Own Against Surging Oil Prices, Tariff WarsTargeted News ServiceAugust 22, 2018 Wednesday 7:34 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 405 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: OAKLAND, California BodyAs You Sow Foundation issued the following news release:Today, As You Sow and Corporate Knights released its fifth update of the Carbon Clean 200(TM) (Clean200(TM)), a list of the 200 largest publicly traded companies making significant revenue from clean energy. After a period of outperforming the S&#38;P Global 1200 Energy Index (fossil fuel benchmark), a series of global events converged to leave the Clean200 behind the fossil fuel benchmark for only the second time since its inception two years ago. However, the Clean200 when excluding Chinese companies continued to outperform.The greatest drag on the Clean200 comes from Chinese companies which now represent 15 of the 20 worst performing companies on the Clean200. The escalating trade war between the U.S. and China which targets specific Clean200 categories (electricity transformers, lithium batteries and LEDs) has taken a heavy toll on Chinese stocks across the board, with the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index plunging 18% year-to-date.The Clean200, excluding China, generated a 35.2% return over the past two years compared to its fossil fuel benchmark, the S&#38;P 1200 Global Energy Index, which returned 23.5%.Additionally, the Chinese government's move this June to slash solar subsidies and quotas led to major drops in solar industry stock prices."No strategy outperforms in every period, but given the large Chinese company component of the Clean200, it is remarkable that the Clean200 has held up so well against the triple whammy of U.S.-China trade war, surging oil prices, and the rolling back of Chinese solar subsidies," Toby Heaps, CEO of Corporate Knights, said.The three best performing Clean200 stocks over the past two years consist of Sumco Corp. (+226%), Bombardier (+163%), and Kingspan Group (+141%). Toyota Motor, Siemens AG, and Schneider Electric continue to top the Clean200 list with combined clean energy revenue of more than $100 billion USD."It is interesting to note that when you strip out Chinese stocks from the Clean200, it still outperforms the fossil fuel benchmark even during a period of volatility and policies aimed at harming clean energy companies," Andrew Behar, CEO of As You Sow, said. "The global transition to clean energy, that must happen to avoid climate catastrophe, continues regardless."Contact: Stefanie Spear, 216/387-1609, sspear@asyousow.orgCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6417064 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: August 23, 2018End of Document

Despite China's prohibitions on trading cryptocurrencies as a regulated central exchange, company CEO Warren Wang stated in an interview last month that many Chinese investors are trading them legally on unregulated  over the counter  platforms that connect individuals to each other. And ChineseInvestors.com showed its own commitment to cryptocurrency by installing a Bitcoin ATM in the lobby of its San Gabriel, California, headquarters (http://nnw.fm/VIa3n). Wang called it the first such automated teller for cryptocurrency within the Chinese community in the United States and said it has generated a lot of traffic.China serves as an example of the mutual distrust that drives cryptocurrencies' prospects while relying on so-called  miners  to establish a level of trust in the legitimacy of the exchanges.Despite the lack of a regulated Chinese exchange to trade cryptocurrencies and what Wang referred to as the Chinese government's  badmouthing  of bitcoin though its official TV media outlet, the CEO said Chinese-speaking people within China and North America are very interested in buying, selling and trading bitcoin among themselves and he urged entrepreneurs to be patient as the community learns the ropes.About ChineseInvestors.comFounded in 1999, ChineseInvestors.com endeavors to be an innovative company providing: (a) real-time market commentary, analysis, and educational related services in Chinese language character sets (traditional and simplified); (b) advertising and public relation related support services; and (c) retail and online sales of hemp-based products and other health related products.

The9 Limited Announces Receipt of Nasdaq Notice of DeficiencyPR NewswireJuly 17, 2018 Tuesday 5:00 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 623 wordsDateline: SHANGHAI, July 17, 2018 BodyThe9 Limited (Nasdaq: NCTY) ("The9" or the "Company"), an established Internet company, today announced that it received a notification letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. ("Nasdaq") dated July 16, 2018 indicating that the Company no longer meets the continued listing requirement of minimum Market Value of Publicly Held Shares ("MVPHS") for the Nasdaq Global Market, as set forth in the Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(C) because the market value of the Company's publicly held American depositary shares ("ADSs"), each representing three ordinary shares of the Company, for the last 30 consecutive business days was below the minimum MVPHS requirement of US$15,000,000.Pursuant to Rule 5810(c)(3)(D) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules, the Company has a compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until January 14, 2019 (the "Compliance Period"), to regain compliance with Nasdaq's minimum MVPHS requirement. If at any time during the Compliance Period, the Company's MVPHS closes at US$15,000,000 or more for a minimum of ten consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide the Company a written confirmation of compliance and the matter will be closed. In the event the Company does not regain compliance with Rule 5450(b)(2)(C) prior to the expiration of the compliance period, the Company will receive written notification that its securities are subject to delisting from the Nasdaq Global Market.The Company's management is looking into various options available to regain compliance and maintain its continued listing on The Nasdaq Global Market, and is also considering other options, including a potential transfer of its listing of securities to the Nasdaq Capital Market. The Nasdaq Capital Market is a continuous trading market that operates in substantially the same manner as the Nasdaq Global Market where listed companies must meet certain financial requirements and comply with Nasdaq's corporate governance requirements.Safe Harbor StatementThis announcement contains forward-looking statements.

Ponzi schemes arrive at "blockchain" platformsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 25, 2018 SaturdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 338 wordsBody The Chinese government warned about the appearance of criminals who attract retail investors to Ponzi schemes using buzzwords such as blockchain and virtual currency, as official concerns about risk outweigh the support for financial innovation.  Many investment schemes "do not really rely on blockchain technology but advertise the concept to raise funds illegally," the People's Bank of China, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission and the Public Security Bureau said in a joint statement. .  The agencies did not announce specific policy actions, but warned the public that they should be on guard against "fraud" and report suspicious activities to the authorities.  Marketing statements such as "value will only rise, will never go down" and "high returns, low risk" are characteristic of fraud, the statement said.  The warning was issued when Chinese regulators stepped up their offensive against cryptocurrency operations and initial currency offers (ICOs).  A multi-agency internet finance team will take action against 124 cryptocurrencies and ICO platforms with servers that are located outside of China, but are aimed substantially at Chinese residents, the official Shanghai Securities News reported this week. The report did not specify how the authorities will act against foreign groups.  Tencent, the Chinese internet group, also closed at least four major public accounts related to cryptocurrencies on its popular mobile message platform, WeChat.  The company said in a statement that it was sent by email that the accounts violated the instant messaging regulations that the China Cyberspace Administration issued in 2014.  The ICO enjoyed a brief but intense boom in China in the middle of last year; However, in September the government of the Asian giant declared them illegal and closed the platforms that facilitated this type of business.  Days later, a working group made up of several internet finance agencies closed the exchange markets to operate bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies. Load-Date: August 25, 2018End of Document

Important Buddhist monk will be investigated for accusations of sexual harassment of six nunsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 2, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 493 wordsBody Chinese religious authorities on Thursday began an investigation into a famous Buddhist monk,accused of sexually harassing six nuns, a claim denied by his monastery.  A 95-page report, produced by two old nuns and broadcast online earlier this week, caused a major scandal that splashed Master Xuecheng, a member of the Communist Party, and the Longquan monastery, which he directs.  They accuse this religious figure of sending text messages with an uninhibited or threatening tone to six nuns to force them to have sexual relations with him.  Four of them accepted his request, as he assured them that sex was part of their Buddhist formation, according to the report, which also denounced the precarious situation of the monastery's finances.  "We received the elements and the content described in the report and we started an investigation and verification work on these claims," ??the state administration in charge of religious affairs said Thursday. This assured to take "very seriously" the accusations.  According to the official newspaper Global Times, the authorities summoned and interrogated Xuecheng, but they immediately released him.  The monastery of Longquan denied in a statement these accusations. In addition, he criticized that in the report appear "trafficked evidence" and denounced "a deliberate attempt to harm" the master Xuecheng and his monastery.  "This incident arose out of a desire for revenge," insisted the Longquan monastery, which asked the government and religious authorities to investigate the accusation.  Xuecheng, the head of the Chinese Buddhist Association and a member of the Chinese parliament's advisory chamber , is a celebrity in China, where millions of worshipers carefully follow their publications on their Weibo account, the Twitter equivalent of the Asian giant.  In the outskirts of Beijing, his monastery tries to reconcile the spiritual demands of Buddhism with a use of new technologies. In this temple last year, an intelligent robot played a monk, talking about the mantras and the principles of karma with visitors.  The report that accuses Master Xuecheng and the reactions on social networks were quickly censored.  In a microblog publication, one of the authors of the report explained that he felt obliged to disseminate this information, since the alleged abuses were ignored by the authorities, who preferred not to initiate an investigation against the famous Buddhist teacher.  In China, there is no legal definition of sexual abuse, a widespread practice in this country.  The #MeToo campaign, which had a global impact after the revelation of the Weinstein case, motivated Chinese students to report cases of assault and sexual harassment on university campuses. The awareness of this issue remains under the control of the Chinese government.  The entry Important Buddhist monk will be investigated for accusations of sexual harassment to six nuns was first published in The Third. Load-Date: August 2, 2018End of Document

Multi-Million Pound International Investment to Launch New Industrial Research Facility in LeicesterTargeted News ServiceJuly 27, 2018 Friday 6:58 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 931 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: LEICESTER, England BodyThe University of Leicester issued the following news release:A multi-million pound Research Centre for metal and alloys has been launched in Leicester.It will enable the University of Leicester and partners to work with China for an initial period of five years to bring advanced thinking to metal production.Representatives from TWI Ltd, the Materials Processing Institute in the UK, University College London, China Fosun International Limited , China National Innovation Institute of Additive Manufacturing and Xi'an Jiaotong University, the Department for International Trade, the Chinese Embassy in London, China-Britain Regional Initiative and Leicester City Council Economic Development Team converged on the University of Leicester on 17th July 2018 to celebrate the establishment of the NISCO-UK Research Centre in the Department of Engineering.Hong Kong listed company Fosun International and Chinese state-owned enterprise Nanjing Iron and Steel Group have a joint venture, NISCO, that involves the manufacturing of ferrous metals and sales of steel materials.It is a major "challenger" business in the Chinese Iron and Steel Industry with a specific focus on specialised applications including oil &#38; gas pipeline steel, high strength ship plate, wind turbine plate and heat treatment plate. The business is escalating investment in R&#38;D and internationalisation as part of its growth plans.Negotiation for this initiative started one year ago at an event organised by the British Council in China. In May 2018, at a special ceremony in China marking the 60th anniversary of NISCO, the new Research Centre with the University of Leicester was announced. Now, after the opening ceremony held in Leicester, the inaugural board meeting was convened in the newly refurbished NISCO Research Centre Offices on Level 5 of the Engineering Tower.Yixin Huang, Chair of NISCO Board, together with Pro-Vice-Chancellor and Head of College, Professor Paul Monks, unveiled a plaque to mark the collaboration and Yixin expressed his warm congratulations to the University for the Joint Initiative.Professor Monks, said the University believed in inspirational, world class research - with the NISCO Research Centre taking this to another level. He said: "Applying cutting-edge technological innovation to the next generation of materials is critical to a whole range of real-world problems from medicine to buildings. The NISCO centre will develop new metallic materials and next generation manufacturing methodology. It is exciting to be working in a global partnership bringing together the best of UK and China. This will drive in the longer term jobs and growth in both China and the UK."Yixin Huang, said the Research Centre would be a model for Sino-British cooperation, thus benefit the people of the two countries. He said: "It will help NISCO achieve industrial upgrading and high quality development. At the same time, it also helps the University of Leicester and British research institutions towards industrialization of scientific and technological achievements as soon as possible."Neil Evans, Trade and Investment Advisor of the Department of International Trade, and Lijuan Zhang from China National Innovation Institute of Additive Manufacturing and Xian Jiaotong University congratulated Prof Hong Dong - Director of the Centre and Royal Academy of Engineering / TWI Research Chair - on this achievement.Professor Dong said: "This is a tremendous coup for the University bringing our world-renowned expertise to bear on industrial processes for metal processing and production. The Research Centre will be supported by NISCO at the level of pound sterling2.2 million over an initial period of 5 years. The University of Leicester will co invest through non-financial contributions."The Centre, in collaboration with TWI Ltd and the Materials Processing Institute, will exploit the UK's research strengths in metallic materials, manufacturing and informatics, and will deliver funded, high quality, high impact collaborative research. We aim to achieve world leading status in the area of metallic materials and advanced manufacturing by developing patents and translating technologies for adoption by NISCO. We will create an excellent research environment and become a world leader in our field."Leicester's City Mayor Sir Peter Soulsby said: "This is excellent news and a significant achievement for the University of Leicester. It provides a great opportunity to link industry and academia - utilising the University's research strengths. We have worked closely with the university and NISCO in supporting the partnership and I am delighted it's happening in Leicester."Professor Jonathon Chambers, Head of Engineering, Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, said that the Centre was a "great fit" with Leicester's research capabilities as well as meeting the aims of Leicester City Council's China inward investment strategy.He said: "May I congratulate Professor Dong and his team for such a successful opening ceremony for our new NISCO UK Research Centre. This is a unique bridge between China and the UK, and I'm excited to see how it grows in our Department."The collaborative activity of the Centre, jointly funded by Innovate UK and the Chinese Government, has also already secured funding of pound sterling500K to develop innovative "Super slab" technology to produce extra thick casting steel slabs for use in harsh environments, with applications for wind turbines and off-shore structures.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6387893 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: July 28, 2018End of Document

Beijing holds the Panda Cultural Week to promote the importance of this animalCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 23, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 389 wordsBody Beijing opened the first edition of the International Giant Panda Culture Week , which aims to promote the global influence of this animal, cultural symbol of China, and preserve vulnerable animal species.  The opening of the International Giant Panda Culture Week commemorates half a century of China's efforts in the conservation of the giant panda to prevent its extinction.  The event was attended by numerous personalities among ambassadors, diplomats and government leaders of Sichuan Province (where a good part of the pandas live in freedom).  As part of these events, the Museum of the Peking Millennium Monument will exhibit an exhibition about Sichuan that, through photographs, films, virtual reality games and posters, will show the evolution of the care of this animal during all these years.  In addition, there will be an interactive map showing the different places where the panda has been sent as a symbol of international exchange and cooperation.  For decades, the Chinese government has sent giant pandas, considered by the Chinese as a national treasure, to zoos in other countries , and since then the breeding and research of the animal has been carried out in more than 15 nations, including Spain or Mexico.  The gifts of giant pandas to foreign zoos marked some of the first cultural exchanges between China and the Western world in the 1970s, known as "panda diplomacy".  The director of the State Forestry Administration of China, Yang Chao, said at the opening that "to preserve the panda and its natural habitat is to reap all the social and economic benefits associated with it."  The event, organized jointly by the aforementioned administration, the China Association of Friendship with Foreign Countries and the provincial governments of Sichuan, Gansu and Shaanxi, hopes as explained Yang extend "a philosophy of peace, development and cooperation."  China is currently building a National Park of the Giant Panda in order to protect 70% of its habitat and 86% of the wild population thanks to the union and extension of the reserves of the three provinces mentioned. The panda bears, originating in the south and center of China, are considered national heritage in the country and are in the first degree of protection of species at risk of extinction, since there are less than 3,000 in the wild. Load-Date: August 23, 2018End of Document

State-Sanctioned Church in Shandong Province DemolishedTargeted News ServiceJuly 18, 2018 Wednesday 7:47 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 389 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyInternational Christian Concern issued the following news release:International Christian Concern (ICC) has learned that on July 17, more than 70 police officers and workers forcibly demolished Liangwang Catholic Church in China's Shandong province. Liangwang Catholic Church is a state-sanctioned church and had been registered since 2006.Three church caretakers, Gao Rongli, Zhang Siling and Li Xiangmei, who were inside the church, had their cellphones confiscated and destroyed, before they were driven out of the building. The church was then razed in 15 minutes by bulldozers and pickaxes.According to Asia News, local authorities have adopted a new urban plan that includes the development of a new neighborhood with a train station. The removal of the church was included in the plan, even though the church did not interfere during the process.The congregation and the local religious affairs office were in communication with the authorities to find a place to relocate the church when, without warning or proper documentation, authorities came to destroy the church, the altars, benches, chairs, and furnishings inside.Chinese Christian Fellowship of Righteousness, a US-based group that highlights Christian persecution in China, shared several photos of the scene on their Facebook page.It is not uncommon for the Chinese government to demolish churches for urban zoning or commercial purposes. A Catholic church near Xi'an in Shaanxi province was forcibly demolished last December, despite having all of the necessary permits for the legal use of the land. Given that the building was close to one of the exits on the Xi'an-Hanzhong highway, the government likely intended to diminish the Christian presence or reuse the land for other purposes.Gina Goh, ICC's Regional Manager, said, "The disproportionate manpower used to demolish this church goes to show that China is fearful of Christians. The government knew that the demolition in the name of urban zoning would be met with resistance, so it ensured success by taking extreme measures. Despite their best efforts to intimidate the Church with actions like this, the government cannot destroy the faith and resilience of Chinese Christians."Contact: Olivia Miller, communications coordinator, press@persecution.orgCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6378437 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: July 21, 2018End of Document

2 Stock Market Sectors to Buy in a Trade WarUSNEWS.comJuly 31, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 U.S. News & World Report All Rights ReservedSection: INVESTING; The Smarter Investor; Vol.; No.Length: 1048 wordsByline: Leslie ThompsonHighlight: Growing trade tensions are grabbing the attention of investors.BodyOver the past few weeks, investor fears of rising interest rates and inflationary pressures have taken a back seat to the escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China. While any shift in public policy typically roils the stock market, all nations involved understand that an actual trade war can easily result in higher input prices for consumers, slower economic growth and, ultimately, political backlash at the voting booth. So it is no coincidence that China is targeting products such as soybeans (produced in the red states of Iowa and Indiana), whiskey (produced in Kentucky) and orange juice (produced in the swing state of Florida). Likewise, President Donald Trump is targeting jobs-heavy industries such as auto parts, steel and industrial equipment, which the Chinese government needs to keep millions of people employed. [See: 7 Small-Cap ETFs to Help You Win a Trade War.]The ideal system of trade theoretically involves a transactional process where each country exports products that they naturally produce, for example: the U.S. in agriculture, technology and natural gas; Europe in industrial goods; or Australia in steel and aluminum. It is common practice, however, for businesses around the world to contribute to the campaigns of elected officials in order to effectuate trade barriers and, therefore, lessen competition for their domestically produced goods. In the end, consumers receive less choice and higher prices. If these distortions become extreme, voter backlash could become inevitable, so politicians are likely to walk a very fine line behind the scenes. As trade discussions continue to unfold, two U.S. sectors will likely be net-beneficiaries of these talks: technology and energy. Look to an ETF for technology stocks. According to Bloomberg, 77 percent of the global technology sector market cap consists of U.S. companies, followed by Japan at 4 percent, South Korea at 3.8 percent and China at 3.5 percent. The overwhelming value is created by U.S. technology companies, so it is no wonder that China has not imposed tariffs on our technology goods. Countries such as China often demand the transfer of intellectual property before foreign companies can tap into their vast consumer base, especially for leading-edge technologies such as 5G, semiconductors and productivity software. This distortion results in less income for U.S. companies from these foreign countries and, ultimately, a wider trade deficit. If Chinese consumers had full access to Alphabet's (ticker: GOOG,            GOOGL) Google search engine, for example, advertisers would benefit from lower ad rates and consumers would benefit from less biased search results. It is notable that Google generates $52 billion in revenue from the U.S. and $36 billion from Europe, but only $16 billion from Asia, even though half of the world lives in Asia. The Chinese search market is estimated at $73 billion a year, so a 10 percent swing in market share to Google could meaningfully impact the $600 billion U.S. trade deficit. According to State Street, the Technology Select SPDR ETF (            XLK) is trading at a 2018 price-earnings ratio of 18.5 and the three- to five-year EPS growth is projected at 13.5 percent per year. Any incremental access for U.S. tech companies to China will likely accelerate this projected growth rate. [See: 9 Ways to Invest in Red-Hot Tech Stocks.]The U.S. is a big player in natural gas production.In the global energy landscape, the U.S. is a surprisingly significant player. According to the BP 2017 Statistical Review of World Energy, the U.S. accounted for 22 percent of global natural gas consumption in 2016, versus 6 percent for China. However, the U.S. accounted for 9.5 percent of global coal consumption versus 51 percent for China that same year, so it is clear why China has such widespread air pollution. In terms of natural gas production, the U.S. produced 22 percent of the world's supply, and China produced 4 percent, or only 67 percent of its consumption, with the balance imported. China's natural gas demand has grown at 10 percent per year, so it will increasingly need to import more to fulfill its needs. Also notable is how dependent Europe and Asia are on the Middle East and Russia for their natural gas needs. U.S. exports of natural gas could help reduce trade imbalances and diversify the supplier base for these countries, especially considering the growing coordination of energy production between OPEC and Russia. The U.S. is especially dominant in biofuels, a renewable resource which could move the needle for Asia's growing air pollution problem. The U.S. produces 44 percent of the world's biofuels compared to China's 25 percent. This is another area where China could easily help itself and the American farmer through increased reliance on biofuels. While China has imposed a tariff on U.S. soybeans, the reality is that few countries have the spare capacity to meet their own internal energy needs and China's growing demand.

Alibaba founder Jack Ma to step down in 2019, names company CEO as successorMetro VarthaSeptember 10, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 Vartha News Network Pvt Ltd All Rights ReservedLength: 867 wordsDateline: Beijing BodyBeijing, Sept. 10 -- Jack Ma, one of China's richest men, announced on Monday he would step down as Alibaba's executive chairman next year as he unveiled an unprecedented succession plan on his 54th birthday, naming the e-commerce giant's CEO as his successor.Ma will remain Alibaba's executive chairman during the year-long period to ensure a "smooth and successful" transition, and stay on as an Alibaba director until a shareholder' meeting in 2020, Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post, which is owned by Alibaba, reported.Ma will hand over the keys of his company to 46-year-old Daniel Zhang in an unprecedented succession plan that will slowly take the focus off one of China's most recognisable corporate names over the next 12 months, the Post report said.Zhang will be promoted to the executive chairman on September 10, 2019, while Ma remains a director on Alibaba's board and a permanent member of the Alibaba Partnership, according to a letter written by Ma to all staff including to the Post."This transition demonstrates that Alibaba has stepped into the next level of corporate governance from a company that relies on individuals, to one built on systems of organisational excellence and a culture of consistent talent development," Ma said in his letter.The succession plan being announced on his birthday on Monday came after confusing reports about Ma's retirement.The New York Times, which interviewed him, reported on Saturday that Ma planned to use his 54h birthday to announce his retirement to devote his time to philanthropy focused on education.The report of his retirement came as a surprise, especially in the Chinese government circles as the NYT report said Ma was relinquishing as China's business environment had soured, with the government and state-owned enterprises increasingly playing more interventionist roles with companies.The NYT report was quickly denied by Alibaba whose spokesman told the Post on Saturday that Ma remains the company's executive chairman and will provide transition plans over a significant period of time."The Times story was taken out of context and factually wrong," the daily quoted the spokesman as saying.Ma, who grew from an English teacher to China's top billionaires making Alibaba into USD 420 billion company, always took care to not ruffle feathers of the ruling Communist Party of China.He took care not to project himself bigger than the CPC leadership though he has emerged as modern China's most revered corporate icon."Alibaba was never about Jack Ma, but Jack Ma will forever belong to Alibaba," Ma said in the letter.The plan, announced on Ma's 54th birthday, took 10 years to put together. It owed its inception to Alibaba's formative years, long before the online marketplace forayed into cloud computing, cashless payments, artificial intelligence and Hollywood movies, the Post report said."This is merely the beginning of a succession strategy of creating a step ladder to groom the next generation of managers," Joseph P H Fan, co-director of the Institute of Economics and Finance at the Chinese University of Hong Kong said."Jack Ma's halo is too bright, and outshines whoever's under him, so he needs to fade out. But for a company of Alibaba's size, it's a process that will take 10 years to complete," he said.Zhang was known to Alibaba employees as "Xiaoyaozi" (free and unfettered one), the name of a character from a Louis Cha wuxia novel, the Post report said.Since Zhang, known as Zhang Yong in mainland China, was named chief executive in May 2015, "Alibaba has seen consistent and sustainable growth for 13 consecutive quarters."His analytical mind is unparalleled, he holds dear "our mission and vision, he embraces responsibility with passion, and he has the guts to innovate and test creative business models," Ma said."I've worked closely with Daniel since 2007 when he first joined us as chief financial officer of Taobao," said Joseph Tsai, Alibaba's executive vice-chairman who was the company's finance chief until 2013."On intellect and energy, I can barely keep up with him. But it's his thoughtfulness and humility that is most impressive as a leader," he said.Zhang had previously served as Taobao's chief financial officer, president of Tmall.com and as Alibaba's chief operating officer before succeeding Jonathan Lu as chief executive.The billionaire started Alibaba.com in 1999 as a business-to-business marketplace with 17 co-founders in his Hangzhou apartment turning the company into a global e-commerce giant with burgeoning cloud computing and package delivery businesses.Alibaba's sprawling businesses also include brick-and-mortar stores, online video, movies and other enterprises, and it has sought to expand in promising new markets like Southeast Asia and India.It has since moved into cloud computing, digital payments, health care, Hollywood movies and backing China's startups. Its share price has more than doubled since its record 2014 initial public offering.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from MetroVaartha English.

Intimidation of Muslim Poet Effort to Silence Writers' Engagement on XinjiangTargeted News ServiceAugust 24, 2018 Friday 8:54 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 505 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK BodyPEN America issued the following news release:Police action against Muslim poet Cui Haoxin--better known by his pen name An Ran--is a clear attempt to silence the writer from being vocal on the issue of mass incarceration of Muslims and others in political "re-education camps," PEN America said today.An Ran is a poet and writer from the majority-Muslim Hui ethnic group whose work includes the 2017 collection Black Gobi. On August 16, An Ran revealed in a blog post that police had raided his home that day and had warned him not to use his Twitter or Facebook accounts. In recent days, An Ran has used Twitter to comment on and re-tweet stories about the forced detention of Uyghur Muslims and other ethnicities in China's western Xinjiang region. Ran reported that the policemen who interrogated him asked him specifically about his tweets, saying that stories of "events in Xinjiang had been concocted by the foreign media to smear China." In April 2018, An Ran was told to attend a weeklong re-education course in eastern China and was briefly detained, an incident which An Ran has said was related to his poetry and other writings that reference XinjiangWriting about his interaction with the police, An Ran wrote: ""The Chinese authorities are unwilling to hear the different views and confuse dissent with disloyalty . . . The government doesn't resolve the question but they resolve the questioner. A lot of Chinese Muslims [have been] resolved.""This is a clear cut example of the Chinese government seeking to silence a critical voice through intimidation," said Summer Lopez, Senior Director of Free Expression Programs at PEN America. "An Ran, a poet, is speaking out on one of the most important human rights issues of our day. Instead of attempting to shut him down, authorities should be listening. As a group dedicated to safeguarding and cherishing freedom of expression everywhere, PEN America recognizes that China's policy of forced "re-education" in Xinjiang is a human rights disaster, one with dire implications for the right to free expression. We call upon the government to immediately end and reverse these catastrophic and abusive policies."A wide array of credible reports from journalists and human rights organizations have revealed a broad system of state surveillance and forced detention of inhabitants in large "re-education camps" in Xinjiang, where they are subject to a mandatory "patriotic" regimen. Such regimens are reportedly oriented around coercively discouraging detainees from expressing their ethnic and religious identity, including reported incidents where Muslim detainees were forced to eat pork, as well as other abuses. While reported numbers vary, the number of detainees is widely believed to be in the hundreds of thousands. Detainees include a large number of Uyghurs, a Turkic majority-Muslim ethnic group, as well as other ethnic minorities.Contact: Anoosh Gasparian, external relations manager, agasparian@pen.orgCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6420405 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: August 25, 2018End of Document

'THEY NEVER KNOW WHEN SOMEONE'S GOING TO STAND UP AND SPEAK OUT'States News ServiceAugust 9, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 798 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:The Twitter account MeTooChina reported on Thursday that the #MeToo sexual harassment and sexual assault reporting campaign is gaining traction among China's army of migrant factory workers. It said workers at Foxconn, which assembles iPhones, had recently sent open letters to management demanding that it set up an anti-sexual harassment mechanism in partnership with female workers. It also noted a report that TooTopia, a Guangdong-based NGO that had been following the #MeTooChina campaign among female factory workers, had its account on the social media platform WeChat suspended after tweeting about the letters. Xiong Jing, social media editor of the Feminist Voices website, which was itself targeted by state censors earlier this year, said the movement continues to gather pace in China in spite of attempts by the ruling Chinese Communist Party to suppress it:The complaints people are making reflect an universal problem, which is sexual harassment. The fact that so many people are making criminal complaints, and telling their stories, shows that this really is a very serious and widespread problem in China, and one that needs a resolution.Telling one's story is only the first step, and I think it's definitely very important to do that openly and freely. So I don't think it's going to resolve this issue, for these stories to be shut down and for public opinion to be censored in that way.The #MeToo movement in China has given people hope, and it just keeps coming, wave upon wave. It has never really stopped. Otherwise we wouldn't have so many people speaking out about their own stories. And those who are willing to tell their stories are only a small proportion of cases.Students at higher education institutions have come under huge pressure from the authorities since the anti-sexual harassment campaign began in academia at the beginning of this year. This has included college officials and campus police talking to their parents, and having their posts deleted. The police probably think they will be able to find the instigators behind the scenes of this movement, but this movement is very decentralized. There are no "black hands" behind the scenes. Everyone is acting on their own initiative.This is a case of a raising of collective awareness, including everyone's anger. So many of these incidents happened many years ago, but the conditions weren't right for them to be spoken about. So we can see how important [external] conditions are for the victims. And now the victims have a lot more issues to deal with that aren't just about the original abuse; when they do tell the truth, sometimes they aren't believed.One of the characteristics of the #MeToo movement is its justice. Sexual harassment is against the law, so it's unreasonable to blame the victims of sexual harassment and abuse for speaking out, and the Chinese government wouldn't behave in an obviously politically incorrect way. And yet posts using the #MeToo hastag are being deleted on [social media platform] Weibo. I also heard there had been a directive to the media telling them not to report on it. But it's the fundamental legality of the #MeToo movement that lends it a little space to operate.The #MeToo movement in China has been targeted for persecution, with students who wrote and signed open letters threatened by the authorities. They basically paid all of the people who signed those letters a visit, and threatened their families. That's why the movement has become much more low-key on university campuses now.Some people have criticize the #MeToo movement, asking why the victims didn't report the incidents to the police, through legal channels. But what does reporting it to the police achieve? The five feminists [Wu Rongrong, Li Tingting, Wei Tingting, Wang Man, and Zheng Churan] were detained two years ago when they ran an anti-sexual harassment and domestic violence campaign. Things haven't improved since then. Our bank account has been frozen [at Feminist Voices]. I don't think the government has thought through its methods in dealing with such a huge issue as the #MeToo movement, which wasn't initiated by a single person. They never know when someone's going to stand up and speak out.That's why I think the #MeToo movement will continue for as long as there are perpetrators and victims willing to stand up. This isn't the same as the feminist five, who were the deliberate instigators of a campaign. In the #MeToo campaign, everyone is an instigator. I don't think the government will be able to detain everyone, just to stop them from getting involved.Reported by Han Qing for RFA's Mandarin Service, and by Lau Siu-fung for the Cantonese Service.

Turkish Lira Hits New Low; Economy under Trump; National Anthem Protest; Tech Versus Military; 4,000 Google Employees Protested Company Partnering with Pentagon; Man Wearing A Make America Great Again Told he Couldn't Vote in Missouri; Parents Hiring Fortnite Coaches Tutors to Help Their Kids ImproveMORNINGS WITH MARIA MORNINGS WITH MARIA 7:00 AM ESTAugust 10, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; FinancialLength: 7963 wordsByline: Maria Bartiromo, Dagen McDowell, Cheryl Casone, Jared MaxGuests: Heather Higgins; Kevin Kelly, Jon Hilsenrath, Caesar Sainz, Nick Mennen, Trae StephensBodyMARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: Welcome back. Good Friday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Friday, August 10th.Your top stories right now just before at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.Turkey's economy is on the brink. The Turkish lira sliding to A record low this morning amid growing concerns about the country's financial system. Turkish President Erdogan reportedly saying the country will not lose an economic war -- looks like it's happening though. The lira is sliding and it is rippling through global markets.The worries, as you can see, impacting markets across the world -- futures indicating a lower opening for the broader averages here in the U.S. Dow Industrials down a hundred points right now, down a third of a percent, the Nasdaq down 36. This is off of the lows of the morning, by the way, in the U.S.And it was a mixed story yesterday on Wall Street. The Dow and the S&P 500 closing lower on the day as you can see there, the Dow giving up 74 points. The Nasdaq posted its eighth day of gains in a row, that is the longest winning streak of the year even though it just squeaked out a gain of just 3 points.In Europe this morning, losses across the board. DAX index in Germany, the worst performer, down almost 200 points, 1.5 percent lower.In Asia overnight markets were mostly lower at the close with the exception of China although it was really flat. The worst performer -- Japan, down one and a third percent.Protesting the national anthem once again -- the NFL preseason gets underway with players taking a knee before taking the field. The backlash this morning coming up.A new constellation on the Hollywood Walk of Fame -- dozens of stars appear with the President's name on them. How they got there and why they are there, later this hour coming up.Ready, aim and hire, Fortnite becomes so popular that parents are hiring coaches for their kids. We'll tell you about it.Plus Disney princesses get a new look, they're changing out of their evening wear and into something more casual. The pictures going viral this morning -- we have it for you.All those stories coming up this Friday morning. And joining me to break it all down -- Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Benchmark managing partner Kevin Kelly and Independent Women's Voice CEO Heather Higgins. Great to see you this morning.HEATHER HIGGINS, CEO, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE: Nice to be here.BARTIROMO: good morning.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: Fortnite coaches --BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: -- because you're embarrassed for your kids if they're not playing the game well.HIGGINS: Why not have coaches for, I don't know, learning something about history or math? But, you know, we'll do Fortnite instead.MCDOWELL: How about actually going outside and building a fort or playing in a creek, things that build physical skill.BARTIROMO: Yes. It's interesting how popular it's become though.MCDOWELL: Yes.(CROSSTALK)KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK: -- it's a huge, huge business and what's crazy about it is it's led to the whole streaming revolution, right. I mean YouTube has done exceptionally well because of this. Amazon's Twitch has done exceptionally well because of this. But you brought up the point, it's a shooting game.HIGGINS: Yes.MCDOWELL: Oh, my gosh. How dare you let your child play a game with guns in it? I'm being sarcastic.HIGGINS: What's more important is that it's a game where apparently you were saying earlier that you need to keep paying up for all these add-ons that you need to have to be a contributing member of the team.And particularly if you get the parents sucked in, they're more willing to, once they get caught up, pay that little incremental amount for the stuff and then it gets hard to say no to the kids they can't have the equipment that the parents have. It's a great business model.BARTIROMO: Just keep buying stuff and buying stuff.HIGGINS: It's a little bit like tobacco, you know. You're hooked.BARTIROMO: We've got more coming up on that. But first to our top story and this is serious business. You have turmoil in Turkey.Reuters is reporting that moments ago the Turkish President Erdogan says that the country will not lose an economic war. But Turkey's lira is tumbling to a record low against the U.S. dollar over the threat of U.S. financial sanctions. Turkey's turbulent economy now sparking fears of a global economic shakeup.Joining us right now to talk more about that and the U.S. economy -- Jon Hilsenrath, the "Wall Street Journal's" global economics editor. Jon -- good to see you this morning.JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, "WALL STREET JOURNAL": Hey, Maria -- great to be here.BARTIROMO: What are your thoughts in terms of this getting bigger and bigger and impacting other emerging markets and perhaps the U.S. as well? What's your take on this?HILSENRATH: Well, it is what always happens when we see a currency going into a tail spin in a place like Turkey. The first question you ask is who else is at risk? You know, what kind of contagion might we see from this?You know, you have to look at countries like South Africa, Argentina, Brazil have wobbled a little bit. And then the really interesting one is Russia. Its currency is off, you know.In the cases of Russia and Turkey we're talking about the U.S. instead of being a country that kind of manages and stabilizes things is prodding these countries with sanctions in the case of Turkey and Russia.KELLY: Yes. Jon -- one of the interesting aspects of this is that President Erdogan took over his central bank. He wasn't pleased with the job they were doing. So now he's in charge of the economy. And that's what really started leading to the decline of the lira.And then we're starting to see that their yields now on their 10-year treasury are above 20 percent. What the end game here? How does this end?All of a sudden we're talking about contagion. But I don't see that as contagion, right --HILSENRATH: Yes.KELLY: -- given that it seems to be isolated. So where do we go from here?HILSENRATH: Well, you know, so in the case of Turkey, it has all of the classic telltale signs of a mismanaged economy. Its banking system is very unstable. It's very exposed to foreign lending. There's a lot of external debt. It's got large current account trade deficits that it has trouble financing.You know, in cases like this in the past we've seen the IMF come in and stabilize an economy but you have to wonder if there's a role for the IMF here. You have to wonder if there's a role for the U.S. in stabilizing Turkey.You know, the U.S. is actually on the other side of this. We've sanctioned Turkey over its detention of an American pastor, Brunson. And we've also imposed tariffs on their steel exports.So you know, as far as the end game, it's hard to say what that end game is when the IMF isn't really -- you know, might not be a player here.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: And Erdogan, Jon -- does not have the power that a Vladimir Putin does. Very often when -- and I'm not making any predictions -- but when Russia is in dire financial straits, you will see Putin become overtly hostile, invade another country to try and drive the price of oil up.HILSENRATH: Yes.MCDOWELL: And Erdogan can brag about we're not going to lose an economic war but Turkey does not have the financial heft on the global stage in terms of the size of the economy or our trading power as the United States.HILSENRATH: Right.HIGGINS: Can I just be cynical for a minute? I mean in the sense that we're all apoplectic here about the currency is being adversely affected but what is the point of sanctions if it's not to have an impact?And if the U.S. wants to have a policy which is saying to Putin you are in trouble for the way you have behaved, misusing chemical agents, right, on people; if they want to say to Turkey there is a cost for what you have done, then you want in a sense their economies to feel it because that's the only way you get the changes that you are desiring.So it seems a little bit odd that we are having flurries over this. The whole point is for it to have an adverse effect on these economies that are specifics to these economies.BARTIROMO: But I think it's the impact on the global economy is what we're talking about.HIGGINS: The economies that are going to feel it are the European ones that have the Turkish debt. They have their -- they did well last year but now that looks anomalous. They've got heavy-handed large governments to support and they have these aging populations so they don't have the growth. So this exposure for them is much more dire than it is for us.BARTIROMO: The question becomes, is this going to be systemic? And is it going to impact the U.S. and other economies across the world -- Jon?HILSENRATH: Well, so two points. One is, you know, I would say that's -- your view isn't at all a cynical view. I think it's exactly what the Trump administration's view is in terms of --BARTIROMO: Absolutely.HILSENRATH: -- how it deals with international affairs, you know. The Trump administration has a policy of using American economic muscle to have its way in situations like this. So I think that's certainly the case.Will it impact the U.S.? You know, we're seeing the dollar strengthen so, you know, when the Turkish lira falls, when the Russian ruble falls, when people get worried about global contagions, they move into U.S. dollar assets.And that does have impacts on the economy. It makes our exports more expensive. It makes imports less expensive so its actually ironically widens trade deficits which the President has said is a sign of American weakness, a stronger dollar makes those trade deficits bigger and that's what we're seeing happen right now.BARTIROMO: But it's also happening at a time that the economy in the U.S. is strengthening.Let's talk about the "Journal's" latest economic survey. Number two story in the "Journal", the Journal's forecast pointing to 3 percent growth this year.HILSENRATH: Right.BARTIROMO: That's up from 2.4 percent last year. Economists are also saying that the unemployment rate will fall to 3.6 percent by June. That would be the lowest level in nearly 50 years.HILSENRATH: Right.BARTIROMO: Pretty incredible stuff here, Jon. But I was reading, I mean while the economists are boosting their near term projections, they're also thinking that things slow down quite a bit in the next couple years. Tell us about that.HILSENRATH: Right. So, you know, economists are reacting to what they're seeing on the ground. I mean it's clear, the economy had a great second quarter growth of more than 4 percent. They're responding to that.You know, it does look like the tax cuts have boosted consumer spending, sustained pretty strong business investment. It does look like we are having one of the best years we've had in this expansion and beyond in 2018 and they're responding to that.The big question is whether that can be sustained. And that's where there's a difference of opinion here. So the private economists that we talked to have lowered their forecast out to 2020 to 1.8 percent growth. So we go from 3 percent to 2.4 percent in 2019 and then 1.8 percent in 2020.So what they're saying is this burst that we're having right now won't be sustained. What the Trump administration says is that it can be sustained, that tax cuts and deregulation is going to improve worker productivity. It's going to draw more people into the labor force and we're going to have a sustained period of very strong growth.These economists are raising questions about that. They're saying they don't think so. They point to three issues that could knock the economy off.BARTIROMO: Yes.HILSENRATH: One is the fiscal stimulus that we have, it kind of peters out after a couple of years. So the biggest impetus we get from that stimulus is right now. What happens in 2020 when that wanes?Another worry is trade wars which we have been talking about a lot.And the third is that the fed has been raising short-term interest rates, 3 percent by 2019, does that slow the economy as well?BARTIROMO: You know, I asked Steven Mnuchin about this. I've asked so many people in the administration about this because we've been saying just this, Jon.And it happened after Robert Kaplan joined me, the president of the Texas Federal Reserve -- the Dallas Federal Reserve.HILSENRATH: Right.BARTIROMO: And he said exactly those numbers. He said yes, we're going to see 3 percent in 2018. But by the end of '19 into '20 we're going to see growth drop all the way down to 1.8 percent.And this was from Robert Kaplan who was on our show and said that. And when I asked Steven Mnuchin this, the treasury Secretary, he said "I don't see it".HILSENRATH: Right. Exactly. So there's a difference of opinion between the fed and the White House, and between Wall Street and the White House. And there's a lot at stake in this.You know, we have -- the White House acknowledges that we're going to have trillion dollar deficits for a couple of years. But they say those deficits are going to disappear over time because we're going to have sustained strong growth.If we get the sustained strong growth, they're right, the fed is wrong and we have a much better budget situation. If the White House is wrong on this, then we have a big budget problem looking out, you know.And this also has a big impact on well-being, you know. If we get the 3 percent growth that we're talking about, the economy doubles in size over 24 years. If it takes -- if we have the 1.8 percent growth that the fed is talking about, it takes more like 36 years to get that kind of economic growth doubling of size. So there's a lot at stake here.The forecasters have been wrong before. So you know, we can't say that the Fed -- because it says that, that it's right.BARTIROMO: Right.HILSENRATH: You know, we're going to have -- someone is right and someone is wrong and we're going to have to wait a couple of years to figure out who it is.MCDOWELL: But Jon -- it's unthinkable -- it would be stupid for anybody in the administration to talk down the economy. Again, there's something to be said for, hey, reminding people, you know, that's the job of the left wing media is to talk down anything good that's happening in this country in terms of people's finances.And a rising tide lifting everybody's boat with the unemployment rate of Latinos falling in the most recent -- of women falling in the last month --(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: People with just high school educations falling in the last month. It is their job to remind people, hey, 90 percent of you out there working are seeing bigger paychecks this year than you did because of the tax reform.BARTIROMO: They better do that going into the midterms -- Dagen.MCDOWELL: Right.BARTIROMO: Because they're not getting that from the mainstream media.HIGGINS: All of the concerns that Jon raised are legitimate. But I think it's fair to say that economists through this administration have consistently been lagging indicators.BARTIROMO: Yes.HIGGINS: They don't see it until it's already biting them in the butt and they inch up but they don't ever catch up. This is a climb a wall of worry, rising market -- I would be much more concerned if the consensus were for a perpetual rosy future. That's when I would start to be very nervous.BARTIROMO: All right. We'll leave it there. Jon -- great to see you, thanks so much.HILSENRATH: All right. Thank you.BARTIROMO: Have a good weekend. Jon Hilsenrath -- "Wall Street Journal".Coming up, outrage over taking a knee again, the new round of protests from the NFL players during the national anthem.Then talk about star power, details on the artist who created multiple new stars for President Trump in Hollywood, next.BARTIROMO: Futures indicating a lower opening at the start of trading this morning. Investor concerns over political turmoil in Turkey rippling through global markets this morning. The major indices lower across the board with the Dow Industrials down half a percent, expected to be down better than 100 at the open.Switching gears, President Trump sounding off against the violence in Chicago. It was a terrible weekend in Chicago last weekend.Cheryl Casone with a look -- Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: It really was -- Maria.And President Trump blamed political leaders in the city for the weekend violence that left 12 people dead. The President didn't name Mayor Rahm Emanuel in particular but he spoke broadly about the situation.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We must strengthen community bonds with law enforcement including cities like Chicago that have been an absolute and total disaster. They had 63 incidents last weekend and 12 deaths. There's no reason in a million years that something like that should be happening in Chicago.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Well, Trump made those comments during a meeting on prison reform. Ok. It's not all bad news in Chicago. Look at this.Locals and visitors were treated to this sight in the Chicago River yesterday -- 60,000 yellow rubber duckies bobbing into the river for the annual ducky derby -- all to benefit the Special Olympics. You adopt a duck for $5. And then you win a prize if your duck comes in first. $400,000 was raised for Special Olympics last year. This is one of the most popular things that happens in Chicago.All right. Now to Chipotle -- they are turning to bacon as they try to find new ways to get the customers back in the doors. The company going to test smoked applewood bacon in eight of its restaurants in Orange County, California next month. They also plan to test nachos in stores in Denver and Minneapolis -- that will be in October.These new offerings follow a series of health scares at Chipotle over the past few years including a serious outbreak of e. Coli back in 2015.Shares of Chipotle are actually up 68 percent this year. And I couldn't help but think about the fact, guacamole with bacon, I don't know, that popped in my head just now. No.BARTIROMO: Not good.KELLY: I think it would be delicious.CASONE: How about Kevin?KELLY: Yes, absolutely. Bacon with anything -- isn't that the golden rule, I mean, bacon wrapped around a filet mignon. Bacon in guacamole's good. This goes back to a great hire for Chipotle. The stock is up like 50 percent so far this year because they actually brought over one of the leaders from Taco Bell who was able to get viral sensations around it, revamp their menu.BARTIROMO: And he's bringing the bacon with him.KELLY: Yes, he is. Listen, yes. That's an important thing you've got to do.BARTIROMO: There you go.MCDOWELL: If you want to be on trend, vegan. Just a little advice for the Chipotle and don't make people sick.HIGGINS: I don't know -- I'm a carb-philia so we've got the two ends here.BARTIROMO: Coming up, a new season, a new round of protests. The outrage this morning over more football players kneeling during the national anthem -- here we go again.Then, ready, aim, hire -- we will tell you why parents are paying for video game coaches, oh, yes, thanks to the popularity of Fortnite. The details later this hour.Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.So now this -- NFL players protesting during the national anthem again. Jared Max now with the story. Jared -- this is incredible.JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS: Welcome back to the NFL. While 99 percent of NFL players who took part in a dozen preseason games last night did honor the American flag, stand for the national anthem, a few did not.Three players on the Miami Dolphins protested. Robert Quinn held up a fist. Kenny Stills, who's no rookie to kneeling during the anthem, did so again and he was thankful to have a teammate Albert Wilson by his side.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KENNY STILLS, NFL PLAYER: Being a part of this protest hasn't been easy. You know, I thought I was going to be by myself out there and today I had an angel with me.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Will this continue into the regular season?STILLS: I don't see why not.MAX: former quarterback Colin Kaepernick, whose anthem protests began this movement in 2016, tweeted quote, "My brother K Stills continue this protest of systemic oppression by taking a knee." He mentions others who protested and also "stay strong, brothers".Now the Eagles Malcolm Jenkins also protested last night. Four players on the Jacksonville Jaguars not on the field during the anthem. One player on the Ravens stood with his back to the field. Three players on the Seahawks ran off the field just before the anthem.The 100th PGA championship teed off yesterday in St. Louis -- the final major tournament this year. One player who is still seeking his first major win, Ricky Fowler, in good position right now. Fowler bogied only one hole yesterday. Ricky shot a 65. He's never shot a better round at a major this year. He's only one shot back. He birdied his final two holes. While American Gary Woodland who made five birdies on the back nine, finished at 6 under and he is our leader, Gary Woodland by one.Tiger Woods' name not near the top. Tiger tied for 48th, six strokes behind. He was three over after two holes and finished even par.Seems everybody wants to get a little piece of the legalized sports betting that's beginning to sweep the nation. It's not only sports leagues who want integrity fees. Buffalo Wild Wings wants a bite of this financial drum stick. They say at the largest sports bar in America, we believe buffalo wild wings is uniquely positioned to leverage sports gaming to leverage the experience for our guests.The United States Supreme Court voted last May to repeal the 1992 law that banned sports betting in all but four states in the country. So everybody is getting in on the sports gambling -- Maria.BARTIROMO: Well, we knew that would happen. Your thoughts, Kevin?KELLY: Yes. I think this is actually a pretty fascinating aspect because it actually kind of plays into what we talked about on Wednesday with Disney and how their ESPN plus over-the-top is probably going to start gaining traction because of the sports betting. We've seen fan duel. We've seen all these other sort of "fantasy daily sports" are really gambling but it's in so many different veins. So I think this that's been happening.MCDOWELL: But in so many instances when people have the option of gambling or buying something of a sin, whether it's cigarettes or soda, they opt for the lottery versus buying a pack of cigarettes.So I wonder, you're basically telling the customers at buffalo wild wings, hey, start gambling in our restaurants, you're going to drinking less beer, eating fewer wings potentially. I don't know --MAX: Well, they'll be staying around a lot more. I think they'll probably be drinking more beer.KELLY: I agree.I mean gambling is an addiction too.MAX: Very much so.KELLY: So that's the issue. .HILSENRATH: You're still, you know when you go to the casino tables, if you're there to win money, not throw it all away, don't drink. But I think if you're going to Buffalo Wild Wings or something like this and you're watching the games, yes, $25 on this next one, 50 here, let's do another one.KELLY: Well, they want to lower your inhibition. But can I just point out that want you to -- Gamble in a casino, you drink for free. That's the whole catch. Don't drink if you want to win.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Seriously ever gotten smashed at the table? --MCDOWELL: When you p gamble in a casino, you drink for free.BARTIROMO: Marta.Jared -- thank you.MAX: Happy Friday.BARTIROMO: Jared Max.

We will share the candid image in just a moment. Stay with us for that.But first, our top story this half an hour, Silicon Valley versus the military. A new report says that technology insiders are making a big mistake by ostracizing the U.S. military.Joining us to discuss it is the co-author of that article, Anduril Industries chairman, Trae Stephens. Trae, it's great to have you on the program this morning. Thanks so much.TRAE STEPHENS, CHAIRMAN, ANDURIL INDUSTRIES: Thank you, Maria. Good morning.BARTIROMO: You know, this article really bothers me. And what's been going on has bothered me. And I want you to talk to us about it. Because the world is safer as you write and more peaceful when the U.S. is in a strong leadership position and has the technology that it needs to continue to advance. But you're seeing Silicon Valley push back at the U.S. government.Recently, as you write Google cancelling its contract with the Pentagon for an A.I. program. This is on top of Microsoft, Amazon, they're also pushing back, facing internal and external criticism for providing tools for law enforcement including the border agents. So, tell us about this.STEPHENS: Yes, I believe that the United States is in a serious competition right now with countries like Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, to develop some of the most significant technologies for defense for the next century. And this is something that we really have to win. It's important not only to our country but also to the liberal Democratic values that we hold so dear, things like equality, freedom of expression, governance and oversight.And the belief in the tech community is -- you know, that the tradeoff is that you can just kind of sit this out and the problem with that thesis is that if you sit it out, you're really just giving our adversaries an advantage and making it much harder for us to win.BARTIROMO: Let's not forget that the strength of America, the democracy and the freedoms that we all share and enjoy are the reasons that these companies have become empowered as much as they have. These are the reasons, America, that Google is where it is and why Apple is a trillion dollar company, Heather.HEATHER HIGGINS, CEO, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE: No, you didn't see them doing this when Obama was president even though these contracts were there. And it's very -- your conversation with Jack Keane talked about the space force. 13 years ago you have the Democrats saying, well, even though everything that we do in space, the satellites are so important to our defense, we don't want to weaponize space. And so, they pulled back on the budget to develop this stuff.And in the interim, China and Russia and other countries have really been developing their capacity. We are now lagging, not leading. And this too is another example where the technology is exactly what keeps us safe by staying ahead of it and it is nonsensical that Google is doing this but they're still -- for example, reputed to be bidding on the Jedi program.BARTIROMO: Right.HIGGINS: It is -- these are free riders on our safety and that's -- that is really not acceptable.BARTIROMO: So Google is more important than the Pentagon, I guess.KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK: Well, Trae, I have a question for you in regards to --we're talking about Silicon Valley but I think we're actually seeing adults in the room, and they're actually up in Seattle. Let's talk about Microsoft, where even the president and chief legal officer, Brad Smith, was talking about -- he wants the government to regulate actually A.I. and the facial recognition technology. Are we going to see leadership start to bifurcate in these technology companies, you're going to see sort of -- you know, Microsoft or Amazon take the lead and actually help steer the ship when it comes to these situations we're facing?STEPHENS: Yes, to be honest, I'm not -- I'm not really sure that it's about any single company, whether it's Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Facebook. I think it's really more about a mindset that is becoming pervasive, that we have an option to sit this out. You know, there seems to be this lie that believes that kind of the way we develop technology is that we can kind of work our way into a situation of parody with another country.But the reality is that the authoritarian option that's kind of being presented by Russia or China doesn't have the same kind of moral standing as we would expect out of our technologies. So we really have to have a more superior technological standing.BARTIROMO: Yes.STEPHENS: In order to give ourselves enough of a cushion to be able to apply the moral and ethical norms that are so important to our liberal values.HIGGINS: Former Google chief CEO Eric Schmidt, I believe, is the head of the defense innovation board and is very supportive of these industry leaders being partnering --BARTIROMO: Why did Google cancel the Pentagon contract?HIGGINS: Because of pressure internally from their employees. My question for you is, does Eric Schmidt have a cohort of support that's going to be able to weigh in on this and perhaps, change minds in these companies?STEPHENS: Yes, you know, I don't -- I don't think that there is like a mass majority of tech employees that are opposed to doing work with the defense community. I think that there's a very vocal minority that has the tendency to shout down people, that believe -- you know, different policy kind of ideas than they do. But it's really important that we get a diversity of thought into these communities and give them kind of a reassurance that there is going to be support when they're -- when they're interested in working on the things.You know, the engineers that were working for Google on Project Maven were -- you know, working on it because they believed in it. And I think that most -- maybe not -- you know, all but certainly a large number of engineers in Silicon Valley, in the tech community, will be happy to work with the government on problems of national significance, if they believe do it, they have the support to do it.KELLY: Do you think -- Trae, do you think they're doing that already through the CIA's venture capital arm In-Q-Tel? So, do you think there's something actually happening behind the scenes that we're not knowing about because we know that CIA does invest and does do venture capital?STEPHENS: Sure, there are numerous organizations that intersect with the tech community, whether it's In-Q-Tel or the DIUx, the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental which is based here in Mountain View or the United States Digital Service.BARTIROMO: Right.STEPHENS: Which has an outcropping in the Pentagon called the Defense Digital Service, so there are places where people can contribute. The question really comes down to how leadership in the tech community are going to respond to the activism from their own employees and choose to stand up for something that's truly nonpartisan. Historically and hopefully moving forward, that we need to care about preserving those values that have gotten us to the leadership position we're in today.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: I'll just paraphrase or quote from a Wall Street Journal editorial about the report that Google was looking to try and reintroduce the search engine back into China about the --BARTIROMO: That's right.MCDOWELL: Quite frankly, the hypocrisy of them turning their back on the U.S. military but willingly trying to do business in a country that is stealing American technology to control its own people and dominate other nations.The Wall Street Journal wrote, Google and its hyper political employees stand out for seeming to spend a remarkable amount of time naval gazing and composing codes of conduct.BARTIROMO: It's a great point, you're absolutely right.HIGGINS: It's a measure of how Trump Derangement Syndrome --BARTIROMO: Yes.HIGGINS: -- redefines your understanding of what do know evil means.MCDOWELL: Don't be evil.HIGGINS: Don't be evil, right. And remember --BARTIROMO: So, go to China and have a different search engine than you have a censor information but cancel your contract with the U.S. military.KELLY: Yes, but you pulled up to work --BARTIROMO: That makes sense, right?KELLY: But you pulled up to work in a Prius so it's all good.MCDOWELL: Excuse me, it's a Tesla. Prius is so 2008. It's Tesla, OK?BARTIROMO: There you go. We don't think this is funny, but this is a serious story. We're going to keep on this story.Back when I spoke with Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, he did mention that he's working with the government on some things but doesn't want to be part of any of border issues. This was around the separation of children and families, and children and their parents, and this is because of the activism of employees.HIGGINS: Right, they are unpleasant things like making your capacity to pinpoint targets more accurately. Well, if you're not pinpointing accurately, you're actually increasing the risk of hurting innocence, children and their families who accidentally get hit. Which side of this do they want to be on?BARTIROMO: Exactly right.MCDOWELL: And saving the lives of our men and women who fight for our freedom. Remember freedom is not free. And if -- drone programs save lives in the United States, then.HIGGINS: And China has its own analogs to Google, etcetera. Those are wholly owned and those are entirely working on this with the Chinese government.BARTIROMO: Hey Silicon Valley, get with the program. Trae Stephens, thank you so much. We will be right back.BARTIROMO: Markets under pressure today. Take a look, Dow Industrials down a hundred points. Futures reflecting investor concerns over political turmoil in Turkey this morning. The major indices are down across the board and across the world. Europe, also weaker this morning as is Asia.Breaking news, reports of multiple fatalities in a shooting in Canada. Cheryl Casone with the details now, Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: We're trying to get more details Maria, for our viewers. But what -- here's what we know. Police say at least four people have been killed in a shooting in Fredericton, the city that's the capital of New Brunswick province which is just north of Maine, you can see on your map.Police have warned people that are living in the area, lock their doors, telling others to stay away from the Brookside drive neighborhood. Now, the incident is ongoing right now. We're going to get more information hopefully soon as this release. So, we'll bring it to you immediately.Well, a man wearing a make America Great Again hat incorrectly told he couldn't vote because he was wearing the pro-Trump hat. The county election official says the hat should have been permitted because it's not really relevant to the primary election, very strange.Apparently though, get this, that all the stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame really belonged there. The Hollywood reporter says, several fake Donald Trump stars have shown up on the famous attraction that's all started yesterday. The (INAUDIBLE) stars appeared in empty spaces reportedly in response to President Trump's star getting vandalized last month and a resolution passed by the West Hollywood city council to have Trump's star completely removed. An unnamed conservative artist is said to be behind the fake stars.Well, the Disney sequel, "Wreck it Ralph 2, Ralph Breaks the Internet", doesn't come out until November.

You can see the Little Mermaid's: Ariel, Pocahontas, Cinderella, Ana and Elsa from Frozen, Snow White, Rapunzel, Moana, Tiana and Mulan. There you go, Maria.BARTIROMO: I love it. I love the fact they're all wearing yoga pants.CASONE: Yes, that's like -- that's what's gone viral on the web, is that picture. Because they're -- you know, hanging out, chilling, forget the gowns.BARTIROMO: Very cool. I like it. All right. Thank you, Cheryl.Meanwhile, we had a great week here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Check out some of the top moments from the program this week.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Your reaction to the sanctions on Iran?REP. LEE ZELDIN (R), NEW YORK: I'm really happy that the president is choosing to take a stronger stance as relates to Iran. The Iran nuclear deal as JCPOA shouldn't have been entered into in the first place. It was faille flawed for what was in it. It was faille flawed for what wasn't in it.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The international markets and businesses already began to take them into account.BARTIROMO: It was pretty aggressive of the U.S. to slap the sanctions on Russia.MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR: Well, I guess I'm trying to figure out, if the president is so the puppet of Vladimir Putin.BARTIROMO: Right.HUCKABEE: He has really cut the strings. I mean, I've never seen the United States push so hard back against Russia.MARK PENN, FORMER HILLARY CLINTON CHIEF STRATEGIST: China has been stealing American jobs for a long time, stealing American technology and is out for world economic domination.BARTIROMO: What do you think is behind all of this violence in Chicago?RAY KELLY, FORMER COMMISSIONER, NEW YORK CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT: The primary reason in my opinion is the backing away from proactive police strategies that have worked in the past. For instance, stop and question people in the field. Now, this is not only happening in Chicago. It's happening throughout the country.BARTIROMO: Turning Point USA's Charlie Kirk and Candace Owens are attacked by left wing protesters while trying to have breakfast at a Philadelphia coffee shop. That must have been scary for you. Tell us what happened.CANDACE OWENS, COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, TURNING POINT USA: Yes, so, we were eating at this restaurant. And there was a group of foreign individuals that were bearing the Antifa decal all over their clothing and on their backpacks. So, we recognize they were Antifa. And they instantly recognized Charlie and I. And they were whispering amongst themselves looking back. There was quite some distance between us. They were on the opposite side of the restaurant. But we didn't think anything of it.BARTIROMO: Have you heard anything about this from anybody on the left, to say this is wrong, what just happened to you?OWENS: Well Maria, this is what they wanted. This is what Maxine Waters called for.TEESHA KEENEY, ANALYST, ARK INVEST: We're not surprised to hear that Elon Musk is frustrated with the short-term major of the public markets. You know, I think he's looking to the private market because they'll support to the longer term.BARTIROMO: Right.JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: You asked me if he's in trouble. The answer is, it depends what happens next. Was this a truthful statement going private at 420, funding secured?JAMES FARLEY, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF GLOBAL MARKETS, FORD: Mustang is so special for the company, 10 million, that's the best-selling sports car in the world. Now we started exporting just a few years ago and we exported from Michigan about a half a million units now. So, it's a big day for Ford, 10 million.BARTIROMO: From your standpoint in terms of the music business in general, how has it changed?LYLE LOVETT, COUNTRY MUSIC SINGER: My first few records came out in the pre-digital world. And so, really, it's how people receive their music.ALEX AZAR, SECRETARY, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES: What we've done today, fewer than 90 days after the president announced his blueprint has brought historic negotiation and management of formularies to our Medicare advantage plan which provides benefits to one third of our Medicare beneficiaries. Allowing them to provide appropriate -- clinically appropriate, cost effective management to the drugs that they cover.DR. MIKHAIL VARSHAVSKI, PHYSICIAN, FAMILY MEDICINE: Being a family medicine doctor, I always see men that are scared to go see the doctor or not go see the doctor. But it looks like when it comes to cost, women are generally going to be making the decisions when it comes to health care.BARTIROMO: Teenagers are seeking plastic surgery to look like their filtered selfies. People suffering from Snapchat Dysmorphia.DR. NEELAM VASHI, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF DERMATOLOGY, BOSTON UNIVERSITY: It's a phenomenon of increased scrutiny over selfies and this new trend we're seeing that has patients seeking out cosmetic procedures to not only improve their look in selfies but also to look like filtered and altered versions of themselves with perfect hair and unblemished skin, smaller noses, fuller lips, bigger eyes.CASONE: Meet the clip-on man bun.BARTIROMO: Man bun?CASONE: That's not going to take off.HUCKABEE: I just ordered one.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: All right. Fortnite fever, that is the gaming trend that is consuming over 125 million people across the globe. Fortnite lets players fight against enemies with basic resources like wood, bricks, steel. It's become so completive that parents are now hiring video game coaches to help their children win.Joining me right now to tell us more about the craze is Fortnite coach Caesar Sainz, and a parent who hired Caesar to coach his son, Nick Mennen. Nick, Great to see you both.Caesar, Nick, thanks for joining us. Nick, let me kick it off with you. You usually hear parents trying to get their kids to put down the controls. Why did you hire a coach?NICK MENNEN, SON PLAYS FORTNITE: My son was actually beginning to play and he wanted to get a little bit more competitive and when I saw that there was a university that started offering a scholarship for it, I decided that it was a good approach for his future, hopefully maybe he can get some scholarship money when he goes to college.BARTIROMO: Scholarship money for what?MENNEN: For Fortnite playing.BARTIROMO: For Fortnite playing, wow. Caesar, this is becoming a big business. How did you get into coaching? How many clients do you have at this point?CAESAR SAINZ, FORTNITE COACH: So, I got into coaching through like my actual organization that got us partnered with Gamer Sensei which is a company that do the coaching through. Initially I don't have that many clients. Well, I did like a kind of several like loyal ones. But after the article from the Wall Street Journal, I basically tripled the numbers regarding clients. And I'm like saying now I'm at a pretty comfortable number, actually.BARTIROMO: That's incredible. What do -- what do you typically pay for a coaching lesson, Nick?MENNEN: I pay $20.00 an hour.BARTIROMO: $20.00 an hour. And Caesar, what do you want to say to people who think hiring a video game coach is cheating?SAINZ: Well, I wouldn't say it's cheating. But it definitely gives you like an outside perspective on like how to like approach the game differently on maybe what you might be doing wrong that you might not be able to realize.And I know coaching might not be for everybody. But it definitely does help the people that do try like -- it definitely helps by getting outside perspective from a professional gamer.BARTIROMO: Well, give us some coaching tips. What's most important that we need to know about Fortnite?SAINZ: Definitely material management is huge, rotate and tilt the map and avoiding hot spots that might get you killed throughout the game is huge. Definitely taking engagements that are in your favor is like something that's very, very important with Fortnite. And also, practicing a lot of your building and mechanics and the new player mode that's truely enabled in Fortnite.BARTIROMO: Well, anybody who plays Fortnite knows who Ninja is, Tyler Blevins.SAINZ: Definitely.BARTIROMO: The most popular streamer on Twitch. He's like the LeBron of Fortnite. Some quick facts, he's 26, he's got 10 million followers -- 10 million plus followers. Almost 300 million channel views. Get this, he makes half a million dollars per month in subscriptions.

Is Microsoft an Outperformer?: Market ReconRealMoneySeptember 18, 2018 Tuesday 8:37 AM EDTCopyright 2018 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1564 wordsByline: Stephen GuilfoyleHighlight: MSFT is still outperforming the Nasdaq Composite, the Information Technology sector, and the software industry.BodyThe Other Shoe?Last night, well after the day's final bell had chimed out loud at 11 Wall Street, the Trump administration pulled the trigger on the next round of tariffs aimed at bringing the Chinese government closer to the U.S. position on trade. On September 24th, which is next Monday, the United States will implement a 10% tax on $200 billion worth of imports from China. If progress is not made, then this 10% tax becomes 25% by year's end. President Trump was frank ahead of the announcement. In reference to the U.S./China trade deficit, he said quite simply "We just can't let this happen anymore."From the Chinese point of view, these tariffs will go well beyond the point where China can respond in dollar for dollar fashion, as China had done with the Trump administration's original batch of tariffs that amounted to a 25% tax on $50 billion worth of goods. In order to respond in kind, China would have to implement a mixed bag of tariffs and some kind of trade restriction that would deny U.S. access to raw materials or impact American corporate supply lines.It is safe to say that European equity markets and overnight U.S. equity index futures markets have taken the events of last evening quite well. This comes despite President Trump's threats earlier this month that the U.S. had another $267 billion worth of tariffs versus imports from China ready to go if China still refuses to deal. That number, by the way, would ultimately bring the dollar total of imports from China subjected to U.S. tariffs beyond the total amount of goods that were exported from China to the U.S. in 2017. That number totaled $505 billion. In 2017, China only imported a rough $129 billion worth of goods from the U.S. That, and the alleged theft of U.S. corporate intellectual properties, are the very crux of the matter.What Is Priced In? Oddly enough, the sectors within the U.S. equity markets that one might expect to take it on the chin, did not on a day where a move like this on tariffs was telegraphed well ahead of the close. The Industrials were simply not torched in the way that one might think. Highly exposed Honeywell  , though trading lower overnight, actually traded at a multi-year high during the regular session. Perhaps investors had started to price in 25%, and found relief that this opening salvo only included a 10% tax that might eventually roll up to 25%?One thing is certain, at least to this trader. It may not feel like it, but we have experienced something of a stealth correction across equities and other markets in 2018. Blame trade wars if you want. Blame the methodical drawing down of liquidity by the central bank. Blame the coming, at some point, of an obvious slow-down in earnings growth that may occur alongside a problematic fiscal situation.The fact is that earnings growth across the S&P 500 has printed well above 20% year over year, and last quarter more like 25%. This, while the S&P 500 itself has gained ground to the tune of a more pedestrian 8%. Why? What is clear to me is that due to the reasons mentioned above, forward looking valuation has been siphoned off quite a bit. As calendar year 2017 came to a close, the broad S&P 500 was trading at a rough aggregate of 18.3 times forward looking earnings. Pundits across TV land screamed about over-valued equities. Poof. Nine month later, the air has come out of those tires. The S&P 500 currently trades at 16.8 times forward earnings, which by the way for those keeping score... is just a smidge above the five year average for the index. Overvalued now? Still, an argument might be made but certainly not such a cut and dried case at this point.Economic ImpactsWill tariffs slow confidence? Is the Fed hurting the broader economy? Survey results make me look silly just for asking. The fact is though... that I must ask. Housing Starts are due tomorrow. This data-point has disappointed in each of the last two months, and in three of the last four. The largest slice of the housing pie... Existing Home Sales has now disappointed for four consecutive months. We'll see that one hit the tape again on Thursday. Now, look at Total Vehicle Sales. That line has printed well below its recent norms in three of the past four months. All line items covering sales of expensive items that require for most people the willingness to borrow a lot of money.Now, there are certainly other factors at play such as household formation, pricing, etc. However, mortgage rates are now also higher than they have been since prior to the economic crisis, and the Fed is whittling down the balance sheet while forcing higher the short end of the curve... this, while the nation is engaged high stakes trade conflicts with key partners. If this isn't dangerous then I guess that I am just unable to recognize danger.BloodlettingOne sector where we did see some major selling pressure yesterday was in Information Technology. Selling continued across the semiconductor space, which is highly exposed to China for revenue. However, the selling was just as intense for the cloud/software space, an industry almost entirely not exposed to China, but perhaps just as exposed to the ruthless magic of passive investment. Depending on your source, the technology sector trades at a higher valuation than does the broader marketplace, at somewhere between 18.7 times and 19 times next year's earnings. Sliced and diced, one quickly sees the semis, and their suppliers trading around 10 to 13 times, while our beloved cloud names sport valuations in the 20's and even 30's. This is where the perceived overvaluation is. This is where the largest profits are, this is where the money has to come from for those getting skittish ahead of any feared slowdown in growth.Truth be told, as a trader, I added to my cloud longs as the closing bell rang last night, or at least the ones not trading prohibitively above my net basis at this point. Interestingly, one name jumped out at me after the closing bell... a name that I am already long... for a good while... Microsoft  .Outperformer?Microsoft gave up a little more than 1% on Monday. Ugly? Yes, but still outperforming the Nasdaq Composite, the Information Technology sector, and the software industry. Hmm. What goes on here? Apparently, Five-star Stifel analyst Brad Reback pointed out late in yesterday's regular trading session that Microsoft has announced an increase to the firm's dividend payment on the third Tuesday of September for eight consecutive Septembers. Microsoft has already made plain the firm's intent to return a cool $20 billion to shareholders. Reback placed a price target of $118 on this name. Same day, Oppenheimer analyst Timothy Horan, also five-star caliber... maintained his buy rating on the name, and established a $127 price target.MSFT trades at something close to 26 times forward looking earnings, expensive for the broader marketplace, but not for the group. Cash on hand and cash equivalents dwarf total debt. Operating Margin is healthy and growing. Cash Flows are enormous. Current and Quick Ratios are robust.On September 24th-28th (next week), Microsoft will be hosting the Ignite conference in Orlando. The focus here will likely be on Cloud technology, as well as on new innovations across the Microsoft universe involving big data, and artificial intelligence. Wait... there's more.By the way, the firm will hold it's "Apple  style fall product launch event in New York City on October 2nd. (That's in two weeks). Think hardware such as a new Surface in addition to new software. I think that maybe the stock price increases in front of these events as we saw with Apple? Maybe. I'm long the name. I am not always right, but I do not see the current week as good timing for a sale.Don't Fear The ReaperOne thing that a chart watcher might say is that this is one heck of a nice Pitchfork. Money Flow is strong. Every component of the daily MACD is pulling the right way. Relative Strength is at a nice level, but appears to be waning just a bit.I placed the second set of Fibonacci levels on the chart just so that the investor my be able to place an effective panic point somewhere. That somewhere for me is the $103 level. However, the stock continues to make higher highs while also putting higher lows to the tape. I interviewed a CEO in an unrelated field for an unrelated purpose the other day. That executive told me that his firm uses the Microsoft Azure cloud for it's business. That did not surprise at all.Microsoft My Target Price: $121My Panic Point: $103Note: MSFT reports on October 18th. For those looking to scalp some revenue by selling the October 19th 105 puts, they only paid 64 cents last night. Is that worth it? Only you can answer that. However, the November 16th 105 puts went out paying $1.64. An extra hundred buck per contract for an extra month of exposed risk? That one's a definite maybe from my corner.Economics (All Times Eastern)08:55 - Redbook (Weekly):Last 6.3% y/y.10:00 - NAHB Housing Market Index (Sept):Expecting 66, Last 67.16:00 - TIC Net Flows (July):Expecting $65.1B, Last $-36.5B.16:30 - API Oil Inventories (Weekly):Last -8.636M.Today's Earnings Highlights (Consensus EPS Expectations)Before the Open: (17.91),  (2.69),  (.64)(Honeywell, Microsoft and Apple are holdings in Jim Cramer's  .

State governors delve into foreign diplomacy on trade warAssociated Press Financial WireJuly 19, 2018 Thursday 11:22 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 594 wordsByline: By MORGAN LEE, Associated PressDateline: SANTA FE, N.M. BodySANTA FE, N.M. (AP) - State governors discussed ways Thursday to court foreign investment in the wake of President Donald Trump's trade disputes with countries including China, Canada and Mexico.Several of the more than 20 governors attending the annual meeting of the National Governors Association said shifting U.S. trade policies are rattling markets for agricultural commodities and complicating decisions by foreign investors."It gets damaging when you get into these very frictional relationships where people are trying to measure this tariff or that tariff," said Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado. "I'm not saying the previous system was fair."Republican Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he is sending the state's economic development director on an additional trip to China this year to meet with companies that are making investments in his state, amid concerns about deteriorating U.S.-China trade relations."It's important that we look for a solution very quickly so that we don't have an increase in tariffs and escalate the tariff war, as some would describe it," said Hutchinson, who is running for a second term this year.Brookings Institution Fellow Joseph Parilla said governors don't decide U.S. trade policy but can engage in direct economic diplomacy to encourage investment, while funding things like education and research at home."They're certainly not helpless," he said. "They can increasingly conduct economic policy themselves."In Washington on Thursday, Trump's proposed tariffs on imported cars, trucks and auto parts ran into opposition from automakers, dealers and suppliers. Opponents of the new trade restrictions lined up to vent as the Commerce Department held a hearing on whether auto imports pose a threat to U.S. national security.At the governor's conference in Santa Fe, emissaries from the Chinese government and enterprises warned that a trade war with China could lead to negative consequences for ordinary Americans, such as higher prices on consumer goods and greater inflation."We should let those who advocate trade war know that trade war is not something that can be easily won," China Consul General to Los Angeles Zhang Ping said. The comment appeared to be a direct response to Trump's statement via Twitter in March that "trade wars are good, and easy to win."The U.S. and China are threatening a trade war over Trump complaints that Chinese companies steal trade secrets and force U.S. firms to hand over technology in return for market access. Trump has slapped tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, provoking retaliatory measures by Canada, Mexico and U.S. allies in the European Union.Hickenlooper described the approach as a "sledgehammer."He and Utah Republican Gov. Gary Herbert extolled long-term strategies for state economies to increase foreign trade, from foreign language schools to Utah's expansion of airport cargo-flight capacity.Republican North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum said soybean growers in his state have an enormous stake in the U.S. trade confrontation, as commodities markets recoil from the threat of retaliatory tariffs. Trump's approach deserves more time to win concessions on important issues such as China's treatment of U.S. intellectual property, Burgum said.New Mexico Farm and Livestock Bureau President Craig Ogden said retaliatory Chinese tariffs on U.S. pecans and new tariffs from Mexico on U.S. cheese products are likely to hurt producers in New Mexico."What makes them nervous is once you lose these markets, they're going to be hard to get back," he said.Load-Date: July 20, 2018End of Document

Guterres: FOCAC Beijing Summit helps African countries reduce povertyPR NewswireSeptember 5, 2018 Wednesday 9:00 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 354 wordsDateline: BEIJING, Sept. 5, 2018 BodyChina has made great contributions in supporting African countries in their development, and helped reduce poverty around the world, thanks to the development cooperation policies of China with countries in the developing world, said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in an exclusive interview with China.org.cn on Monday.Guterres said China's investment in other countries could be integrated with their own development processes. "It's very important to support African countries to fully benefit from China's cooperation, and to fully integrate it into their own development programs." "China's cooperation is an important contribution to reduce poverty around the world, and to achieve other development goals, and at the same time to create synergies that will allow, through international cooperation, the global economy to be more prosperous and to bring more benefits to the global population," he added.Guterres also pointed out that China has been able to move hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, and the country now has a very clear target to fully eradicate extreme poverty in China by 2020. This is China's most important contribution to the world."These two contributions together represent China's very important commitment and contribution to the implementation of the Agenda 2030, the Sustainable Development Agenda and its goals," he said.Guterres believes that China will achieve its goals because they have strong commitments from Chinese President Xi Jinping, the Chinese government, and the society. He estimates that after 2020, China will continue its systematic program to reduce less extreme poverty that might still exist, and will aim to create a society in which the fight against inequality and the capacity to bring all people into the benefits of the modern era will be achieved.Guterres was invited to attend the 2018 Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) held on Sept. 3-4. View original content with multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/guterres-focac-beijing-summit-helps-african-countries-reduce-poverty-300706807.htmlSOURCE China.org.cnCONTACT: Ni Jingjing, +86-158-1109-0105, 2928586960@qq.comLoad-Date: September 6, 2018End of Document

Lockheed Martin's Chart Is Spectacular: Market ReconRealMoneySeptember 17, 2018 Monday 7:33 AM EDTCopyright 2018 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1181 wordsByline: Stephen GuilfoyleHighlight: LMT spiked right through a couple of points of resistance late last week.BodyMarking Time What is the purpose of marking time? As 17-year-olds, we were told that the purpose was to get your cover and alignment right. In other words, to make sure that you were in the right spot, so that on parade before the public, you might not stick out like a sore thumb.This is exactly what you are seeing across financial markets right now. Why? Simply because everyone involved is unsure. Unsure whether they should be pricing in either the hopeful resolution to the various trade disputes the U.S. is currently engaged in -- particularly with China. Unsure still over the size and scope of the damage still being done to the Carolinas due to Hurricane Florence, and unsure of just how much upward pressure the Federal Reserve should be putting on interest rates in the wake of what were tremendously positive July revisions to both domestic Retail Sales and Industrial Production.One might have noticed that even with that upward pressure on rates, the spread between what U.S. two-year paper and U.S. 10-year paper will pay has not really been altered all that much. Those extra eight years will help garner the investor a whopping 21 basis points or so of yield. It does not take too much cognitive ability to figure out why the Financials were the only sector within the S&P 500 to close out last week in the red, despite the 10-year battle with 3% support.On Trade It is said that the Chinese government was working on finalizing plans for senior officials to meet on trade in Washington this week, and set up a visit the very next week by Vice Premier Liu He with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Rumors are that the Trump administration will move ahead with the much-discussed tranche of tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. However, the same rumors have it that these tariffs might come down at just 10%, instead of the previously threatened 25%.By the way, these tariffs -- if implemented -- reach a level that China cannot match dollar for dollar, given the sheer size of the trade imbalance that the nation enjoys versus the U.S. In order to retaliate, China would have to get creative. That would mean some kind of restriction along the lines of equipment sales key to U.S. corporate supply lines.Almost as if on cue, beleaguered memory chip producer Micron Technology  will report the firm's fourth-quarter performance after Thursday's closing bell. EPS whispers are for a print that might be a couple of pennies below consensus. As important as performance, inventories and pricing might be, as important will be anything that CEO Sanjay Mehrotra might have to say regarding the firm's continued reliance upon China.Expensive Toys News broke on Friday evening that catches one's eye, if one tends to watch the defense and aerospace industries closely. The U.S. Air Force awarded a contract to Lockheed Martin worth a potential $7.2 billion to produce as many as 22 additional GPS III satellites. This is an option-based contract that could be exercised in part or in whole, which would be in addition to the ten satellites of this type that Lockheed is already producing for the Air Force.These advanced satellites, which will be manufactured in the Denver, Colorado suburb of Littleton, will improve both accuracy for navigational purposes, as well as security against cyber attacks. This new satellite, which is not expected to take the field until 2026, will also emit a signal more compatible with satellites currently used by European nations.This, at least to this investor, is the deal here. As you all know, the federal government's fiscal year ends within two weeks. For any unspent defense money, this becomes crunch time. In other words, it's use it or lose it.You kids ever hear of the Air, Space, & Cyber Conference? This aerospace dog and pony show kicks off today and will run through Wednesday at National Harbor, Maryland. The event is hosted by the Air Force Association. Not only will a plethora of high-ranking officers speaks at this event, but you can expect to hear from SpaceX COO Gwynne Shotwell this afternoon, and Blur Origin founder -- and Amazon  CEO -- Jeff Bezos on Wednesday afternoon. Both of these appearances are scheduled for 3:40 p.m. ET.The point that I am trying to make is that if the Air Force is going to throw money around ahead of the close of the fiscal year, this event would make for great theater. The Air Force is thought to have two potential contracts in play at this time. One would be a two-year contract to replace the Atlas 5 rocket now used to launch military payloads. The Atlas 5 is a United Launch Alliance product, which is a joint venture between Lockheed and Boeing  . ULA is still in the running for some business here. Both Space X and Blue Origin are also thought to be contending, as is Northrop Grumman  .Then there is the much-bigger potential for some cash flow as the Air Force is expected to at some point in the near future make a move toward replacing it's tired fleet of 38C Talon trainer aircraft. This contract, according to Investors Business Daily, could be worth $16 billion, and involve an order for as many as 350 aircraft. The 38C is a Northrop product. Both Lockheed Martin and Boeing are working on separate competing joint efforts with external firms on designing suitable replacements. This contract has been delayed several times already. According to Inside Defense, this contract will likely be awarded prior to September 30... for real this time.Chart Of The Day: Lockheed Martin  Now that is a chart. One quickly see that this name spiked right through a couple of points of resistance late last week. The daily Moving Average Convergence Divergence looks sharp, with all three components pulling in the same direction. Relative Strength is well... strong, and that Money Flow is just spectacular. As most of you know, I am long this name, and have been quite high on the name of late.The entire sector has  much better in recent weeks than it had for quite some time. I have taken some off of several of my names in this group as price has improved -- and for others,  prices have been reached. My target price for LMT ($333) was pierced on Friday. Discipline demands that I take something off -- and so it shall be, but it won't be much. Maybe a 10% scalp.I like this name, and LMT obviously has the hot hand in the industry right now. For your information, the financial industry's average target price for this name is currently $369.88. Third-quarter earnings are not due until October 23.The Details Target Price: $360 (up from $333)Panic Point: $312 (up from $290)Note: I do not find options markets related to LMT especially liquid -- they are not priced to my liking to either take a shot there myself, or lead you, the reader, to believe that doing so would be a good idea. If that changes, I'll be on it. Right now, this is an equity play for me.Economics (All Times Eastern) 08:30 - Empire State Manufacturing Index (Sept):Expecting 23.1, Last 25.6.Today's Earnings Highlights (Consensus EPS Expectations) After the Close: (3.83),  (0.68)Load-Date: September 18, 2018End of Document

The companies behind bitcoin are trying to go public at a really bad timeCNN WireSeptember 27, 2018 Thursday 10:56 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 789 wordsByline: By Daniel ShaneDateline: HONG KONG (CNNMoney) BodyHONG KONG (CNNMoney) --  Bitcoin's big stock market debut is coming at a bad time. Three of the world's top makers of cryptocurrency technology are planning to sell shares, giving investors a new way to bet on digital currencies. They're reportedly hoping to raise billions of dollars.Unlike the dollar or the euro, which are issued by central banks, cryptocurrencies are based on computer code. Bitcoin, for example, is created and traded through the "mining" process in which computer algorithms solve increasingly complex math problems. Bitmain, Canaan and Ebang, which are all based in China, make money by selling the high-tech parts and systems that power this mining. Together, they dominate the business. But the three companies operate in a young, unpredictable industry and are planning their IPOs in Hong Kong in brutal market conditions. The price of bitcoin, which soared to nearly $20,000 in December, has since plunged by about two-thirds. Other cryptocurrencies like ethereum have plummeted, too."If the market price of cryptocurrencies suddenly falls ... demand for our mining hardware and cryptocurrency mining services will also drop rapidly," Bitmain warned potential investors this week.On top of that, Hong Kong's stock market, where the companies plan to list, entered a bear market this month, having plunged more than 20% from its previous peak because of concerns about China's economic slowdown and trade war with the United States. The mining technology companies haven't said when exactly they plan to go public or how much they're seeking to raise. Bitmain and Canaan declined interview requests, while Ebang didn't respond to a request. "These firms might be looking to cash out before the market takes an even steeper nosedive," said Benjamin Quinlan, founder of Hong Kong-based financial services consulting firm Quinlan & Associates. He points out that cryptocurrencies are slowly gaining more acceptance among mainstream investors despite recent setbacks, and that the three mining companies' revenues are still growing. But the industry faces major challenges. A key one is how governments go about regulating digital currencies. Last year, China banned most activities involving bitcoin. The country is still thought to be home to a significant number of cryptocurrency mining operations, but authorities have been trying to push them out.Cryptocurrency miners need huge amounts of electricity to run their rooms full of computing equipment around the clock. Some public utilities in the United States are already introducing higher tariffs specifically for miners."Increasing the cost of bitcoin mining will decrease the demand for mining equipment, hindering the performance of these companies," Quinlan said. Mining cryptocurrencies is already less lucrative than it used to be.Bitcoin mining activity has exploded over the past year, boosting demand for the technology. But that means the profits from mining are spread more thinly across a greater number of users. That could hit future demand for mining equipment. Will the mining boom last?Bitmain, Canaan and Ebang were all profitable in their most recent financial year, according to documents setting out their intention to go public. But staying in the black will be a "massive challenge," said Leilei Wang, a Shanghai-based consultant at research firm Kapronasia. The companies are aware of the risks they face and are trying to adapt. For example, they say they are increasing investment in more advanced chip technology that can be used in areas like artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and connected devices.Although the Chinese government has a tough stance on cryptocurrencies in general, it's eager to bulk up the country's technological prowess in areas like computer chips. Chinese companies are still largely reliant on foreign chip technology, especially from the United States. "Whether [the cryptocurrency companies] are able to successfully pivot remains to be seen," Wang said. For now, their fate is tied to that of the wider industry. "Cryptocurrencies will likely fall out of favor" without greater mainstream adoption in the near future, Quinlan predicted. The mining equipment makers "will find it extremely difficult to survive when the cryptocurrency market, as a whole, withers away," he said.But bitcoin bulls are still hopeful that the currency can stage a recovery as financial exchanges and big companies start to take it more seriously."As you see more adoption of just people being comfortable with it, it feels like it's going to go up," Mike Novogratz, CEO of cryptocurrency investment firm Galaxy Digital, told CNN this week.TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

JinkoSolar Announces Second Quarter 2018 Financial ResultsPR NewswireAugust 13, 2018 Monday 7:00 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 4711 wordsDateline: SHANGHAI, Aug. 13, 2018 BodyJinkoSolar Holding Co., Ltd. ("JinkoSolar" or the "Company") (NYSE: JKS), a global leader in the solar PV industry, today announced its unaudited financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2018.Second Quarter 2018 HighlightsTotal solar module shipments were 2,794 megawatts ("MW") (including 200 MW to the Company's overseas downstream segment for which no revenue has been recognized), an increase of 38.7% from 2,015 MW in the first quarter of 2018 and a decrease of 3.1% from 2,884 MW in the second quarter of 2017.Total revenues were RMB6.06 billion (US$915.9 million), an increase of 32.7% from the first quarter of 2018 and a decrease of 23.5% from the second quarter of 2017.Gross margin was 12.0%, compared with 14.4% in the first quarter of 2018 and 10.5% in the second quarter of 2017.Income from operations was RMB94.6 million (US$14.3 million), compared with RMB125.0 million in the first quarter of 2018 and RMB85.3 million in the second quarter of 2017.Net income attributable to the Company's ordinary shareholders was RMB99.0 million (US$15.0 million) in the second quarter of 2018, compared with RMB3.6 million in the first quarter of 2018 and RMB47.4 million in the second quarter of 2017.Diluted earnings per American depositary share ("ADS") were RMB2.512 (US$0.408) in the second quarter of 2018.Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's ordinary shareholders in the second quarter of 2018 was RMB106.7 million (US$16.1 million), compared with RMB11.0 million in the first quarter of 2018 and RMB61.2 million in the second quarter of 2017.Non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS were RMB2.728 (US$0.412) and RMB2.708 (US$0.408) in the second quarter of 2018, compared with RMB0.300 and RMB0.296 in the first quarter of 2018 and RMB1.908 and RMB1.892 in the second quarter of 2017.Mr. Kangping Chen, JinkoSolar's Chief Executive Officer commented, "We delivered a strong quarter with module shipments hitting 2,794 MW while generating total revenue of US$915.9 million. Leveraging our cutting-edge technologies, strong global sales network, and industry leading cost structure, I'm confident in our ability to generate sustainable profits and growth going forward.""Growth during the quarter was strong and we expect this momentum to continue into the second half of the year despite the impact from the new policies issued by the Chinese government on May 31 as shipments to overseas markets are expected to continue growing and account for an increasing proportion of our shipments. We believe these new policies will have a relatively limited impact on our operations over the short-term and are optimistic about our future prospects. We expect demand from Top Runner Program, poverty alleviation projects, local government subsidies, and self-contained DG projects to continue to drive the growth in the Chinese market, especially in regions with ample sunlight and high commercial power prices.""We already have good visibility of our order book for the entire year which is predominantly made up of overseas orders to markets which are growing rapidly and will generate significant opportunities ahead. We are taking full advantage of our market leading position and production facility in Florida to expand our presence in the US market. Demand in emerging markets continues to grow, especially in Latin American and the Middle East and North Africa. We are devoting our resources there towards securing large long-term orders through our mature sales network which spans a number of markets there. We believe the Indian solar sector will maintain its long-term growth trajectory despite the short-term impact of recently announced tariffs and will continue to explore opportunities there.""We continued to develop high-efficiency technologies while optimizing the cost structure of our products. We made significant progress in improving wafer efficiency and reducing both oxygen content and light induced degradation. We are increasing our mono PREC cell capacity which will reach 4.2GW by the end of year. We are also investing in N type technology, especially HOT double sided cell technology. The falling cost of raw materials and our deep experience in rapidly rolling out new technologies will allow us to further optimize our cost structure going forward and help us increase market share by providing clients with high-efficiency products at cost effective prices.""Despite some industry headwinds, we believe those challenges also create opportunities for us to further strengthen our position as a global leader in the solar PV industry. On one hand they will push the industrial upgrading and accelerate the industry's consolidation by phasing out outdated production capacities and replacing them with high efficiency ones; On the other hand, it will push the rapidly falling cost of solar, making solar more competitive and stimulating the global demand. We are now in a good position and are fully prepared for these new opportunities to continue to expand our market share and further consolidate our leading position in the industry."Second Quarter 2018 Financial ResultsTotal RevenuesTotal revenues in the second quarter of 2018 were RMB6.06 billion (US$915.9 million), an increase of 32.7% from RMB4.57 billion in the first quarter of 2018 and a decrease of 23.5% from RMB7.92 billion in the second quarter of 2017. The sequential increase was mainly attributable to an increase in the shipment of solar modules in the second quarter of 2018.

The companies behind bitcoin are trying to go public at a really bad timeCNNMoney.comSeptember 12, 2018 Wednesday 6:56 AM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: TECHNOLOGYLength: 769 wordsByline: Daniel ShaneBodyBitcoin's big stock market debut is coming at a bad time.Three of the world's top makers of cryptocurrency technology are planning to sell shares, giving investors a new way to bet on digital currencies. They're reportedly hoping to raise billions of dollars.Unlike the dollar or the euro, which are issued by central banks, cryptocurrencies are based on computer code. Bitcoin, for example, is created and traded through the "mining" process in which computer algorithms solve increasingly complex math problems.Bitmain, Canaan and Ebang, which are all based in China, make money by selling the high-tech parts and systems that power this mining. Together, they dominate the business.But the three companies operate in a young, unpredictable industry and are planning their IPOs in Hong Kong in brutal market conditions. The price of bitcoin, which soared to nearly $20,000 in December, has since plunged by about two-thirds. Other cryptocurrencies like ethereum have plummeted, too."If the market price of cryptocurrencies suddenly falls ... demand for our mining hardware and cryptocurrency mining services will also drop rapidly," Bitmain warned potential investors this week.On top of that, Hong Kong's stock market, where the companies plan to list, entered a bear market this month, having plunged more than 20% from its previous peak because of concerns about China's economic slowdown and trade war with the United States.The mining technology companies haven't said when exactly they plan to go public or how much they're seeking to raise. Bitmain and Canaan declined interview requests, while Ebang didn't respond to a request."These firms might be looking to cash out before the market takes an even steeper nosedive," said Benjamin Quinlan, founder of Hong Kong-based financial services consulting firm Quinlan & Associates.He points out that cryptocurrencies are slowly gaining more acceptance among mainstream investors despite recent setbacks, and that the three mining companies' revenues are still growing. But the industry faces major challenges.A key one is how governments go about regulating digital currencies. Last year, China banned most activities involving bitcoin. The country is still thought to be home to a significant number of cryptocurrency mining operations, but authorities have been trying to push them out.Cryptocurrency miners need huge amounts of electricity to run their rooms full of computing equipment around the clock. Some public utilities in the United States are already introducing higher tariffs specifically for miners."Increasing the cost of bitcoin mining will decrease the demand for mining equipment, hindering the performance of these companies," Quinlan said.Mining cryptocurrencies is already less lucrative than it used to be.Bitcoin mining activity has exploded over the past year, boosting demand for the technology. But that means the profits from mining are spread more thinly across a greater number of users. That could hit future demand for mining equipment.Will the mining boom last?Bitmain, Canaan and Ebang were all profitable in their most recent financial year, according to documents setting out their intention to go public.But staying in the black will be a "massive challenge," said Leilei Wang, a Shanghai-based consultant at research firm Kapronasia.The companies are aware of the risks they face and are trying to adapt. For example, they say they are increasing investment in more advanced chip technology that can be used in areas like artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and connected devices.Although the Chinese government has a tough stance on cryptocurrencies in general, it's eager to bulk up the country's technological prowess in areas like computer chips. Chinese companies are still largely reliant on foreign chip technology, especially from the United States."Whether [the cryptocurrency companies] are able to successfully pivot remains to be seen," Wang said.For now, their fate is tied to that of the wider industry."Cryptocurrencies will likely fall out of favor" without greater mainstream adoption in the near future, Quinlan predicted. The mining equipment makers "will find it extremely difficult to survive when the cryptocurrency market, as a whole, withers away," he said.But bitcoin bulls are still hopeful that the currency can stage a recovery as financial exchanges and big companies start to take it more seriously."As you see more adoption of just people being comfortable with it, it feels like it's going to go up," Mike Novogratz, CEO of cryptocurrency investment firm Galaxy Digital, told CNN this week.Load-Date: September 28, 2018End of Document

CrowdReviews Partnered with AsiaMold 2019 Annouce: AsiaMold 2019 Continues to Attract Renowned Industry ExhibitorsPR.comJuly 27, 2018 Friday 6:30 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR.com, distributed by Contify.com All Rights ReservedLength: 711 wordsByline: CrowdReviews.comBodyNaples, FL,  July 27, 2018 --(PR.com)-- The 2019 edition of AsiaMold returns next March to showcase the latest moulding products and technologies, with many leading companies having already confirmed their participation.

Uoolu Releasing 2018 Ten Countries on Belt and Road Property Investment Data reportPR NewswireAugust 30, 2018 Thursday 8:00 PM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 341 wordsDateline: BEIJING, Aug. 30, 2018 BodyOn August 31, 2018, Uoolu, the leading platform for cross-border real estate transactions in China, is releasing the "Uoolu 2018 Ten Countries on Belt and Road Property Investment Data Report".The "Belt and Road Initiative" was proposed by the Chinese government in 2013 in order to strengthen the relationship with surrounding Asian countries. Since then, there has been frequent activity between China and other Asian countries in terms of property investment.In the report, Uoolu selected eight countries in Southeast Asia and two countries in the Middle East along the Belt and Road based on the Cooperative Development Index to assess the investment risk in the Belt and Road Initiative region.The ten countries were ranked by different criteria such as housing price growth rate and price-to-rent ratio. The data highlights the significant and accessible property markets of the region, as well as the demographics of Chinese investors.Surprisingly, the primary investors in overseas property are aged between 30 to 49 years old and are mostly from new industries. Investors come from IT, and Internet business accounts for 31% of investors who are open to mobile technology and new services. The new affluent generation has exhibited a short decision-making cycle. 43.56% of Chinese investors only take a week to decide on a property investment, and 67% invest between US$70,000 to $150,000.The report also reveals that Thailand, the Philippines, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam are the major markets today that receive the most attention from Chinese investors.To receive the full report, please follow us on Facebook or LinkedIn and drop us the message: "Belt and Road Report".Uoolu Website:http://www.uoolu.com Uoolu Facebook:           https://www.facebook.com/Uoolu/ Uoolu LinkedIn:           https://www.linkedin.com/company/uoolu.com/  View original content with multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/uoolu-releasing-2018-ten-countries-on-belt-and-road-property-investment-data-report-300704838.htmlSOURCE Uoolu.comCONTACT: Wu Peiling, +86-155-4689-2019, g.pr@uoolu.comLoad-Date: September 1, 2018End of Document

AP Explains: The US push to boost 'quantum computing'Associated Press Financial WireSeptember 24, 2018 Monday 2:14 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: DOMESTIC NEWSLength: 1020 wordsByline: By MATT O'BRIEN, AP Technology WriterDateline: YORKTOWN HEIGHTS, N.Y. BodyYORKTOWN HEIGHTS, N.Y. (AP) - A race by U.S. tech companies to build a new generation of powerful "quantum computers" could get a $1.3 billion boost from Congress, fueled in part by lawmakers' fear of growing competition from China.Legislation passed earlier in September by the U.S. House of Representatives would create a 10-year federal program to accelerate research and development of the esoteric technology. As the bill moves to the Senate, where it also has bipartisan support, the White House is showing enthusiasm for the effort with a planned quantum summit on Monday.Scientists hope government backing will help attract a broader group of engineers and entrepreneurs to their nascent field. The goal is to be less like the cloistered Manhattan Project physicists who developed the first atomic bombs and more like the wave of tinkerers and programmers who built thriving industries around the personal computer, the internet and smartphone apps.WHAT'S A QUANTUM COMPUTER?Describing the inner workings of a quantum computer isn't easy, even for top scholars. That's because the machines process information at the scale of elementary particles such as electrons and photons, where different laws of physics apply."It's never going to be intuitive," said Seth Lloyd, a mechanical engineering professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "At this microscopic level, things are weird. An electron can be here and there at the same time, at two places at once."Conventional computers process information as a stream of bits, each of which can be either a zero or a one in the binary language of computing. But quantum bits, known as qubits, can register zero and one simultaneously.WHAT CAN IT DO?In theory, the special properties of qubits would allow a quantum computer to perform calculations at far higher speeds than current supercomputers. That makes them good tools for understanding what's happening in the realms of chemistry, material science or particle physics.That speed could aid in discovering new drugs, optimizing financial portfolios and finding better transportation routes or supply chains. It could also advance another fast-growing field, artificial intelligence, by accelerating a computer's ability to find patterns in large troves of images and other data.What worries intelligence agencies most about the technology's potential - and one reason for the heightened U.S. interest - is that a quantum computer could in several decades be powerful enough to break the codes of today's best cryptography.Today's early quantum computers, however, fall well short on that front.WHERE CAN YOU FIND ONE?While quantum computers don't really exist yet in a useful form, you can find some loudly chugging prototypes in a windowless lab about 40 miles north of New York City.Qubits made from superconducting materials sit in colder-than-outer-space refrigerators at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center. Take off the cylindrical casing from one of the machines and the inside looks like a chandelier of hanging gold cables - all of it designed to keep 20 fragile qubits in an isolated quantum state."You need to keep it very cold to make sure the quantum bits only entangle with each other the way you program it, and not with the rest of the universe," said Scott Crowder, IBM's vice president of quantum computing.IBM is competing with Google and startups like Berkeley, California-based Rigetti Computing to get ever-more qubits onto their chips. Microsoft, Intel and a growing number of venture-backed startups are also making big investments. So are Chinese firms Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent, which have close ties to the Chinese government.But qubits are temperamental, and early commercial claims mask the ongoing struggle to control them, either by bombarding them with microwave signals - as IBM and Google do - or with lasers."It only works as long as you isolate it and don't look at it," said Chris Monroe, a University of Maryland physicist. "It's a grand engineering challenge."WHY DOES QUANTUM COMPUTING NEED FEDERAL SUPPORT?Monroe is among quantum leaders from academia and industry gathering in Washington on Monday with officials from the White House science office - though not likely President Donald Trump himself. Some federal agencies, including the departments of defense and energy, already have longstanding quantum research efforts, but advocates are pushing for more coordination among those agencies and greater collaboration with the private sector."The technology that underlies this area comes from some pretty weird stuff that we professors are used to at the university," said Monroe, who is also the founder of quantum startup IonQ, which floats individual atoms in a vacuum chamber and points lasers to control them. But he said corporate investment can be risky because of the technical challenges and the long wait for a commercial payoff."The infrastructure required, the hardware, the personnel, is way too expensive for anyone to go in it alone," said Prineha Narang, a Harvard University assistant professor of computational materials science.By investing more in basic discovery and training - as the House-passed National Quantum Initiative Act would do - Narang said the U.S. could expand the ranks of scientists and engineers who build quantum computers and then find commercial applications for them.WHAT ARE THE INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS?The potential economic benefits have won bipartisan support for the initiative, which is estimated to cost about $1.3 billion in its first five years. Also pushing action on Capitol Hill is a belief that if the U.S. doesn't adopt a unified strategy, it could one day be overtaken by other countries."China has publicly stated a national goal of surpassing the U.S. during the next decade," said Texas Republican Rep. Lamar Smith, chairman of the House science, space and technology committee, as he urged his colleagues on the House floor to support the bill to "preserve America's dominance in the scientific world."Smith said he expects the Senate will pass a companion bill before the end of the year.Load-Date: September 25, 2018End of Document

"It's a grand engineering challenge."WHY DOES QUANTUM COMPUTING NEED FEDERAL SUPPORT?Monroe is among quantum leaders from academia and industry who gathered in Washington on Monday with officials from the White House science office. Some federal agencies, including the departments of defense and energy, already have longstanding quantum research efforts, but advocates are pushing for more coordination among those agencies and greater collaboration with the private sector."The technology that underlies this area comes from some pretty weird stuff that we professors are used to at the university," said Monroe, who is also the founder of quantum startup IonQ, which floats individual atoms in a vacuum chamber and points lasers to control them. But he said corporate investment can be risky because of the technical challenges and the long wait for a commercial payoff."The infrastructure required, the hardware, the personnel, is way too expensive for anyone to go in it alone," said Prineha Narang, a Harvard University assistant professor of computational materials science.By investing more in basic discovery and training - as the House-passed National Quantum Initiative Act would do - Narang said the U.S. could expand the ranks of scientists and engineers who build quantum computers and then find commercial applications for them.WHAT ARE THE INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS?The potential economic benefits have won bipartisan support for the initiative, which is estimated to cost about $1.3 billion in its first five years. Also pushing action on Capitol Hill is a belief that if the U.S. doesn't adopt a unified strategy, it could one day be overtaken by other countries."China has publicly stated a national goal of surpassing the U.S. during the next decade," said Texas Republican Rep. Lamar Smith, chairman of the House science, space and technology committee, as he urged his colleagues on the House floor to support the bill to "preserve America's dominance in the scientific world."Smith said he expects the Senate will pass a companion bill before the end of the year.Load-Date: September 25, 2018End of Document

Apple soars but energy, industrial stocks weigh on marketAssociated Press InternationalAugust 1, 2018 Wednesday 9:17 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; Financial MarketsLength: 857 wordsByline: By MARLEY JAY, AP Markets WriterDateline: NEW YORK BodyNEW YORK (AP) - Apple surged to its biggest gain in a year and a half Wednesday and drew closer to $1 trillion in value after it reported stronger iPhone sales and rising prices. But losses for energy and industrial companies left major stock indexes lower.Already the most valuable company in the U.S., Apple was the biggest gainer of any S&P 500 stock Wednesday and the technology giant finished at another record high.That made up for a lot of losses elsewhere in the market. Investors sold industrial stocks following reports that the Trump administration is considering a higher tax rate on Chinese imports. Energy and materials companies fell with the price of oil, and metals and car companies also declined.After the close of trading, the administration said it might put a 25 percent tax on $200 billion in imports from China. It proposed a 10 percent tax in July, shortly after it placed a 25 percent tax on $34 billion worth of imports. China again threatened to retaliate.China can't match the size of the tariffs the U.S. could put on Chinese exports. But Katie Nixon, chief investment officer for Northern Trust Wealth Management, said the Chinese government is already reacting to the new tariffs and the larger proposed ones by pumping more money into the economy and weakening its currency."They're sending a strong signal that they cannot just withstand (tariffs), but they can manage through a period of turmoil related to the negotiations," Nixon said.The S&P 500 index slid 2.93 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,813.36. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 81.37 points, or 0.3 percent, to 25,333.82.The Nasdaq composite added 35.50 points, or 0.5 percent, to 7,707.29, but the Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks lost 1.54 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,669.26. Almost two-thirds of the stocks on the New York Stock Exchange traded lower.The S&P 500 index rose 3.6 percent in July in spite of the trade war between the U.S. and China. The markets got a lift from strong company earnings as well as efforts by the U.S. and European Union to resolve their trade differences.As expected, the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged, but suggested it's likely to raise rates again in September. High-dividend stocks like consumer products makers sank as bond yields increased. Automakers fell as they reported their monthly sales and Ferrari plunged after it said it might not make some of the profit goals laid out by Sergio Marchionne, its late former CEO.Apple said the average selling price for the iPhone jumped 20 percent in its latest quarter and its third-quarter profit and sales both surpassed analyst projections. Apple's third fiscal quarter is usually its weakest. The company's forecast for fourth-quarter revenue also topped Wall Street estimates.Apple surged 5.9 percent to $201.50. That gives the company a value of $973 billion, based on its latest quarterly filing.The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged and suggested it plans to keep raising rates as long as the economy stays healthy. The central bank noted the labor market continues to get stronger and the economy is growing at a strong clip, while inflation has reached its target of 2 percent a year.Automakers mostly slid. Ferrari dropped 11 percent to $118 after new CEO Louis Camilleri warned that the company might not be able to reach the revenue targets outlined by Marchionne.Industrial companies changed course again and took sharp losses.Bond prices sank. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 3 percent from 2.96 percent.Higher yields force interest rates on mortgages and other loans higher, making it more profitable for banks to lend money. However rising yields drew investors to bonds and away from high-dividend stocks like consumer goods makers.SodaStream jumped 26.3 percent to $110.30 after the maker of beverage carbonation systems raised its annual forecasts following a strong quarterly report. Clothing maker Hanesbrands plunged 19.3 percent to $17.96 after it posted a smaller-than-expected profit and said Target won't renew a contract for an exclusive line of Champion clothing when the deal expires in January 2020.Benchmark U.S. crude dropped 2 percent to $67.66 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, fell 2.5 percent to $72.39 per barrel in London.Wholesale gasoline sank 1.7 percent to $2.05 a gallon. Heating oil gave up 1.9 percent to $2.10 a gallon. Natural gas dipped 0.9 percent to $2.76 per 1,000 cubic feet.The price of gold gave up 0.5 percent to $1,227.60 an ounce. Silver fell 0.7 percent to $15.45 an ounce and copper plunged 3 percent to $2.75 a pound.The dollar fell to 111.56 yen from 111.83 yen. The euro slipped to $1.1664 from $1.1697.Britain's FTSE 100 dropped 1.2 percent and Germany's DAX fell 0.5 percent. The French CAC 40 dipped 0.2 percent.Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.9 percent and South Korea's Kospi added 0.5 percent. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index dropped 0.9 percent.____AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at            https://apnews.com/search/marley%20jayLoad-Date: August 2, 2018End of Document

China&#39;s military presence in Latin AmericaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 2, 2018 SundayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1450 wordsBody        For 17 months, a space base has been operating in the Argentine Patagonia, a mound of 450 tons built on a 200-hectare land granted to the PRC army for 50 years without paying rent. The military complex with an investment of $ 70 million began operating in March of last year as a control for satellites and space missions.  "The space base is one of the most striking symbols of the strategy that Beijing has been implementing for some time to transform Latin America and shape the future of the region, often through maneuvers that directly undermine the political, economic and strategic power of United States in the region, "The New York Times said in an extensive article published a few weeks ago.  The station and its spatial monitoring system 24 hours a day -criticized as a way to cede Argentine sovereignty- will play an essential role in the expedition planned by China to the farthest side of the Moon. Beijing sent a satellite to space last May as part of its lunar project.  If the mission is successful, whose launch is scheduled for later this year, it will be a milestone in space exploration and is likely to chart the way for the extraction of helium-3 gas, considered the clean energy of the future. Nuclear fusion between a ton of helium-3 and a half-ton of deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen found in abundance in nature, is equivalent to burning about 15 million tons of oil. While currently one ton of oil costs about $ 560, helium-3 is estimated at $ 1 billion. According to US scientists, available reserves of helium-3 on the Moon could provide power for at least 5,000 years.  The space base is part of the deep space network, a set of communication facilities to support Chinese operations beyond the Earth, the new scenario to compete strategically with the United States.  The base, on the other hand, has a geographical position facing the Atlantic and against Antarctica, a continent in which China has the largest scientific base in the world. Antarctica is a very strategic area for Beijing given its abundance of natural resources, beyond hydrocarbons and mining.  The station was secretly negotiated with the previous Argentine government, desperate to attract Chinese capital, which allowed Beijing to improve its capabilities to gather information in the hemisphere, fueling a debate about the risks and benefits of letting itself be dragged into its orbit.  The technology employed in that station has many strategic uses. Frank A. Rose, assistant secretary of state for arms control, told the Times that in recent years China has developed sophisticated technology to interfere, alter and destroy satellites.  "A giant antenna is like a huge vacuum cleaner," said Dean Cheng, who worked as a researcher in the US Congress and now studies China's national security policy. "It sucks signals, information, all kinds of things," Cheng said, quoted by the New York newspaper.  In this way, China's space station in Argentina becomes a symbol of the power of the Asian giant in Latin America. "Beijing has transformed the dynamics of the region, from the agendas of its leaders and businessmen to the structure of its economies, the content of its policy and even its security dynamics," he told the New York newspaper R. Evan Ellis, professor of Studies Latin Americans of the Superior School of War of the United States Army.  China has articulated a sustainable and far-reaching invasion in Latin America. The strategy includes an overwhelming expansion of its trade, rescue ofindebted governments, construction of huge infrastructure projects, strengthen military ties and ensure immeasurable amounts of natural resources - given the voracious appetite for oil, iron, soy and copper - which has sealed the fate of many countries in the region attached to the Chinese imperial quadriga.  It is not surprising, then, that since governments in the region have adopted their policies to satisfy Chinese demands, that expanding power has consolidated its role as a central actor in Latin America in the long term and in a decisive way. As he has plenty of money, he has found the formula of disbursing billions of dollars in loans to put the region in its orbit and guarantee a preponderant place while hiding its imperialist objectives in the subcontinent.  The warning lights went on in the Pentagon, according to the Times, when in October 2015, the Ministry of Defense of China received senior military officers from 11 Latin American countries in an almost two-week forum on defense logistics that was titled : 'Strengthen the understanding and cooperate for mutual benefit'.  As a preliminary step, China had donated military equipment to the Colombian army and organized joint military training exercises and naval operations on the coasts of Brazil and Chile. China has also sold military equipment to Argentina, Bolivia, Peru and Venezuela.  'Beijing has transformed the dynamics of the region, from the agendas of its leaders and businessmen to the structure of its economies, the content of its policy and even its security dynamics',  R. EVAN ELLIS HIGHER SCHOOL OF WAR OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY  "If we talk about the world of 2049, from the perspective of Latin America, China will undoubtedly have surpassed the United States in terms of absolute power and size. Frankly, if it were a sustained conflict, it would reach a point where there could be no denying the possibility of Chinese forces operating military bases in the region, "Ellis said.  The first Chinese military base outside its borders was established in July last year in Djibouti, a minuscule French excolony in north-eastern Africa - where it has invested $ 15,000 million - at the entrance of the Red Sea and the Suez Canal where 50% passes of your maritime trade.  To ensure the security of its huge global economic expansion, China also plans to build a military base in the Pakistani port of Gwadar. In this project, according to the South China Morning Post, the Chinese interest in having an alternative route for the entry of oil coming from the Persian Gulf and to prevent any other maritime power from blocking the Strait of Malacca in Sumatra was decisive.  The base would be built in the Arabian Sea, of great geostrategic importance for being key in the economic corridor of China and Pakistan and for the relevance of the initiative to connect the trade of the Asian giant with Africa and Europe.  "The Chinese naval flotilla patrolling the Gulf of Aden, in addition to the warships that escort their oil tankers across the Indian Ocean, need a naval base to be given logistical support and maintenance," he told the South China Morning Post. the military analyst Zhou Chenming.  China has also advanced plans to build near its border a military base in Wakhan, in northeastern Afghanistan, where witnesses, quoted by the AFP news agency, reported seeing Chinese and Afghan soldiers conducting joint patrols. The project stems from Beijing's concerns over the expansion of the Islamic State into Afghan territory and by combatants returning to Chinese territory from Iraq and Syria.  'We can not focus only on what they do inEurope or in the South China Sea. Here, much closer to the United States, there is also competition. This is a struggle for influence, and the most important thing we can do is fight, "US Admiral Kurt Tidd told the Times.  The Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Basin, including Venezuela, is the focus of the world's largest oil reserves, in addition to the Panama Canal, an important interoceanic artery, where China has its sights set and has proposed to finance the fourth set of locks to undermine the American domain.  It has also offered incentives for the creation of new bioceanic corridors to improve trade. That is part of the Chinese project to include Latin America in the new Silk Road, the ambitious infrastructure investment project in the corridor that goes from South Asia to Eastern Europe and Africa.  Beyond any strategic dispute with the United States, the concern of some regional leaders is that previous governments have tied the destiny of their countries to China with huge debts and are mortgaging the future of their nations.  Gustavo Cardozo, analyst at the Argentine Center for International Studies, has joined the voices that perceive that China is using the weakest flanks of the countries of the region to achieve a leading role. "This is going to increase in the future because it has sovereign funds to invest and because it has an interest in Latin America that does not show any other extra-continental power. I think that in a few years, in a decade, it will be something totally visible, "he warned. Load-Date: September 2, 2018End of Document

Measures taken by the Chinese government for development of yachting as a recreational activity as well as development of marinas in coastal regions have boosted the growth of the Chinese leisure boat market.Further key findings from the report suggest:· Leisure boats are projected to witness a strong demand owing to changing economic situations and rise in consumer disposable income across the world· Sports yachts are expected to record a high demand in developed countries owing to active participation of people in recreational boating activities and marine sporting events· Implementation of IoT technologies, GPS mapping, and smart sensors in boats increases safety and security of the boat, which, in turn, is expected to increase demand for recreational boats over the forecast period· Boat manufacturers are focusing on promotional activities and boating events to attract more buyers in many developed as well as developing countries· In 2016, North America dominated the global market in terms of revenue and was valued at USD 16.60 billion· Key players in the market include Avon Marine; Azimut Benetti S.p.A.; Baja Marine; Bavaria Yachtbau GmbH; Bombardier Recreational Products (BRP) Inc.; Brunswick Corporation; and Chaparral Boats, Inc.Download the full report:           https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/5479680AboutReportbuyerReportbuyer is a leading industry intelligence solution that provides all market research reports from top publishersFor more information:Sarah SmithResearch Advisor at Reportbuyer.comEmail:sarah@reportbuyer.comTel: +1 (718) 213 4904Website:           http://www.reportbuyer.com View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-global-leisure-boat-market-size-is-anticipated-to-reach-usd-51-37-billion-by-2025--300688449.htmlSOURCE ReportBuyerLoad-Date: July 31, 2018End of Document

Her forced solitude was an emblem of Chinese cruelty toward a wife whose husband was ripped away from her for the crime of expressing his views, and then--nearly exactly a year ago--allowed to die in prison while denied access to potentially lifesaving medical treatment abroad.PEN America's members and supporters, working in solidarity with writers and readers all over the world, have campaigned relentlessly for Liu Xia's freedom throughout her confinement through letters, postcards, petitions, live protests, social media campaigns, videos, the distribution of her poems, and readings of her work."She has never been far from our thoughts, including this spring when dozens of artists and writers joined in literary solidarity with Liu Xia. Her release is a testament to the power of collective voices being raised in support of those who others would brutalize into silence. We commend the leadership of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her government for their role in demanding her freedom. We call on the Chinese Government to permit Liu Xia's brother, Liu Hui, to travel freely and to release all other political prisoners."Contact: Summer Lopez, senior director for free expression programs, slopez@pen.orgCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6363986 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: July 11, 2018End of Document

Electronic Security Market Outlook to 2024: Top Companies, Trends & Growth Factors Details for Business DevelopmentiCrowdNewswire (English)July 10, 2018 Tuesday 12:02 PM GMTCopyright 2018 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1268 wordsBody                   Global Electronic Security Market: get comprehensive research offering detailed regional analysis and growth outlook in a new report now available at Marketstudyreport.com.

Continue reading Electronic Security Market Outlook to 2024: Top Companies, Trends & Growth Factors Details for Business DevelopmentGlobal Electronic Security Market: get comprehensive research offering detailed regional analysis and growth outlook in a new report now available at Marketstudyreport.com.The state and central governments of various countries are placing high focus on the development and adoption of advanced systems in high-traffic locations such as public roads, transit stations, and malls, contributing to the growth of the electronic security market. For instance, the Indian government in 2014 set up a USD 125 million fund solely devoted to the prevention of sexual violence among women through the installation of security equipment such as surveillance systems at high-risk public locations. These hardware systems are equipped with video analytics and advanced algorithms that allow the detection of criminals. Furthermore, technological advancements have also aided in the improvement of existing technologies such as high-resolution 4k cameras and IP surveillance units. Electronic Security Market size is set to exceed USD 60 billion by 2024; according to a new research report.Request a discount on standard prices of this premium report athttps://www.marketstudyreport.com/check-for-discount/668596Crime rates across the world are heavily impacted with the rising penetration of these systems in residential and commercial settings and is anticipated to drive the electronic security market growth. End-users across the world are replacing conventional security systems such as guards and physical body checks with high-tech solutions. Physical body checks in malls and airports can be cumbersome and increase customer discomfort, primarily among women. X-ray body scanners, on the contrary, requires the person to pass through an electronic frame.The rising trend of the development of smart cities in countries such as China and India is contributing to the high growth of the electronic security market. For instance, the Chinese government has undertaken large construction projects for the development of smart cities imbued with advanced security solutions in cities such as Dalian, Hangzhou, Nanjing, and Tianjin. The rise in traveler population across the world is also leading to the growth of the electronic security market.The surveillance and alert system market is anticipated to exhibit substantial growth during the forecast timeframe. The reduction in component and raw material costs is contributing to the decline in the electronic security market price trend. Remote monitoring systems are increasingly finding application in developed regions such as U.S and Western Europe. Installing a home security solution with remote monitoring capabilities allows the homeowner to access security cameras and video units situated inside the residential location in real-time.Public-sector applications are the largest revenue-generating segment. Various government bodies are making use of advanced solutions for surveillance and criminal detection applications. For instance, in September 2017, a police department in Arkansas was reported to be using drones for highly specialized missions such as the tracking of a suspect or obtaining an inside view and additional information in a hostage situation.Request a sample of this premium report athttps://www.marketstudyreport.com/request-a-sample/668596The North America electronic security market is projected to dominate the global business landscape owing to the government initiatives to integrate these systems into their public safety segment. For instance, the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 contains provisions to make the unmanned aerial systems (UAS) licensing process easier and quicker for law enforcement officials. Various U.S states are currently conducting trial operations on drones to understand their capabilities and their operational efficiency.Players operating in the global electronic security market include Axis Communications, BOSCH Security Systems, Hitachi Ltd, OSI Systems, Inc., SDMS Security Products UK Ltd., Siemens AG, MilliVision Technologies, ASSA ABLOY, Scanna MSC Ltd., Thales Group, RedXDefense LLC, etc. Industry players conduct strategic moves such as mergers and acquisitions to sustain growth. For instance, in July 2017, Assa Abloy announced the acquisition of Arjo Systems SAS to strengthen their physical and digital identity solution provisions.Major Points in Table of ContentsChapter 1.

The phenomenon, they say, is fostering some unhealthy ideas about what we really see in the mirror -- and on our phones.911 calls on black people are a new twist on something oldAs stories of 911 calls on black people ricochet across the media, it seems at times that a quickly mutating form of racial profiling is taking hold of White America. But historians say this behavior isn't anything new. It's a modern version of something that happened decades ago: white flight.The making of 'Notorious RBG'Ruth Bader Ginsburg was rejected by prestigious judicial clerkships and spurned by law firms early in her career. Now she's marking 25 years on the Supreme Court. Here's how she became a phenomenon.'This is China ... leave immediately'High above one of the most hotly contested regions in the world, CNN was given a rare look at the Chinese government's rapidly expanding militarization of the South China Sea. During the flight on a US Navy plane, Chinese military repeatedly warned the crew, telling them they were inside Chinese territory and urging them to leave.She's a war hero leading a new wave of veteran candidatesMJ Hegar served in the US Air Force. She has a Purple Heart and has tattoos covering her battle scars. One of many veterans running for Congress as Democrats in the 2018 midterms, she's now battling to flip a Texas district blue.Not your traditional island retreatThere's nowhere for visitors to stay on this jam-packed Colombian island that's about the size of two football fields. There are no police, and the colorful houses are passed down through generations, so there are no non-native residents. And the locals wouldn't have it any other way.In their own words: Charlottesville, one year laterBefore August 11 and 12, 2017, Charlottesville was, for those who knew of it at all, a college town or a weekend getaway from Washington, DC. Now it's a national wound for many Americans. CNN Opinion asked the people who call Charlottesville home to share their memories of last year's events and their reflections on the year since.Load-Date: August 11, 2018End of Document

United States from its infantry, telecommunications operators; Europe divided between Nordic and Central European, slow, obsessed with regulating everything, without local digital winner; and Asia as a whole, led by China, South Korea, Japan and their generals in person. The alliances between technological companies, the mergers among operators, the competition between them, the international debate on the technological norm, the fight for frequencies and geopolitics between countries and regions, indicate that we are about to observe the arrival of a disruptive technology, capable of to deliver value to society, companies, governments, citizens and telecommunications operators. Ten years ago, several of these companies were among the largest in the world, today its value pales in comparison with a sector 10 times larger. A quick story: 1G, your mobile voice call; 2G, mobile call, more SMS messages; 3G, the above plus email; 4G mobile broadband and remarkable speeds to download video; and 5G, essentially means 4K video and connectivity to everything (Internet of Things). By 2023, 73% of the network will be video and will support artificial intelligence, virtual reality, augmented, big data analysis, cities, home and car connected: extreme convergence. But we will know it as one of the fastest and most powerful technologies in the history of mankind. That means a collapsing impact on economic structures: how we produce, consume, live, work and analyze information. Companies and governments will be more efficient. Nordic countries. The first ministers of the Nordic region sign an agreement to achieve the early adoption of 5G technology in Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Norway and Iceland. Asia. The ICT ministers of South Korea, China and Japan will work together in the commercialization of 5G and in the discovery of newservices. The Chinese Government announces the possibility of merging China Unicom and China Telecom to generate 5G market scale, there will be 2 operators. Europe without fiber and wants more operators. Technology. Nokia, Ericsson and Intel announce strategic alliance for the development of technology, in response to China's Huawei. U.S. AT & T eats Warner, Verizon, Sprint-Tmobile (merged) promise the best 5G. Spain tenders spectrum, Italy at the door, Mexico reserves spectrum and expects to assign it. Spectral politics in Chile collapses. In this fight there is no space for small, local companies, or independent telecom services. Consolidation, new investments and integration of services are the correct route. Should a regulator take sides with a company? No. Should a regulator promote mergers or consolidations? No. The power of the regulator is superior, since by regulating it allows conducts, the generation of new services and innovation. He does not have to issue instructions, he points out opportunities; does not sympathize with any regulated, empathizes horizons; it does not indicate investments, nor does it punish them; does not propose to package services, but recognizes its value released to the user. Exciting moment of history. Director of Grupo Mediatelecom @fernegretep       Load-Date: September 17, 2018End of Document

Commercial tensions weigh on Wall Street, but not too muchCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 8, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 341 wordsBody Wall Street lived today a day without a clear course, with the trade war between the US and China pushing the market down, but not enough to make forget the strength of the US economy.  At the end of the day, the Industrial Dow Jones gave 0.18%, while the broader S & P 500 remained almost flat, with a slight decline of 0.03%.  The technology Nasdaq, meanwhile, endured in green and advanced 0.06% at the close.  The day was marked by a new episode in the commercial fight between Washington and Beijing, after the Chinese government announced tariffs of 25% to a new selection of imported US products worth US $ 16,000 million.  The movement came in response to a similar measure announced a day earlier by the government of Donald Trump, which continues to toughen its trade dispute with the Asian giant.  Chinese tariffs today caused setbacks in the prices of companies that depend to a large extent on their sales abroad, such as Caterpillar (-1.88%) or Boeing (-0.85%).  However, analysts still consider that the market is being able to assimilate commercial tensions without too much trouble, thanks mainly to the growth of the US economy and the good results of the companies.  "What the market is saying, and I agree, is that an increase of 24% in profits and 9% in billing has more impact than these tariffs," summed up investor Mark Esposito in statements to CNBC.  The last big company to present its quarterly accounts, Disney, did not exactly come off the year, since today it was 2.21% and led the losses among the thirty Dow Jones stocks.  Although it gained 23% more than in the same period of the previous year, the entertainment giant defrauded the investors, who expected more in terms of both profit and total billing.  Among the victims of the day were also the two major US oil companies, Chevron (-1.04%) and ExxonMobil (-0.66%), dragged down by a 3.22% retracement in the price of intermediate Texas oil ( WTI).  The entry The commercial tensions weigh on Wall Street, but not too much was first published in La Tercera. Load-Date: August 9, 2018End of Document

AT LEAST 15 WORKERS, MAOIST SUPPORTERS STILL DETAINED OVER LABOR UNION CAMPAIGNStates News ServiceSeptember 12, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 783 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Authorities in China are still holding 15 people following mass detentions of workers in the southern province of Guangdong, along with Maoist campaigners supporting their campaign for an independent trade union.Peking University graduate and former #MeToo campaigner Yue Xin remains incommunicado after being detained along with around 50 other supporters of the workers' movement at the Jasic Technology factory in Guangdong's Shenzhen city, the support campaign said in a statement posted to Github.Shang Kai, editor of the leftist website Red Reference, is currently under criminal detention in Zengcheng Detention Center in Guangdong's provincial capital Guangzhou alongside Maoist youth campaigner Yang Shaoqiang, while fellow Maoist activist Gu Jiarui is being held under "residential surveillance" in the same district.Migrant workers' rights campaigner Fu Changguo and former Jasic employees Hu Pingping and Wu Haiyu have been in the Shenzhen No. 2 Detention Center since Aug. 24, the group said, while labor rights activist Huang Guangnan has been released on "bail."Meanwhile, former Jasic workers Yu Lingcong, Mi Jiuping, Liu Penghua, and Li Zhan were all placed under formal arrest by police in the city on Sept. 3, following their initial detention at the factory on July 27, it said.Maoist campaigner Shen Mengyu, who briefly emerged as the leader of the Jasic supporters' group, has been under house arrest at her home in Yongzhou city, in the central province of Hunan.Home surroundedPolice on Tuesday surrounded Yu Lingcong's home and tried to detain his wife Huang Lanfeng, she said in a "distress call" that was posted to Twitter by the Jasic Supporters' Group."My husband is still in the detention center; he didn't get out yet," Huang says in a video message. "There are police everywhere ... and right outside the door. They just called the landlord to get them to unlock the door.""I think they're going to force their way in through the door in a minute; I will resist them all the way," said Huang, who is also a former Jasic employee.Calls to Huang's cell phone went unconnected on Wednesday, and there were no more updates from her on social media. She was briefly detained in July on suspicion of "picking quarrels and stirring up trouble" after protesting her husband's detention outside her local police station.Repeated calls to the police department in Dongguan city, where the couple were living, rang unanswered during office hours on Wednesday.A number of sources close to the Jasic campaign declined to comment when contacted by RFA on Wednesday, saying it was "inconvenient," a term often used by dissidents and rights activists to suggest they are under surveillance and monitoring.Among them was veteran Guangdong labor activist Zhang Zhiru."I'm not allowed to give interviews about the Jasic situation," Zhang said, before hanging up the phone.Widespread supportShenzhen-based migrant worker Xie Liusheng told RFA that the Jasic campaign garnered widespread support across China, and that he and many others had been called in by police or officials and warned not to take part or "pay attention" to it."This is the first time we have seen such a large movement in a number of years," Xie said. "But as soon as the workers kick up a fuss, the authorities start detaining them.""As soon as they start detaining people, the workers start to get frightened, and are forced to make concessions," he said. "They have no way to follow up."Xie, a veteran workers' rights campaigner, said the Shenzhen police had sought him out and warned him not to take part.In neighboring Hong Kong, the Confederation of Trade Unions has launched a solidarity campaign with the Jasic workers and their supporters, calling on unions around the world, including the ruling Chinese Communist Party's All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) to support the workers and students.HKCTU organizing secretary Lam Cho-ming said the group had had difficulty getting hold of the right documentary evidence to back up a formal complaint to the International Labor Organization (ILO)."In 2015, when they were arresting workers in Guangdong, we successfully filed a complaint with the International Labor Organization to complain that the Chinese government had violated their freedom of association," Lam told RFA."I had hoped we could follow the same plan this time, but most of the key workers' representatives have been arrested this time," he said."We have experienced some difficulty in collecting evidence and collecting information."Reported by Wen Yuqing for RFA's Cantonese Service.

The FBI Around the WorldTargeted News ServiceJuly 11, 2018 Wednesday 8:09 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 5440 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe U.S. Department of State issued the following foreign press center briefing:MODERATOR: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for waiting. We are very, very pleased today to have this briefing by FBI Assistant Director for International Operations Mr. George Piro about the FBI's international cooperation overseas.Just to quickly review the ground rules, we are off camera in its entirety so no stills or video, please, but recording is fine including for broadcast. And I'd also ask you, please, to observe an embargo until the end of the briefing.Assistant Director Piro's been with the bureau since 1999. His full bio was attached to our announcement and he'll give you an introduction to the FBI's overseas operations which assist international law enforcement partners in conducting joint investigations and sharing information around persistent global threats.For other questions that may arise that might be outside of that lane, you can certainly contact me or one of my colleagues, and this is a veteran crowd, so I obviously don't need to remind any of you that U.S. law enforcement agencies don't discuss ongoing or potential investigations under any circumstances.And with that, let me please turn it over to Assistant Director Piro.MR PIRO: Good morning and Benjamin, thank you for that introduction and for this wonderful opportunity to speak with all of you. This is very exciting for us and what I'm hoping to accomplish today is to give you kind of an overview regarding our international operations mission and the FBI's efforts in our international program and then take all of your questions after that.I just want to kind of share with you the history of our international mission and then our efforts today and then some of the successes that we have had. As Benjamin mentioned, I represent the International Operations Division, which is the cornerstone of the FBI's international mission. It is comprised of FBI agents that are - and professional staff that are stationed overseas, that focus on building partnerships with our foreign law enforcement, security, and intelligence partners to combat crime and mitigate threats both nationally and internationally.As some of you may know, our program is focused or is based on what we call the FBI legal attache program. That is our folks that are assigned overseas and they serve as our primary liaison representatives with our foreign partners. They work very closely with our - with the host countries in conducting joint investigations and sharing information and intelligence on global threats like counterterrorism and cyber crime.Our LEGATs have an esteemed past. The program was actually created in 1940 in the early days of World War II, just before the United States entered the World War II in 1941. At the time, President Franklin Roosevelt issued an order for agencies to assist in the intelligence collection war efforts based on the threat that was posed by the axis powers. So the FBI responded to that request and began to station undercover agents around Latin and Central America and developed or created the Special Intelligence Service. Our first post was in 1941 in Bogota, Colombia, and that really launched our international program. At that time, of course, we were sharing information with countries that we were cooperating with in regards to the Nazi threat that the United States was facing. As you can imagine, our international operations looks very different today than World War II, but the program continues to advance.Years ago, the law enforcement focus was really on crimes that were affected or that were occurring within each country's borders. That mindset is no longer conceivable. As journalists, you all know firsthand that globalization combined with the incredible advances in technology, travel, commerce, and most importantly, communication has broken down those barriers and, really, borders. As a result, threats have become much more global and the need for better cooperation, information sharing, and engagement is critical for agencies and countries, really, to better address these global threats.Never before has it been so easy for terrorists, human traffickers, malicious cyber actors, and other criminals and adversaries to take advantage of technology and a more global community to do harm. For example, gangs like MS-13 doesn't operate in just one city or region anymore. They have become a global presence. Illicits - illicit drugs like fentanyl no longer require an in-person purchase since they are readily available on the darknet. So things like that - human trafficking, especially as it pertains to children - has become a global threat and requires a global response or an approach.So the FBI puts a significant effort and resources towards its international presence to better work with law enforcement around the world to try to address those global threats. The FBI has 63 legal attache offices and 27 sub-offices in key cities around the world. Combined, those offices provide coverage for over 200 countries, territories, and islands.In addition to that, we have actually built on that capability and assigned or developed specialties within those offices to include, for example, cyber assistant legal attaches that promote the FBI's cyber efforts with our foreign partners around the world, counterterrorism ALATs, counter - or criminal investigative, and weapons of mass destruction ALATs that are posted around the world to really try to advance and cooperate with our foreign partners to address those specific threats or issues that are - all of our countries are facing.So these relationships are critical for our success. We recognize that information sharing, intelligence sharing, and joint efforts or operations are the key to our success. And those - having our folks overseas increases our ability to collaborate and allow for a robust information sharing not only with our foreign partners, but really with the private industry or the private sector which is sometimes key for our success. By increasing our international footprint we've been able to develop long-lasting relationships with our foreign partners and our - and has really paid dividends for all of us combined.An area that we invest significantly in is training and exchanges. We in the FBI recognize how important it is for information sharing but also for sharing of best practices, trainings, lessons learned - not only from our perspective but gaining that from our foreign partners. So as a result, through the Department of Justice as well as the State Department, the FBI hosts or participates in a significant number of international training around the world. We invite foreign officers to attend the FBI's National Academy, a 10-week program at Quantico that's really designed to improve the administrative - administration of justice and police departments not only here in the United States, but really globally. And it allows those law enforcement officers to share information, build a better network, as well as identify best practices.We also, of course, participate in the International Law Enforcement Academy, a multi-nation and national effort organized by the U.S. Government and play a key role in promoting and providing valuable training to our foreign partners, everything from public corruption, crime scene investigation, to cybercrime.That training and that exchange really is the main effort that leads to the successes that we have. Just for example, last year the FBI hosted over 1,000 exchanges here in the United States with our foreign partners. But some of the successes that has resulted from those exchanges, from the training and the partnerships, for example, the FBI works very closely with law enforcement agencies in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras through the Transnational Anti-Gang Task Force to combat the violent gang problem in the Northern Triangle caused by MS-13 and the 18th Street gangs. Through that task force the FBI has assisted our partners in various operations to arrest violent gang members, the most recent which was this last April and led to the arrest of 629 MS-13 and 18th Street gang members.Two weeks ago, our office in Mexico City, in coordination with our FBI office in El Paso and Mexican authorities, successfully captured Eduardo Ravelo in Mexico. Ravelo was the leader of the Barrio Azteca crime enterprise and was involved in numerous murders, assaults, and kidnappings, as well as extortion, money laundering, and drug trafficking. He was key for us because he was responsible for the 2010 murder of a U.S. consulate employee in Juarez who was four months pregnant at the time of her murder. She also had her nine-month-old daughter with her at the time.Through our investigative efforts, our office in Mexico City was able to identify possible locations where Ravelo could be located. We shared that intelligence with our Mexican counterparts and they were able to locate and arrest Ravelo and two of his associates.Another success story I'd like to share with you is the most recent one regarding a large-scale international law enforcement effort primarily between the United States and Nigeria to dismantle a fraudulent business email compromise transactions, otherwise known as BEC, and pursue the criminals behind it. It ran from January of 2018 to early June 2018 and resulted in 74 international arrests and the disruption and recovery of approximately $14 million that was fraudulently taken from innocent victims.And that - those are just a sample of the small successes that we have internationally working with our partners and recognizing the importance and the value of the partnerships and engagement around the world.So these joint operations really send a clear message that law enforcement around the world will work together to stop criminal activity and ensure justice is served no matter where the victims are or where the perpetrators are. And we know that, in the FBI, for us to carry out our mission it requires us to work with our international partners. It's not the best option; it really is our only option. As we look at the FBI, our mission is very clear: it is to protect the American people and to uphold the U.S. Constitution. So everything we do, whether it's here domestically or internationally, is focused and driven based on that mission. So as a result we recognize we need strong relationships with our foreign partners, and we invest a significant amount of our resources and effort in building those partnerships.As I mentioned, from everything from counterterrorism, cybercrime, human trafficking, transnational organized crime, our effort continues to move forward today and will continue in the future.So that's just kind of a quick overview of the FBI's international footprint and mission, and I look forward to taking your questions.MODERATOR: Thank you very much for laying out that very broad landscape. Just to remind very quickly about our rules of procedure, please wait for the microphone and when you get it, please give your name and outlet. For our colleagues in New York, if you'd like to ask a question, please step up to the lectern and we'll identify you from there.With that, we can open for questions. Ma'am.QUESTION: Hi, morning. Estelita Carazzai from Brazilian newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo. I have two questions regarding Latin America basically. First, what role does corruption investigations play in your division? Is this a concern? It's a critical issue in Latin America currently, and I would like to know how involved is FBI with those investigations, if they're - you're supporting law enforcement agencies in these countries.And second, about terrorism in Latin America, how concerned is FBI with terrorism activities in Latin America? I know you can't comment on ongoing investigations, but if you could just let us know if - especially in the border of Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina, there is a lot of talk about this. If you could just tell what is - what are - are you actually looking at there?MR PIRO: Okay. I'll take the second part first.QUESTION: Okay.MR PIRO: Terrorism is the FBI's number-one priority, not only here domestically but internationally, and we work very, very closely with all of our international partners in sharing information, intelligence, to try to identify threats as early as possible and then coming up with joint efforts to try to disrupt or prevent terrorist attacks or incidents around the world. We recognize that our ability to protect, as I mentioned, our mission, the American people, we have to be, in a sense, as engaged and as forward-leaning as possible to try to identify threats as early as possible, again, giving us the most opportunity to try to prevent those.We are concerned regarding the terrorism threat, really, in every region in the world. The terrorism threat affects all of us and it is an issue that is really impacting every region, whether we're talking about the Middle East as a result of what is occurring there. We, of course, have seen what has occurred in Europe the last few years, and unfortunately, in Latin and Central America. So we are proactive in that regard. We share our intelligence and information. We work very closely with our partners. As you mentioned, I can't talk about specific investigations or ongoing operations. But it is our number-one priority; it is something that we are focused on. We work very, very closely with our partners there. We do joint exercises, training, those kinds of things to really build up not only our capacity but our partners' capacity, and we have done several of those in Latin and Central America. Again, because anything that affects that region is going to eventually affect the United States, and we recognize that and invest a lot of effort into that.In regards to your first - the first part of the question, public corruption or corruption in general, it is a top priority within the FBI, both here domestically and internationally. Of course, domestically we look at it - or our role is somewhat different. Internationally, our effort, it is to provide - whether it's training, expertise, assistance to further ongoing corruption investigations, as well as independently whenever we have a matter that we have identified and falls into what we call our Foreign Corruption Practices Act that we are able then to lead those investigative efforts.We have a significant effort and initiatives going in Latin and Central America. Again, I can't go into specific cases, but we are working very, very closely in that regard. We recognize that nothing erodes public confidence and public trust in government institutions like corruption, so it is imperative that we promote - not only here domestically but internationally - the importance of a objective, independent investigative effort that deals with corruption. Again, going back to it being objective, independent, for it to be successful and for it to be embraced by people.QUESTION: Thank you. Dmitry Kirsanov with TASS. Sir, I was hoping you could speak a little to your cooperations - cooperation with the Russians. Does it even exist at this point because of the current political climate? And specifically, I mean, I don't want to - I'm not asking you to get into the specifics, but could you say whether or not you interact regarding the FIFA World Cup that is taking place right now in Russia? And finally, how did that happen that it was you who interrogated Saddam? Could you talk about that a bit? (Laughter.)MR PIRO: Okay. Actually in this one, your first question is easier than your second question. In regards to our cooperation with our Russian counterparts, we actually do have an office in Moscow. We have personnel assigned there. And I am pleased to tell you we have been cooperating and collaborating with our Russian counterparts, specifically as it relates to the World Cup. As you're probably aware, one of the largest attendees or purchasers of tickets to the World Cup were Americans. And as I mentioned, our missions is to protect the American people. That doesn't - that's not limited to just here in the United States. That's - in a sense, that's globally. So we have been working very closely sharing intelligence and information. We've had folks in Moscow working with our counterparts leading up and during the FIFA World Cup prepared to support and provide any assistance or information that is developed real-time to our counterparts so that they are able to address any potential threats to the events, to the venues, things like that.So we have actually been working very closely with our counterparts.QUESTION: Did you have to expand your LEGAT's office in Moscow to do that, or it stayed the same?MR PIRO: We actually expanded our office for the period during the World Cup, just so that we are in a better position to support and assist our counterparts so that we are able to provide the type of assistance that our counterparts would want or seek from us.QUESTION: And the last question?MR PIRO: The last question, I'll be honest with you, I didn't realize I was even being considered for that assignment. I just got a call that said, "You have just been selected to interrogate Saddam Hussein." So you can imagine my shock and surprise at that.Several key factors that led the FBI in its selection. Of course, Saddam Hussein only spoke Arabic, so the interrogator had to be able to speak Arabic for the interrogator to have any chance of success. At that time I happened to be one of 12, so you could see how my chances dramatically increased at that point. And other factors. I had already been to Iraq; I was part of the FBI's first team to deploy into Iraq during the war, so I had an understanding of the regime, the history of the Ba'ath party, Saddam Hussein, things like that, and probably a few other key factors. But as I mentioned, I didn't realize - I just got the call and went off.MODERATOR: Take one question for now, ma'am. Yes.QUESTION: Okay. Thank you. Welcome, sir, to FPC. It's great to have you here. I am Kanwal (inaudible). I represent Pakistani print media Daily Ausaf. Okay, I have one question - several, but they said just one. So FBI has zero tolerance on child pornography within America. But - and FBI takes very strict actions on child predators. In Pakistan there is a city near Lahore - Kasur. It's full of this menace and dirt. Recently a seven-year-old girl was gangraped, and lot of UN cry was raised all over Pakistan under justice for Zainab. So would you like your international team to respond to such things?And secondly, FBI has - is doing a lot of amazing work on community outreach within America. So would you like to have some cross-country program with Pakistani schools, like appointing junior special agents? And I'm willing to volunteer if you need any kind of service for it. (Laughter.) Thank you.MR PIRO: Okay. In regards to the incident that you had - that you brought up, the FBI is aware, the International Operations Division is aware of that and we are actually sending folks to assist and provide best practices. We are sending experts in our Crimes Against Children program, and we're confident that that exchange will assist and - not only the investigation but prevent future incidents from occurring. And that is a horrific - as you mentioned, here in the United States we consider that a horrific crime, and you're right, we have a zero tolerance for that here in the United States.So we are prepared to support and share our best practices, investigative efforts, techniques, things like that to our foreign partners. In these types of incidents where the FBI or the United States may not necessarily have jurisdiction, we are prepared to support our foreign partners if they ask for our assistance and support. And that is - that's what kind of triggers or initiates the mechanism for the FBI to provide - whether it's a technical support expertise, subject matter expertise, or things like that, it would require the foreign partner to ask for our assistance, and we will provide that.The second part of your question - we do invest quite a bit into our community efforts. It is - it's a key part of the FBI's mission, because again, we recognize it is imperative that the communities that we serve has the trust and confidence in the FBI which is critical for us to carry out our mission. So the efforts that we do in schools, other programs like our Citizens Academy and things like that, are a cornerstone of our community outreach, and it is designed to really give the community an opportunity to see what the FBI represents, who makes up the FBI, which is really part of the same community, and the commitment of the fine men and women of the FBI.Now, we have shared some of those best practices or some of those events with our foreign partners, but you have to also remember cultures are different. What necessarily works in the United States may not work in other regions. While we're prepared to, again, share our best practices and things that we do, it is critical for the - for our foreign partners to recognize what would be valuable in their country and kind of look to see what would be - what would resonate with communities there and things like that, again, because cultures are different.MODERATOR: Back and then come back up front. Sir.QUESTION: Hi, my name is Ragip Soylu, I'm working for Turkish newspaper Sabah. As you know, recently there has been a lot of tensions between Turkey and the United States, especially concerning a court case in New York, and Turkish official directly targeted FBI in their remarks. What do you think - do you still have a working relationship with Turkish officials about - from counterterrorism, the other issues? How would you describe the state of the relations? Was there any impact on those kind of tensions to your relationship? Thank you.MR PIRO: We absolutely value our partnership and cooperation with our Turkish counterparts. We actually have an office in Turkey and work very, very closely with, again, our counterparts there. Turkey is a strategic partner for the United States, and more importantly for the FBI as we deal with issues, as you mentioned, counterterrorism. At the working level, that is the one nice thing about the field that we're in, the - the mission kind of drives the relationship and the value of the relationship. So at the working level we work very, very well, tremendous cooperation, mutual respect and commitment. And for us, we continue to put a lot of value and commitment to that partnership.MODERATOR: Sir in the gray jacket.QUESTION: Thank you so much, sir. Sir, this is Jahanzaib Ali, I'm correspondent for Pakistani news channel ARY News TV here. Sir, as of - today's topic is FBI around the world, so I just wanted to ask: What are the ongoing operations right now in Afghanistan and Pakistan (inaudible), because we - we are well aware that in past, FBI is involved in different investigations. So there is the biggest challenge there in the terrorism in Pakistan, Afghanistan area, so what it is going on there, where - I mean, are you involved in some ongoing investigations?Secondly, sir, about the domestic issues, FBI prevented lot of incidents of terrorism by the sting operation, we know. So are you engaged the different communities here also like the immigrants community, like the Muslims, Jews or - and other communities here who can prevent such (inaudible)? Thank you.MR PIRO: So in regards to your first question, as you can imagine, I cannot detail ongoing investigative or operational activity by the FBI in Afghanistan or Pakistan. I will tell you that we do have FBI personnel stationed around the world, including Afghanistan and Pakistan. We work very, very closely with our Pakistani counterparts, recognizing Pakistan as a key partner when it comes to our counterterrorism mission and effort in that part of the world. The majority of our effort is devoted toward counterterrorism - again, not only protecting U.S. persons, U.S. interests, our homeland here, but also providing assistance, support, engagement to our foreign partners so that they are able to also protect their homeland, their communities, their citizens, their interests. So it's a collaborative effort and we've been engaged in that partnership for years, and it's been consistent and determined. So I will tell you it will remain that way, and the FBI is committed to its mission and to its partners.In regards to here domestically, we do - as I mentioned earlier, we recognize that for us to be successful, we have to have the trust and confidence of the communities that we serve, the entire communities that we serve. We don't serve a particular community; we serve every community. We are openly engaged with our communities. We want the communities to know who we are. One of the things that we - one of our most successful community outreach program is our Citizen's Academy, where we invite members of the community to come and spend about eight weeks with the FBI, getting an overview of all of our investigative efforts, capabilities and things like that, and more importantly have the opportunity to meet and see the incredible men and women that make up the FBI and how committed, determined they are in regards to their - to the organization, to the mission and to the core values of the FBI.We have outreach in the various communities, school programs, things like that, and it's driven by every field office. We have 56 field offices around the country, so every field office has that responsibility or that mission, and they have various community efforts, community activities, events, things like that, again, because we want folks to - the folks that really matter, which is the communities that we serve, we want them to see who we are, see how committed we are and understand our core values, which have been the same for - this year is our 110th anniversary as an organization, and our core values have remained the same. They are fidelity, bravery and integrity, and every employee projects those core values and our belief - that is when folks interact with us, they see those and they gain that trust and confidence in us.MODERATOR: Far back corner, please.QUESTION: Thanks. Jennifer Chen with Shenzhen Media Group, China. I was wondering for a long time, what is a difference between the missions, domestic and overseas, between FBI and the CIA? And - yeah, sometimes - or the two organizations have some program just - collaborate or coordinate together. And also, would you like to share some light on the projects the FBI work with Chinese government recently since Trump administration? Thanks.MR PIRO: The difference between the FBI and the CIA mission overseas is very clear. So domestically, the FBI is the U.S. domestic intelligence agency. By statute is we are the U.S. domestic intelligence agency authorized to conduct intelligence efforts or - operations here domestically. Overseas, our primary function is to fulfill our both national security and our law enforcement responsibilities, and it is to foster those partnerships and relationships. The FBI works openly. Our agents are fully declared under diplomatic mission and are engaged with our - with our law enforcement, security, and intelligence partners.The CIA's mission is different. We work very closely - we collaborate with our partners over at the CIA, recognizing that we are part of the same component designed to really promote the United States mission and protect our citizens abroad and interests, but our roles and responsibilities are very different. I will leave the question to what the CIA does overseas to the CIA. I'll let you ask them that so they can give you a better answer. Ours is to advance our law enforcement and national security missions and then work openly with our foreign partners to accomplish that.In regards to your second question, again, the FBI is a national security organization, law enforcement organization. We work with our counterparts all over the world, including China, again recognizing that counterterrorism is our number one priority and then transnational organized crime, things like that. So we do have a formal relationship with our counterparts in China and we work in that regard. In regards to anything specific, I wouldn't be able to openly discuss those with you. Again, the FBI does not operate based on anything except the mission, which is protecting the American people and upholding the U.S. Constitution.MODERATOR: We had two questions - we're coming down to the wire, so two people who have been waiting. We'll go one, two, and then if we have time, we'll take one more.MR PIRO: Okay.QUESTION: Mika Jentunen from Finnish Broadcasting Company. What sort of - you talked about the cyber threats. Are there specific new threats that you're seeing around the world - out in - cyber world?MR PIRO: The cyber threats that we're seeing globally are - fall in line in what we would call the various fraud schemes, as - for example, as I just recently mentioned, the business email compromise. That was - that's been a significant threat that is affecting victims, millions of victims around the world. One of the things that we're seeing is the - these fraud schemes are becoming more and more sophisticated as - again, as technology, communication is becoming more and more advanced and these cyber criminal actors are becoming more and more sophisticated, taking advantage of the dark net and things like that.Again, the goal of the majority of these criminal cyber acts are - is financial in nature, so their goal is to defraud or steal from - whether it's a company or an individual, the techniques will occasionally vary. As we identify that and we try to counter that, we share those - that information with our foreign partners. Then, unfortunately, as we are able to dismantle one group, another group then comes in and then comes up with a new scheme, and as a result that requires us to continue to be aggressive and forward-leaning as we try to counter that. They're all associated with the various types of fraud schemes to try to defraud or steal money from victims.QUESTION: Thank you very much. Rahim Rashidi from Kurdistan TV. My question is: Do you have any office in KRG, Kurdistan Regional Government, and how you describe your relationship with Peshmerga? Because we know the Peshmerga capture many member of the ISIS, including U.S. citizens.MR PIRO: So we have personnel throughout that region. We have personnel strategically located. Some of those positions or some of those locations are acknowledged; others are not. So I will tell you we have folks in - throughout that region. Because of ongoing matters, I don't really want to discuss where we have everyone. We recognize - again, as I mentioned earlier, every partnership is key for us. Every relationship is important because of the value - as you mentioned, the information sharing, the intelligence, the cooperation that we gain. The FBI is committed to those partnerships and those relationships and to our mission.As you mentioned, ISIS is a significant threat really to the entire world, not just the United States or to that region or that part of the world. It is starting to affect everywhere - again, as I mentioned earlier, what has transpired in Europe and things like that. So our effort to work with everyone and anyone that can jointly support the FBI's effort, the FBI will pursue that relationship or that partnership.MODERATOR: We'll take one more. Please, sir.QUESTION: Hi. Philippe Gelie with Le Figaro, France. Two quick and easy questions --MR PIRO: Okay.QUESTION: -- to finish. Was your personnel affected when Russia expelled the diplomats and intelligence people last year? And secondly, how many people do you have worldwide? Thank you.MR PIRO: So the first one, easy: No. (Laughter.) The second one - I'll give you a rough number. Again, there - we have roughly 600 personnel permanently stationed overseas, and on any given day, we could have another 600 on assignment overseas.MODERATOR: With that, I'll thank Assistant Director Piro very, very much for taking the time to come and brief us. I know there were questions we did not get to. If you email them to me or one of my colleagues, we will pass them on to our colleagues at FBI press and work to get you an answer. Thank you all very, very much for coming today.MR PIRO: Thank you very much.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6366046 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: July 12, 2018End of Document

THE OUTLOOK FOR INFRASTRUCTUREStates News ServiceSeptember 16, 2018 SundayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1012 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: ROLLING MEADOWS, IL BodyThe following information was released by the Metals Service Center Institute (MSCI):The Metals Service Center Institute's recent Economic Summit brought together analysts and experts from across industries to discuss the future of the North American economy and how it relates to metals producers, service centers, processors, and metals users.Tony Nash, CEO and founder of Complete Intelligence, a data technology firm that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to forecast commodities, currencies, equity markets, economics, and international trade addressed an issue that has plagued U.S. policymakers for several years: how to tackle the nation's yawning infrastructure investment gap.U.S. infrastructure spending has declined 20 percent over the last two decades and has not kept up with population or economic growth, Nash said. As a result, the gap now exceeds $2 trillion. (Funding for roads, bridges, and transit is alone responsible for half of that deficit.)While political commentators worry little will get done in Washington, D.C. if Congress is divided after the November 2018 elections, Nash said the outlook for infrastructure spending is "positive." Nash predicted that, even if Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is sitting across the negotiating table from President Donald Trump next January, federal lawmakers and the White House can successfully negotiate an infrastructure packagebut it might not be the full $1.5 trillion outline the Trump administration has proposed. "Democrats will want to save some part of the investment in case their party takes over the White House in 2021," Nash said.In the event Democrats control the U.S. House of Representatives in 2019, Nash puts the odds at 60 percent that Congress will send an infrastructure bill to the president to sign. If Republicans manage to retain control of both houses of Congress, expect a robust package focused on private spending to pass, Nash said in an interview after the MSCI Economic Summit.To set the stage for that outcome, Nash noted the Trump administration has been working to identify projects that truly are "shovel ready." "That's important," Nash said. "Having projects ready to go is as necessary as the funding itself."Driving the desire to reach a deal is the understanding among policymakers that infrastructure investment is one of the safest economic choices they can make. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, every dollar invested in infrastructure generates $1.80 in economic activity, double the impact of a tax credit for new job creation and more than four times the bounce from a capital gains or dividend tax rate reduction.A $1 trillion infrastructure package would result in an additional $330 billion in spending by the construction sector; $65 billion by the electric power generation, transmission, and distribution sector; and $40 billion by transportation equipment manufacturers. Under a $1.5 trillion federal package, spending by those sectors would rise to $495 billion, $98 billion, and $60 billion respectively.Even if Washington can't agree on an infrastructure reform package over the next two yearshow to pay for the new investment and the environmental review processes will remain sticking points between the two partiesNash is bullish on the infrastructure market. Several states, like Texas, are on strong fiscal ground and will look to make new investments absent a federal share. Private sector investors also are eager to get moving and will go directly to local and state officials if there's a stalemate in Washington, Nash said.In his presentation to MSCI members, Nash drew comparisons between U.S. infrastructure investment and China's. After infrastructure investment lagged, China, through its Belt Road Initiative (BRI), is now using infrastructure as a means to build hard and soft power domestically and internationally. The Chinese government made attempts to get the private sector to pay for the $1 trillion investment in greenfield infrastructure but ended up stuck with the bill. (In our interview with him, Nash reiterated a government-only investment in the United States is not a viable approach.)Nash also noted China's BRI has been devoid of transparency and warned that U.S. lawmakers must learn from that mistake. Nash said federal lawmakers and the White House should develop a clear monitoring and evaluation of project milestone framework; a system for portfolio planning and program management; cross-agency cooperation capabilities; and a plan to reform regulations and streamline approval. (Nash said fewer steps in approval processes mean there is less opportunity for corruption.)One option is to create a website where citizens can explore the bidding process for all projects, Nash said. This website should go much further than the site established by the Obama administration to provide transparency to its $1 trillion infrastructure package, passed by Congress in 2009.Nash estimated that China's lack of transparency efforts eventually could mean up to 30 percent of spending is lost to waste, fraud, and abuse. The country already has spent $1 billion on a port in Sri Lanka where no ships will dock. Other projects have been cancelled due to lack of oversight, or to regulatory hurdles. If the U.S. doesn't enact the proper administrative infrastructure, the potential for corruption will be immense and could "rob" the American people of essential investment.U.S. lawmakers will have plenty of details to negotiate regarding infrastructure investment in the 116thCongress, but, if Nash is right, the potential that the federal government will increase spending is strong.Before launching Competitive Intelligence, Nash built and led the global research business for The Economist and the Asia consulting business for IHS (now IHS Markit). He has also been a social entrepreneur, media entrepreneur, writer, and consultant and currently is international advisory board member for Texas AandM University and a non-executive director with Kredit Microfinance Bank in Cambodia.Load-Date: September 16, 2018End of Document

Backlash following a deadly boat accident could cause a $1.5 billion hit to Thailand's economyBusiness Insider USJuly 22, 2018 Sunday 12:00 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 487 wordsByline: gheeb@businessinsider.com,  (Gina Heeb)Highlight: Amid calls in China to boycott Thailand following a boat accident off the southern island of the country that left at least 45 dead, most of them Chinese tourists, some economists estimate Bangkok will see its tourism industry lose more than a billion dollars in revenue this year.BodyReuters/Athit Perawongmetha• Dozens were killed after tourist boats capsized off the southern island of Phuket, Thailand on July 5. • Many of the passengers aboard were Chinese tourists. • Calls for a boycott of Thailand have broken out in China.• Economists say that could cost the Thai tourism industry more than $1 billion.A boat accident off the Thai island of Phuket that left at least 45 people dead - most of them Chinese tourists - has caused some in China to call for a boycott of tourism to Thailand. Some economists estimate such action would cost Thailand more than $1 billion in tourism revenue this year.Two tour boats capsized July 5 off the resort island of Phuket after hitting 16-foot waves during a storm. While Thai authorities said official weather warnings were issued before the boats went to sea,            CNN reports the incident has raised questions about safety standards in the country and led outrage and calls to boycott Thailand.Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan initially dodged blame, telling reporters the accident was "entirely Chinese harming Chinese." The Thai government later issued an apology, but some damage appeared to already have been done.Days after state-run newspaper China Daily            called            the remarks "provocative and irresponsible," Thailand's Phuket News            reported that Chinese tourists have cancelled thousands of summer hotel reservations since the incident. Nomura economists led by Euben Paracuelles predicted in a note that the incident could cost the Thai tourism sector $1.5 billion, based on past drops. For example, Paracuelles said the number of tourists to Thailand fell by around 8% within two months of a deadly bombing at a popular Bangkok shrine in 2015. The industry took about four months to fully recover, he said. "In the near term, we think tourist arrivals in July could drop sharply as a result of this incident and the World Cup," Paracuelles said, adding that Russia accounts for nearly 6% of Thailand's tourism receipts.China is the largest source of tourist arrivals to Thailand and on the rise, jumping from 7% in 2010 to 30% this year. China also makes up nearly 29% of revenue in the industry. Despite a potential blow to tourism revenue, economists see the situation as "manageable" in the near-term. With rising oil prices and seasonal factors, they expect current account surplus to rise to $10.8 billion in the third quarter after falling to $8 billion the quarter before. "The impact on the current account balance should be relatively limited," Paracuelles said.NOW WATCH: I tried the newest BlackBerry phone for a weekSee Also:• Trump doubles down on his rebuke of the Fed, says tightening 'hurts all that we have done'• The Chinese yuan's unwind is just getting started• Chinese economic growth slowed in the June quarterSEE ALSO: IMF: The US trade war could cost the global economy $430 billionLoad-Date: February 11, 2019End of Document

MAN, WOMAN DETAINED AFTER BLAST NEAR US EMBASSY IN BEIJINGStates News ServiceJuly 26, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 888 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Authorities in the Chinese capital on Thursday detained a man who police said was slightly injured after setting off a small explosive device near the U.S. Embassy in Beijing."There was an explosion at approximately 1.00 p.m. today on the street outside the South East corner of the Embassy compound," the U.S. Embassy said in a statement on its website, as images showing billowing smoke from a Beijing street began to be shared via social and mainstream media."According to the Embassy's Regional Security Officer, there was one individual who detonated a bomb. Other than the bomber, no other people were injured and there was no damage to embassy property," it said.Police detained a 26-year-old man identified only by his surname, Jiang, in connection with the incident, official media reported."A man sustained a hand injury when he detonated a 'firecracker-like device' in Beijing's Chaoyang district on Thursday afternoon," China's international broadcaster CGTN reported, citing a police statement.Jiang, who hails from China's northern Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region "set off the explosive device at the crossroads of Tianze Road and Anjialou Road," it said, adding that no other injuries were reported.The device was detonated close to the U.S. Embassy visa office, which was evacuated shortly afterwards but has since resumed operations, it said.Clampdown on newsChinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the incident was an "individual public security case" that was promptly and properly dealt with by police."We heard an explosion, and then everyone started running ... because we didn't know what was happening," an eyewitness told reporters. "The whole area was cordoned off; some people were saying it was just a tire exploding, while others were saying it was a terrorist attack."The authorities were quick to limit reporting and sharing of news relating to the incident, telling journalists to leave the area, and threatening one correspondent with the loss of her Chinese visa if she didn't comply.A Beijing resident who gave only her surname Liu said that local residents would likely never know the full story about the incident."It's too fragmented, so we'll never get to piece it together, because there's too little to go on, and it's hard to analyze it when it's in fragments," she said. "But my conclusion is that this was a disgruntled citizen, because there are so many grievances that are never addressed in China."She said some people with grievances against the government "will do anything in their power" to come into contact with foreign journalists and publicize their petitions against official wrongdoing."They want exposure; that's the sort of mentality they have," Liu said.Call for attentionRights activist Wu Tianli said the choice of location suggested that the main point of the explosion was to attract attention."Most government and [ruling Chinese Communist Party] buildings are guarded by police now, and there's basically no way to get close to any departments that are considered sensitive," Wu said. "If you want to try anything to make a fuss there, they will arrest you beforehand, and if you go somewhere else, it's not going to have much impact.""The U.S. Embassy of course would have a huge impact in China."Police also detained a woman after she shared video footage she shot of the immediate aftermath of the incident with journalists at the scene, according to Becky Davis, Beijing correspondent for Agence France-Presse, who posted video of the incident to Twitter."Have a taste of Chinese rule of law at Beijing US embassy explosion site!" Davis wrote. "A bystander ... kindly decided to share images and video - apparently passed to her by a friend - w a scrum of journalists via WeChat."Davis' video showed a woman being bundled screaming into the back of a car by a man in a green shirt claiming to be a family member. "This is a family matter," he says, but the woman shouts: "I do not know that man. I didn't do anything! I was just a bystander!"Police asked by Davis about the incident later told her to leave the area, adding, "I have control over your visa," Davis wrote.Back to normalCrowds were still queueing outside the embassy after the explosion and traffic was moving as normal in an area of northeastern Beijing that is home to numerous embassies including those of France, India, and Israel, Reuters reported.The Global Times newspaper, which has close links to Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece the People's Daily, said police also took away a woman who sprayed herself with gasoline in a suspected self-immolation attempt outside the embassy at around 11 a.m. on Thursday.It was unclear whether the two incidents were linked.Beijing rights activist Hu Jia said petitioners are a common site in Beijing's diplomatic quarter, where they hope that "going foreign" will lend some weight to their complaints."We can't rule out that this was done by someone on the lowest rungs of the social ladder," Hu said. "It's very likely that [the blast] was an isolated incident, expressive of someone's total despair, in the hope of getting some attention."Reported by Wen Yuqing for RFA's Cantonese Service, and by Gao Feng for the Mandarin Service.

Link Motion Reports on the Special Committee's Independent Investigation; Announces Changes to its Board of DirectorsPR NewswireSeptember 10, 2018 Monday 7:00 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1943 wordsDateline: BEIJING, Sept. 10, 2018 Body Link Motion Inc., (NYSE: LKM), a leading smart car and smart ride company, today announced the summary of the results of the independent investigation conducted by an independent Special Committee of its Board of Directors and carried out by its independent counsel, Loeb & Loeb LLP.  The Company also announces changes to its Board of Directors and remedial steps it is taking to enhance its corporate governance and operational controls. 1.  The Special Committee and the Report to the BoardBackgroundThe Special Committee comprised of independent directors was created in 2016 to deal with allegations concerning internal governance matters raised in connection with an investigation into Dr. Henry Lin's resignation as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the Board's decision to replace him as Chairman with Dr. Vincent Shi.  Loeb & Loeb was first retained as counsel to the Special Committee in November 2016 to investigate these allegations. During the first half of 2018, additional allegations were raised and the mandate of the Special Committee was expanded to deal with these matters as well. On August 27, 2018, Loeb & Loeb made an oral presentation of the results of the investigation to the Board of Directors.Elements of the reported findings pertain to matters related to RPL Holdings Ltd., one of the Company's major shareholders.  RPL's sole shareholder is a trust, of which Dr. Lin and Dr. Shi are major beneficiaries.  Dr. Lin was the sole director of RPL until the delivery of a letter announcing his resignation in 2016, at which time he was replaced in that capacity by Dr. Shi.Principal Findings Related to the Company and its Board of DirectorsLoeb & Loeb found it was reasonable for the Board to conclude that (i) in December 2014, Dr. Henry Lin resigned as CEO and Chairman of the Company, and (ii) there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that Dr. Henry Lin's letter of resignation from those positions was not authorized or ratified by him.However, Loeb & Loeb found a discrepancy between the reason disclosed by the Company for Dr. Lin's resignation at the time of announcement ("personal reasons unrelated to the Company") and the reason provided by counsel to the Company at the request by management in response to a subsequent request for more information as to the nature of the "personal reasons" from the staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  In that response, "health reasons" were put forward as the basis for Dr. Lin's resignation.  This statement was not accurate and complete since members of the Company's management were aware that Dr. Lin's resignation was significantly related to his involvement with a Chinese government investigation involving matters unrelated to the Company.  In connection with the transaction in which the Company divested its subsidiary, FL Mobile, Loeb & Loeb reported that there is not sufficient evidence to support allegations that (i) the Company intentionally tried to conceal the restricted nature of the RMB 440 million dollar bank deposit, (ii) the Company's repurchase of 5.66% of the outstanding FL Mobile shares from Dr. Vincent Shi was inappropriate or (iii) Company management lacked integrity regarding the disclosure that this deposit constituted restricted cash.In connection with the sale of FL Mobile shares by the Company to Tongfang Investment Fund Series SPC ("Tongfang"), the investigation found that, under the agreements signed with Tongfang, the Company has the ability to recover the shares it has sold to Tongfang if Tongfang fails to pay its RMB 1.77 billion senior note delivered in payment for those shares.  Furthermore, there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that the agreements signed with Tongfang are related-party transactions that would require special procedures for approval.With respect to internal controls and cash management, Loeb & Loeb reported that there is not sufficient evidence to support the allegations that any director, officer or employee of the Company has the ability to inappropriately direct funds out of the Company or that the Company's banking relationships with China Industrial Bank or Bank of Jiangsu are not trustworthy.In connection with the sale of Class B common shares by the Company to China AI Capital, the investigation found that the transaction was presented to the Board in accordance to proper procedures and decision-making and did not violate the Company's Memorandum and Articles of Association.Loeb & Loeb investigated Dr. Lin's statement that he did not sign and did not authorize the execution of the letter of resignation as sole director of RPL.  Loeb & Loeb reported its finding that a Company employee had custody of Dr. Lin's signature stamp, which she had used to "stamp" the letter of resignation as director of RPL.  Loeb & Loeb further found that it was "more likely than not" that the employee had done so at the instruction of Dr. Shi.   Dr. Lin was the sole director of RPL until the delivery of the letter announcing his resignation in 2016, at which time he was replaced in that capacity by Dr. Shi.2.  The Changes to its Board of DirectorsMr. Ethan Hu served as Chairman of the Special Committee of the Board, and as such was the director primarily responsible for the investigation into the allegations referred to above.  He was also the Chairman of the Company's Audit Committee.  Now that the arduous tasks as Chairman of the Special Committee have been completed, on September 5, 2018, Mr. Hu tendered his resignation as a director without any dispute or disagreement with the Company or its Board of Directors in any matter related to his roles on the Board.  In addition, the Board of Directors accepted the resignation of Mr. Jian Qi as an independent director of the Company and a member of the Audit Committee. The Board of Directors thanked both Mr. Hu and Mr. Qi for the services they have rendered to the Company in their respective capacities. To expand the remaining number of independent directors, the Board elected Mr. Jia Lian and Mr. Xiao Yu as independent directors of the Company.  Mr. Jia Lian has served as the chairman of Botongxingcheng (Beijing) Investment Co., Ltd.  Mr. Lian has more than 10 years' experience in finance and investment.  He graduated from Chinese People's Liberation Army Armored Force Engineering Institute in 2004.  Mr. Xiao Yu is the chief executive officer of Beijing Hongyi Garment Trading Co., Ltd.  He has more than 10 years' experience in marketing and management.  Mr. Yu graduated from Modern Art Design College in 2004. 3.  Improving Corporate Governance and Operational ControlsBased in part on the findings of the investigation, the Board has concluded that the Company's internal procedures and processes with respect to its decision making and operations should be made more effective and transparent in order to avoid events in the future that could lead to allegations similar to those that have been investigated by the Special Committee.  The anticipated improvements will be focused, among other things, on expanded and reinforced management and financial controls and review of financial and operational reporting.As a first step in that process, the directors have removed each of the existing members of the standing Committees of the Board, thanking them for their service.  Each removed Committee member remains a director of the Company's full Board of Directors.  As an interim step, the directors named Mr. Yu as the sole member of each of the Audit and Corporate Governance Committees, and named Mr. Yu and Mr. Bruson Li as members of the Nominations Committee, pending the selection of additional directors as members of those committees.The Board has also decided that the corporate governance of the Company would be enhanced by naming a Co-Chairman of the Board.  Therefore, pursuant to Company's Articles of Association, the directors have elected Director Larry Chi as Co-Chairman of the Board.  Dr. Shi will continue to serve the Company as Chairman of the Board and chief operating officer. In addition, members of the Board of Directors are considering ways to strengthen the Board's operations.  These methods could potentially include (i) adding additional new directors who can actively contribute to the Company's growth,  (ii) improving the Committee structure and operations, and (iii) implementing structural and procedural methods to improve the Board's oversight of Company operations.Finally, in order to continue to improve the Company's governance processes, the directors have charged the management with the task of reporting as soon as possible to the Board on appropriate and effective steps for the Board's consideration to achieve that goal.  The Board will report to the shareholders and other interested parties as such procedures are adopted and implemented by the Company. About Link Motion Inc.Link Motion Inc.

Link Motion Reports on the Special Committee's Independent Investigation; Announces Changes to its Board of DirectorsPR NewswireSeptember 10, 2018 Monday 7:00 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1946 wordsDateline: BEIJING, Sept. 10, 2018 BodyPR Newswire Link Motion Inc., (NYSE: LKM), a leading smart car and smart ride company, today announced the summary of the results of the independent investigation conducted by an independent Special Committee of its Board of Directors and carried out by its independent counsel, Loeb & Loeb LLP.  The Company also announces changes to its Board of Directors and remedial steps it is taking to enhance its corporate governance and operational controls. 1.  The Special Committee and the Report to the BoardBackgroundThe Special Committee comprised of independent directors was created in 2016 to deal with allegations concerning internal governance matters raised in connection with an investigation into Dr. Henry Lin's resignation as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the Board's decision to replace him as Chairman with Dr. Vincent Shi.  Loeb & Loeb was first retained as counsel to the Special Committee in November 2016 to investigate these allegations.  During the first half of 2018, additional allegations were raised and the mandate of the Special Committee was expanded to deal with these matters as well.  On August 27, 2018, Loeb & Loeb made an oral presentation of the results of the investigation to the Board of Directors.

"We continued to grow in changing market conditions and I believe that with increasing regulatory clarity, Lexin's compliance and strong financial technology capabilities will enable us to develop further.""We continue to see strong growth in our business in the second quarter," said Mr. Craig Yan Zeng, Lexin's chief financial officer. "In the second quarter, Lexin's gross profit reached RMB619 million and non-GAAP EBIT reached RMB353 million, representing an increase of 123% and 343% from the same period in 2017. Our adjusted net income also increased by 776% to over RMB502 million due to our strong performance, as well as the reversal of previously recognized valuation allowance of deferred tax assets of RMB193 million." "Our increasing profitability is also a reflection of our increasing operating leverage, as we continue to scale our business." continued Mr. Zeng. "And as our business continues to grow and expand, we can expect the trend to continue.""In the second quarter, we have made some adjustments to our business model for new loans funded by individual investors on Juzi Licai." continued Mr. Zeng. "After assessing the accounting impact in respect of the updated business model, we have concluded that all loans funded by individual investors on Juzi Licai under this business model from late April 2018 should be accounted for as off-balance sheet loans.""Our credit quality continues to be stable    which is a reflection of the stability of our educated young adult customers" said Mr. Ryan Huanian Liu, Lexin's chief risk officer. "Our vintage charge-off rate6 continues to be approximately 2.0%.

This increase was primarily due to the substantial increase in financial services income.Financial services income increased by 64.9% from RMB699 million in the second quarter of 2017 to RMB1.2 billion in the second quarter of 2018. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the outstanding principal balance of on-balance sheet loans, which was in turn driven by increases in the number of active customers and the average outstanding principal balance of loans per customer.Loan facilitation and servicing fees increased by 339% from RMB52.9 million in the second quarter of 2017 to RMB232 million in the second quarter of 2018. This increase was primarily due to the significant increase in off-balance sheet loans.Funding cost increased by 43.8% from RMB183 million in the second quarter of 2017 to RMB263 million in the second quarter of 2018. This increase was primarily due to an increase in our funding debts to fund on-balance sheet loans originated on our platform.Processing and servicing cost increased by 38.2% from RMB51.5 million in the second quarter of 2017 to RMB71.2 million in the second quarter of 2018. This increase was primarily due to an increase in fees to third-party payment platforms, an increase in risk management expenses and an increase in salaries and personnel related costs.Provision for credit losses increased by 55.7% from RMB149 million in the second quarter of 2017 to RMB232 million in the second quarter of 2018. This increase was primarily due to the increase in the average outstanding principal balance of on-balance sheet loans. In addition, as we had continued to improve our credit assessment and risk management capabilities as well as to enhance our collection efforts, we gradually expanded our customer base to improve our profit, while maintaining credit risks at a reasonable level.Gross profit increased by 123% from RMB278 million in the second quarter of 2017 to RMB619 million in the second quarter of 2018.Sales and marketing expenses increased by 39.3% from RMB104 million in the second quarter of 2017 to RMB144 million in the second quarter of 2018. This increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll expenses and an increase in online promotional fees and advertising costs.Research and development expenses increased by 37.7% from RMB57.0 million in the second quarter of 2017 to RMB78.5 million in the second quarter of 2018. This increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll and related expenses, an increase in share-based compensation expenses allocated to research and development expenses, and an increase in depreciation expenses allocated to research and development expenses.General and administrative expenses increased by 35.9% from RMB51.3 million in the second quarter of 2017 to RMB69.6 million in the second quarter of 2018. This increase was primarily due to an increase in share-based compensation expenses allocated to general and administrative expenses and an increase in payroll expenses. In addition, we incurred an increase in professional service fees and rental expenses.Loss on guarantee liabilities of RMB20.1 million in the second quarter of 2018 was due to the implementation of risk safeguard scheme as part of the adjustments to the business model for loans funded by individual investors on Juzi Licai.Income tax benefit for the second quarter of 2018 was RMB156 million, compared to income tax expense of RMB21.9 million in the second quarter of 2017. The Company's PRC subsidiaries completed 2017 annual tax filings with relevant tax authorities in May 2018. The tax filing result provided additional insights as to the recoverability of the deferred tax assets arising from provision for credit losses. Accordingly, a valuation allowance of RMB193 million previously recognized as of December 31, 2017 was reversed in this quarter.Net income for the second quarter of 2018 was RMB465 million, representing an increase of 2,905% compared to RMB15.5 million in the second quarter of 2017.Adjusted net income for the second quarter of 2018 was RMB502 million, representing an increase of 776% from RMB57.3 million in the second quarter of 2017.Please click here to view our vintage curve: http://resource.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/f27d9d37-3fb0-4a68-8b8c-1d05828a99ae OutlookThe Chinese government's recent actions to reduce financial risks have tightened liquidity in the P2P market, which has led to smaller players' exiting from the industry. The Company believes that this is a positive evolution of the industry towards a more mature regulatory environment that will foster a healthy and stable market in the future. Noticing that the government has issued new policies to encourage the development of consumer finance and based on the latest market conditions, the Company remains positive in terms of outlook and has adjusted its estimate for the total loan origination for fiscal year 2018 to a range from RMB65 billion to RMB75 billion. This outlook is Lexin's current and preliminary view, which is subject to changes and uncertainties.Conference CallThe Company's management will host an earnings conference call at 8:00 AM U.S. Eastern time on August 23, 2018 8:00 PM Beijing/Hong Kong time on August 23, 2018.Dial-in details for the earnings conference call are as follows:    United States (toll free):1 845 675 0437 or 1 866 519 4004    International:65 6713 5090    Hong Kong (toll free):800 906 601 or 852 3018 6771    China:400 6208 038 or 800 8190 121Participants should dial-in at least 5 minutes before the scheduled start time and use the following passcode: 6173307.Additionally, a live and archived webcast of the conference call will be available on the Company's investor relations website at http://ir.lexinfintech.com.A replay of the conference call will be accessible approximately two hours after the conclusion of the live call until August 31, 2018, by dialing the following telephone numbers:    United States (toll free):1 855 452 5696 or 1 646 254 3697    International:61 2 8199 0299    Replay Access Code:6173307About LexinFintech Holdings Ltd.LexinFintech Holdings Ltd. is a leading online consumer finance platform for educated young adults in China.

The presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We define adjusted net income as net income excluding share-based compensation expenses, interest expense associated with convertible loans and investment-related impairment and we define non-GAAP EBIT as net income excluding income tax expense/(benefit), share-based compensation expenses, interest expense, net and investment-related impairment.We present these non-GAAP financial measures because it is used by our management to evaluate our operating performance and formulate business plans. Adjusted net income enables our management to assess our operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses, interest expense associated with convertible loans and investment-related impairment. Non-GAAP EBIT, on the other hand, enables our management to assess our operating results without considering the impact of income tax expense/(benefit), share-based compensation expenses, interest expense, net and investment-related impairment. We also believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate investors' assessment of our operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool. One of the key limitations of using adjusted net income and non-GAAP EBIT is that they do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses, interest expense associated with convertible loans, income tax expense/(benefit), interest expense, net and investment-related impairment have been and may continue to be incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of adjusted net income and non-GAAP EBIT. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the non-GAAP financial information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.We compensate for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, which should be considered when evaluating our performance. We encourage you to review our financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.Exchange Rate Information StatementThis announcement contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars ("US$") at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader.

STUDY ABROAD IN CHINA OFFERS STUDENTS NEW PERSPECTIVES ON CULTURE AND BUSINESSUS Fed NewsJuly 31, 2018 Tuesday 2:18 PM  ESTCopyright 2018 HT Media Ltd. All Rights ReservedLength: 858 wordsBodyBLACKSBURG, Va., July 31 -- Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University issued the following news release:A study-abroad program initiated by the Pamplin College of Business this summer offered a group of students a learning experience in Beijing, Hong Kong, and Shanghai, China's largest city and a global financial and trade center.The three-week program combined meetings at both government-run and privately owned Chinese enterprises, lectures, workshops, and visits to local universities with cultural and historic excursions. The group also gained insights from Virginia Tech alumni living and/or working in China."The goal of this fast-paced program is to offer a transformative experience for our students by exposing them to a wide array of perspectives on business and life in China," said Jennifer Clevenger, director of global study abroad at Pamplin.With research showing that more than 90 percent of those graduating with business degrees will engage with Chinese businesses in some form, it is increasingly important that students prepare for practices and culture significantly different from what is customary in the West, she said.For Philip Andrew Williams, a rising sophomore from Orange, Virginia, the program was right on target."The experience completely altered my perception and opinion of Chinese culture, business, and government," Williams said. "The trip opened me up to new styles of thinking, which greatly challenged my Western outlook on the world and how I viewed Eastern cultures."Williams, who is leaning toward a finance major, said the program also helped him narrow down his future goals. He would like to pursue a career as an investment banker who consults with companies involved in large trade deals.Clevenger developed the syllabus for the three-credit course. It includes company reports, book reports, a daily journal, a poster project, and an observation sheet.One required reading, "The Chinese Way in Business," describes the difference in philosophies and ideologies of doing business from a Western versus Eastern perspective. "Throughout the program, students remarked on parts of the book that they saw in action," she said.Included among varied businesses visited by the students were TusPark, a government- and university-run entrepreneurial center for start-ups; PengCheng, a meat processing plant; Volkswagen China; IJK Capital Partners, an investment and venture capital firm; and BTCC, a leader in cryptocurrency."Visiting both private and government-owned companies in China was a great way for us to compare and contrast how business is conducted," said Maddy Altobelli, from Springfield, Virginia, a rising sophomore majoring in hospitality and tourism management."Because of my major, I was very interested in all the cultural sites and tourist destinations, such as the Great Wall, the Forbidden City, the Bund, and the Summer Palace, and of course, the food," Altobelli said."Dr. Clevenger's summer program in China is a perfect example of our concerted effort to introduce our students to global-learning opportunities much earlier in their program of study," said Svetlana Filiatreau, director of international programs at Pamplin.During their stay in China, the students connected with a number of Virginia Tech alumni, including Xiaoping Zhao, an assistant professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University who received his Ph.D. in management; MBA and other master's graduates Yi-Fan "Elyse" Lin, Lefert "Paddy" Zhou, and Michelle Sun; and Ruichao "Billy" Liu, who majored in finance and business information technology.The program was organized with the help of a company co-founded by Robert Fried, who majored in political science and communication. "As a Hokie and an owner of an international education company, he truly knows what type of learning could be helpful to our students," said Filiatreau."All of the alumni were very generous with their time," Clevenger said. "They joined in some activities and meals. They seemed happy to meet and reminisce with fellow Hokies and to share information about life in China."A goal is to have a few students remain in China for an internship at the conclusion of the program. "This also reflects the broader Pamplin goal of creating global fellows programs that help steer students toward multiple international opportunities," said Filiatreau.This summer, Jenna Nojaim, of Midlothian, Virginia, a rising senior majoring in finance, and Jack Speroni, of Leesburg, Virginia, a rising junior majoring in finance, are interning at the Chinese Language Institute in Guilin, where they are analyzing financial-based data to help the institute grow its business into an expanding market."The China trip and internship have indeed been a life-changing experience," said Nojaim. "These past couple of months will have a lasting impact on the rest of my life."The deadline for the summer 2019 Global Explorations in Chinese Business and Culture program is Dec. 1.

Celebrating a record run, President Trump touting the strong economy during last night's rally in Las Vegas.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We have the best economy in our history. Jobless claims just did a 50-year low, 50, 5-0. And the stock market today just hit another all-time high.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Futures are losing a little bit of steam this morning, but we still have a 23-point gain on the Dow futures. S&P futures are down slightly. But the Dow and S&P do start this day at new all-time highs. The NASDAQ is about one percent -- is about one percent away from its own record. In Europe, markets are moving to the plus side. We have gains in England, France, and Germany, and gains across Asian markets overnight. All four of the major Asian markets were moving higher.Opening the door, Brett Kavanaugh's accuser now saying next week is on the table for her to testify. But there are conditions. We have the latest on the Supreme Court showdown. Hitting store shelves, two of Apple's new phones in stores today. But now, there are questions about the battery life. And a moment 635 days in the making.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Steps, steps, step, fires, hit, hit, and go. That got it. (INAUDIBLE) got it. He picked it off at the 43-yard line. Is this how it feels? Is this how it feels to win?(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Yes. That's how it feels to win because the Browns finally did it and you know what that means, free beer for Cleveland. All that and so much more coming up this morning. The Federalist Commentary Writer Emily Jashinsky is here, the Brewer Group CEO and former NFL star Jack Brewer, and National Security Analyst Morgan Ortagus. So much to cover and I can't think of better people to do it with this morning.EMILY JASHINSKY, COMMENTARY WRITE, THE FEDERALIST: Thank you.MCDOWELL: So thank you all for being here.MORGAN ORTAGUS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Happy Friday.MCDOWELL: Yes, right on and happy last day of summer too.JASHINSKY: Oh, that's depressing.MCDOWELL: Let's get on it. Our top story this hour, President Trump touting the economy at a -- economy at a campaign rally last night.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We have the best economy in our history. Jobless claims just hit a 50-year low, 50, 5-0, and the stock market today just hit another all-time high. We cut regulations more than any administration in the history of our country, and I did it in less than two years. You can now go out and look for another job if you're not happy because everybody wants to hire you and you're getting higher wages for the first time in 21 years.Almost four million jobs created since the election, more Americans are now employed than ever recorded before. Think of that. Today, more Americans are working than ever before. We've created more than 400,000 manufacturing jobs. Last quarter, we hit GDP 4.1, adjusted upwards 4.2%, right? Boy, boy, boy. New unemployment claims recently hit a 49-year low. You know what that means? Simple. That means people are working.African-American unemployment has recently achieved the lowest rate ever recorded. And, you know what I've been saying, we're going to start winning again. We're winning now much bigger than I ever thought at a much earlier level.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: The commander-in-chief will be on the stump again this evening in Missouri this time. Blake Burman is at the White House for us with a whole lot more. Good morning, Blake.BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Dagen, good morning to you as well. 46 days until election day which is why we are continuing to see President Trump out on road hitting the pain trail last night as you just showed it was Nevada, a state in which Republicans are trying to hold on to a Senate seat. Later tonight, it will be Missouri, a state in which Republicans are trying to flip a Senate seat. The president specifically will be going to Springfield, Missouri, southwestern part of the state.We bring that up because that by the way is where the president launched his tax reform proposal last year. Tax reform, the current state of the economy, two of the top benchmarks the president points to for successes of his administration. But even his supporters of his agenda have cautioned him that his trade policy could potentially hold some of that back. Wal- Mart is one of those who have concerns with the president's escalating trade tensions with China or some would describe it as a trade war.Wal-Mart describe -- writing in a letter to the U.S. trade representative the following just about a week or so ago, "As the largest retailer in the United States and a major buyer of U.S. manufactured goods, we are very concerned about the impact these tariffs would have on our business, our customers, our suppliers, and the U.S. economy as a whole. Should Wal-Mart want to bring up those concerns directly with the Trump administration, Dagen, they could do that today.Ivanka Trump just so happens to be visiting a Wal-Mart in Texas. She's there to push further push job skills training if nothing else a little bit of coincidental timing there, Dagen.MCDOWELL: Most definitively, Blake Burman, thank you so much for that. Blake Burman at the White House. Turning to the Supreme Court showdown, Judge Brett Kavanaugh's accuser now open to testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday. President Trump weighing in on the controversy last night on "HANNITY."(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I think it's a very sad situation. He's an outstanding person. And frankly, Sean, to see what's going on is just very, very sad. You say, why didn't somebody call the FBI 36 years ago? I mean you could also say, when did this all happen? To take a man like this and besmirch. Now, with that being said, let her have her say and let's see how it all works out. But I don't think you can delay it any longer. I have been accommodating. I say let her say what she has to say.And let's see how it all comes out. But they've delayed it a week and they have to get on with it.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Here Now, Harvard law professor emeritus, author of the book The Case Against Impeaching Trump, Alan Dershowitz. Alan, good of you to be here. Good morning always.ALAN DERSHOWITZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning.MCDOWELL: Always a pleasure. One of the requirements based on what her lawyers are asking for in order to have her appear before the Judiciary Committee is that Brett Kavanaugh goes first. Is this a hurdle?DERSHOWITZ: Every civil libertarian in the country liberal, conservative, Republican, Democrat led by the American Civil Liberties Union should be outraged at this demand. It is so un-American. You're the accuser. You get on the witness stand. You testify. You make your accusation. You get cross-examined then the accused responds. It turns entire legal system on its head. It is insane to ask an accused person to deny the accusation before he has heard the accusation being mad and cross-examined.Sure. The FBI should continue its background check. They should also call everybody else who may have been at this party. All of that is true. But the idea that he goes first, I want to hear from the American Civil Liberties Union. Where are they? This is the most fundamental denial of due process.MCDOWELL: So do you think that the Senate Judiciary Committee would never agree to these terms?DERSHOWITZ: Never. It would be outrageous to put the person who is being accused on the witness stand first and say, would you please deny? We think we may have heard in a newspaper there's a letter when I didn't get to show you the letter to Senator Feinstein. But now, set out your argument. Set out your case. I would never in a million years allow a client to be subjected to a kangaroo court like that.MCDOWELL: With that, you're kind of getting at the essence of this. This is no longer a confirmation hearing. It's turning into what feels and looks like is a criminal trial.DERSHOWITZ: Well, Rachel Maddow says put him in jail. Impeach him. There's no statute of limitations. She says it's attempted rape. Attempted rape in the Maryland law, you pardon have to be specific requires a specific intent to penetrate. There's no evidence even in her allegation of that -- look, men and women are not born with a gene for telling the truth or lying. These senators who say, I believe her or the others would say, I believe him.Nobody is in a position to believe or disbelieve. Let's hear her. Let's hear him. Let's hear other witnesses. Let's see them. Let's see their attitude. Let's determine their credibility then we can say, I believe the idea that you always believe a man always believe a woman is the most blatant form of sexism.MCDOWELL: You're being too logical, Alan --(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: -- legal brain. Again, this is -- this is about hysteria all around.DERSHOWITZ: Well, that's what lawyers have to do and stop hysteria and that's what the ACLU for years did no more. They make so much money now on being anti-Trump. They have forgotten about civil liberties.ORTAGUS: So I know that we're talking about a lifetime appointment here, so it's a little bit different. But what would normally happen in a case where you're talking about two minors and its decades later because I believe he was 17, she was 15, so what would be normal precedent under these circumstances?DERSHOWITZ: Number one, always every state has what's called a Romeo and Juliet law, so we have 15-year-old and a 16 or 17-year-old, it's generally not treated as a felony of the crime if it was a 40-year-old man and a 15- year-old girl. That's number one. Number two, I have to tell you. I practiced law for 55 years. I have never heard of a case like this criminally being reopened after 35 years. It would be the first time as far as I know in American history probably world history that anything like this has led to a criminal investigation.Only in the world of, you know, radical extremists would you ever even hear suggestion of a prosecution.JASHINSKY: So the accuser's legal team insist that this process is moving too quickly and clearly Democrats in the Senate have a strategy to delay, delay, delay until, you know, perhaps the elections happen and we're moving onto 2020, what is the appropriate timeframe here because you just mentioned, we do have to do all these interviews? We have to conduct some sort of investigation, is pushing this to next week, is that still too quick or have Republicans pursued an appropriate time?DERSHOWITZ: Both sides are wrong. There should be no timeframe. We shouldn't be concerned about the election. We should be concerned about finding the truth however long it takes to make sure she testifies. The other witnesses are put on the stand subpoenaed if they have to be. The FBI conducts its investigation. Remember, the FBI has no jurisdiction criminally in this case because it took place in Maryland. But they do have the power to do background checks.They're not supposed to make credibility determinations. But just to supposed to gather all the evidence give it then over to the Senate. Let the process unfold. Let there not be a deadline. If it happens before the election, so be it. If it happens after the election, so be it. But politics shouldn't determine the outcome of this investigation in terms of timing.MCDOWELL: Well, the Senate Judiciary Committee actually said this on Twitter yesterday. They have a statement from Mark Judge, the other man allegedly in the room at this party. They have a statement under penalty of felony. There's a third person allegedly at the party. They have a statement under penalty of felony. And they also contacted a fourth -- a fourth person who was a schoolmate who has made some allegations on social media.So again, there is an -- what -- however you want to characterize it an investigation going on with -- by the people within the Senate Judiciary.DERSHOWITZ: But that's not good enough. You have to ask this guy judge, what did you initially say you don't remember? And then what did you say, oh, it didn't happen. You have to be able to confront him with his inconsistencies too. Look, everybody here has to pass the shoe on the other foot test. If this were a liberal Democrat who had this allegation being made against him, oh, by the way, we have such a case. We have Keith Ellison who has a spousal abuse or a domestic abuse case against him.Where are the Democrats on that? The same standard has to apply to Democrats and Republicans. You can't have one system of justice for one party and another system for another partly. I just want to see a fair process applied to everybody across the board and I don't care whether it helps the Democrats or Republicans. I want to make sure the rule of law is preserved.MCDOWELL: Well, the equal application of the law is kind of the old normal. It is not the new normal in what we're seeing in this deeply --(CROSSTALK)DERSHOWITZ: The equal application of everything is no new normal. You can't have the same standards of morality the same standards of the media, the same standards of anything. We have two truths. It's absurd the way we have become so partisan and so divided. You know, I was at the Red Sox- Yankees game last night. I'm a Red Sox fan. But I have to tell you. When Aaron Judge gets up, I applaud. I met Reggie Jackson last night. He is my hero.I don't care. I'm a Red Sox fan. But I know a great player when I see one and I know my friends who are Yankees fans when, you know, Martinez gets up, they cheer. That's the way it should be.MCDOWELL: Well, Alan, we are fan of yours.DERSHOWITZ: Thank you.MCDOWELL: Alan Dershowitz. Coming up, everybody, a possible sour Apple, the newest iPhones hit store shelves today, but concerns about battery life might stall sales. And a toast to victory beer, Browns, next.MCDOWELL: Hurricane Florence claiming more lives. Cheryl Casone has the details. Cheryl?CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes. Dagen, Florence has now blamed for at least 41 deaths in three states after four more deaths reported yesterday in Duplin County, North Carolina. Rivers keep on rising in the region as water continues to make its way downstream. Duke Energy, the area's largest utility says tens of thousands of homes remain without power and more than 1,000 roads are still closed throughout the Carolinas. Well, Wells Fargo slashing as many as 26,000 jobs.The bank plans to cut up to 10 percent of its workforce over the next three years as it's trying to recover from a series of scandals. CEO Timothy Sloan has the job cuts would help streamline the bank and become more customer focused. Shares of Wells Fargo are slightly lower in the -- well, they were lower in the premarket. They actually just inched up higher, but the stock is under pressure for the year. Well, Wal-Mart is making virtual reality part of its trading program.The company plans to put 17,000 Oculus Go V.R. headsets in all of its U.S. stores. The headsets are going to be used to simulate busy shopping events as Black Friday -- like Black Friday. Give workers a chance to become familiar with using the new technology. Shares of Wal-Mart are actually unchanged in the premarket, 97.75. And then, finally, you know we had a pizza on set yesterday, Dagen, well, a little bit like 10,000 box.MCDOWELL: Yes.CASONE: But if you like pizza, this is the job for you. You could you make up to $1,000 a day being a pizza taste tester. Uni is a company that manufactures home pizza ovens. They're looking for people to come up with new recipes that used as portable wood fired ovens. The pay could hit a thousand bucks. The company says it wants to attract a variety of people from novices to pizza pros. So is anyone in the panel wants to, you know, venture out into a new career path, pizza tasting is in your future. Back to your guys.MCDOWELL: Thank you -- thank you so much. You know, raise your hands if you want to be professional pizza taster.ORTAGUS: Totally.JACK BREWER, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, THE BREWER GROUP: If it's --(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: Or even an amateur.BREWER: (INAUDIBLE) I might do it.MCDOWELL: You see, I'm glad there's somebody else here to reign on the pizza parade.ORTAGUS: Yes, come on.MCDOWELL: I thought that was rain on it yesterday.JASHINSKY: But dairy-free pizza.BREWER: Dairy-free? It's got to be --(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: Why do you --(CROSSTALK)JASHINSKY: No.BREWER: You don't need cheese for a pizza.MCDOWELL: Why do you think he looks so phenomenal jackets 95 years old?BREWER: My pizzas are made and there's pylons, vegetables, and tomato sauce. Awesome.JASHINSKY: Opposite of amazing.MCDOWELL: Yes. Do a whole giant salad on top of it. By the way, Steve Forbes, he ate two pieces of pizza yesterday and a bag of cookies, so he is like the most awesome guy --(CROSSTALK)ORTAGUS: I was on Charles Payne show last night and the pizza box is in there. I did -- I didn't need it, but I did open the pizza box just to see if there is any -- there's like one piece left that was half eaten and I was hungry. I thought about it.MCDOWELL: Yes. It would have been OK. They wouldn't have told anybody and there is a microwave in the green room.ORTAGUS: I'm shameful.MCDOWELL: Coming up, a five star car, Tesla receives high marks for its Model 3 despite production that is being plagued with problems. Plus, a possible buyer's market. The real estate trying to signal it could be an opportune time to buy a home. Stay with us.MCDOWELL: A new report from real estate broker Redfin saying that in the last month more than a quarter of homes listed for sale had a price drop, does this mean that we are in a buyer's market? Joining us now, Warburg Realty President, MetaProp cofounder and partner, Clelia Peters. Clelia, good of you to be here. What are you seeing out there in the market right now?CLELIA PETERS, PRESIDENT, WARBURG REALTY: Well, the report that you just mentioned I think is very much aligned to what we're seeing in New York. I do have to say New York is always its own little market and that's really where I specialize, so what we're seeing in New York is buyers having a lot more power in the market, and sellers needing to be really strategic as they sell.MCDOWELL: What about the -- can you speak to the rest of the country at all because we have had this conversation privately? New York real estate market has been incredibly strong for the most part, but there are a lot of pockets out there in this country where there's an incredible amount of inventory on the market. Prices are not even back to where they were in the peak and so it is -- it is truly returned to it is about the location and up where you live, and where you're trying to buy or sell.PETERS: It's about the location. It's about the state of your home. And it's about some other factors, you know, the neighborhood, so, yes. Nationally, we are seeing a softening of the market. You know, I think the one thing that's interesting about New York is we've actually been seeing that softening here for a while and that's pretty unusual. Usually, New York's market goes in the lockstep with the stock market and we're obviously in a booming stock market.So it's interesting to try to speculate about why we're having these two things separated.MCDOWELL: I think valuation wise. I think that properties here apartments here are wildly overvalued when stocks aren't. But the prices that people are trying to ask for on these apartments are not realistic. They're living in La La Land quite frankly. Look at the prices of some of these places what they paid for and what they're trying to ask in terms of appreciation. That's why they're sitting on the market for so long. is it going to on the market so long. Jack, you got a question?BREWER: Yes. What about mortgage rates, is that affecting the investment portfolio for someone particularly individual buyers that, you know, maybe of course picking up a second property or third property to flip or rent? Do you see the mortgage rates having an effect on that?PETERS: Well, you know, what's funny is that mortgage rates are actually still pretty low. So you'd think that -- I mean this is where it really is, a buyer's market. You'd think that we're in an environment where buyers have more power. There's more inventory on the market. Sales prices are softening. Plus, we still have these low mortgage rates. But I think that buyers are hesitant because I mean, you know, the irony is so often buyers are hesitant when they don't see other people buying. And that there's opportunity for people who are willing to be bold when the market is a little soft --(CROSSTALK)BREWER: What about the inventory? It is -- I mean it seems like there's just a lot of things going up?PETERS: Yes.MCDOWELL: The inventory is -- I'll let you answer rather than me.PETERS: It's definitely true that we have more and more inventory on the market and part of that is about buyers and sellers not coming to the same -- the same place in terms of what they think is reasonable, you know, you have sellers who feel like their home should have greater value and you have buyers who feel, you know, it's almost like buyers are very sensitive right now. If they see something that's overvalued in their opinion, they don't even want to look at it. It's like it offends them.MCDOWELL: Right. Because, you know, they feel like that the seller is trying to rip them off. So you're one of the few female patterns at a venture capital firm, just talk about what it's like -- is the door wide open for women now.PETERS: You know, I think it is and it isn't. So I invest exclusively in real estate tech. It's funny because it's two different industries where there are very few women. And, you know, it's been my experience as a woman that if you come in and you're good at what you're doing, there's usually a seat available at the table. But I also recognize that there are a lot of barriers for a lot of women to sort of getting to the table in the first place.And I think particularly in venture capital, it's really important that we have more women, you know, only nine percent of the general partners or managing directors of venture capital firms are women and venture is about dreaming about what's next for our country, for our world. We need more women sitting at that table.MCDOWELL: Since we make up more than half the workforce, they need to add some more chairs around the table. If you're not going to give up your seat then you just need to make friends. Thank you. Clelia, it's good to see you. Clelia Peters.PETERS: Thank you.MCDOWELL: Coming up, Google under fire, details on the shocking report that employees discussed tweaking search results to counter President Trump's agenda to send essentially money and attention to pro-immigration organizations. And the new iPhone concerns, why customer might be complaining about the Apple -- about the latest device from Apple next.MCDOWELL: Welcome back. I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Friday, September 21st, your top stories at 8:30 a.m. Eastern. The Trump economy booming, better-than-expected jobless claims numbers, and easing fears over a trade war, pushing the Dow and S&P 500 to new all-time highs.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: This is an incredible time for our country. America is winning again. America is being respected again.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Take a look at the action in Futures this morning, as we are less than an hour away from the opening bell -- 58 minutes to be exact. 24-point gain on the Dow Futures right now, so we could see more record highs today. In the European markets, we have nice gains on the markets in England, France, and Germany. The FTSE 100 in Britain up more than one percent. And Asian markets finishing to the plus side. All four of the major markets there gaining to wrap up this week.Sky-high bidding, Comcast and Disney and Fox set to enter a blind auction this weekend to decide the fate of broadcaster Sky. A blind auction is complex enough. The process further complicated by Disney's pending purchase of the entertainment assets of 21st Century Fox which already owns 39 percent of Sky.Good grief, Google, a new report detailing how Google tried to help get around President Trump's travel ban. And influence thinking, even potentially sending money to pro-immigration organizations. And then, Tesla catching a break with all the controversy surrounding CEO Elon Musk, the company actually getting some good news with its Model 3.And Cleveland celebrates, the Browns breaking their losing streak and cracking open some Bud Light victory refrigerators. We have the highlights and more.Some of Apple's newest iPhones hitting shelves today. Gerri Willis is live in an Apple store in New York City, with a whole lot more, and her iPad in hand. Hey, Gerri.GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Hey, that's right, Dagen. Good to see you. So, we're at 58th and 5th, and let me tell you, the lines for these iPhones stretch all the way down to the block to Madison Avenue. A lot of people here are trying to get these new phones. What's on offer here? Well, the Xs and the Xs Max, those are the two phones. Let me tell you about them. The Xs, this is the old X souped up a little bit. Joanna Stern at the Wall Street Journal says, S stands for subtle because the differences are not that great. More durable glass on the front of that phone, but also, a report this morning that talk time on this phone may be as much as an hour less, so there could be a nasty surprise waiting for folks who buy that phone.The big deal, what people online are really talking about is the Xs Max. This is the biggest phone, 6.5-inch screen that Apple has ever put out. So, it's really ground breaking, very big. The battery life, an hour longer than the X. You could stream Netflix for 13 hours on this thing, Dagen. Very exciting. And we talked to one fellow, Abraham, the fellow who was first on line today, for one of these phones. He said that's what he was getting. That's what he was excited about. Now, this phone will be $1100, doubling down on this $1,000 price point going all the way to $1100.The thing that's not on offer here, and I want you to note the 10R, 750 buck, maybe it stands for reasonable. I want to show you some video of people getting those phones this morning. Take a look at that. In the meantime, we're interviewing people here about what they're getting. You can see them walking into the store right here. Dagen, I got to tell you, I was surprised by the number of people here. I thought there might be a fewer, and I hear there's more than the last time, that phones were on offer. So, we'll be here all day talking to folks, and seeing what it is they are buying. By the way, Abraham also bought an Apple Watch.MCDOWELL: Fantastic, I know with the new innovations, you can take an EKG on the new watch, so they are --WILLIS: That's right.MCDOWELL: -- they're pushing forward. Gerri, thank you so much for that report. Gerri Willis at one of the Apple Stores here in New York City. President Trump's signature legislative achievement not polling so well. An internal RNC survey obtained by Bloomberg reveals that the tax overhaul is struggling to resonate with voters. 61 percent of respondents believe that Trump's tax cuts benefit large corporations and rich Americans. Twice the number who said otherwise. And when it comes to approval of the plan, Americans remain torn, 44 percent favor it, 45 percent are opposed.Joining us now, Republican Strategists, former Trump campaign data and strategy director and Look Ahead America executive director Matt Braynard. Matt, should these results worry Republicans.MATT BRAYNARD, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, LOOK AHEAD AMERICA: Yes. Actually, they should. Mitch McConnell said that if you can't sell this to the American people, he needs to find another line of work. He's talking about a second round of tax cuts this close to the election. And it's a little bit like a piano that only plays one note. This is really straight out of the Chamber of Commerce, the Koch Brothers' playbook on how to lose elections. If these issues were determinative for voters, we'd be talking about President Romney right now.What we have is President Trump and his success running on issues that are existential to the country that voters actually do care about that the congressional leadership has neglected. Issues like securing the border, fixing the immigration system, repairing this crazy catch and release process, cracking down on H1B abuse and fixing the trade system And these are the issues the President has run on, led on, won on, and Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan is just caught up in this 1980s Republican strategy of just tax cuts, you know, just cut taxes, and oh, that level won the election.MCDOWELL: But, Matt, the economy -- we've got the stock market at record high, jobless claims at the lowest level in nearly 50 years. I can go through the list of things that are working for this economy, and it's because of the tax reform and deregulation, and those are two lynchpins, two main critical reasons why President Trump did win the election. So, why is that not connecting? Trump is pushing, pushing that message, but it's not connecting yet.BRAYNARD: If you ask people who voted for Trump why they did, I don't think you would find tax cuts in the top 10. You'd find things like repealing Obamacare which the leadership and the House and Senate failed to do. You'd find issues like securing the border, building the wall. Mitch McConnell can't even find a measly $25 billion so the President can have this wall is the lynchpin of what he ran on. Yes, the tax cut plan is good. The one they initially passed is part of the reason why the economy is doing so well. Also, just confidence in this pro-business environment the President has created. But to -- now, just less -- almost a month away from the election to be -- trying to force, you know, a 2.0 tax cut.Now, Mitch should just read his own poll from the RNC, and see that right now, this is not a winning issue. There's a time for this, and a place for this, but the time now is for fulfilling the President's promises when he ran and being part of that agenda, rather than being a roadblock to it.JAHINSKY: Matt, so here's a question, though, I mean, polling does demonstrate that voters list jobs in the economy as their top priority time and time and again. So -- and it's not as though President Trump himself is not out there touting this tax reform bill, he talks about it all the time. So, with those two things being the case, why is it that Republicans clinging to the tax reform narrative, what do you think keeps them -- I mean, we saw this with Conor Lamb's victory in Pennsylvania in the spring, right? It kind of blew up this idea that tax reform was going to seal the deal for Republicans in November. What is it that keeps them clinging to the narrative?BRAYNARD: Listen, it's a part of the pie that Republicans are banking as a value proposition to voters, but it's a small part of the pie. Many Republicans, the old establishment sort of think that it's the old pie. And right now, we're going through, I think in my lifetime, the third realignment of the Republican Party. The first happened with Ronald Reagan. The second happened with the Senate seat of the Christian Coalition in the 90s and in the early -- so now, we're in the third realignment, the Trump realignment.So, we have a lot of people who are still in the party's leadership, who's still are stuck on that same note from back in the 1980s. You know, the Ronald Reagan playbook is still effective here, but we're now in a new era. And what you're going to have -- to see happen in new Congress which I anticipate still being in Republic hands but whether is or isn't Republican Caucus, it's going to be much more in the line with this President and his agenda rather than this -- some of these holdovers, some of these dead enders. They're just part of this, you know, Chamber of Commerce, Koch Brothers network where all they really care about is, you know, open- borders, a cheap labor, and you know, tax cuts.With tax cuts not bad but, you know, really, what motivates the voters is much broader than that and much more existential because honestly, if they don't get their handle on the immigration problem in this country, they're never going to be able to pass another tax cut again when the Democrats take over the Congress and perhaps from the White House.MCDOWELL: I want to bring up this story in The Wall Street Journal, that after President Trump's first travel ban order, Google employees talked internally about how they could tweak search results to favor pro- immigration organizations. I want to get your reaction to this news. Because again, Google has always denied, Oh, it's just algorithms which are completely not transparent. But now, we're really finding out there are -- there are people left-wingers liberals within these major tech companies that are up to no good.BRAYNARD: Yes. And we saw that with the leak of those videos after the election. From the very top to the very bottom, overwhelmingly, this company is staffed by hard-core left-wing resisters. And I think that there is a deception -- it's very deceptive saying (INAUDIBLE) they're not (INAUDIBLE) when at the same time, they're rapidly developing a tool to allow the Chinese government to censor Google results. They've also been censoring conservative voices in a much more subtle way by de-monetizing conservative voices on YouTube, allowing them not to earn money.So, in these small subtle ways, they've been sort of -- they've been trying to limit conservative voices. And, you know, it's their company, right? They're free to run it how they are -- how they see fit. But I think the federal government and state government should re-evaluate all the money they spent on public relations, on advertising and in some cases like Apple, hardware on these companies that limit legal constitutional speech of many citizens. So, I think that may be is something the federal government and state government should reconsider.MCDOWELL: These technology companies have a liability waiver because of Congress, kind of when the internet was taking off where they're not liable for user-created content. But if you are a media company and not a technology company, and you are parsing what people see and read, they've got a problem, and they'll come right from Washington, D.C., Matt. I want to just leave it -- I'm editorializing, but I'll leave it there. Matt Braynard, thank you so much.BRAYNARD: Thank you.MCDOWELL: Coming up, a five-star car. Tesla Model 3 said to be one of the safest cars on the market. And open to celebrate, Brown fans crack and open free cold beer after the team won their first game in nearly two years.MCDOWELL: Supreme Court showdown, Judge Brett Kavanaugh's accuser now open to testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday. Well, with option -- with restrictions. Joining me now, the host of "VARNEY & COMPANY," Stuart Varney. You were asking questions about Kavanaugh's treatment here, Stuart.STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Oh, look, I'm fit to be tied. I think we have mistreated and being grossly unfair to a good man. Judge Kavanaugh has been hung out to dry. I just bring a couple of items to your attention, Dagen. Yesterday, Adam Schiff, who is the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, he said Republicans are, quote, OK with putting someone who committed attempted rape on the Supreme Court. You hear that? He committed attempted rape? This man, Adam Schiff, has found Judge Kavanaugh guilty. No evidence, don't even know where or precisely when this event was supposed to have taken place, but Adam Schiff, ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee says, he's guilty.Kirsten Gillibrand, Senator, New York State, Democrat, said the virtually the same thing. The Hollywood types have gotten together with this little videotape where all of these people are saying, oh, it's wrong to put him on the court. Believe the accuser. We're entering a new era here, where anybody can be accused of anything without any evidence whatsoever and held to be guilty. The presumption of innocence has been lost, and I think that is a terrible, terrible thing. That's all I got to say, Dagen, I'm steamed about this!MCDOWELL: I will say it to you that the Democratic narrative and make them put it on a bumper sticker before the midterms: Men are liars, women are victims. And everybody in this country knows that that is just ridiculous and appalling.VARNEY: It is a disgrace. What a circus. It has come to this? Good lord.MCDOWELL: Yes. And in terms of the treatment of this accuser by the Democrats, somebody leaked her name.VARNEY: Right.MCDOWELL: I mean, let's talk about how the Democrats are treating women in this country, it's -- there will be -- there will be hell to pay for years to come, based on the treatment of both Kavanaugh and the accuser.VARNEY: We are in sync, Dagen. That's a good thing.MCDOWELL: We're in sync often, Stuart.VARNEY: That's true, actually, yes.MCDOWELL: Stuart Varney is coming up in a little more than 10 minutes. Every day 9:00 a.m. to noon. Stuart, great to see you. Coming up, a bright spot amid Tesla's production woes. The details on the Model 3's perfect safety rating. Plus, 635 days in the making. How fans reacted after the Cleveland Browns won, next.MCDOWELL: A bright spot amid Tesla's production problems and, oh, the guy who runs the company also smoking weed on a podcast. Connell McShane is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with more. Connell?CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: Yes. And also, just almost every day of the week, it seems like we get a story about a Tesla executive leaving. So, this is good news for the company, and that its Model 3 got a five-star rating which is somewhat rare from the NHTSA, which is in charge of those ratings. Only two other sedans have that high of a safety rating, Toyota Camry and Subaru Forester. So, keep an eye on Tesla not moving very much in premarket trading, but it's usually a volatile stock, given all the news surrounding it. And we'll watch it once again today.We've also been (INAUDIBLE) stock to watch because of the old free beer in Cleveland story. Baker Mayfield making his NFL debut for the -- for the Browns last night, down 14-0 against the Jets. He leads them back to a victory, their first in quite some time, 635 days, and Bud Light had one of the better sports promotions of all-time, putting fridges all around the City of Cleveland with 200 bottles of Bud Light in each fridge, and once the Browns won, the fridge is automatically opened. There you go. Open them up and drink up, free beer all around Cleveland.MCDOWELL: Connell, Jack Brewer is here. He played in the NFL.MCSHANE: That's right.MCDOWELL: Are you a Jets' fan.MCSHANE: No, I don't know what you're talking about.(LAUGHTER)MCSHANE: Never heard of them.MCDOWELL: Connell is a Jets' fan, Jack Brewer. Can you -- can you console -- can you console Connell, please.BREWER: I mean, I have to -- I'm a Giant man, so you know, I don't feel too bad if we -- but come on, I mean, you had to -- you had to leave the whole gang.MCSHANE: You know what's funny about that game? You know what's funny about that game? I feel like both fan bases because of what they've gone through, Cleveland and the Jets, both fan bases were like assuming that their team would find a way to lose. Of course, the Jets did, and the Browns found a way to win. So --BREWER: Well, congratulations. Cleveland is a great city and they deserve a win. So -- yes, with their backup quarterback.(LAUGHTER)MCSHANE: He's going to be all right.MCDOWELL: No, let's pile on. Connell is also a Metz fan, so he lives in a world of hurt.BREWER: Oh, my God, really? It's Friday. That's what you're doing?MCSHANE: There's always next year.BREWER: Friday blues.MCSHANE: Or the year after, or the year after that. I hate you.MCDOWELL: No, we --(LAUGHTER)MCDOWELL: We love Cleveland, though, we really do because we spent a lot of time out there. Like Orange --(CROSSTALK)MCSHANE: Yes, no, Cleveland is great. I had emails all night long, by the way, from Liz Claman last night. So, congratulations, Liz -- on top of everything else, congratulations Liz, congratulations Cleveland. Great city, great win, free beer, great promotion, whatever Jets.MCDOWELL: And then, there's next week, so they got to put up another W. Connell, thank you so much.MCSHANE: All right.MCDOWELL: Always a winner, Connell McShane. Final thoughts from our all- stars when we come back.MCDOWELL: President Trump just tweeting this, "Judge Brett Kavanaugh is a fine man with an impeccable reputation who is under assault by radical left-wing politicians who don't want to know the answers. They just want to destroy and delay. Facts don't matter. I go through this with them every single day in D.C."Final thoughts, Morgan Ortagus?ORTAGUS: Yes, I think the President has been pretty reserved this week, actually and saying let the -- let the victim speak, and I think what you're seeing right there is frustration from the fact that the Senate Judiciary Committee is trying to get her to testify early next week. And there are many delay tactics that her lawyer -- so I think you're seeing the President, just the frustration over the delay tactics for that specific hearing coming out.MCDOWELL: Final thought, Jack.BREWER: Attempted rape. That's a serious accusation. Let's keep it focused and real.MCDOWELL: You mean focused on what the actual --BREWER: On what they actually --MCDOWELL: On what the accuser actually said which is not attempted rape, according to Alan Dershowitz.JAHINSKY: Yes, my phone -- I'm curious to see if this tweet is previewing a pivot from the White House. Are we going to see more of this? Is it a new strategy? We'll see.MCDOWELL: Thank you all. Stuart Varney, it is all yours, my friend.VARNEY: Thank you very much, and good morning, Dagen.

We believe these core values, our considerable R&D capabilities, and strong business acumen will continue to drive our future success,  concluded Mr. Ding.Second Quarter 2018 Financial ResultsNetRevenuesNet revenues for the second quarter of 2018 were RMB16,283.9 million (US$2,460.9 million), compared to RMB14,173.0 million and RMB13,376.0 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2017, respectively.Net revenues from online games were RMB10,060.8 million (US$1,520.4 million) for the second quarter of 2018, compared to RMB8,761.2 million and RMB9,430.2 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2017, respectively.

The top performing advertising verticals in the second quarter of 2018 were automobile, internet services and real estate sectors.Net revenues from e-mail and others were RMB1,223.5 million (US$184.9 million) for the second quarter of 2018, compared to RMB1,217.3 million and RMB858.3 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2017, respectively.Gross Profit/(Loss)Gross profit for the second quarter of 2018 was RMB7,245.1 million (US$1,094.9 million), compared to RMB5,953.6 millionand RMB6,736.9 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2017, respectively.  The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases in online game services gross profit were primarily due to increased revenue contribution from self-developed mobile games such as Chu Liu Xiang, Knives Out and Identity V. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases in e-commerce gross profit were primarily due to the rapid development of Kaola.com and Yanxuan.The year-over-year increase in advertising services gross profit was primarily due to its enhanced monetization efforts. The quarter-over-quarter increase in advertising services gross profit was primarily due to seasonality.The year-over-year increase in e-mail and others gross loss was primarily due to decreased revenue contribution from certain online platform businesses, which have relatively higher gross profit margins, as well as higher recognized costs related to certain licensed music content. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in e-mail and others gross loss was primarily due to higher recognized costs related to certain licensed music content in the preceding quarter.Gross Profit/ (Loss) MarginGross profit margin for online game services for the second quarter of 2018 was 64.3%, compared to 62.1% and 63.1% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2017, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases in gross profit margin were mainly due to increased revenue, while certain costs related to the Company's online games segment were fixed.Gross profit margin for e-commerce for the second quarter of 2018 was 10.1%, compared to 9.5% and 12.6% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2017, respectively. The year-over-year decrease in e-commerce gross profit margin was primarily due to certain sales discounts in the second quarter of 2018 to support the rapid development of Kaola.com and Yanxuan. The quarter-over-quarter increase in e-commerce gross profit margin was primarily due to improved product mix and procurement process.Gross profit margin for advertising services for the second quarter of 2018 was 67.0%, compared to 59.0% and 67.6% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2017, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter increase in gross profit margin was mainly due to seasonality.Gross loss margin for e-mail and others for the second quarter of 2018 was 7.3%, compared to gross loss margin of 9.9% and gross profit margin of 7.7% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2017, respectively. The year-over-year decrease in gross margin was primarily due to decreased revenue contribution from certain online platform businesses, which have relatively higher gross profit margins, as well as higher recognized costs related to certain licensed music content in the second quarter of 2018. The quarter-over-quarter improvement in e-mail and others gross margin was primarily due to higher recognized costs related to certain licensed music content in the preceding quarter.Operating ExpensesTotal operating expenses for the second quarter of 2018 were RMB4,911.5 million (US$742.2 million), compared to RMB4,746.6 million and RMB3,331.5 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2017, respectively. The year-over-year increase in operating expenses was mainly due to increased marketing expenditures, research and development investments and shipping and handling costs, as well as higher staff-related costs. The quarter-over-quarter increase in operating expenses was mainly due to increased staff-related costs and research and development investments, and partially offset by decreased marketing expenditures related to online games. Shipping and handling costs included in selling and marketing expenses for the second quarter of 2018 were RMB386.6 million (US$58.4 million), compared to RMB325.8 million and RMB281.3 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2017, respectively.Income TaxesThe Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB420.5 million (US$63.6 million) for the second quarter of 2018, compared to RMB282.7 million and RMB703.5 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2017, respectively. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2018 was 15.7%, compared to 26.0% and 19.0% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2017, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter changes in the effective tax rate were mainly due to the fact that certain subsidiaries of the Company were recognized as Key Software Enterprises in the second quarter of 2018, and therefore subject to a preferential tax rate of 10% for 2017. The Company recognized related tax credits in the second quarter of 2018 accordingly. The effective tax rate represents certain estimates by the Company as to the tax obligations and benefits applicable to it in each quarter.Net Income After TaxNet income attributable to the Company's shareholders for the second quarter of 2018 totaled RMB2.1 billion (US$318.3 million), compared to RMB751.9 million and RMB3.0 billion for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2017, respectively. Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders for the second quarter of 2018 totaled RMB2.7 billion (US$411.8 million), compared to RMB1.3 billion and RMB3.5 billion for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2017, respectively.During the second quarter of 2018, the Company had a net foreign exchange gain of RMB232.8 million (US$35.2 million), compared to net foreign exchange losses of RMB375.1 million and RMB131.3 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2017, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter changes in foreign exchange gains and losses were mainly due to unrealized exchange gains and losses arising from the Company's U.S. dollar-denominated bank deposits and short-term loan balances as the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the RMB fluctuated over the periods.NetEase reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$2.45 and US$2.44, respectively, for the second quarter of 2018. The Company reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$0.87 and US$0.86, respectively, for the preceding quarter, and basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$3.41 and US$3.39, respectively, for the second quarter of 2017.

The determination to make dividend distributions and the amount of such distributions in any particular quarter will be made at the discretion of the board of directors and will be based upon the Company's operations and earnings, cash flow, financial condition and other relevant factors.Other InformationAs of June 30, 2018, the Company's total cash and cash equivalents, current and non-current time deposits and short-term investments balance totaled RMB44.3 billion (US$6.7 billion), compared to RMB43.2 billion as of December 31, 2017. Cash flow generated from operating activities was RMB2.0 billion (US$295.9 million) for the second quarter of 2018, compared to RMB1.9 billion and RMB2.3 billion for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2017, respectively.Share Repurchase ProgramOn November 15, 2017, the Company announced that its board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program of up to US$1.0 billion of the Company's outstanding ADSs for a period not to exceed 12 months beginning on November 16, 2017. On June 11, 2018, the Company announced that its board of directors approved an amendment to its share repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of up to an additional US$1.0 billion of the Company's outstanding ADSs. This expands the US$1.0 billion repurchase program that was approved on November 15, 2017 for a period not to exceed 12 months, bringing the total authorized repurchase amount to US$2.0 billion.As of June 30, 2018, the Company had repurchased approximately 3.4 million ADSs for approximately US$912.0 millionunder this program.Under the terms of the current approved program, NetEase may repurchase its issued and outstanding ADSs in open-market transactions on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. The timing and dollar amount of repurchase transactions will be subject to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 10b-18 requirements. It is also expected that such repurchases will be effected pursuant to a plan in conformity with SEC Rule 10b5-1.  The extent to which NetEase repurchases its ADSs will depend upon a variety of factors, including market conditions, regulatory requirements and other corporate considerations, as determined by NetEase's management team. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.** The United States dollar (US$) amounts disclosed in this press release are presented solely for the convenience of the reader. Translations of amounts from RMB into United States dollars for the convenience of the reader were calculated at the noon buying rate of US$1.00 = RMB6.6171 on June 29, 2018 as set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board. No representation is made that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted into US$ at that rate on June 29, 2018, or at any other certain date. The percentages stated are calculated based on RMB.Change in Segment ReportingEffective in the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company changed its segment disclosure to separately report the financial results of its e-commerce business in light of the significant growth of the revenue contribution from e-commerce to the Company's total consolidated net revenues in 2017. This segment primarily reflects the results of NetEase's two e-commerce platforms, Kaola.com and Yanxuan, which were established in January 2015 and April 2016, respectively. The Company now reports four reporting segments: online game services, e-commerce, advertising services, and e-mail and others. This change in segment reporting aligns with the manner in which the Company's operating decision maker ( CODM ) currently receives and uses financial information to allocate resources and evaluate the performance of reporting segments. This change in segment presentation does not affect consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of income or consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company retrospectively revised prior period segment information to conform to current period presentation.Impact of the recently adopted major accounting pronouncementsOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Topic 606  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  using the modified-retrospective transition approach and recorded a reduction of its deferred revenue of approximately RMB81.7 millionand a net increase to its retained earnings of approximately RMB27.4 million (net of tax) as a result of estimating game point breakage. The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a significant impact on the Company's operating results for the second quarter of 2018 and comparable periods.On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-01  Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. , and reclassified RMB38.2 million of accumulated other comprehensive income for the Company's available-for-sale equity securities that existed as of December 31, 2017 into retained earnings upon the adoption. In addition, the Company recorded a net investment loss of RMB78.5 million and RMB56.3 million related to the equity investments with readily determinable fair value in the second quarter and the first quarter of 2018, respectively. Given that there were no material observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investments of the same issuer, the Company did not record any changes to the carrying value of equity investments without readily determinable fair value in the first half of 2018.The Company also adopted ASU 2016-18  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash  starting from the first quarter of 2018. Pursuant to the new guidance, the Company's cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash increased by an aggregate of RMB717.9 million for the second quarter of 2017, compared to the amounts presented under previous guidance.Conference CallNetEase's management team will host a teleconference call with simultaneous webcast at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday, August 8, 2018 (Beijing/Hong Kong Time: 9:00 a.m., Thursday, August 9, 2018).

These statements are made under the  safe harbor  provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these forward-looking statements by terminology such as  will,   expects,   anticipates,   future,   intends,   plans,   believes,   estimates  and similar statements. The accuracy of these statements may be impacted by a number of business risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or anticipated, including risks related to: the risk that the online game market will not continue to grow or that NetEase will not be able to maintain its leading position in that market, which could occur if, for example, its new online games or expansion packs and other improvements to its existing games do not become as popular as management anticipates; the ability of NetEase to successfully expand its mobile internet offerings; the ability of NetEase to effectively market its games and other services and achieve a positive return on its marketing expenditures; the risk that NetEase's affiliates will not be able to continue operating Minecraft, World of Warcraft®, StarCraft® II, Hearthstone®, Diablo® III: Reaper of Souls , Heroes of the Storm®, Overwatch® or other games licensed by it for a period of time or permanently due to possible governmental actions or the risk that such games will not be popular with game players in China; the risk that changes in Chinese government regulation of the online game market and the market for NetEase's e-commerce businesses may limit future growth of NetEase's revenues or cause revenues to decline; competition in the online advertising business and the risk that investments by NetEase in its content and services may not increase the appeal of the NetEase websites among internet users or result in increased advertising revenues; the risk that NetEase may not be able to continuously develop new and creative online services, including its ability to maintain and enhance the popularity of its e-mail, mobile and e-commerce businesses and develop attractive mobile games; the risk that NetEase will not be able to control its expenses in future periods; competition in NetEase's existing and potential markets; governmental uncertainties (including possible changes in the effective tax rates applicable to NetEase and its subsidiaries and affiliates and the ability of NetEase to receive and maintain approvals of the preferential tax treatments and general competition and price pressures in the marketplace); the risk that fluctuations in the value of the Renminbi with respect to other currencies could adversely affect NetEase's business and financial results; and other risks outlined in NetEase's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. NetEase does not undertake any obligation to update this forward-looking information, except as required under the applicable law.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresNetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS, as supplemental metrics in reviewing and assessing its operating performance and formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ).NetEase defines non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders as net income attributable to the Company's shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders enables NetEase's management to assess its operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses, which are non-cash charges. NetEase believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating the Company's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP financial measure facilitates investors' assessment of its operating performance.Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders is that it does not reflect all items of expense that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses have been and may continue to be incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. See  Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results  at the end of this press release. NetEase encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.Contact for Media and Investors:Margaret Shi NetEase, Inc. ir@service.netease.com Tel: (+86) 571-8985-2955Brandi PiacenteInvestor Relations brandi@corp.netease.com Tel: (+1) 212-481-2050NETEASE, INC.NOTES TOUNAUDITEDFINANCIALINFORMATIONNote 1: The conversion of Renminbi (RMB) into United States dollars (USD) is based on the noon buying rate              of USD1.00 = RMB6.6171 on the last trading day of June 2018 (June 29, 2018) as set forth in the H.10              statistical release of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board.Note 2: Share-based compensation cost reported in the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated statements              of comprehensive income is set out as follows in RMB and USD (in thousands):See Campaign:http://corp.netease.com/Contact Information:NetEase, Inc.Tags:,            Wire,            Disclosure Newswire,            Asia,            EnglishLoad-Date: August 12, 2018End of Document

Mobile games accounted for approximately 74.7% of net revenues from online games for the second quarter of 2018, compared to 71.8% and 72.4% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2017, respectively.Net revenues from e-commerce were RMB4,365.5 million (US$659.7 million) for the second quarter of 2018, compared to RMB3,732.5 million and RMB2,492.0 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2017, respectively.Net revenues from advertising services were RMB634.1 million (US$95.8 million) for the second quarter of 2018, compared to RMB462.0 million and RMB595.6 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2017, respectively. The top performing advertising verticals in the second quarter of 2018 were automobile, internet services and real estate sectors.Net revenues from e-mail and others were RMB1,223.5 million (US$184.9 million) for the second quarter of 2018, compared to RMB1,217.3 million and RMB858.3 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2017, respectively.Gross Profit/(Loss)Gross profit for the second quarter of 2018 was RMB7,245.1 million (US$1,094.9 million), compared to RMB5,953.6 million and RMB6,736.9 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2017, respectively.  The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases in online game services gross profit were primarily due to increased revenue contribution from self-developed mobile games such asChu Liu Xiang,Knives OutandIdentity V.The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases in e-commerce gross profit were primarily due to the rapid development ofKaola.comandYanxuan.The year-over-year increase in advertising services gross profit was primarily due to its enhanced monetization efforts. The quarter-over-quarter increase in advertising services gross profit was primarily due to seasonality.The year-over-year increase in e-mail and others gross loss was primarily due to decreased revenue contribution from certain online platform businesses, which have relatively higher gross profit margins, as well as higher recognized costs related to certain licensed music content. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in e-mail and others gross loss was primarily due to higher recognized costs related to certain licensed music content in the preceding quarter.Gross Profit/ (Loss) MarginGross profit margin for online game services for the second quarter of 2018 was 64.3%, compared to 62.1% and 63.1% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2017, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases in gross profit margin were mainly due to increased revenue, while certain costs related to the Company's online games segment were fixed.Gross profit margin for e-commerce for the second quarter of 2018 was 10.1%, compared to 9.5% and 12.6% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2017, respectively. The year-over-year decrease in e-commerce gross profit margin was primarily due to certain sales discounts in the second quarter of 2018 to support the rapid development ofKaola.comandYanxuan. The quarter-over-quarter increase in e-commerce gross profit margin was primarily due to improved product mix and procurement process.Gross profit margin for advertising services for the second quarter of 2018 was 67.0%, compared to 59.0% and 67.6% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2017, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter increase in gross profit margin was mainly due to seasonality.Gross loss margin for e-mail and others for the second quarter of 2018 was 7.3%, compared to gross loss margin of 9.9% and gross profit margin of 7.7% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2017, respectively. The year-over-year decrease in gross margin was primarily due to decreased revenue contribution from certain online platform businesses, which have relatively higher gross profit margins, as well as higher recognized costs related to certain licensed music content in the second quarter of 2018. The quarter-over-quarter improvement in e-mail and others gross margin was primarily due to higher recognized costs related to certain licensed music content in the preceding quarter.Operating ExpensesTotal operating expenses for the second quarter of 2018 were RMB4,911.5 million (US$742.2 million), compared to RMB4,746.6 million and RMB3,331.5 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2017, respectively. The year-over-year increase in operating expenses was mainly due to increased marketing expenditures, research and development investments and shipping and handling costs, as well as higher staff-related costs. The quarter-over-quarter increase in operating expenses was mainly due to increased staff-related costs and research and development investments, and partially offset by decreased marketing expenditures related to online games. Shipping and handling costs included in selling and marketing expenses for the second quarter of 2018 were RMB386.6 million (US$58.4 million), compared to RMB325.8 million and RMB281.3 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2017, respectively.Income TaxesThe Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB420.5 million (US$63.6 million) for the second quarter of 2018, compared to RMB282.7 million and RMB703.5 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2017, respectively. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2018 was 15.7%, compared to 26.0% and 19.0% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2017, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter changes in the effective tax rate were mainly due to the fact that certain subsidiaries of the Company were recognized as Key Software Enterprises in the second quarter of 2018, and therefore subject to a preferential tax rate of 10% for 2017. The Company recognized related tax credits in the second quarter of 2018 accordingly. The effective tax rate represents certain estimates by the Company as to the tax obligations and benefits applicable to it in each quarter.Net Income After TaxNet income attributable to the Company's shareholders for the second quarter of 2018 totaled RMB2.1 billion (US$318.3 million), compared to RMB751.9 million and RMB3.0 billion for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2017, respectively. Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders for the second quarter of 2018 totaled RMB2.7 billion (US$411.8 million), compared to RMB1.3 billion and RMB3.5 billion for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2017, respectively.During the second quarter of 2018, the Company had a net foreign exchange gain of RMB232.8 million (US$35.2 million), compared to net foreign exchange losses of RMB375.1 million and RMB131.3 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2017, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter changes in foreign exchange gains and losses were mainly due to unrealized exchange gains and losses arising from the Company's U.S. dollar-denominated bank deposits and short-term loan balances as the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the RMB fluctuated over the periods.NetEase reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$2.45 and US$2.44, respectively, for the second quarter of 2018. The Company reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$0.87 and US$0.86, respectively, for the preceding quarter, and basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$3.41 and US$3.39, respectively, for the second quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS were US$3.17 and US$3.15, respectively, for the second quarter of 2018, compared to non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$1.54 and US$1.53, respectively, for the preceding quarter, and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$3.98 and US$3.96, respectively, for the second quarter of 2017.Quarterly DividendThe board of directors has approved a dividend of US$0.61 per ADS for the second quarter of 2018, which is expected to be paid on August 31, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 24, 2018.NetEase paid a dividend of US$0.38 per ADS for the fourth quarter of 2017 on March 2, 2018 and paid a dividend of US$0.23 per ADS for the first quarter of 2018 on June 8, 2018.Under the Company's quarterly dividend policy announced on May 13, 2014, quarterly dividends will be set at an amount equivalent to approximately 25% of the Company's anticipated net income after tax in each fiscal quarter. The determination to make dividend distributions and the amount of such distributions in any particular quarter will be made at the discretion of the board of directors and will be based upon the Company's operations and earnings, cash flow, financial condition and other relevant factors.Other InformationAs of June 30, 2018, the Company's total cash and cash equivalents, current and non-current time deposits and short-term investments balance totaled RMB44.3 billion (US$6.7 billion), compared to RMB43.2 billion as of December 31, 2017. Cash flow generated from operating activities was RMB2.0 billion (US$295.9 million) for the second quarter of 2018, compared to RMB1.9 billion and RMB2.3 billion for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2017, respectively.Share Repurchase ProgramOn November 15, 2017, the Company announced that its board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program of up to US$1.0 billion of the Company's outstanding ADSs for a period not to exceed 12 months beginning on November 16, 2017. On June 11, 2018, the Company announced that its board of directors approved an amendment to its share repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of up to an additional US$1.0 billion of the Company's outstanding ADSs. This expands the US$1.0 billion repurchase program that was approved on November 15, 2017 for a period not to exceed 12 months, bringing the total authorized repurchase amount to US$2.0 billion.As of June 30, 2018, the Company had repurchased approximately 3.4 million ADSs for approximately US$912.0 million under this program.Under the terms of the current approved program, NetEase may repurchase its issued and outstanding ADSs in open-market transactions on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. The timing and dollar amount of repurchase transactions will be subject to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 10b-18 requirements. It is also expected that such repurchases will be effected pursuant to a plan in conformity with SEC Rule 10b5-1.  The extent to which NetEase repurchases its ADSs will depend upon a variety of factors, including market conditions, regulatory requirements and other corporate considerations, as determined by NetEase's management team. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.** The United States dollar (US$) amounts disclosed in this press release are presented solely for the convenience of the reader. Translations of amounts from RMB into United States dollars for the convenience of the reader were calculated at the noon buying rate of US$1.00 = RMB6.6171 on June 29, 2018 as set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board. No representation is made that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted into US$ at that rate on June 29, 2018, or at any other certain date. The percentages stated are calculated based on RMB.Change in Segment ReportingEffective in the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company changed its segment disclosure to separately report the financial results of its e-commerce business in light of the significant growth of the revenue contribution from e-commerce to the Company's total consolidated net revenues in 2017. This segment primarily reflects the results of NetEase's two e-commerce platforms,Kaola.comandYanxuan, which were established in January 2015 and April 2016, respectively. The Company now reports four reporting segments: online game services, e-commerce, advertising services, and e-mail and others. This change in segment reporting aligns with the manner in which the Company's operating decision maker ("CODM") currently receives and uses financial information to allocate resources and evaluate the performance of reporting segments. This change in segment presentation does not affect consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of income or consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company retrospectively revised prior period segment information to conform to current period presentation.Impact of the recently adopted major accounting pronouncementsOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Topic 606 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" using the modified-retrospective transition approach and recorded a reduction of its deferred revenue of approximately RMB81.7 million and a net increase to its retained earnings of approximately RMB27.4 million (net of tax) as a result of estimating game point breakage. The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a significant impact on the Company's operating results for the second quarter of 2018 and comparable periods.On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-01 "Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.", and reclassified RMB38.2 million of accumulated other comprehensive income for the Company's available-for-sale equity securities that existed as of December 31, 2017 into retained earnings upon the adoption. In addition, the Company recorded a net investment loss of RMB78.5 million and RMB56.3 million related to the equity investments with readily determinable fair value in the second quarter and the first quarter of 2018, respectively. Given that there were no material observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investments of the same issuer, the Company did not record any changes to the carrying value of equity investments without readily determinable fair value in the first half of 2018.The Company also adopted ASU 2016-18 "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash" starting from the first quarter of 2018. Pursuant to the new guidance, the Company's cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash increased by an aggregate of RMB717.9 million for the second quarter of 2017, compared to the amounts presented under previous guidance.Conference CallNetEase's management team will host a teleconference call with simultaneous webcast at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday, August 8, 2018 (Beijing/Hong Kong Time: 9:00 a.m., Thursday, August 9, 2018).

These statements are made under the "safe harbor" provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these forward-looking statements by terminology such as "will," "expects," "anticipates," "future," "intends," "plans," "believes," "estimates" and similar statements. The accuracy of these statements may be impacted by a number of business risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or anticipated, including risks related to: the risk that the online game market will not continue to grow or that NetEase will not be able to maintain its leading position in that market, which could occur if, for example, its new online games or expansion packs and other improvements to its existing games do not become as popular as management anticipates; the ability of NetEase to successfully expand its mobile internet offerings; the ability of NetEase to effectively market its games and other services and achieve a positive return on its marketing expenditures; the risk that NetEase's affiliates will not be able to continue operatingMinecraft,World of Warcraft®, StarCraft® II, Hearthstone®,Diablo® III: Reaper of Souls(TM),Heroes of the Storm®,Overwatch® or other games licensed by it for a period of time or permanently due to possible governmental actions or the risk that such games will not be popular with game players in China; the risk that changes in Chinese government regulation of the online game market and the market for NetEase's e-commerce businesses may limit future growth of NetEase's revenues or cause revenues to decline; competition in the online advertising business and the risk that investments by NetEase in its content and services may not increase the appeal of the NetEase websites among internet users or result in increased advertising revenues; the risk that NetEase may not be able to continuously develop new and creative online services, including its ability to maintain and enhance the popularity of its e-mail, mobile and e-commerce businesses and develop attractive mobile games; the risk that NetEase will not be able to control its expenses in future periods; competition in NetEase's existing and potential markets; governmental uncertainties (including possible changes in the effective tax rates applicable to NetEase and its subsidiaries and affiliates and the ability of NetEase to receive and maintain approvals of the preferential tax treatments and general competition and price pressures in the marketplace); the risk that fluctuations in the value of the Renminbi with respect to other currencies could adversely affect NetEase's business and financial results; and other risks outlined in NetEase's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. NetEase does not undertake any obligation to update this forward-looking information, except as required under the applicable law.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresNetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS, as supplemental metrics in reviewing and assessing its operating performance and formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP").NetEase defines non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders as net income attributable to the Company's shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders enables NetEase's management to assess its operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses, which are non-cash charges. NetEase believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating the Company's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP financial measure facilitates investors' assessment of its operating performance.Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders is that it does not reflect all items of expense that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses have been and may continue to be incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. See "Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results" at the end of this press release. NetEase encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.Contact for Media and Investors:Margaret ShiNetEase,

Continue reading Global Electronic Security Market   Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Forecast 2024The report is a comprehensive exploration of global Electronic Security market offering growth rates, size of the industry, competitive landscape information, factors to the contributing growth of the global Electronic Security market and more.Electronic Security Market size is set to exceed USD 60 billion by 2024; according to a new research report.The state and central governments of various countries are placing high focus on the development and adoption of advanced systems in high-traffic locations such as public roads, transit stations, and malls, contributing to the growth of the electronic security market. For instance, the Indian government in 2014 set up a USD 125 million fund solely devoted to the prevention of sexual violence among women through the installation of security equipment such as surveillance systems at high-risk public locations. These hardware systems are equipped with video analytics and advanced algorithms that allow the detection of criminals. Furthermore, technological advancements have also aided in the improvement of existing technologies such as high-resolution 4k cameras and IP surveillance units.Crime rates across the world are heavily impacted with the rising penetration of these systems in residential and commercial settings and is anticipated to drive the electronic security market growth. End-users across the world are replacing conventional security systems such as guards and physical body checks with high-tech solutions. Physical body checks in malls and airports can be cumbersome and increase customer discomfort, primarily among women. X-ray body scanners, on the contrary, requires the person to pass through an electronic frame.The rising trend of the development of smart cities in countries such as China and India is contributing to the high growth of the electronic security market. For instance, the Chinese government has undertaken large construction projects for the development of smart cities imbued with advanced security solutions in cities such as Dalian, Hangzhou, Nanjing, and Tianjin. The rise in traveler population across the world is also leading to the growth of the electronic security market.Request a sample of this premium Research Report at:https://www.marketstudyreport.com/request-a-sample/668596/Public-sector applications are the largest revenue-generating segment. Various government bodies are making use of advanced solutions for surveillance and criminal detection applications. For instance, in September 2017, a police department in Arkansas was reported to be using drones for highly specialized missions such as the tracking of a suspect or obtaining an inside view and additional information in a hostage situation.The North America electronic security market is projected to dominate the global business landscape owing to the government initiatives to integrate these systems into their public safety segment. For instance, the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 contains provisions to make the unmanned aerial systems (UAS) licensing process easier and quicker for law enforcement officials. Various U.S states are currently conducting trial operations on drones to understand their capabilities and their operational efficiency.Players operating in the global electronic security market include Axis Communications, BOSCH Security Systems, Hitachi Ltd, OSI Systems, Inc., SDMS Security Products UK Ltd., Siemens AG, MilliVision Technologies, ASSA ABLOY, Scanna MSC Ltd., Thales Group, RedXDefense LLC, etc. Industry players conduct strategic moves such as mergers and acquisitions to sustain growth. For instance, in July 2017, Assa Abloy announced the acquisition of Arjo Systems SAS to strengthen their physical and digital identity solution provisions.Request a discount on standard prices of this premium report at:https://www.marketstudyreport.com/check-for-discount/668596/Table of Content:Chapter 4.

What I Hope to Learn From the Tech GiantsTargeted News ServiceSeptember 4, 2018 Tuesday 1:21 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1470 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Federal Communications Commission posted the following blog by Chairman Ajit Pai:This coming week, elected officials will have a chance to question those who run Silicon Valley tech giants -- including a hearing on September 5 before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which will feature Twitter co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey. This public scrutiny comes at an important time, as Americans across the political spectrum debate the ever-increasing role of these massive companies in our economy and civic society.Here are a few things I hope to learn from these hearings.1. TransparencyConsumers interact with these digital platforms on a daily basis. We get our news from them. We interact with our family and friends on them. But how do these companies make decisions about what we see and what we don't? And who makes those decisions? We still don't know. Recently, for instance, The New York Times hired a left-wing editorial board member who used racially incendiary language in a plethora of tweets. Those tweets remained on the platform until they were deleted by the user, and she was never suspended. Last month, a conservative commentator took some of those same tweets, substituted a religious group for the racial category in order to, she argued, underscore the original tweets' repugnance -- and was promptly suspended. (To state the obvious, I do not support any of these tweets' sentiments in any way.) After public backlash, Twitter rescinded the suspension, attributing it to an "error." But how was the suspension decision made? Was it by an algorithm or a human? How was the reversal decision made? Similar concerns have been raised with respect to how Twitter manages its own content (like Twitter Moments), how Facebook compiles its News Feed, and how Google orders its search results. Should these companies be more transparent about their business practices? Currently, the FCC imposes strict transparency requirements on companies that operate broadband networks -- how they manage their networks, performance characteristics, and the like. Yet consumers have virtually no insight into similar business practices by tech giants. Do steps need to be taken to ensure that consumers receive more information about how these companies operate, and if so, what should those steps be and who should take them?2. PrivacyTech giants have enormous and unprecedented insight into every part of our daily lives. For instance, a recent Associated Press investigation found that "many Google services on Android devices and iPhones store your location data even if you've used a privacy setting that says it will prevent Google from doing so." (Bear in mind that Android currently has an 88% global mobile operating system market share.) Facebook has shared consumers' personal information with numerous entities, including foreign corporations that U.S. intelligence agencies have indicated raise national security concerns. Most consumers have no idea that their data is being shared in these ways. Most consumers have no idea how this data is being used. Do we need greater transparency when it comes to these companies' privacy practices? And should consumers have greater control over the use of their information?3. Online expressionThe promise of digital platforms is that Americans can express themselves online in a way they couldn't in the analog age. But recent developments suggest that this town square may not be as open as it seems. Almost one year ago, for instance, I observed that "recent experience shows that so-called edge providers are in fact deciding what content [we] see. These providers routinely block or discriminate against content they don't like." I pointed out that many content creators on Google's YouTube platform, like PragerU, said their videos were "demonetized" -- that is, denied advertising revenue critical to their ability to speak online -- without explanation. And many Twitter users said their online messages were restricted without explanation, such as Tennessee Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn's video announcing her campaign for the U.S. Senate and one company's statement on net neutrality (ironically, on a day advocating about the importance of net neutrality).The concerns I highlighted last year only continue. Just last month, for instance, Twitter and Facebook blocked an online campaign ad by Elizabeth Heng, a Cambodian-American Republican congressional candidate in California. The ad featured Khmer Rouge-era footage to underscore her point that her parents saw the United States as a beacon of freedom. After a public backlash, the companies relented and reversed their decisions. (Heng vowed to continue to "fight for internet transparency, so that every American has a chance to be heard.")In addition to the concerns about tech giants serving as gatekeepers of online content domestically, foreign business practices, too, are raising eyebrows. Recently, a bipartisan group of Senators wrote to Google about its reported plan to "launch a censored version of its search engine in China . . . that would prohibit websites and search terms deemed objectionable by the Chinese government and Communist Party." And late last year, Apple's CEO gave a keynote address at the World Internet Conference in China, in which he said the company was "proud to have worked alongside many of our partners in China to help build a community that will join a common future in cyberspace." Translated properly, that is code for delivering a censored internet. To say the least, these practices would never be countenanced at home, not least by the tech giants themselves.These domestic and international trends might explain why last year, the CEO of a tech company called Cloudflare questioned whether it was "the right place for tech companies to be regulating the Internet." He didn't offer a solution, but he did say that "what I know is not the right answer is that a cabal of ten tech executives with names like Matthew, Mark, Jack, [and] Jeff are the ones choosing what content goes online and what content doesn't go online." Indeed, there are plenty of cases in which tech giants decide what consumers see and what they don't. So when we talk about protecting a free and open Internet, shouldn't we be focusing on the part of the Internet economy where it is most at risk?More broadly: Are these tech giants running impartial digital platforms over which they don't exercise editorial judgment when it comes to content? Or do they in fact decide what speech is allowed and what is not and discriminate based on ideology and/or political affiliation? And again, going back to the first point: where is the transparency?* * *These issues of online transparency, privacy, and free expression raise the question of public oversight. And some critics of these companies have called for strict, utility-style regulation. To be clear, I don't believe that is the right answer. The government -- in particular, the Federal Communications Commission, which I have the privilege of leading -- shouldn't regulate these entities like a water company. Among other things, because they are private entities, they do not violate the First Amendment when they make certain business judgments about content on their sites.At the same time, it's important to have a serious conversation about these issues -- not least because these tech giants have come to have much greater influence over our economy and society. Twenty years ago, Google was a small startup. Today, its market capitalization is greater than that of Comcast, AT&#38;T, Verizon, and Charter combined, along with the GDP of Sweden. And it as well as Facebook are gaining a powerful duopoly on digital advertising. Speaking of, fifteen years ago, Facebook was a relatively unknown website for college kids. Today, one out of every three people on Earth is its "friend." Twitter is where everyone from politicians to celebrities to corporate executives makes news and where billions more can read about it and make their own. The public deserves to know more about how these companies operate. And we need to seriously think about whether the time has come for these companies to abide by new transparency obligations. After all, just as is the case with respect to broadband providers, consumers need accurate information in order to make educated choices about whether and how to use these tech giants' platforms.* * *I hope the upcoming congressional hearings can help us have a more informed debate about the practices of these tech giants.

WHAT I HOPE TO LEARN FROM THE TECH GIANTSStates News ServiceSeptember 4, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1458 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC):By Ajit PaiThis coming week, elected officials will have a chance to question those who run Silicon Valley tech giants including a hearing on September 5 before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which will feature Twitter co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey. This public scrutiny comes at an important time, as Americans across the political spectrum debate the ever-increasing role of these massive companies in our economy and civic society.Here are a few things I hope to learn from these hearings.1. TransparencyConsumers interact with these digital platforms on a daily basis. We get our news from them. We interact with our family and friends on them. But how do these companies make decisions about what we see and what we don't? And who makes those decisions? We still don't know. Recently, for instance, The New York Times hired a left-wing editorial board member who used racially incendiary language in a plethora of tweets.

How Trump Is Targeting California's Air Pollution StandardsAtlantic OnlineJuly 31, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 934 wordsByline: Karim DoumarBodyCalifornia's ability to create its own fuel efficiency standards for cars sold in the state is under threat, Environmental Protection Agency director Andrew Wheeler confirmed Friday, as are Obama-era fuel standards for cars and light trucks. A proposal, expected to be released as soon as this week from the EPA, would revoke            permission granted to California in 2012 by the Obama administration that allows the state to establish its own automotive emission regulations.A long courtroom battle would surely follow any attempt to end that relationship. But how did California end up with the ability to set its own emissions rules anyway-and what would happen if that suddenly goes way?The state was first granted this unique ability in 1970, when the Clean Air Act established the first federal air pollution limits. But California already had its own, more stringent emissions standards for vehicles, thanks to the California Air Resources Board (CARB), an earlier clear-air watchdog formed in 1967 in response to the            dangerous smog that afflicted greater Los Angeles and other parts of the state. (Here's a helpful short film about that saga.)Had the new federal standards preempted California's rules, smog control would have become less strict, so the state was exempted from the rule and allowed to set its own pollution benchmarks for cars sold in the state. Currently more than a            dozen other states also follow California's standards; collectively, this market comprises 30 percent of all cars sold in the United States.This represents a challenge for a Trump White House that is determined to undo environmental regulations established by the previous administration. In April, then-EPA chief Scott Pruitt said that the administration planned to            walk back Obama-era guidelines requiring an average fuel efficiency of 54.5 miles per gallon for light trucks and cars by the end of 2025. Instead, the EPA will enforce guidelines through 2021 only. "Cooperative federalism doesn't mean that one state can dictate standards for the rest of the country," Pruitt said in a            statement at the time.After that announcement,            17 states filed a lawsuit against the EPA,            arguing that the rule change was illegal.Simply replacing the 2025 goals with looser new ones couldn't be enforced nationwide, since California and the states that follow it would maintain standards at the level agreed upon with the Obama administration, forcing automakers to either sell cars with different fuel efficiencies in different parts of the country, or simply acquiesce to California's stricter rules."The auto industry does not want to build two sets of vehicles for the U.S.," said Bruce Belzowski, the managing director of Automotive Futures Group, a think tank in Ann Arbor, Michigan.The prospect of standardizing vehicles for the entire American market was a big reason why carmakers agreed to stricter federal standards in 2012 under the Obama administration, according to Belzowski. And the car industry is a global one: American vehicles sold overseas need to be compliant with standards in European and Asia-particularly in China, a huge, emerging market. Severe air-pollution concerns in Chinese cities like Shanghai and Beijing have led the Chinese government            to emphasize electric vehicles and tighter emissions standards recently. The European Union enforces fuel economy standards stricter than those in the United States."Companies that are selling in all those markets want economies of scale, not to do separate things in each country," Belzowski said.Then there's the bigger question of whether the EPA proposal to revoke California's waiver would succeed."No one has ever tried to revoke a waiver before," said Michael Wara, director of the climate and energy policy program at Stanford University. "The question is: Can you do that? What level of scrutiny will the court apply?"For example, Wara says the EPA could interpret the Clean Air Act's waiver section in a more limited fashion. Since California's biggest air pollution problems involve ozone and nitrous oxide, Wara says, the administration could require California to only independently regulate those two gases, hobbling its abilities to oversee overall auto emissions.Still, there are creative ways the state could wriggle around such a limitation. Case in point: leaf blowers. California is successfully            enacting rules governing the use of these            notoriously dirty power tools "not because of carbon dioxide, but because of particulates and other air pollutants," Wara said. "We could do that for cars."Over the last decades, California has been steadily improving            air quality; the months and years ahead could change that. A GOP-funded effort to repeal an increase to the gas tax in the state,            Proposition 7, recently garnered enough signatures to make it on the November ballot. And California is currently            suing the EPA for not enforcing Obama-era regulations limiting methane releases from oil and gas facilities.âš ï¸ This flawed and dangerous measure pushed by Trump's Washington allies jeopardizes the safety of millions of Californians by stopping local communities from fixing their crumbling roads and bridges. Just say no. ðŸ‘Ž            https://t.co/poYNjiPAVA - Jerry Brown (@JerryBrownGov)            June 25, 2018Many            experts are confident that California would prevail in a legal fight over the EPA's waiver. But that waiver only lasts until 2025 and will soon need replacement, setting up the prospect of more high-stakes battles between California and the Trump administration."Fundamentally," Wara said, "California is in a really difficult situation."Load-Date: August 2, 2018End of Document

Game-Changing Ivory Ban Takes Effect But Further Efforts Needed to Ensure Long-Term GainsTargeted News ServiceSeptember 27, 2018 Thursday 8:01 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 694 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: BEIJING, China BodyWWF Global issued the following news release:New research released today by WWF and TRAFFIC reveal that China's elephant ivory trade ban has had significantly positive effects since coming into force on 31 December 2017, but still requires further action to influence key segments of society.Consumer research conducted in collaboration with GlobeScan, an independent consultancy, showed that respondents' claims of past purchase have reduced substantially and future intention to buy ivory products dropped by almost half to 26 per cent when compared to 2017 before the ban took effect. When prompted with information regarding the ivory trade ban, the corresponding percentage is 14 per cent. Support for the ivory ban also remains very high in 2018 with 9 out of 10 respondents saying they support it.All pre-ban legal ivory shops visited by TRAFFIC in 2018 have stopped selling ivory, and the magnitude of illegal ivory trade in most of surveyed cities and online platforms has decreased. The average number of new ivory advertisements in websites and social media platforms decreased by 26.6 per cent and 10.6 per cent, respectively, from pre-ban to post-ban. However the incidence of ivory purchase among regular outbound travellers stands out compared to the other buyers' segments.There are also other concerns with highlighted ivory trafficking hotspots particularly at the border with neighbouring Viet Nam, as well as a rise of activity since 2017 in China's ivory auction market, which remains the only legitimate post-ban commercial outlet for ivory sales. Another point of concern is the low level of respondents' spontaneous (unprompted) awareness of the ivory ban, which remains only 8 per cent since the ban although it has doubled from the period prior to the ban.TRAFFIC visited 157 markets in 23 cities and found 2,812 ivory products in 345 outlets in 2018. Compared to 2017, the number of stores with ivory decreased by 30 per cent. However, the number of ivory products found in three second-tier cities--Chengdu, Chongqing, and Hangzhou--and two third-tier cities--Dongxing and Pingxiang accounts for more than half of the total number in all 23 cities (56.0 per cent)."We are seeing some positive trends in post ivory ban China that indicate the new legislative changes may be yielding positive results. But persisting demand and a lack of awareness among consumers in some parts of the country as well as weak spots with insufficient regulation and enforcement means we need to redouble efforts in strengthening these areas," says Margaret Kinnaird, WWF Wildlife Practice Leader.Despite these positive trends, further examination of the current exemption allowing antique ivory to be sold at auction revealed potential loopholes for laundering illegal ivory. Visits to 17 pre-auction exhibitions in Beijing, Shanghai, Suzhou and Nanjing in 2018 showed lack of compliance with the need to obtain administrative approvals from relevant authorities. Seven of them were in apparent violation of the laws and regulations related to elephant ivory auctions, resulting in 219 lots of elephant ivory items being withdrawn by law enforcement officers (with an estimated value between USD974,282 and USD1,082,536). During the survey, TRAFFIC also found some auctions mislabeled auction items in the catalogues in order to evade ivory trade supervision."These three studies provide a critical tool for Chinese government efforts to further strengthen market supervision, law enforcement and public education for effective implementation to ensure the long-term success of the ivory trade ban." says Ling XU, overall coordinator of these research studies in China. "The closure of the legal ivory market has set a benchmark for other countries such as Viet Nam, where domestic ivory markets continue to drive elephant poaching and we hope that these studies will inform dialogues at key international fora such as the upcoming London Conference on Illegal Wildlife Trade and build a united global effort to achieve the goal of stamping out ivory trafficking for the benefit of elephant conservation."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6458166 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: September 27, 2018End of Document

Search resumes for 23 missing tourists in Thai boat tragedyAssociated Press InternationalJuly 7, 2018 Saturday 3:21 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 652 wordsByline: By VINCENT THIAN, Associated PressDateline: PHUKET, Thailand BodyPHUKET, Thailand (AP) - Divers who entered the wreck of a tour boat that sank in a storm off the southern Thai resort island of Phuket described heart-breaking scenes of bodies of children found in the arms of their mothers, as a search resumed Saturday for some 23 mostly Chinese tourists missing.The death toll from Thursday's tragedy hit 33, all of them Chinese nationals, in Thai tourism's biggest disaster in years."It's very difficult to see ... it's traumatic, it's tragic but the best thing to do, our job as divers, is to bring back the bodies to their families," diver Philip Entremont told reporters before resuming the search Saturday.The boat, with 105 people, including 93 tourists, capsized and sank after it was hit by 5-meter (16-foot) high waves.The death toll jumped Friday after the navy sent divers to the wreck on Friday. In images shortly after the sinking, rescued people sat in large rubber life rafts surrounded by churning seas.Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, the leader of Thailand's military government, expressed his "sympathies and deepest condolences" to the families of the dead. The government will "exert all efforts to find those still missing and provide support to all survivors of this tragic event," he said in a statement.Reports in Thai media said police charged the owner and captain of the stricken ship with carelessness causing death and injury.Chinese Ambassador Lyu Jian had an "emergency conversation" by phone with Thai Deputy Prime Minister Somkid Jatusripitak, the Chinese Embassy said in a statement. It quoted the envoy calling on Thailand to quickly mobilize an intensive search for the missing and "to tend and make appropriate arrangements for the rescued Chinese tourists, treat and cure the injured and receive family members of the Chinese tourists involved."Lyu said it hoped the cause of the capsizing would be quickly ascertained and asked Somkid to have the relevant Thai agencies closely cooperate with China on the matter.Fatal accidents among foreign tourists at Thai beaches are not unusual, but normally involve drownings in unsafe swimming areas or accidents involving smaller boats.Thai officials were rushing to cope with some of the logistics of the aftermath of the sinking.At the request of Phuket's governor, the Phuket Tourist Association was seeking 80 volunteer Chinese language translators to assist the outgoing Chinese passengers at the provincial airport.Many of the victims had been on group tours, booked in Phuket and China.The government of the eastern Chinese city of Haining in Zhejiang province said on its official microblog account that it received a distress alert sent by phone text message from the head of the Haining Haipai Furniture Co. Ltd., from Thailand Friday morning.It said that 37 of the furniture company's employees and family members had traveled together to Phuket and that on July 5 at around 5 p.m. they encountered the "biggest storm in five years" and they sought the government's help. The group had booked their tours to the islands online on their own, said the posting.A Chinese tour operator based in the central province of Hunan said on its official Sina Weibo account that three travelers it had booked were missing.Lazy Cat Travel said it had sent personnel to Phuket to help out its clients, who also included 35 passengers who had to be rescued from another boat that it had chartered that ran into trouble on Thursday. It said that second boat had lost power after being swamped by waves. All on board were returned safely to shore.The accidents came as rescuers, also led by Thai navy divers, support 12 boys and their soccer coach stranded nearly two weeks inside a flooded cave in the country's far north, and try to determine how and when to extract them.___Associated Press researcher Shanshan Wang in Beijing and writer Eileen Ng in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, contributed to this report.Load-Date: July 7, 2018End of Document

REC Silicon - Second quarter 2018 resultsThomson Reuters ONEJuly 19, 2018 Thursday 12:55 AM ESTCopyright 2018 Comtex News Network, Inc.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 GLOBE NEWSWIRE. All rights reserved.This content is provided to LexisNexis by Comtex News Network, Inc.Length: 817 wordsBodyFornebu, Norway - July 19, 2018: REC Silicon ASA (REC Silicon) reported second quarter 2018 revenues of USD 58.9 million, down from USD 69.6 million in the previous quarter. The corresponding EBITDA during the second quarter was a loss of USD 9.6 million compared to a positive USD 14.6 million in the previous quarter. Polysilicon sales volume for the quarter was 2,077 MT, a 28.5 percent decrease from the first quarter, while inventory increased by 401 MT.REC Silicon reported a cash balance of USD 42.4 million on June 30, 2018. This represents a decrease of USD 69.6 million compared to March 31, 2018. The company refinanced its outstanding debt during the quarter with a net repayment of USD 59.5 million. Cash outflows from operations was USD 7.1 million for the quarter.Silicon gas sales volumes for the second quarter were 918 MT, an increase of 2.4 percent compared to the first quarter. Prices were 2.1 percent higher than first quarter. Second quarter semiconductor polysilicon production was 267 MT, in line with guidance of 270 MT.FBR capacity utilization was decreased to approximately 25 percent in early June resulting in cash costs of USD 13.4/kg, compared to USD 9.40/kg in the first quarter. FBR production was 2,078 MT, a 1,049MT decrease compared to the first quarter.The Yulin JV plant continued to operate at reduced capacity utilization during the second quarter.

Year-to-date, the plant has produced a total of 1,800 MT compared to a target of 8,000 MT for 2018.REC Silicon reported impairment charges of USD 340.4 million due to the market disruption from the curtailment of solar incentives in China, as well as continued trade barriers that prevent access to primary markets inside China. As previously announced on July 1, 2018, REC Silicon reduced its Moses Lake workforce by approximately 30 percent.President and CEO, Tore Torvund, said, "Although our semiconductor and silane gas business in Butte remains strong, it is regrettable that we had to reduce our headcount by 85 highly-skilled employees. Despite having the most advanced polysilicon manufacturing technology; REC Silicon has no access to the largest market for polysilicon in China due to the 57 percent duty imposed by China. We need the United States and Chinese governments to cooperate in ending the solar trade dispute between the two countries to prevent additional job losses and to enhance the value of the solar industry in the United States and China."For more information, please see the attached second quarter 2018 report.Morning Program:The company will give a presentation at 8:00 am CET today at Hoyres Hus Konferansesenter, Stortingsgaten 20, Oslo, Norway.

Twitter's Dorsey takes heat on bias allegations: Key moments from tech hearingsPolitico.comSeptember 5, 2018 Wednesday 11:48 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 1534 wordsByline: clima@politico.com,  (Cristiano Lima)BodyRepublican lawmakers Wednesday revived allegations that Twitter has suppressed conservative voices on its platform, a claim that Democrats and company CEO Jack Dorsey sharply challenged in the second of two back-to-back, high-stakes congressional hearings for the tech leader. At a House Energy and Commerce committee hearing, GOP leaders said they remain unsatisfied with Twitter's explanations for what they see as "shadow banning" that reduces the visibility of their accounts. The flap gained renewed prominence last month, after President Donald Trump took to Twitter to bash tech companies for "silencing millions of people" - a claim he has yet to substantiate. Earlier Wednesday, Dorsey and Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg fielded questions for nearly three hours on their companies' efforts to combat online disinformation and foreign influence operations ahead of the midterm elections. Lawmakers also pressed the executives on an array of issues including data privacy, hate speech and doing business in China.Both hearings, however, veered into bizarre political theater at times, complete with a disruption from a screaming far-right activist who was drowned out by Republican Billy Long performing an auctioneering routine; a conspicuously empty chair set aside in the Senate hearing to highlight Google's absence; and a cameo from InfoWars host Alex Jones.Here's a look at the top moments from the hearings so far. House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden began his questioning of Dorsey by raising GOP allegations of shadow banning. Republicans claim an incident this summer in which some conservative accounts were excluded from Twitter's auto-complete search field is part of that trend.Dorsey said the incident was part of an experimentation with the search function that was quickly corrected. He stressed the company strives for "impartiality" and has found no evidence of a bias against conservatives in its algorithms. "Looking at the data, we analyzed tweets sent by all members of the House and Senate, and found no statistically significant difference between the number of times a tweet by a Democrat is viewed versus a Republican, even after our ranking and filtering of tweets has been applied," he said at the start of the hearing.But Walden said the practice of limiting the visibility of certain accounts was troublesome."It doesn't matter what your definition of shadow banning is, when the expectation you are giving to your users who choose to follow certain accounts is different from what they see on their timeline and in their searches," he said. Democrats, who have long argued the GOP's anti-tech crusade is politically motivated and disingenuous, cited the president's own Twitter habits in challenging Republican claims of bias. "I think it's the height of hypocrisy when Trump and congressional Republicans criticize Twitter for supposed political bias when he uses the platform every day for his juvenile tweets and spreading lies," said Rep. Frank Pallone, the panel's top Democrat. Still, Pallone said Twitter needs to take steps to protect its users."Twitter's policies have been inconsistent and confusing. The company's enforcement seems to chase the latest headline as opposed to addressing systemic problems," he said.Dorsey offered a series of mea culpas on Wednesday, acknowledging shortcomings in Twitter's content moderation and transparency practices.Asked about a doctored photo of a grieving Meghan McCain with a gun pointed to her head, which circulated for hours on Twitter, Dorsey vowed to apologize to the family.The image appeared on Twitter during the memorial services for the late Sen. John McCain, who died last month following a battle with cancer. The post prompted Meghan McCain's husband, Ben Domenech, to tweet directly at Dorsey demanding that it be taken down.Earlier in the day, the CEO conceded that the company needs to do more to inform users when a foreign influence campaign has been detected on its platform. "We simply haven't done enough," Dorsey told Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine.). Collins noted that Twitter has taken down more than 3,800 accounts linked to the Russian Internet Research Agency, including one purporting to represent the Tennessee GOP with more than 140,000 followers. They sometimes "spread conspiracy theories and false claims of voter fraud," Collins noted.Facebook's Sandberg didn't have many hard details to offer as Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) peppered her with questions about revenue from Russian troll farms.Harris asked Sandberg how much revenue Facebook generated from content - both ads and free posts - from Russia's Internet Research Agency. Sandberg said the IRA spent a total of $100,000 on ads, a tally Facebook previously disclosed. But she said there's no way of knowing just how much revenue Facebook made off the IRA and other Russian accounts. Still, Sandberg said, "Any amount is too much."Sen. Joe Manchin asked Dorsey and Sandberg about the sale of opioids drugs on their platforms. "Do you all feel any responsibility?" Manchin asked. "A lot of people have been affected and a lot of people have died receiving information about how to obtain drugs through y'all's platforms."Manchin suggested Congress could again chisel away at Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which affords internet firms legal protections for content posted by users. Lawmakers earlier this year passed a carveout for cases of online sex trafficking."We passed bills that held you liable," Manchin said about the anti-sex trafficking effort. "Don't you think we should do the same with opioid drugs and the way they're being used on your platform?"Dorsey replied that Twitter is "certainly open to dialogue" on the issue and Sandberg echoed the remarks, adding that Facebook would "want to work very closely on how this would be enacted."Sen. Marco Rubio pressed Sandberg on how the social networking site handles repressive regimes overseas, asking whether Facebook would bend its principles to enter markets like China, where it's currently blocked. "We would only operate in a country when we can do so in keeping with our values," Sandberg said."And that would apply to China as well?" Rubio followed up."That would apply to China as well," Sandberg replied.China has become a lucrative growth market for companies like Apple. But the Chinese government's tight controls over citizens' speech on the internet has kept out companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter. InfoWars founder Alex Jones livestreamed his entrance into the Senate building early Wednesday, and proceeded to slam Facebook and Twitter outside the hearing room. "I'm here to face my accuser," Jones told reporters at one point.Last month, many of the major internet companies said Jones violated their rules against hate speech and inciting violence. Twitter suspended him, while Facebook, Google's YouTube and other platforms banned him outright.On Wednesday, Jones cited those actions as he called for the breakup of big tech companies.Just a few hours later, during the House hearing, far-right activist Laura Loomer stood up and started shouting from the back of the hearing room. "You are a liar, Jack Dorsey!" yelled Loomer, a former operative with the conservative undercover video producer Project Veritas. At Walden's request, Capitol police officers escorted Loomer out. At that, Rep. Billy Long dusted off his professional training (he was an auctioneer and radio host before being elected to Congress) with a rapid-fire imitation of a live auction, meant to drown out the uninvited guest.The fireworks continued in the halls of Congress as Jones confronted Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who was speaking to reporters.The exchange quickly went downhill when the senator warned the conspiracy-peddling host, who was standing beside him in the hallway, to "not touch me again.""I'm just patting you nicely," Jones responded, before accusing Rubio of trying to get him arrested. Rubio rebuffed the charge, adding: "I'll take care of you myself.""Rubio just threatened to physically take care of me," Jones replied, an insinuation Rubio disputed.Senate Intelligence leaders criticized Google for not sending a CEO to speak alongside Sandberg and Dorsey after weeks of publicly sparring with the search giant over the matter."Google has an immense responsibility in this space," Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the panel's top Democrat, said in opening comments at the hearing. "Given its size and influence, I would have thought the leadership at Google would want to demonstrate how seriously it takes these challenges and to lead this important public discussion."Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Warner both said they were "disappointed" in Google, which sent neither CEO Sundar Pichai nor Larry Page, the head of Google parent company Alphabet. Google had offered  senior vice president of global affairs Kent Walker, but the committee rejected that option. The committee followed through on threats to place an empty chair labeled "Google" where an executive would have sat, in a symbolic rebuke of the company. John Hendel and Ashley Gold contributed to this report. Load-Date: September 6, 2018End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 26 of 369Editor's Corner—Here are the U.S. wireless carriers currently using Huawei equipment  Page 29 of 369NAWG JULY 12, 2018 WEEKLY UPDATES  Page 32 of 369Global Big Data Analytics In Defense & Aerospace - Market and Technology Forecast to 2026  Page 34 of 369Mobile shares rise amid 5G deal with Ericsson  Page 36 of 369Genetic Technologies Announces Proposed Joint Venture with Beijing Zishan Health Consultancy Limited  Page 38 of 369SEC Concludes Investigation of Sinovac  Page 40 of 369SEC Concludes Investigation of Sinovac  Page 42 of 369Alibaba is ready for a trade war  Page 44 of 369Alibaba is ready for a trade war  Page 57 of 369Wal-Mart, Microsoft Take Aim At Amazon With Cloud Tech; Microsoft CEO Calls For A.I.
