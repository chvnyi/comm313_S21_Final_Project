"For the fourth quarter, our total net revenues continued to grow year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Although a few mobile titles such asOnmyojiand the mobile version ofNew Ghostexperienced a decline, we have introduced new content for these games to attract players. During the fourth quarter, we held substantial promotions to support the successful launch of our new battle arena gamesKnives Out,Terminator 2:Judgment DayandRules of Survival. We also made additional investments to further scale our thriving e-commerce businesses. We believe these strategic investments provide us with extended reach and momentum to support our future long-term growth."Our business remains strong and our 2018 initiatives to bring exciting new titles to our robust and diverse portfolio of self-developed games are well underway. To expand our reach, we will also seek partnerships with other industry leaders to bring mobile and PC-client games to audiences worldwide.

We will continue to expand ourKaola.comandYanxuane-commerce platforms in 2018 along with our other business segments where we see opportunities to generate value for our shareholders, as well as serve and grow our community of users by providing best-in-class online content and services," Mr. Ding concluded.Change in Segment ReportingEffective as of December 31, 2017, the Company changed its segment disclosure to separately report the financial results of its e-commerce business in light of the significant growth of the revenue contribution from e-commerce to the Company's total consolidated net revenues in 2017. This segment primarily reflects the results of NetEase's two e-commerce platforms,Kaola.comandYanxuan, which were established in January 2015 and April 2016, respectively. The Company now reports four reporting segments: online game services, e-commerce, advertising services, and e-mail and others. This change in segment reporting aligns with the manner in which the Company's operating decision maker ("CODM") currently receives and uses financial information to allocate resources and evaluate the performance of reporting segments. This change in segment presentation does not affect consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of income or consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company retrospectively revised prior period segment information to conform to current period presentation.Fourth Quarter 2017 Financial ResultsNetRevenuesNet revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were RMB14,607.6 million (US$2,245.2 million), compared to RMB12,477.8 million and RMB12,099.0 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively.Net revenues from online games were RMB8,004.4 million (US$1,230.2 million) for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to RMB8,111.7 million and RMB8,959.1 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. Mobile games accounted for approximately 68.0% of net revenues from online games for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 68.3% and 64.4% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively.Net revenues from e-commerce were RMB4,653.7 million (US$715.3 million) for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to RMB2,667.5 million and RMB1,691.2 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively.Net revenues from advertising services were RMB736.6 million (US$113.2 million) for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to RMB631.4 million and RMB664.8 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. The top performing advertising verticals in the fourth quarter of 2017 were automobile, internet services and real estate sectors.Net revenues from e-mail and others were RMB1,213.0 million (US$186.4 million) for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to RMB1,067.2 million and RMB783.8 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively.Gross Profit/(Loss)Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 was RMB5,744.6 million (US$882.9 million), compared to RMB5,947.6 million and RMB6,463.3 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively.The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter decreases in online game services gross profit were primarily due to decreased revenue contribution from self-developed mobile games such asOnmyoji.The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases in e-commerce gross profit were primarily due to the rapid development ofKaola.comandYanxuan.The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases in advertising services gross profit were primarily due to NetEase's enhanced monetization efforts and better economies of scale.The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter decreases in e-mail and others gross profit were primarily due to decreased revenue contribution from certain online platform businesses, which have relatively higher margins, as well as the one-off recognition of expense related to certain copyrights in the fourth quarter of 2017.Gross Profit/ (Loss) MarginGross profit margin for online game services for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 61.4%, compared to 62.5% and 60.7% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. The year-over-year increase in gross profit margin was mainly due to the one-off recognition of certain royalty expenses related to licensed games in the fourth quarter of 2016, which was partially offset by increased staff-related costs. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in gross profit margins was mainly due to increased staff-related costs.Gross profit margin for e-commerce for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 7.4%, compared to 11.5% and 12.5% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter decreases in e-commerce gross profit margin were primarily due to the larger-scale promotions and certain sales discounts in the fourth quarter of 2017, such as Singles Day on November 11, 2017.Gross profit margin for advertising services for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 71.2%, compared to 68.0% and 66.5% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases in gross profit margin were mainly due to NetEase's enhanced monetization efforts and better economies of scale.Gross loss margin for e-mail and others for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 3.3%, compared to gross profit margin of 13.1% and 46.9% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter decreases in gross margin were primarily due to the decreased revenue contribution from certain online platform businesses, which have relatively higher gross profit margins, as well as the one-off recognition of expense related to certain copyrights in the fourth quarter of 2017.Operating ExpensesTotal operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were RMB4,317.8 million (US$663.6 million), compared to RMB3,397.9 million and RMB2,596.6 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases in operating expenses were mainly due to increased selling and marketing expenses and research and development investments, and higher staff-related costs, as well as increased operating expenses related to NetEase's e-commerce businesses. Shipping and handling costs included in selling and marketing expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were RMB393.3 million (US$60.4 million), compared to RMB294.8 million and RMB177.2 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively.Income TaxesThe Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB290.4 million (US$44.6 million) for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to RMB225.5 million and RMB882.0 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 18.2%, compared to 8.1% and 19.2% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. The changes in the effective tax rate were mainly due to the fact that certain subsidiaries of the Company were recognized as Key Software Enterprises in the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2017, and subject to a preferential tax rate of 10% for 2016. The Company recognized related tax credits in the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2017 accordingly.Net Income After TaxNet income attributable to the Company's shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled RMB1.3 billion (US$197.6 million), compared to RMB2.5 billion and RMB3.7 billion for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively.

The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter changes in foreign exchange gains and losses were mainly due to unrealized exchange gains and losses arising from the Company's U.S. dollar-denominated bank deposits and short-term loan balances as the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the RMB fluctuated over the periods.NetEase reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$1.50 and US$1.49, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$2.95 and US$2.93, respectively, for the preceding quarter, and basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$4.31 and US$4.28, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2016.

The increase in operating expenses in 2017 was primarily due to increased selling and marketing expenses and research and development investments, and higher staff-related costs, as well as increased operating expenses related to NetEase's e-commerce businesses.

The changes in foreign exchange gains and losses were mainly due to unrealized exchange gains and losses arising from the Company's U.S. dollar-denominated bank deposits and short-term loan balances as the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the RMB fluctuated over these periods.NetEase reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$12.50 and US$12.41, respectively, for fiscal year 2017, and basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$13.59 and US$13.48, respectively, for fiscal year 2016. Non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS were US$14.85 and US$14.73, respectively, for fiscal year 2017, compared to non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$15.06 and US$14.94, respectively, for fiscal year 2016.Quarterly DividendThe board of directors has approved a dividend of US$0.38 per ADS for the fourth quarter of 2017, which is expected to be paid on March 2, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 23, 2018.NetEase paid dividends of US$1.08 per ADS for the first quarter of 2017 on June 2, 2017, US$0.83 per ADS for the second quarter of 2017 on September 1, 2017 and US$0.72 per ADS for the third quarter of 2017 on December 8, 2017, respectively.Under the Company's quarterly dividend policy announced on May 13, 2014, quarterly dividends will be set at an amount equivalent to approximately 25% of the Company's anticipated net income after tax in each fiscal quarter. The determination to make dividend distributions and the amount of such distributions in any particular quarter will be made at the discretion of the board of directors and will be based upon the Company's operations and earnings, cash flow, financial condition and other relevant factors.Other InformationAs of December 31, 2017, the Company's total cash and cash equivalents, current and non-current time deposits and short-term investments balance totaled RMB43.2 billion (US$6.6 billion), compared to RMB36.9 billion as of December 31, 2016.

These statements are made under the "safe harbor" provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these forward-looking statements by terminology such as "will," "expects," "anticipates," "future," "intends," "plans," "believes," "estimates" and similar statements. The accuracy of these statements may be impacted by a number of business risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or anticipated, including risks related to: the risk that the online game market will not continue to grow or that NetEase will not be able to maintain its leading position in that market, which could occur if, for example, its new online games or expansion packs and other improvements to its existing games do not become as popular as management anticipates; the ability of NetEase to successfully expand its mobile internet offerings; the ability of NetEase to effectively market its games and other services and achieve a positive return on its marketing expenditures; the risk that NetEase's affiliates will not be able to continue operatingMinecraft,World of Warcraft®, StarCraft® II, Hearthstone®,Diablo® III: Reaper of Souls(TM), Heroes of the Storm®,Overwatch® or other games licensed by it for a period of time or permanently due to possible governmental actions or the risk that such games will not be popular with game players in China; the risk that changes in Chinese government regulation of the online game market and the market for NetEase's e-commerce businesses may limit future growth of NetEase's revenues or cause revenues to decline; competition in the online advertising business and the risk that investments by NetEase in its content and services may not increase the appeal of the NetEase websites among internet users or result in increased advertising revenues; the risk that NetEase may not be able to continuously develop new and creative online services, including its ability to maintain and enhance the popularity of its e-mail, mobile and e-commerce businesses and develop attractive mobile games; the risk that NetEase will not be able to control its expenses in future periods; competition in NetEase's existing and potential markets; governmental uncertainties (including possible changes in the effective tax rates applicable to NetEase and its subsidiaries and affiliates and the ability of NetEase to receive and maintain approvals of the preferential tax treatments and general competition and price pressures in the marketplace); the risk that fluctuations in the value of the Renminbi with respect to other currencies could adversely affect NetEase's business and financial results; and other risks outlined in NetEase's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. NetEase does not undertake any obligation to update this forward-looking information, except as required under the applicable law.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresNetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS, as supplemental metrics in reviewing and assessing its operating performance and formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP").NetEase defines non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders as net income attributable to the Company's shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses and impairment on long-term investment of available-for-sale securities. Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders enables NetEase's management to assess its operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses and impairment on long-term investment of available-for-sale securities, which are non-cash charges. NetEase believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating the Company's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP financial measure facilitates investors' assessment of its operating performance.Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders is that it does not reflect all items of expense that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses and impairment on long-term investment of available-for-sale securities have been and may continue to be incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. See "Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results" at the end of this press release. NetEase encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. Contact for Media and Investors:Margaret ShiNetEase,

Trust Is Collapsing in AmericaAtlantic OnlineJanuary 21, 2018 SundayCopyright 2018 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1140 wordsByline: Uri FriedmanBody"In God We Trust," goes the motto of the United States. In God, and apparently little else.Only a third of Americans now trust their government "to do what is right"-a decline of 14 percentage points from last year, according to a new report by the communications marketing firm Edelman. Forty-two percent trust the media, relative to 47 percent a year ago. Trust in business and non-governmental organizations, while somewhat higher than trust in government and the media, decreased by 10 and nine percentage points, respectively. Edelman, which for 18 years has been asking people around the world about their level of trust in various institutions, has never before recorded such steep drops in trust in the United States."This is the first time that a massive drop in trust has not been linked to a pressing economic issue or catastrophe like [Japan's 2011] Fukushima nuclear disaster," Richard Edelman, the head of the firm, noted in announcing the findings. "In fact, it's the ultimate irony that it's happening at a time of prosperity, with the stock market and employment rates in the U.S. at record highs.""The root cause of this fall," he added-just days after polling revealed that Americans' definition of "fake news" depends as much on their politics as the accuracy of the news, and a Republican senator            condemned the American president's Stalinesque attacks on the press and "evidence-based truth," and a leading think tank            warned that America was suffering from "truth decay" as a result of political polarization and social media-is a "lack of objective facts and rational discourse."It used to be that what Edelman labels the "informed public"-those aged 25 to 64 who have a college degree, regularly consume news, and are in the top 25 percent of household income for their age group-placed far greater trust in institutions than the U.S. public as a whole. This year, however, the gap all but vanished, with trust in government in particular plummeting 30 percentage points among the informed public. America is now home to the least-trusting informed public of the 28 countries that the firm surveyed, right below South Africa. Distrust is growing most among younger, high-income Americans.But whereas trust is falling in the United States and a number of other countries with tumultuous politics at the moment, including            South Africa,            Italy, and            Brazil, it's actually increasing elsewhere, most prominently in China. Eighty-four percent of Chinese respondents said they trusted government-levels the United States hasn't seen since the            early Johnson administration-and 71 percent said they trusted the media. The world's two most powerful countries, one democratic and the other authoritarian, are moving in opposite directions. In each case, the trajectory is largely being determined by people's views of government.Chinese respondents are probably reflecting on the upward mobility and improving quality of life that their political leaders have helped deliver, David Bersoff, the lead researcher for the Edelman report, told me: "I'm looking at my life now and it looks a lot better than it did before, and I can look forward and still see things that would get even better." When I asked Richard Edelman why survey participants tended to trust technology companies much more than government, he reasoned that it was because those companies "have products that perform for you every day-whether it's your cell phone or your airline." Chinese respondents might have been making a similar statement about the government's performance."There's a lot of chaos and uncertainty in the world, and when there is chaos and uncertainty in the world centralized, authoritative power tends to do better," Bersoff added. (It's worth noting that other countries with high trust levels in the report range politically from democratic India to more-or-less democratic Indonesia and Singapore to the undemocratic United Arab Emirates.)Percent Change in Trust in Government, Media, Business, and NGOs, 2017 - 2018           2018 Edelman Trust BarometerWhy, though, is trust eroding in the United States in the absence of an economic crisis or other kind of catastrophe? What's changed, according to the Edelman report, is that it's gotten much harder to discern what is and isn't true-where the boundaries are between fact, opinion, and misinformation."The lifeblood of democracy is a common understanding of the facts and information that we can then use as a basis for negotiation and for compromise," said Bersoff. "When that goes away, the whole foundation of democracy gets shaken.""This is a global, not an American issue," Edelman told me. "And it's undermining confidence in all the other institutions because if you don't have an agreed set of facts, then it's really hard to judge whether the prime minister is good or bad, or a company is good or bad." A recent            Pew Research Center poll, in fact, found across dozens of countries that satisfaction with the news media was typically highest in countries where trust in government and positive views of the economy were highest, though it didn't investigate how these factors were related to one another.America actually falls in the middle of surveyed countries in terms of trust in the media, which emerges from the Edelman poll as the least-trusted institution globally of the four under consideration. (In the United States, the firm finds, Donald Trump voters are over two times more likely than Hillary Clinton voters to distrust the media.) Nearly 70 percent of respondents globally were concerned about "fake news" being used as a weapon and 63 percent said they weren't sure how to tell good journalism from rumor or falsehoods. Most respondents agreed that the media was too focused on attracting large audiences, breaking news, and supporting a particular political ideology rather than informing the public with accurate reporting. While trust in journalism actually increased a bit in Edelman's survey this year, trust in search and social-media platforms dipped.  Percent Trust in Media and Change From 2017 to 2018           2018 Edelman Trust BarometerIn last year's survey, the perspective that many respondents expressed was "'I'm not sure about the future of my job because of robots or globalization. I'm not sure about my community anymore because there are a lot of new people coming in. I'm not sure about my economic future; in fact, it looks fairly dim because I'm downwardly mobile,'" Edelman said. These sentiments found expression in the success of populist politicians in the United States and Europe, who promised a return to past certainties. Now, this year, truth itself seems more uncertain."We're desperately looking for land," Edelman observed. "We're flailing, and people can't quite get a sense of reality." It's no way to live, let alone sustain a democracy.Load-Date: January 22, 2018End of Document

Homeland Security Committee Passes Two Portman Amendments Targeting Synthetic OpioidsTargeted News ServiceMarch 7, 2018 Wednesday 6:57 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 474 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe office of Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, issued the following news release:The Senate Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs Committee today approved two amendments offered by U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Authorization Act to combat the influx of synthetic opioids in our country. Portman authored the amendments with Senator Tom Carper (D-DE). The amendments build on the shocking report from the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI) detailing how drug traffickers exploit vulnerabilities in our international mail system to easily ship synthetic drugs like fentanyl from China into the United States."Synthetic opioids like fentanyl are killing Ohioans and people across America, and they're coming into the country through our own postal service," said Senator Portman. "These two amendments build on recommendations we made in our groundbreaking PSI report and require DHS to follow through and ensure we make progress in our efforts to stop drug traffickers in China from shipping these poisons into our communities. This epidemic is devastating our communities, and I'm pleased the committee is taking an active role in ensuring we have effective oversight of DHS. I'd like to thank Senator Carper for his leadership on this issue and will continue to work with him and the rest of my colleagues to address this important issue."NOTE: On January 24, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI) released a stunning report detailing how drug traffickers exploit vulnerabilities in our international mail system to easily ship synthetic drugs like fentanyl from China into the United States. Last year alone, 318 million international packages entered the U.S. with no advanced electronic data such as a shipper and recipient's names, address, or contents--which is used by federal law enforcement agencies to target packages containing illegal items, like fentanyl. Portman has introduced bipartisan legislation - the Synthetics Trafficking & Overdose Prevention (STOP) Act - designed to help prevent these synthetic drugs like fentanyl from being shipped from China into the United States through our the Postal Service.The Portman/Carper Amendments that passed the committee today would:* Require DHS to develop a strategy to fulfill one of the recommendations in the PSI report to increase counter-narcotics information sharing between Customs & Border Protection, the U.S. Postal Service, and the express consignment carriers on these drug shipments, known drug traffickers, and best practices.* Require DHS to report on another recommendation in the PSI report for DHS to engage the Chinese government on synthetic opioid production and mail shipments through the U.S.-China Law Enforcement and Cybersecurity Dialogue.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6195350 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: March 8, 2018End of Document

Melamine Procurement Research - Market Trends and Spend Analysis by SpendedgeBusiness WireFebruary 8, 2018 Thursday 8:15 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Business Wire, Inc.Distribution: Business EditorsLength: 807 wordsDateline: LONDON BodyGlobal procurement intelligence advisory firm, SpendEdge , has announced the release of their            'Melamine Market Procurement Research Report.' The insights and data in this report provide a strategic analysis of the supply markets, factors influencing purchasing decisions, procurement best practices, pricing models, supplier landscape, and an analysis of the supplier capability matrix for the            chemicals industry . This report breaks down the data and analysis behind the procurement of melamine and acts as an all-inclusive guide for making smart purchasing decisions.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180208005683/en/Global Melamine Procurement Market Intelligence Report (Graphic: Business Wire)"The demand for melamine will be primarily driven by its application in packaging, construction, and automotive industries to make adhesives, coating, flooring, and plywood," says SpendEdge procurement analyst Tridib Bora. "Also, the global melamine demand-supply scenario has been stable for 2017 due to limited plant downtime, which ensured consistent supply to meet steady demand from end-user industries such as automotive, packaging, and construction," added Tridib.Looking for more insights from this report?

Chinese melamine is priced relatively low when compared with other regions due to cheap labor costs and liberal regional regulation. Moreover, the low-cost of Chinese imports affect the sales of locally produced melamine, which are comparatively expensive. Also, the increasing competition among local suppliers may lead to the reduction of procurement costs for buyers in this market space.Stable demand-supply scenario for melamine across the globe:The unplanned closures due to maintenance, production issues such as bottlenecks or equipment failure, and government environmental inspections deeply affected the Chinese melamine suppliers in 2016. This resulted in a shortage of melamine worldwide as China has been a major producer. However, in 2017 the demand-supply scenario was stable worldwide due to a reduction in plant downtime. Also, stable plant performance helps the buyers to ensure a steady supply of melamine.Declining operating rates for urea plants:Urea is a key raw material used to manufacture melamine. The suppliers expect that urea prices might decrease because of oversupply in the market over the next few years. Hence, suppliers of urea worldwide are trying to reduce their plant's operating rate to balance urea's demand-supply. This reduction can also be attributed to the high availability of shale gas, which is also used to make melamine.Get unlimited access to all our reports.

He followed that up Friday with a tweet that said "trade wars are good, and easy to win."Investors are worried that Trump stance could set off a wave of protectionist policies across the globe that will hurt businesses and the economy.US stock futures were sharply lower.Benchmark indexes in Frankfurt and Paris shed roughly 2% in early trade, while stocks in London dropped by 1%. The Nikkei dropped 2.5% in Tokyo, while Hong Kong stocks slid 1.5%."Trump's announcement not only increases the specter of a global trade war but also neatly highlights the fracturing of the global compact which has been in place over recent decades," Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at currency trading platform AxiTrader, said in a note to clients.Trump said his administration would impose a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum.Investors are worried how major US trading partners like China, Canada and the European Union will respond."Markets are particularly vulnerable if we see retaliatory moves," said Ric Spooner, chief analyst at stock broker CMC Markets.If more and more countries put up tariffs on goods coming into their territory, that could push up prices for consumers and depress global trade, which has helped spur recent growth in many major economies around the world."Trade is just about the only thing economists are agreed on -- more is better," Rob Carnell, chief Asia-Pacific economist at Dutch bank ING, wrote in a research note.Trump's announcement dealt a direct blow to US stocks on Thursday. The Dow fell nearly 1.7% Thursday, while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 both declined 1.3%.Analysts in Asia are paying particular attention to what happens in the relationship between the world's two largest economies, the US and China.While steel and aluminum make up just a small part of China's exports to the US, Trump's move "is expected to invite the ire" of America's largest trading partner, Jingyi Pan, a market strategist with investment advisory firm IG, said in a note to clients.Shanghai's main stock index fell 0.6% Friday. The losses were smaller than for some other markets in the region because Shanghai stocks had already suffered a big correction in the past month, according to analysts.For now, investors are taking a "wait and see approach" to how the Chinese government responds to Trump's latest move, said Dickie Wong, director of research for Hong Kong broker Kingston Financial.Some steel producers took a big hit. China's Baoshan Iron & Steel and Japan's Nippon Steel both dropped nearly 4%.European steelmakers, which were slammed late on Thursday, posted further losses. Germany's ThyssenKrupp dropped 3%, while Salzgitter shed 5%. Industry leader ArcelorMittal declined more than 4%.Companies that have strong ties to the US fared better, with investors hoping their American operations could enable them to avoid the worst effects of the tariffs.Australia's Bluescope Steel, which has a mill in Ohio, climbed 1.2%.

LONDON MARKET CLOSE: Banks And Retailers Send FTSE 100 To Record HighLive Briefs PRO Global MarketsJanuary 10, 2018 Wednesday 12:20 PM ESTCopyright 2018 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 1925 wordsBody Stocks in London ended mixed on Wednesday, with the FTSE 100 hitting a fresh all-time high buoyed by gains from banks and retailers offsetting losses from housebuilders. The FTSE 100 index closed up 0.2%, or 17.49 points at 7,748.51. The FTSE 250 ended down 0.6%, or 114.95 points, at 20,760.00, and the AIM All-Share closed down 0.2%, or 1.89 points, at 1,066.05.The large-cap index hit a fresh all-time high of 7,756.11 earlier in the trading session. The BATS UK 100 ended up 0.2% at 13,144.28, the BATS 250 closed down 0.6% at 18,853.14, and the BATS Small Companies ended 0.3% higher at 13,009.54.On the London Stock Exchange, Royal Bank of Scotland ended as the best blue-chip performer up 4.5% after Morgan Stanley raised the state-backed lender to Overweight from Equal Weight. Asia-focused lenders Standard Chartered and HSBC closed up 3.8% and 3.3% respectively amid a rise in Chinese inflation overnight, according to IG market analyst Joshua Mahony."The rise of inflation and the impact that would have upon monetary policy is going to be a key theme for 2018, with the expectation of further upside driving up margins for banks," said IG's Mahony.Consumer prices in China were up 1.8% on year in December, the National Bureau of Statistics said earlier on Wednesday, which came in below forecasts for an increase of 1.9% but was up from 1.7% in November.The FTSE 350 Banks Sector was the best performing sector, up 2.7%.3i Group closed up 3.6% after Macquarie upgraded the private equity investor to Outperform from Neutral. Micro Focus International closed up 2.4% after UBS raised the Newbury-based software company to Buy from Neutral.Within the retail sector, J Sainbury closed up 1.8% after the supermarket chain lifted its annual profit guidance after strong end to the year, with its Argos unit delivering a particularly strong performance on Black Friday. Sainsbury's said it now expects underlying pretax profit for the year ending on March 11 to be "moderately ahead" of consensus, which currently gives a figure of GBP559.0 millionMarks & Spencer closed up 1.8% after the retailer appointed Dixons Carphone Finance Director Humphrey Singer as chief financial officer, with a date of appointment to be confirmed. Dixon Carphone closed down 0.4%. Singer will be replacing Helen Weir, who will leave the role on March 31 to pursue a portfolio career, after more than two years in the role since 2015. The electrical goods retailer said it has already started to search for a replacement for Singer.At the other end of the large-cap index Taylor Wimpey ended as the worst performer down 4.1%, after the housebuilder said its order book fell and house price growth slowed at the end of 2017. As at the end of 2017, Taylor Wimpey's order book is valued at GBP1.63 billion, representing 7,136 homes, down from GBP1.68 billion representing 7,567 homes at the end of 2016. The group's net private reservation rate was 0.77 homes per outlet per week, up from 0.72, and cancellation rate remained flat at 13%. The average selling prices on private completions rose by 3% to GBP296,000 from GBP286,000 the prior year, leading to overall average selling price increasing by 4% to GBP264,000 from GBP255,000. Compounding Taylor Wimpey's woes, Peel Hunt cut the stock to Hold from Add. Peers Persimmon, Barratt Developments and Berkeley Group suffered a negative read across ending down 1.7%, 1.5% and 1.0% respectively. In the FTSE 250, PageGroup closed up 9.3% after the recruiter reported good fourth quarter growth, and said its full-year profit is now expected ahead of consensus expectations. PageGroup delivered fourth quarter gross profit of GBP182.4 million, up 11% from GBP163.3 million in the comparative year ago period. For the full-year, gross profit totalled GBP711.6 million, up 15% year-on-year. Ted Baker ended up 9.0% after the fashion retailer said strong growth in online sales resulted in a good retail performance in the key Christmas period, and results for the year to January 27 are anticipated to be in line with board's expectations. At the other end of the midcap index, SuperDry was the worst performer closing down 9.3% after the high street fashion retailer reported a drop in interim pretax profit.For the six months ended October 28, SuperDry reported a pretax profit of GBP9.1 million, down from GBP12.7 million for the same period the year before, due to a fair value movement on forward contracts. Although underlying profit, before the one-off cost, rose by 21% to GBP25.3 million from GBP21.0 million.The group, which changed its name on Monday from SuperGroup, also said like-for-like retail sales were up 6.3%, a slowdown on the 123% growth reported the prior year.Hikma Pharmaceuticals ended as the second worst performing midcap stock, down 6.1% after Jefferies cut the Jordan-founded drugmaker to Underperform from Hold, as analysts said its 2018 full-year outlook is likely to disappoint.QinetiQ closed down 5.1% after the defence outsourcer was cut to Sell from Neutral by UBS.IG Group Holdings closed down 3.7%. The UK Financial Conduct Authority said its review on contract-for-difference providers uncovered "areas of serious concern", with most firms unable to define their target markets, raising questions about whether they are offering suitable financial products.IG responded to the findings stating it does not believe the review holds any new financial implications for the firm. Fellow London-listed CFD providers CMC Markets and Plus500 ended down 2.3% and 5.4% respectively. CMC Markets had made positive steps to address the points raised in an individual letter from the UK Financial Conduct Authority, received in September, adding it does not believe the review holds any new financial implications for the firm.The pound was flat quoted at USD1.3517 at the London equities close, compared to USD1.3516 at the London equities close Tuesday.However, sterling sank to an intraday low of USD1.3481 against the greenback in early trade after data showed the UK visible trade deficit widened in November, the Office for National Statistics said.The visible trade deficit rose to GBP12.23 billion in November from GBP11.67 billion in October. The expected level of shortfall was GBP10.95 billion. The total trade deficit came in at GBP2.80 billion versus GBP2.27 billion shortfall in the previous month.The disappointing trade figures took the gloss off strong UK industrial production growth which doubled in November, figures from the ONS illustrated. Industrial output climbed 0.4% month-on-month, faster than the 0.2% increase seen in October. The rate came in line with expectations. On a yearly basis, growth in industrial output slowed to 2.5% from 4.3% in October. Nonetheless, the pace exceeded the expected rate of 1.8%.At the same time, manufacturing grew 0.4% after rising 0.3% a month ago. Output was forecast to gain again by 0.3%. Manufacturing output advanced 3.5% following a 4.7% rise seen a month ago. Economists had forecast 2.8% increase.Meanwhile, the UK economy grew by an estimated 1.8% in 2017, with the pace of expansion picking up in the second half, according to the National Institute of Economic & Social Research.The NIESR's monthly estimate of UK GDP suggested output grew by 0.6% in the final quarter of 2017 from the prior quarter, accelerating compared to the third quarter's growth of 0.4%. This was the strongest quarterly growth estimate since the fourth quarter of 2016, the think tank said. Based on this, the UK economy expanded by 1.8% in 2017, the NIESR noted.Economic growth picked up in the second half of 2017 after a period of subdued growth in the first six months, the NIESR added.On the continent, CAC 40 in Paris ended down 0.4%, while the DAX 30 in Frankfurt ended down 0.8%. The euro was firm at USD1.1970 at the European equities close, against USD1.1922 the prior day."The rally in the euro is hurting the eurozone indices. The single currency has jumped as Germany bond yields are higher on the back of the reduction of the Bank of Japan bond buying scheme. Traders are moving their money out of German stocks and into German government bonds while the yield is attractive," said David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets.Stocks in New York were lower at the London equities close, with the seemingly relentless run of record gains running out of steam. The DJIA was down 0.2%, the S&P 500 index down 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite down 0.4%.Profit taking may be a factor in play contributing to the weakness on Wall Street after major stock indices once again climbed to new record closing highs in the previous session.Moreover, a report from Bloomberg News indicating Chinese officials have recommended slowing or halting purchases of US Treasuries weighed on stock markets.People familiar with the matter told Bloomberg the officials believe the market for US government bonds is becoming less attractive relative to other assets. The officials also suggested trade tensions between the US and China may provide a reason to slow or stop buying American debt."Although this is yet to be confirmed, speculators took no chances and sold the dollar as China &ndash; along with Japan &ndash; are the biggest foreign holders of US debt. Thus any decisions to reduce their holdings of US debt could have significant consequences on Treasuries, and in turn the dollar. Apparently, the Chinese consider US government bonds to have become less attractive compared to other assets," said Forex.com analyst Fawad Razaqzada.In US economic news, the Labor Department released a report showing import prices rose by much less than expected in the month of December.The Labor Department said import prices inched up by 0.1% in December after climbing by an upwardly revised 0.8% in November.Economists had expected import prices to rise by 0.5% compared to the 0.7% increase originally reported for the previous month. The uptick in import prices was primarily due to another significant increase in prices for fuel imports, which surged up by 1.8% in December after soaring by 8.4% in November.Elsewhere, wholesale inventories in the US increased by slightly more than anticipated in the month of November, according to a report released by the Commerce Department.The Commerce Department said wholesale inventories climbed by 0.8% in November after falling by a revised 0.4% in October. Economists had expected wholesale inventories to increase by 0.7% compared to the 0.5% drop originally reported for the previous month.Brent oil hit an intraday high of USD69.34 a barrel in early trade, its highest level since late 2014. The North Sea benchmark was quoted at USD69.00 a barrel at the London equities close from USD68.23 at the London equities close Tuesday.An ounce of the precious metal was quoted at USD1,317.11 at the London equities close against USD1,311.38 at the London equities close Tuesday.The economic events calendar on Thursday has China new loans data at 0200 GMT, Italy retail sales figures at 0900 GMT and eurozone industrial production data at 1000 GMT. In the afternoon attention turns to the US with producer prices for December at 1330 GMT and EIA natural gas storage change data at 1530 GMT. The corporate calendar on Thursday has trading statements from clothing, food and homewares retailer Marks & Spencer, food wholesaler Booker Group - which is being acquired by Tesco which also releases a trading statement, housebuilder Barratt Developments, recruiter Hays and AIM-listed online fashion retailer Boohoo.com.Load-Date: January 11, 2018End of Document

HOW MIGHT TRUMP'S STIFF TARIFFS IMPACT THE COST OF YOUR IPHONE?States News ServiceMarch 8, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 238 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: SYRACUSE, NY BodyThe following information was released by Syracuse University:Pres. Trump is expected to formally sign off on stiff and sweeping tariffs on steel and aluminum imports today.Jason Dedrick is a professor in the School of Information Studies at Syracuse University, who researches the globalization of information technology. Dedrick doesn't predict tariff increases would have a significant impact on iPhone costs but says the retaliation consequences could be a bigger concern.Dedrick says:"The enclosure for an iPhone is a pretty expensive part, actually. We had it at $22 on the iPhone 7, but according to some reports, it's $51 on iPhone 8 and $61 on iPhone X. Some of the enclosures are aluminum and others are stainless steel. In any case, I think the raw material cost is a very small part of the enclosure cost."Raw materials are bought by Apple outside the U.S. and imported from China as parts in the iPhone.

5 things Trump did this week while you weren't lookingPolitico.comMarch 3, 2018 Saturday 1:34 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 1402 wordsByline: dvinik@politico.com,  (Danny Vinik)Highlight: Outside of the commotion in Washington, Trump's cabinet leaders are reshaping federal policy.BodyIt was a week of typically unpredictable headlines in the Donald Trump presidency: One of the president's closest advisors resigned; Trump announced his support for gun-control proposals on national TV only to walk back his position a day later; and he surprised his staff by announcing major tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, possibly precipitating a trade war.For all that commotion, gun control policies still look dead on Capitol Hill and the tariffs haven't actually been implemented yet. Outside the spotlight, however, the Trump agenda has steadily marched forward, as his cabinet appointees-from Betsy DeVos as the Department of Education to Scott Pruitt at the Environmental Protection Agency-continued to impress a new conservative agenda on their agencies. And there are some curveballs in the mix as well, such as a move back toward Obama's labor rules. Here's how Trump changed policy this week:1. The Department of Education boosts charter schools, lightens civil-rights scrutinyBetsy DeVos took a lot of heat for her lack of experience when she was nominated to be Trump's secretary of education, a billionaire charter-schools advocate who'd never worked in government or even a school. But in the past year, DeVos has clearly figured out how to use the levers of power in her department, rolling back Obama-era regulations and policies on everything from for-profit colleges to campus sexual assault. This week came a trio of changes. On Tuesday, the department released its final priorities for how it allocates competitive grant money-a little-known agency power that can fuel long-term policy shifts by funneling money to favored organizations. It declared a new focus on expanding school choice, as well as other Trump administration priorities like the promotion of STEM and computer science. It's a major shift from the priorities under DeVos' predecessor, John King, which focused on socioeconomic diversity in schools.Also on Tuesday, the Department proposed delaying for two years a rule issued at the tail end of the Obama era that attempted to address the disproportionate number of minority students in special education classes, ensuring that states were using a uniform standard in determining which students were placed in those classes. The rule was scheduled to take effect on July 1; the delay would push it into 2020.Finally, the Department also posted a new version of its rulebook for investigating civil rights abuses in U.S. schools, notably eliminating all mentions of "systemic" investigations and effectively telling investigators to look at schools on a case-by-case basis. Civil rights leaders slammed the move, saying it would put marginalized students, such as immigrants and LGBT people, at risk. The agency responded by saying the changes were necessary to reduce the case backlog and protect students' civil rights in a timely manner. The revisions take effect on March 5.2. In Mexico, Trump's trade agenda moves forwardThis week's trade news may have been dominated by Trump's threatening new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, and his positive tweeting about a "trade war," but his administration also made a few other important trade announcements that could have far-reaching implications on the U.S. economy.In Mexico City this week, the U.S., Mexico and Canada continued to negotiate reforms to the North American Free Trade Agreement, a slow process that continues to hit roadblocks, particularly on how much of a car needs to be made in North America to qualify for preferential tariffs. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer also refused to budge from his position on eliminating NAFTA's controversial provision for settling investor-state disputes, raising fears in the business community that a policy that industry generally likes is unlikely to be included in a renegotiated NAFTA deal. On Tuesday, the Commerce Department issued final duties on aluminum foil imports for China, designed to offset what Commerce said was unfair subsidies from the Chinese government. Then, on Wednesday, the Office of the USTR revealed in its 359-page annual trade agenda that it would seek a three-year renewal of the "trade promotion authority" that Congress granted to Obama in 2015, which lets the White House negotiate trade deals and restricts Congress to an up-or-down vote on the resulting agreements. The administration must request such an extension by April 1, and despite Republicans controlling both Congress and the White House, this might not be smooth sailing: Many congressional Republicans are openly unhappy with the president's aluminum and steel tariffs. 3. EPA weakens a rule on methane emissionsIn 2016, Obama's Environmental Protection Agency issued a new rule to reduce methane leaks from oil and gas wells. Environmentalists cheered the news, while industry groups criticized them as overly burdensome. This week, the EPA sided with industry, giving oil and gas companies up to two years to fix methane leaks and eliminating a requirement that forced them to fix leaks during emergency or unscheduled shutdowns. Under the new proposal, operators must repair leaks during the next scheduled shutdown or within two years, whichever is sooner. The changes weren't exactly a surprise, as EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has been attempting to loosen or repeal the rule altogether since he took office. Last year, a court even rejected the EPA's attempt to delay the rule's compliance dates. 4. Treasury closes a loophole in the tax lawAfter Congress overhauled the tax code in December, the work shifted to the Treasury Department to begin drafting dozens of rules and guidance documents to implement the 494-page law, a process that will take months, if not years. This week, Treasury reached something of a milestone when it released the new W-4 withholding form, the document that employers use to determine how much tax to withhold from their employees' paychecks. The agency also released an online withholding calculator.That news represents an important moment in Treasury's implementation process but doesn't represent a major policy change. The bigger news came when the Department announced that it would close a loophole in the tax law that would have allowed wealthy money managers to continue paying a lower tax rate on so-called carried interest. The tax law made it harder for people to claim the carried interest tax break-a break for super-rich private-equity investors that Trump promised to repeal in the presidential campaign-but the law contained a vaguely worded section that allowed money managers to avoid that crackdown. Treasury this week made clear that it won't allow that.5. After a reversal of a reversal, an Obama labor policy survivesIn December, in a 3-2 vote on party lines, the National Labor Relations Board rolled back a major Obama-era decision that would have held more businesses legally responsible for their franchisees' labor-law violations. Labor groups slammed the rollback of the so-called "joint employment" standard, saying it would undermine workers' labor rights and let big franchising companies duck their responsibilities as employers, while businesses cheered the news.But on Monday, in a shocking move, the NLRB rolled back its rollback, leaving the Obama-era standard in place. The decision had nothing to do with the underlying policy, but instead was related to a potential conflict of interest by NLRB member William Emanuel, whose previous law firm was involved in the original case that put the topic of "joint employment" before the NLRB in 2015. Due to those ties, Emanuel faced pressure to recuse himself from the current decision. That pressure intensified in early February when the NLRB's inspector general sharply criticized the agency for its handling of conflict-of-interest cases. This week, the Board ruled that Emanuel should have recused himself and therefore it was withdrawing its December decision.The NLRB currently has just four members-two Democrats and two Republicans, including Emanuel-with a fifth GOP member likely to be confirmed by the Senate soon. But even with a 3-2 majority, Republicans will have trouble overturning the Obama-era decision, since Emanuel will likely recuse himself from future cases, leaving the NLRB split at 2-2. That's the main reason that many congressional Republicans called for legislative action after Monday's news.Load-Date: March 3, 2018End of Document

Cryptocurrency Market Rebounds After Recent DeclinePR NewswireJanuary 16, 2018 Tuesday 9:45 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2321 wordsDateline: NEW YORK, January 16, 2018 BodyAccording to data from Coinmarketcap, the total market capitalizations of 1419 cryptocurrencies were valued at about $700 billion on Friday. Recent news from South Korea planning to ban cryptocurrency trading, sent most of the digital currencies' prices lower last Thursday. However, the market bounced back quickly and recovered its losses by Friday morning. The cryptocurrency market witnessed rapid growth in 2017 and according to Coindesk ICO Tracker, more than $3.7 billion were raised via initial coin offerings (ICO) in 2017. In a separate note, Thomas Glucksmann, head of APAC business development for cryptocurrency exchange Gatecoin, told CNBC by email. "Over the last year and a half, we've seen that the majority of tokens issued during ICOs and traded on exchanges, have been coded to run on the ethereum network". Victory Square Technologies Inc. (OTC: VSQTF), Riot Blockchain Inc (NASDAQ: RIOT), Global Blockchain Technologies Corp. (OTC: BLKCF), India Globalization Capital, Inc. (NYSE: IGC), Pareteum Corporation (NYSE: TEUM)South Korea and Japan are the major cryptocurrency trading markets in Asia after the Chinese government announced a ban on Initial Coin Offering and shut down the major cryptocurrency exchanges in China last year. According to data from CryptoCompare, South Korea and Japan account for about 5 percent and 38 percent of bitcoin trading respectively. For Ethereum, about 14 percent of the transaction were made by South Korean currency. For ripple, the third largest cryptocurrency by market cap, South Korea accounted for about 22 percent of the trading volume.Victory Square Technologies Inc.(OTC: VSQTF) is also listed on the TSX Venture Exchange under the ticker symbol 'VST'. Just earlier today the company announced breaking news that it, "has become and early strategic adopter, investor, and partner in the Gibraltar Blockchain Exchange ("GBX").The GBX, based in Gibraltar, is a subsidiary of the Gibraltar Stock Exchange ("GSX"), a European Union ("EU") regulated stock exchange since 2014. Victory Square's investment of $150,000 USD into GBX (the "Investment") connects the Company with the GBX partnership network and renowned blockchain technology professional services firms such as Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, PricewaterhouseCoopers, ISOLAS and Kenetic Capital. In exchange for the Investment, the Company will receive 1,500,000 cryptographic tokens known as Rock Tokens (the "RKT Tokens") issued by the crowd-contribution smart-contract. The RKT Tokens allocated to Victory Square include an agreed 10% bonus for being an early partner of GBX."The Gibraltar Blockchain Exchange represents a tremendous opportunity to partner with the world's first licensed and regulated token sale platform and digital asset exchange that is operated by an EU-regulated stock exchange," said Victory Square Chief Executive Officer Shafin Diamond Tejani. "The GBX is expected to be a global listing and token sales springboard for utility tokens that have satisfied a strict due diligence and admissions process as well as a high-quality digital asset exchange. In this regard, the GBX intends to set a higher standard for token issuance and trading for the benefit of all market participants."Victory Square is delighted to partner with the Gibraltar Blockchain Exchange on this initiative, which provides an elite regulated market - a true rock, so to speak - for our portfolio companies and other leaders in the field," added Tejani.GBX CEO, Nick Cowan, said: "Since we started the GBX project, we have been humbled and flattered by the support and interest we have received in building a rules-based marketplace promoting best practices in the industry. We have received phenomenal support globally for our ICO, and we are very pleased that Victory Square has chosen to join us in our journey to build the crypto harbour, right here in Gibraltar."The GBX Platform will provide crypto and blockchain companies a number of advantages. These include: the ability to raise post-ICO equity rounds on the GSX; a regulated and licensed platform for companies raising through an ICO; and a fully regulated cryptocurrency exchange for their tokens post-ICO. The Gibraltar government recently launched their Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) Framework, solidifying their position as a market leader in blockchain and facilitator of innovation in technology and providing a pathway to Tokenized Securities (bonds, issuances) within a Stock Exchange ecosystem.Victory Square selected GBX as an investment vehicle because the GBX has been exceptionally thorough in the preparation and organization of GBX's overall business structure and operations. In particular, the GBX has developed the GBX Alliance to help facilitate discourse and form thought leadership around the growing token industry. The GBX Alliance includes key players and interest groups throughout the blockchain space including technology firms, academia, investors, practitioners, and legal advisors. Collectively, stakeholders will elect a council which will identify and manage partnerships and sponsor initiatives, further raising the profile of the GBX. The Alliance Council, in turn, connects to the GBX Partnership Model, which selects proven industry experts and key influencers, advises clients and will be responsible for bringing tokens to market on the GBX."Riot Blockchain Inc(NASDAQ: RIOT) recently announced that it has established Digital Green Energy Corp as a wholly owned subsidiary to explore international infrastructure opportunities. The Company is identifying environmentally friendly projects with large energy capacity and a cost-efficient rate for cryptocurrency mining and data center operations. Daniel Stefan Robertsen has been appointed President of Digital Green Energy Corp and will begin his duties in the role on January 24, 2018. "We believe green energy infrastructure will continue to be in strong demand and we aim to position Riot accordingly," commented John O'Rourke, Chairman and CEO of the Company. Global Blockchain Technologies Corp.(OTC: BLKCF) amounted last week that it has made a strategic investment of C$2.0 million in Spectra7 Microsystems Inc., a leading provider of high-performance analog semiconductor products for broadband connectivity markets. In November 2017, Spectra7 announced a new product line optimized for blockchain processing data centers. Data Centers focused on blockchain processing are extremely dedicated to network and computational efficiency. Spectra7's BCI-2500 products enable copper cables up to three times the reach of passive copper cables at dramatically lower power levels than alternative solutions. Spectra7's BCI-2500 product line is the market's first to address the specific needs of data centers running blockchain applications including Bitcoin mining.India Globalization Capital, Inc.(NYSE: IGC) has two lines of businesses, a legacy infrastructure business and a cannabis pharmaceutical business that has developed a lead product for treating Alzheimer's patients. On December 26, 2017, the company announced that it will leverage its existing team of technology and healthcare experts to develop methods utilizing blockchain in areas such as product identification assurance (PIA). "We understand the unique challenges facing the cannabis industry and believe that our team has the expertise to be the first to create meaningful solutions to address these issues using distributed ledgers inherent in blockchain technology. As we work to develop blockchain in the rollout of Hyalolex, our goal would be to establish a universal cannabis platform applicable to solving multiple industry challenges facing dispensaries and consumers. This would include addressing issues such as transactional difficulties, inadequate product labeling, product identification assurance (PIA) and product origin assurance," stated Ram Mukunda, CEO.  Pareteum Corporation(NYSE: TEUM) and its subsidiaries provide a complete mobility cloud platform, utilizing messaging and security capabilities for the global Mobile, MVNO, Enterprise, Software-as-a-Service and IoT markets. On December 26, 2017, the company announced that it has completed development enabling it to add support of Blockchain technology to its billing and settlement services. This newest service capability enables Pareteum customers to participate in the transformational "Digital Economy Monetization to the Cloud" and now accept and process Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Airtokens and other forms of cryptocurrencies. The new feature being offered to all Pareteum's Global Mobility Cloud customers will allow them to not only accept the crypto-currencies but also to perform payment processing and settlements with their partners in any currency. Subscribe Now!

Exactly.BARTIROMO: Joining the conversation this morning in just a few minutes is the acting director of Immigration And Customs Enforcement, that's Tom Homan. He will join us momentarily. So, stay with us for that important interview. But we want to kick this hour off as President Trump coming off of a major bipartisan meeting on immigration. He will not budge on one of his biggest campaign promises, the wall. Blake Burman is live at the White House this morning with the very latest there. Blake, good morning to you.BLAKE BURMAN, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Maria, good morning to you as well. You remember back here at -- on Tuesday at the White House when the President had that meeting with both Republican and Democratic lawmakers in that room. He told them that he would sign any immigration deal that they end to up producing. However yesterday during a news conference, the President clarified his ultimate demand. He was asked if he would support a DACA solution if it does not address the border wall.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: No.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: NO?TRUMP: No. It's going to include the wall. We need the wall for security, we need the wall for safety, we need the wall for stopping the drugs from pouring in.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURMAN: Now, House Republicans did introduce a bill yesterday that calls for the President's core immigration principles. Wall construction while ending the diversity visa lottery program and chain migration. It also included a three-year extension for those protected by DACA. However, Democrats want a DACA fix to be attached to the upcoming spending measure that needs to be hashed out in eight days by next Friday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), NEW YORK: The iron is hot, we should strike now. Delay will snap out the hope of getting an agreement that both sides can live with.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURMAN: More than 100 CEOs from all across the country have written into Congressional leadership asking for a DACA solution indeed by next Friday. Among them, Bezos, Cook, Zuckerberg, the heads of Under Armour and Starbucks, along with the President's top ally on Wall Street, Steve Schwarzman. However, Maria, that timeframe, the political reality here in Washington, that timeframe is very tight. Maria?BARTIROMO: All right, Blake. Thank you so much. Blake Burman at the White House this morning. I want to get to some breaking news right now. Wal-Mart is announcing a number of things this morning. First of all, they're raising the minimum wage. They are creating bonuses for hourly workers. They're going to send $1,000 checks to hourly workers. They are going to incur costs as a result of this on Wal-Mart. They're going to incur a $400 million charge for the special bonus of a $1,000 being paid out the bonuses to employees and they're going to -- it's going to cost $300 million to raise the minimum wage.Again, Wal-Mart this morning raising the minimum wage to $11.00 an hour. And also paying out a special bonus of $1000 to hourly workers. This is going to cost $400 million to the special -- the special bonus and $300 million expense for raising the minimum wage to $11.00 for employers. Wal- Mart making these moves just right now. Hitting the tape, stock is up two- thirds of a percent in the premarket.Let's talk more about customs and immigration. Joining me right now is the acting director of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, Tom Homan. Tom, it's good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.TOM HOMAN, ACTING DIRECTOR, IMMIGRATIONS AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT: Good morning. Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: So the President says a border wall must be part of any deal on DACA. Do you agree with that?HOMAN: Absolutely. Every place we build a wall or barrier has worked. We've proven that, so why would we not want -- not want to invest in a wall.BARTIROMO: Yes. That's what I want to ask you. Make the case that a wall works because you've got a lot of people on the left from Chuck Schumer to Nancy Pelosi basically saying, we don't want to spend --we don't want to spend $13 billion or $18 billion what the President is asking for to build a wall because the wall doesn't work.HOMAN: Well, a few years ago there is bipartisan support for the wall, they actually funded the wall or parts of a barrier. Look, every place that built -- all they got to do is look at facts, every place that built it, whether it's San Diego, Yuma, Arizona, El Paso, Texas, wherever they have built a barrier, the illegal crossing decreased significantly. So, as far as the cost, I mean, what cost do you want to put on public safety national safety. It's proven it's worked, I think this country needs it, I think it's going to help protect this country. And this president is committed to protecting this country.BARTIROMO: Let me ask you. When you -- I know the border crossings are down huge ever since it became apparent that there's new sheriff in town and the President is actually enforcing this but when you catch somebody trying to come into America illegally, can you send them right back?HOMAN: Well, it depends, you know, if they're, you know, if they can voluntarily, you know, seek to return, they can -- they have a right to see a judge if they -- if they are -- if they want to see a judge or claim credible fear. That's the issue. We signed a list of policy objectives up to the Hill. Border security is more than just a wall, we got to have to interior enforcement, we got to close some of these loopholes. Like I hear -- I hear a lot of people say, we want a clean DACA bill. Look, you got to fix the underlying cases of people coming into this country illegally. I was in -- I was special agent back in 1986 and we passed last amnesty. We're supposed to fix it then but we never got the tools, we never got the authorities to actually stop illegal immigration.So, if we're going to give this DACA fix, if there's going to be a negotiation on DACA, then let's address the underlying problems of illegal immigration. Let's talk about diversity of visa, let's talk about some of these court rulings that require ICE to release people in certain amount of time, only to go -- be lost in the community and never show up in court. Let's close some of these loopholes, let's be able to remove people we arrest in a timely manner. So, we've asked for a series of policy changes to Congress in exchange for a DACA discussion. I think it all needs to be discussed. We finally -- for once and a -- once and for all, let's fix this problem and stop, you know, let's stop, you know, put an air in the tire that leaks, let's actually replace that tire and get a new tire. Let's fix it.BARTIROMO: Right. And that's why I asked you, you know, can just send someone back when they break the law like that because it's not that easy. You know --HOMAN: No. Many times we cannot.BARTIROMO: Exactly what you just said, you know, they come back. So, we - - by the way, before I get to this I want to ask you about sanctuary cities but where are most of the people coming from because I think there's a misnomer on this as well. When people are trying to come into America, most recently, I'm talking the last couple of years, where are they coming from largely?HOMAN: Well, as far as, you know, a lot of the population we've seen a huge increase in Central American --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: A lot of Guatemala.HOMAN: -- Guatemala, El Salvador, you know, Honduras. The Mexican in earlier immigration actually declined. So look, we removed people to 140 different countries last year. So people from all over the world, I can't blame anybody for wanting to come to the greatest country on earth.BARTIROMO: Of course.HOMAN: But there's a right way and there's a wrong way, they got to do it the right way. You can't want to be a part of the greatest country on earth and not respect those laws. You can't have it both ways anymore, this president has made that clear.BARTIROMO: Unfortunately, people are having it both ways because of sanctuary cities, you got people in California basically saying, come here, we will let you in, we're a sanctuary city, they just said they were sanctuary city officially just recently, how do you compensate for the sanctuary cities?HOMAN: Look, I've been very clear. Sanctuary cities, let's talk about the smoke and mirrors of sanctuary cities. These politicians that their political ambitions ahead of public safety. Releasing the public safety threats back in the public is not smart. It puts my officers at the risk, it puts the community at risk. And they say they want to protect immigrant community, let's be-- let's be totally factual about this. When I -- when my officers can't arrest a bad guy and send to county jail and they release them t the street, that means our officers have go to a home, a neighborhood or a place of employment, where they're going to find most likely other illegal aliens that weren't the target of the operation.And those other illegal aliens will be arrested. So what the sanctuary cities did in fact, not protect the immigrant community, they put them at greater risk of being arrested. Sanctuary cities are public safety threat. My officers ready and take a custody of a -- of a significant criminal in the safety and security of a county jail, now they have to knock on the door when that person got access to a weapon.Also, they send a message for further enticement illegal immigration. If they don't think the alien smuggle organizations in Mexico and Central America isn't using sanctuary cities as a subbing ploy. Look, for $6,000, I get you to California. You know what, you can even be arrested by the local police in California and they're not going to assist immigration in locating you and removing you. We are bankrolling the very criminal organizations that have killed more virtual agents and special agents that work for me. The same criminal organization that smuggled aliens, also smuggled dope, they smuggled narcotics, they smuggled guns, they smuggled people that want to do harm to this country. And we're bankrolling through the sanctuary city's policies.BARTIROMO: Yes. It's pretty incredible that they just break the Federal Law. Meanwhile, explain what happened at 7-Elevens. ICE Agents raided 7- Elevens important across country early yesterday morning in search of employees who were in the country illegally and managers who knowingly employ them. What came from the raids, will there be more going forward? Can you walk us through what took place?HOMAN: There were absolutely be more worksite enforcement. I've been very clear since the beginning of the year, we are going to -- if not triple, quadruple worksite enforcement operations. We need to remove yet another magnet that entices illegal entry. People think they can come to this country and get a job illegally, they're going to keep coming. So we have stepped up worksite enforcement, 7-Eleven is the first large one we did, there are many more large ones to come. We are also going on concentrate on medium-sized companies and small companies.We're going to hold employers responsible for knowingly hiring illegal aliens which is a crime, we're going to make them pay their taxes and we're going to arrest illegal aliens that come to this country to get a job. We got to take that magnet away and that's another thing we asked in our -- in our policy request to Congress on the Hill, let's make e-verify, let's make that a requirement, let's make companies use e-verify. Let's fix this illegal immigration once and for all. Let's give the men and women of the border patrol and ICE the tools and the legislation, close these loopholes so we can stop the enticement of people coming to this country illegally.BARTIROMO: Yes.HOMAN: Once and all let's fix this problem.BARTIROMO: Well, I mean, people would like to see the rule of law followed, Tom, you know, let's face it. I mean, the President will reportedly fly to San Diego after the State of the Union later this month on the 31st to view the prototypes for the proposed border wall. Talk to us about this. Has trip been confirmed, will you go with the president to look at these prototypes? What can you tell us about the prototypes of the wall?HOMAN: I'm not aware of that trip. I certainly have made numerous trips to the wall. I think it's a good move to go down and look at, you know, the President is known for his construction abilities and what he's done in his past life. But look, let me say it again, the border is necessary, it has worked every place it built at. But border security is more than just a wall and there has to be some true interior enforcement, mechanism put in place, we need to close the loopholes, we need to talk about diversity visas, we need to talk about chain migration. We need to address these things to address the underlying problems of illegal immigration. A wall is a great idea, it's worked, we ought to invest in it. There's other things had to be included besides the wall. So we need to have a large discussion about immigration in this country.BARTIROMO: Yes. So, what do you want to see? I mean, what's most important in terms of the urgency?HOMAN: Look, along with the wall, I think we need to talk about chain migration, I think we need to talk about sanctuary cities. Look, sanctuary cities put my officers at risk. You're talking about the men and women of ICE who lead the safety and security of their home everybody and strap a gun to their hip to defend this country and defend people to never have honor of meeting. And for federal law enforcement officers not to have access to a public-funded county jail where there is illegal alien there that entered this country illegally which is already a Federal crime, entering this country illegally is a crime and yet they committed another crime against the citizens of this country.And a Federal law enforcement officer can't enter a county jail to talk to this person and make sure we get custody of that person, not only remove from the community when he gets released, removed from the country. Criminal aliens, anybody can Google, recidivism rates of criminals, over half of these people being released to the street rather than being turned over to ICE will reoffend the first year. Three-quarters of them will re- offend within five years.BARTIROMO: Wow. Incredible. Tom, we'll be watching. Thanks very much for joining us. Hope you'll come back soon.HOMAN: Thank you.BARTIROMO: That's the acting director of ICE, Immigration, and Customs Enforcement. We'll be right backBARTIROMO: Welcome back. A frantic search underway this morning for victims of California's deadly mudslides. Cheryl Casone with the details now. Cheryl?CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: That's right, Maria. Hundreds of rescuers were slogging through knee-high mud continuing to search for victims of devastating floods. The death toll now standing at 17, another 17 still reported missing.Well, Oprah Winfrey among the celebrities whose homes sustained serious damage. She took Instagram followers on a tour of the mud in her own backyard saying that she's lucky compared to what her neighbor is going through.Meanwhile, Seals taken to Instagram to call out Oprah for hypocrisy after her Sunday Night speech at the Golden Globe Awards about sexual misconduct in Hollywood. Seal saying that Oprah has been part of the problem for decades. He posted two pictures of Oprah with her Harvey Weinstein, one showing her apparently kissing his cheek with a text for the (INAUDIBLE) saying when you have been part of a problem for decades. But suddenly they all think you are the solution. Seal adding the #SanctimoniousHollywood to his Instagram post.Well, Bitcoin prices plunging after the South Korean government banned cryptocurrency trading. Soth Korean Police and tax authorities also raided the country's virtual coin exchanges on alleged tax evasion. More than 55,000 South Koreans have joined the petition asking to country's president to halt their crackdown. One Bitcoin currently worth about $13,740. On Sunday it was worth more than $17,000.Meanwhile, the Chinese government ordering the closing of Bitcoin mining operations, miners used powerful computer systems to solve complex math problems that generators and verifies units of cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. Well, China has already shut exchanges for virtual coin trading in that country.OK. Then there's this. Recently, fake news was officially declared the word of 2017 by the Collins Dictionary. Well now, British retailer Topshop is selling a pair of $90.00 jeans with the words Fake News stitched down the legs. Just in time for President Trump's fake news awards, those are scheduled for Wednesday. So, some are going to be rocking President Trump's famous phrase outside of politics. By the way, people on social media kind of making fun of the jeans. One person writes that she hopes the release of the jeans "fake news". That's not your fake headline but kind of what --BARTIROMO: That's real. OK. Thank you, Cheryl.MCDOWELL: You bet.BARTIROMO: Coming up. A major policy shift on Medicaid. The Trump administration proposing requirements for recipients, we'll bring them to you. Then Delta Airlines releasing its fourth-quarter results beating revenue and earnings expectations. We break down those numbers as well as look at Wal-Mart which just raised its minimum wage, big story there. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Breaking news out of the White House this morning. The Trump administration has announced a major policy shift that paves the way for states to seek requirements on Medicaid recipients. The head of centers for Medicaid and Medicare services releasing the following statement. Reading in part, Medicaid needs to be more flexible so that states can best address the needs of this population. Our fundamental goal is to make a positive and lasting difference in the health and wellness of our beneficiaries. Joining us right now to weigh in on that is the president of the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity and Forbes Opinion Editor, Avik Roy. Afaik, good to see you. Thanks for joining us.AVIK ROY, PRESIDENT, FOUNDATION FOR RESEARCH ON EQUAL OPPORTUNITY: Hey, Maria. How are you?BARTIROMO: Give us your take on the impact of this, insurance markets anything else.ROY: Yes. So in terms of this particular announcement from the administration, the idea is this. There is a lot of evidence that people who have jobs who work, who engage with their communities, they're healthier, there's something about working about feeling needed by other people that makes you healthier that makes -- that just makes you more alert mentally. And so the idea here is if you can -- if you can incorporate that into that Medicaid program and give states the ability to actually require or encourage work, not only you make people healthier but you let them out of poverty so maybe they don't even need to be on Medicaid in the end.MCSHANE: And is Medicaid kind of, Avik, a next logical target when we just talk about healthcare generally speaking, of course, last year, the failure to, you know, overhaul the entire system, there's a lot made of that but then at the end of the year in the tax overhaul plan, we did see the repeal of the individual mandate. So following that with going after Medicaid, you know, piece by piece, does that make sense just in terms of a progression for you from the administration?ROY: Yes. It's huge, so that repeal of the individual mandate, I think it's underappreciated in terms of how important that is because you remember all those headlines last year about how that Republican healthcare bills would throw 22 million people off their health insurance. Well, those headlines were wrong because 17 million of that so-called 22 million were people who would voluntarily dropped out of the market because the individual mandate was being repealed. So you take that out, that's not part of the baseline because the tax bill repeal the individual mandate, now you have a situation where you can reform the healthcare system in a way in which more people will have health insurance than before while also tackling those entitlement spending issues that are crowding out our ability to fund every other national priority like the military, like education, et cetera.MCDOWELL: Avik, there was also a recent report that the labor department was issuing a proposal that would allow small business to band together to provide insurance on equal footing with state unions and corporations. What are some other things that the Trump administration and the agencies under the White House can do to really try and reform Obamacare and these insurance markets outside of Congress coming together and getting something done?ROY: Just, in general, let me say that there is an enormous amount of activity in the executive branch right now from the White House on down. They're really gearing up to make a lot of these kinds of announcements to use their executive authority under the law to make changes that will improve and stabilize these insurance markets. So you saw that with labor department announcement where people can band together to make -- to have group insurance or even self-insure, the announcement today out of -- in terms of the Medicaid program, there's going to be more announcements in terms of giving states and individuals more flexibility to buy insurance outside the Obamacare regulatory structure. So they're going to do a lot there.There's also going to be opportunities perhaps for employers to get people help savings account and help reimbursement accounts to buy healthcare in ways that the modern insurance system doesn't allow. So you're going to see a lot of those kinds of announcements and the administration is waiting, so they are waiting for Congress its thing, right? Now that that's relatively settled, they're moving in and going to act.KEANE: You know, under Obamacare, the pull of those who have -- who are qualified for Medicaid was expanded and have drove up the cost of the program considerably. Is there an opportunity to bring that fact to people who truly have special needs?ROY: Yes. So General, this is what I was -- describing in this Wall Street Journal op-ed last week about how this the most important problem that Congress can tackle this year. Obamacare, they repeal (INAUDIBLE) executive orders, they at least provide a lot of relief, they don't repeal those (INAUDIBLE) but they convert a lot of relief so that people can get out from under the high premiums. The big problem -- the real problem that's spacing the country that's threatening all these other priorities, our ability to have a solvent American in the future is the growth of entitlement spending and Medicaid, in particular, is going to grow by 64 percent over the next years.There's going to be a larger amount of money that we're spending on that and the defense department than every other line out of the budget. So Congress has an opportunity to do something about this. I think the House of Representatives there, they're actually eager to take on Medicaid reform, Paul Ryan has talked about this, a number of the people in the House have talked about it. If the Senate where there's a little bit more reluctance because of that 51-49 majority, they're not sure that they can even pass a budget this year.MCDOWELL: Avik, I actually quoted those numbers on this very program a couple when that -- when that op-ed ran. The spending on Medicaid by 2025 will be close to a trillion dollars. It's going to be $200 billion more than we spend on defense.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Using raising the red flag on this for years and the spending numbers are just mind-boggling.MCDOWELL: Right. And some just kind of get done and for quite frankly, so did the Congress is going to have to do something about this spending on healthcare. Medicare, Medicare in particular.(CROSSTALK)ROY: And the state level too by the way.BARTIROMO: I'm sorry?ROY: But the big problem it crowds out education, it crowds out --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Right.ROY: All the things that states are trying to fund. Medicaid is eating up more and more of that budget.KEANE: Do you think the Congress has got the stomach to deal with this in an election year?BARTIROMO: And did not this year, right? I mean --ROY: The House wants to, the Senate is where there's -- they're just -- they still have PTSD from last year's healthcare debate. So, I think the House has to act first, pass something that the Senate can take up and that the Senate believes that it's viable, then you could see some movement in the Senate.BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Avik, good to see you. Thanks very much.ROY: Thanks, Maria.BARTIROMO: We will see you soon. We're looking at the Wal-Mart press release this morning. Huge story that Wal-Mart is raising the minimum wage paying out $1,000 bonuses to its employees on the heels of the Trump tax reform legislation. They're raising the minimum wage to $11.00 expanding maternity and parental leave benefits providing a one-time cash bonus for eligible associates.

It will pay a one-time bonus of up to $1,000 to hourly workers and it will expand maternity and parental lead benefits. President Trump spoke more about the positive of tax reform during his cabinet meeting yesterday.DONALD TRUMP, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: Hardworking American families will receive tremendous tax relief. We lowered our tax rates nearly doubled the standard deduction, and doubled the child tax credit. We had no Democrat support zero, they didn't want tax cuts, they want tax increases.BARTIROMO: More on the major impacts for business coming up this morning.

Dow Industrials up 36 points, and the NASDAQ up 11, S&P 500 also higher, by four points. December PPI is out down one-tenth of a percent versus an estimate of down two-tenths of a percent. In Europe this morning the industry's look like this higher pretty much the FT-100 earlier was that trading up.

Boeing meanwhile looking to get its drone business a lift, we have a look at the company's new vehicle that can carry a massive amount of cargo. Wait until you see this then a sweet tune of an IPO, how music superstar Drake is planning to make his Wall Street debut.Plus the story is for real, the details as Costco customer returns a Christmas Tree in January. So they returned the Christmas Tree in January, wait till you hear whether or not they got the money back. But first, this breaking news Wal-Mart announcing big plans this morning following the tax reform package, the retail giant planning to raise the minimum wage to $11.00 an hour, also Wal-Mart is offering up to a thousand dollar bonuses for hourly workers. The company is also planning to expand maternity and parental leave benefits, the CEO of Wal-Mart is out on Twitter basically talking about passing on the savings of the tax plan to employees. Want to bring Deutsche Bank cheap, U.S. equity strategist and global asset allocation, man in Binky Chadha.BINKY CHADHA, CHIEF U.S. EQUITY STRATEGIST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. Your reaction to this Wal- Mart story this morning.CHADHA: So I think it's very important to keep in mind that, you know, we already have basically a very, very strong rebound coming from the business cycle, and you know we can talk about how and why that was happening but that's because of things that happened a couple years ago. And so if you look for example the equity market, you know, we are up a lot already before we come basically to tax reform which the market really started to focus on in November. So in terms of, you know, what corporates are going to do and you're questioning really about, you know, what just happened with Wal-Mart, the big question is what our corporates going to do with their higher after-tax earnings starting in the first quarter, and what I would argue is, you know, they are going to do everything that they will already doing. So they are -- the wages would have gone up anyway I think it's important to keep in mind that the unemployment rate was already close to four percent before we had the tax reform.BARTIROMO: Right.CHADHA: You know, if you look at -- investment spending, for example, you know, it already taken off when we're talking about eight to 10 percent rates of growth, before tax reform. We were talking a little bit about earnings before, you know, earnings that running 14-1/2 percent is what we expect to for earnings to come in that's before you know, the impact of tax reform.BARTIROMO: Yes. But wait a second Binky because during the commercial break, I asked you what is 2018 look like pre and post the tax reform package and you said earnings were expected to be what in '18?CHADHA: So earnings -- we were at up 11 percent.BARTIROMO: And now?CHADHA: And now I would say earnings add another 12 percent. So earnings for the year are really going to be more like 23 percent.BARTIROMO: 23 percent gain in earnings for 2018.CHADHA: That is correct. But I would also, you know, quickly point out that if you think about S&P 500 earnings, and you know think about them really longer term, bigger picture, you know, there's a very, very, very clear trend line for the last eight years for most of this recovery because we had a variety of shocks something about we were speaking about earlier. You know kind of sitting basically close to the trend line, the shocks that goes below, we -- prior to tax reform, earnings were going to go up by 11 percent and would have sort of --BARTIROMO: Now they're going to go up 23 percent?CHADHA: And they're going to go well above the trend line, and that is what you know, equity analysts would call well above normalized levels and that means that when earnings are well above normalized levels, the market is going to put lower multiples. So I would argue that the -- you know, there is an 11 percent or 12 percent on earnings coming from the tax reform alone. But as a result, the multiple is going to go down a little bit. So the total market impact is about five or six percent and that's exactly the rise that you have from the 2,600 round number in November until the third week when the market began to focus very, very accurately on tax reform. So I would argue tax reform is fully braced in at the market level.MCDOWELL: But I don't think that people saw actions like what we're seeing from -- let's just point out what Maria said a short while ago Wal-Mart is the largest private employer in this country. There's already been about 130 companies, whether it was a JetBlue or Verizon or in AT&T, we're talking about hundreds of thousands of workers in this country that are getting bonuses if not running into several figures in this country. With Wal-Mart, for example, it's not just a thousand dollar bonus which I believe you need 20 years of service to get, it is raising, this is of raised its minimum pay to $10.00 an hour two years ago, now it is 11.Your average full-time worker at that company makes about $14.00 an hour. This is an incredible story because it is going to the point -- it looks like the estimate particularly like by the joint committee on taxation, all of the, oh, it's good, the tax reform is going to drive up the deficit, that's going to be a trillion-dollar. So the deficit -- those numbers as we suspected could very well be wrong, in terms of the economic impact, in terms of the impact -- the negative impact on our deficit because these companies are coming out and doing things with this money to help their workers -- the way that people did not anticipate.BARTIROMO: We haven't seen this -- we haven't seen this in years. I wouldn't disagree with that at all, I would argue that probably tax reform is facilitated and may be brought earlier what -- I would argue was going to happen anyway, keep in mind that we are now you know, starting in March the 9th that we will go into 10th year of this economic recovery.BARTIROMO: So you think -- was it 175 companies or you think 175 companies were going to win out a thousand dollar check?CHADHA: No, I think. It has been brought earlier but the labor market, you know, unemployment set four percent, listen to any company talking about its earnings and its made an issue any survey they will tell you it's a shortage of labor. So shortage of labor, so when you have a shortage of labor, you know, one of the things you do is bid up their compensation.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: You think they would have loosened their purse strings in terms of investments regardless because, you know, companies we know had been sitting on cash for eight years.CHADHA: It's definitely facilitated the timing given the series of announcements and that's, you know, positive, there's no question. But I would argue a lot of these would have happened anyway and we can --BARTIROMO: Not with the regulatory environment.MCSHANE: Whether we're set up for some sort of a sell-off in stocks, or just kind of a flattening out after these gains that we've seen. Get it right, you know.CHADHA: So on a sell-off, you know, the two or three really important things to keep in mind is the historical average behavior is that the S&P 500 tends to sell off by three to five percent every two to three months. We are currently into 15th month without a sell-off, this is the longest rally since world war II without --BARTIROMO: So why do you think that is?CHADHA: That is because --BARTIROMO: If it never happens, how can it be like that?CHADHA: So when I talk about it, people's eyes always glaze over because it's about something that happened this long time ago, in the summer of 2014. It drag and took interest rates negative in New York. the U.S. dollar shot up by 25 percent in nine months that is fastest rise in the U.S. dollar, oil prices consequently collapsed and we have been basically working through that shock and what it is really implied is that by the middle-late 2015, equity investors were positioned essentially ready for a recession.Now our call was the dollar shock would pass, it did. And so we have seen a strong, big rebound in growth and so equity positioning has gone from a low in the cycle prepared for recession to know what is a six-year high. So in terms of your question I want you to get a pullback, there are two necessary conditions in our view historically that have to be to be fulfilled. Number one is, long equity position and I would say that's a pretty big check today. The other is macro data surprises in growth which has been the biggest driver really of the rally.BARTIROMO: Well, they're talking about four percent growth for 2018.CHADHA: Yes. And so it shouldn't be a big pullback. So we're just talking about a return to normal of a three to five percent pullback which I would say given the 14 or 15-month rally people have just forgotten about.KEANE: You see the administration forecasting that we are going to have a growth economy and create obviously greater revenue sources for the U.S. Treasury. Is that going to take place in your judgment?CHADHA: Yes. I think basically we are set in this cycle for, you know, very strong growth late in the cycle, and that is historically very, very unusual. So you know, if I was to look at you know, historically periods when unemployment and labor market was tight and the items were 58 or 60 you would find that it happens, you know, much less than 5 percent of the time. So we are in sort of a unique circumstance, we are in a unique circumstance, for very good fundamental reasons we spoke about some of them. And so I would argue, you know, things have already get better anyway I mean things have already gotten a lot better.BARTIROMO: It sounds like you are going out of the way not to attribute any of this to Donald Trump.CHADHA: I think that it is just very early in terms of you know -- the tax and the deficit, I mean at the end of the day you know, what we are talking about actually, you know, very small aggregate numbers and so I wouldn't get too much into decimals. So keep in mind that, you know, in one sense I mean the way that we do U.S. budgeting relative to trend lines. And so we are talking basically about a one and a half trillion, you know, increase in the deficit over 10 years. It's a hundred and fifty billion a year, that is not a big number.BARTIROMO: Thank you. It's great to see you. Thanks so much.CHADHA: Yes. Thank you.BARTIROMO: Binky Chadha, Deutsche Bank. We will be right back.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: This is the end of it. This health care -- the debate on health care is like death. This is Armageddon. This is a very big deal. Because you know why? There's really a very hard way to come back from this.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Hard way to come back, Armageddon, death. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi described the tax plan as Armageddon back in that December sound bite, that was right before it passed. Of course, it's paying off huge for the American worker. The latest evidence is this morning, Wal- Mart announcing big plans followings tax reform. The retail giant planning to raise the minimum wage to $11.00 an hour, offering up to $1,000 bonus check for hourly workers. The company is also planning to expand maternity and parental leave benefits. Dagen, that's just a -- that's just one company.MCDOWELL: It's just one company, Wal-Mart in the United States, largest private employer in this country has roughly a million and a half workers in this country. Now, not all of them are going to get $1,000 bonuses. You got to work there for 20 years, you get that $1000 number but they are handing out bonuses to a large part of the workers there. But we've had more than 130 companies announced similar plans. You're looking at potentially a few million people getting checks from their employers because of tax reform. This is -- to Nancy Pelosi, she was acting like we were going to experience a plague of frogs that it was going to be -- a plague of locusts in this country. And this is where you get the messaging of we know this is going to hurt more people than it helps. No, it's not. Tell that to Wal-Mart's workers and AT&T's workers, and Verizon, and JetBlue -- shall I go on?BARTIROMO: American Airlines, Southwest Airlines. Look, do you think voters are going to remember these lies come November? I don't know. We'll see.MCDOWELL: Not when they're -- not when they're getting every week and seeing that they're making more money.BARTIROMO: Can you just keep spewing out lies and think that that's going to resonate with your base? Look, Futures this morning are pointing to a higher opening for the broader averages. Dow Industrials up 26. Technology certainly helping to drive this historic rally. Microsoft is at an all-time high. Joining us now, the host of "VARNEY & COMPANY," Stuart Varney. Stu, you're considering selling some Microsoft stock.STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: I know that's what I wanted to talk about, maybe sell some Microsoft and buy G.E. But I really want to follow up on this Wal-Mart discussion.BARTIROMO: Do it. Do it.VARNEY: And what the Democrats are going to do come November. If you watched "SPECIAL REPORT" last night with Bret Baier on the Fox News Channel, there was Senator Elizabeth Warren being interviewed on the subject of tax cuts. She launched into talking points about how it's just a giveaway to the billionaires and to the billion-dollar corporations, it's a terrible thing. And then, Bret said, well, what about that Massachusetts utility which is lowering the bills to its customers for gas and electricity because of the tax cut? She simply shrugged up, good for them. And then re-launched into the diatribe about billion-dollar corporations and billionaires getting all the benefits. Are they going to keep this up until November?BARTIROMO: I know.VARNEY: What are they going to say as you run up to the election and presumably they're going for a tax increase? I guess that's what they're looking for.BARTIROMO: Yes.VARNEY: And here you've got -- by our count, 2 million people in America who are going to get bonuses.BARTIROMO: Yes.VARNEY: All kinds of wage increases because of the tax cuts, I found it incredible. I don't know what they're going to do.BARTIROMO: Yes. I wonder if voters are going to hold their feet to the fire. Stuart, we'll see you in 10 minutes. Thank you. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Now, there's millions of dollars in jewels stolen in a spectacular heist at the famed Ritz Hotel in Paris. Cheryl Casone with the details. It sounds like a movie, Cheryl.CASONE: It really does, Maria. Police say a gang of five armed men -- masked men stormed the hotel through the side entrance then they smashed display windows of jewelry shops on the ground floor. Three have been arrested, two others remain at large. Some of the jewelry has been recovered, not all of it. Estimated value of what was stolen about $5 million. Several high-end jewelers in Paris have been hit in recent years: Cartier Harry, Winston, Chopard, Kim Kardashian-West lost millions' worth of jewelry back in October of 2016, you may remember.Well, rapper Drake and his business partner Brent Hocking are taking their Virginia Black whiskey public. But the Grammy Award-Winning platinum- selling artist is doing it in a very non-traditional way, crowdsourcing, Drake's massive fan. Individual investors will be able to buy into what the duo calls their mission to, quote, redefine whiskey. The focus is on high-rye content. Offering expected to start at the end of the first quarter of 2018. They're hoping to raise $30 million in their IPO.Then check this out, because this may be the mother of all drones we're going to show you. Boeing shot off a giant drone that can lift 500 pounds of cargo or the weight of two baby elephants. The prototype is going to be used to test its autonomous technology. The drone has already gone through the first round of testing at Boeing's research center in Missouri. Shares of Boeing getting a lift in the premarket up more than a percent.And over -- you're going to love this one, finally, is this shopper for real? On January 4th, a woman in California returned her Christmas tree to Costco, asked for a money back because it was dead. And guess what, she walked away, full refund, Maria, 10 days after Christmas.BARTIROMO: Wow.CASONE: People around, they were so appalled, they took pictures and posted on social media. And one woman wrote, quote, if I didn't see it, I wouldn't believe that someone has so little moral values or lack of conscience to return a dead tree.BARTIROMO: Wow. That's incredible. All right. Thanks, Cheryl. Stay with us. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Final thoughts from this all-star panel. General Jack Keane?KEANE: 2018, morning in America, taxes going down, wages up.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's what we're seeing. Connell?MCSHANE: Go with the General with that one.BARTIROMO: Me too.MCDOWELL: You get this.BARTIROMO: Great show, everybody. Thanks so much for being here. We'll see you tomorrow same time, same place. Here's Stuart Varney and "VARNEY & COMPANY." Stu?VARNEY: Always go with the General. He's a great guy.BARTIROMO: Exactly.VARNEY: OK. The pass-through movement, whoa, just moved into high gear. Wal-Mart joining the club.Load-Date: January 11, 2018End of Document

Q&A: How is the growth of bitcoin affecting the environment?Associated Press InternationalFebruary 11, 2018 Sunday 8:23 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 806 wordsByline: By PATRICK WHITTLE, Associated PressBodyThe growth of bitcoin is fueling speculation and debate about the environmental impact of the energy needed to power the virtual currency in the era of climate change. Some questions and answers about the issue:___WHAT IS BITCOIN?Bitcoin is the most popular virtual currency in the world, and it has fluctuated significantly in value over the past year. It was created in 2009 as a new way of paying for things that would not be subject to central banks that are capable of devaluing currency. The sustainability concerns about bitcoin, voiced by economists and environmentalists, stem from the process of "mining" that is central to its existence.The "miners" use computers to make complex calculations that verify transactions in bitcoins. This uses a tremendous amount of energy via computers and server farms all over the world, which has given rise to concerns about the amount of fossil fuel-dependent electricity used to power the computers. Some estimates say bitcoin's energy impact is more than that of a small country.___WHY IS BITCOIN ATTRACTIVE?Bitcoin is a kind of digital money that isn't tied to a bank or a government, and its value rose swiftly in the second half of 2017 before falling early this year. It's volatile. The value of one bitcoin was about $16,500 in late December 2017, compared with about $1,000 in March 2017, and then it dipped to about $7,700 in the first week of February this year. A bitcoin itself is essentially a line of computer code. It's signed digitally when it goes from one owner to another.___WHY ARE CRITICS CONCERNED ABOUT BITCOIN ENERGY USE?Bitcoin can't exist without computers, which can't exist without a source of electricity. And the number of computers and the energy needed to power them is rising.The growing value of bitcoin is directly tied to the amount of energy it uses. The miners unlock bitcoins by solving complex, unique puzzles. As the value of bitcoin goes up, the puzzles become increasingly more difficult, and it requires more computer power to solve them.Some estimates say more than 60 percent of the processing power used to mine bitcoin is in China, where it relies heavily on the burning of coal. The Chinese government revealed plans in January to shut down bitcoin mining, partly because of concerns about energy consumption.Coal and other fossil fuels are also the largest generator of electricity for the rest of the world, and coal is a significant contributor to manmade climate change. Burning it produces carbon dioxide, a gas that is a primary contributor to global warming.This reliance on fossil fuels has given rise to speculation that bitcoin's energy consumption will continue to rise as it grows in popularity.___HOW MUCH DOES BITCOIN REALLY AFFECT ENERGY CONSUMPTION?Estimates vary, and a true figure could be impossible to come by because of the intentionally anonymous nature of bitcoin use. But Dutch bitcoin analyst Alex de Vries, who operates a Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index on the website Digiconomist, has produced estimates he believes are alarming.If bitcoin miners are using the most efficient machines possible, the lowest amount of electricity they could possibly be using is 13 terawatt hours, de Vries said in an interview. That's about as much as the entire country of Slovenia. De Vries said less conservative estimates make it entirely possible that bitcoin is using as much energy as Ireland, which consumes about twice as much as Slovenia, or about 0.7 percent of the U.S. total.The problem is getting worse, said de Vries, who estimated the annual amount of energy consumed by bitcoin rose by a fifth in the final weeks of 2017.On the other hand, Oscar Lafarga, co-founder of a Fort Lauderdale, Florida, technology company that consults on cryptocurrency, said bitcoin's growth could spur interest in green energy."In a way, it could be the driving force for breakthroughs on renewable energy," he said.In Iceland, an abundance of renewable energy from geothermal and hydroelectric plants has helped spawn bitcoin mining.___WHO IS RIGHT IN THE BITCOIN DEBATE?The extent of bitcoin's impact on the environment, and how much that should matter to people who use it, is a source of debate.While de Vries says bitcoin is consuming an "insane amount of energy," both on its own and relative to older payment systems such as credit cards, others think the situation is not so dire.Bitcoin investor Marc Bevand, of St. Louis, has written that bitcoin likely uses close to four or five terawatt hours, less than the annual electricity consumption for Christmas lights in the U.S. He said that he believes bitcoin's benefits, such as making payments more efficient and helping people escape inflation, outweigh the environmental toll.However, he added: "We don't have exact data to say how much we are benefiting from bitcoin."Load-Date: February 12, 2018End of Document

IN MEMORIAM: ESMOND BRADLEY-MARTIN, IVORY TRADE RESEARCHER, IS KILLED IN KENYAStates News ServiceFebruary 5, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 528 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: BRUSSELS, Belgium BodyThe following information was released by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP):of the world's leading researchers into the illegal ivory and rhino horn trade was found dead at his Nairobi home on Sunday, multiple news outlets reported.Esmond Bradley-Martin, a 75-year-old American citizen, had worked for decades researching the markets for wildlife products across Africa and Asia, most recently in Myanmar. He had once served as the UN Special Envoy on rhino conservation."Esmond was known for absolute rigour and painstaking precision in his methodology and reporting," said Lisa Rolls, who leads UN Environment's Wild for Life campaign. "He was always willing to lend his decades of expertise to explore approaches to tackling the illegal wildlife trade with complete objectivity. Esmond's commitment to securing a future for wild rhinos and elephants was steadfast. To lose such a gentle and wise conservationist in this way is a shocking tragedy."Bradley-Martin's meticulous work on the dynamics of illegal wildlife markets provided provided countries - including China - with the hard data they needed to shut those markets down. His research also informed many of the decisions of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, a global agreement that regulates trade in wildlife products.His research, most of which was published by conservation group Save the Elephants, included a 2017 report that found that the Lao People's Democratic Republic was home to the world's fastest-growing retail market for ivory, as well as a 2016 study that detailed how demand for ivory in Viet Nam was threatening elephants in Africa.Bradley-Martin dedicated his life to investigating the trade in wildlife products, including rhino horn. (Source: Shutterstock)"Esmond has been at the forefront of rhino horn and ivory trade research issues, gleaning much valuable information on both legal and illegal trade," said UN Environment's Maxwell Gomera. "Very few knew much about these issues better than Esmond. Even fewer have pursued these issues with such dedication and commitment. The fight to save wildlife has lost one of its most committed soldiers."Conservationist Paula Kahumbu described Bradley-Martin as "a global authority on ivory and rhino horn trafficking", adding that he was "at the forefront of exposing the scale of ivory markets in USA, Congo, Nigeria, Angola, China, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Laos and recently Myanmar."Iain Douglas-Hamilton, the founder of Save The Elephants, paid tribute to his longtime friend and colleague: "Esmond was one of conservation's great unsung heroes. His meticulous work into ivory and rhino horn markets was conducted often in some of the world's most remote and dangerous places and against intensely busy schedules that would have exhausted a man half his age... He played a key role in revealing the price of ivory in China had fallen prior to the Chinese Government committing to close its legal domestic market, and was working on important research on Myanmar when he died. He was my friend for 45 years and his loss is a terrible blow both personally and professionally."Load-Date: February 5, 2018End of Document

Wall Street has been wondering how Kroger would respond. In November, the 2,800-store Kroger announced it would roll out an apparel line. Then, earlier this month, according to Forbes, the Cincinnati chain was engaged in talks with Boxed.com - an online retailer some have called the Costco for millennials. But a hook-up with Alibaba could be Kroger's boldest move yet.Read more at nypost.comKeep reading:Kroger Working With Edgewater Wireless To Power Smart Retail TechKroger Will Expand Its Simple Truth Lines To 'Align With Customer Trends'Kroger Opens 1,000th ClickList Store In Milford, OhioThe post Recommended: To battle Amazon, Kroger Eyes Alibaba Alliance appeared first on            Shelby Report.Load-Date: January 29, 2018End of Document

How Generation Z, Social Media and Mobile Technology Are Transforming the Jewellery IndustryTargeted News ServiceMarch 7, 2018 Wednesday 6:55 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1057 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WANCHAI, Hong Kong BodyThe Hong Kong Trade Development Council issued the following news release:Among the events staged during the recently concluded HKTDC Hong Kong International Diamond, Gem and Pearl Show (27 February-3 March) and Hong Kong International Jewellery Show (1-5 March) was a panel discussion on the future of ethical business practices in the jewellery industry, organised by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC).Moderated by the Responsible Jewellery Council (RJC), an international not-for-profit standards and certification organisation, "The Role of Responsible Business Practice in the Future of the Jewellery Industry" featured moderator Edward Joyce, RJC's Business Development Director, along with Victor Chan, Hong Kong Jewellery & Jade Manufacturers Association Vice Chairman and Chairman of Continental Holdings Ltd; Dr Guido Grohmann, BV Schmuck + Uhren Managing Director; and Jonathan Kendall, Forevermark Senior Vice president and CIBJO Marketing and Education Commission President.Introducing RJC's work around the world, Mr Joyce said RJC is setting standards in the jewellery supply chain, from mining to retail, to strengthen consumer confidence in the jewellery trade. To date, RJC counts more than 1,000 members, 726 of which are certified, covering 455,136 employees, 8,887 business premises in 75 countries.In his welcoming remarks, Ken Lo, Chairman of the Hong Kong Jewellery & Jade Manufacturers Association noted that the Hong Kong body established links with the RJC in 2013, and became a member in 2015.Synthetic and Simulant Gems are the Biggest Threat to the IndustryThe panellists began discussions by identifying what they considered the biggest challenges in the industry. Mr Kendall said that synthetic and simulant gems are the biggest threat and will remain so in the future. He said that synthetic and simulant stones can infiltrate any part of the supply chain, that even one sale would be one too many. The industry has sought to tackle the problem, particularly during the last year, including by distributing testing machines to both manufacturers and retailers.Dr Gohmann said the biggest challenge for Germany's jewellery and watch industry is keeping up with European legislation and around the world that have a direct impact on their business. Dr Gohmann noted that the vast majority of jewellery businesses in Germany were small to medium-sized and lacked the manpower to keep abreast of legislation, particularly in the areas of data privacy and money-laundering. Dr Gohmann added that membership in a body such as RJC, which offers legal support, helps smaller companies to mitigate the problem.Mr Chan said that corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the jewellery industry in China was a challenge as the country still lacked formalised CSR initiatives that are found in the West. However, he added that CSR is becoming an important issue in China and is moving in the right direction, largely driven by consumers who want more sustainable suppliers. Mr Chan said that the environment is becoming a bigger policy concern for the Chinese government, but that given the country's size, it would be more effective for local industry bodies, with the help of RJC, to start their own initiatives.Employees are the Key Communication Bridge to Consumer on Responsible JewelleryThe panel also discussed promoting the importance of responsible jewellery manufacturing and retail to consumers, with Mr Chan noting that employees serve as the key communication channel. He said that when his company joined RJC, employees initially questioned the wisdom of the membership, but eventually saw the value of RJC's work after seeing improvements in standards and product quality. Mr Chan said that employees then started relaying directly to consumers their own experience with supply chain integrity.Mr Kendall said communicating responsible business practices is paramount amid greater consumer scrutiny of jewellery products. Mr Kendall added that consumers today want to know where stones are mined, cut and polished, a trend that the industry must embrace. Mobile phones have dramatically changed consumer behaviour, Mr Kendall said, creating a relationship between the consumer and the production pipeline that did not exist 10 or 15 years ago. To allay consumer concerns, cameras may eventually be brought into mines to document the process, allowing buyers to check on the gem's provenance and obtain immediate answers.Radical Transparency Becomes a Defining Issue in the Jewellery BusinessThe discussion wrapped up with a look towards the future and the most pressing challenges facing the jewellery industry, particularly as responsible business practices increasingly come to the fore. All of the panellists agreed that transparency, even radical transparency, would become a defining issue in the jewellery business.Mr Kendall said that the industry needs to start considering the purchasing behaviour of Generation Z, the post-millennial generation, who are currently aged 15 to 20 years old. Citing research by Forevermark, Mr Kendall said Generation Z exhibit a strong affinity to social media, are technologically sophisticated, strong communicators, risk-averse and have an interest in the environment, ethical business practices and the "greater good." These traits make it vitally important for the jewellery industry to adopt more ethical and transparent practices to satisfy the next generation of consumers, Mr Kendall said.Mr Chan echoed similar sentiments, adding that the world has become smaller with rapid improvements in the Internet and technology, which will lead consumers to seek more information, not only on jewellery but on all the products they buy.Dr Gohmann also agreed that the next generation of consumers will be more interested and invested in responsible business practices. He added that language and distance were no longer barriers to checking the supply chain. Dr Gohmann added that the industry need to be mindful that the dominance of social media meant that companies that fall foul of ethical behaviour will face huge problems within minutes due to viral boycotts on Twitter and Facebook.Contact: Agnes Wat, (852) 2584 4554, agnes.ky.wat@hktdc.org; Sunny Ng, (852) 2584 4357, sunny.sl.ng@hktdc.orgCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6192884 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: March 7, 2018End of Document

Retailers urge Trump not to increase tariffs on Chinese importsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 19, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 242 wordsBody Several major US retailers, including Wal-Mart Inc, Target Corp, Best Buy Co Inc. and Macy's Inc., sent a letter to President Donald Trump on Monday urging him not to impose heavy tariffs on products imported from China.  The Trump administration would be preparing tariffs against Chinese information technology, telecommunications and consumer products in an attempt to force changes in intellectual property and investment practices in Beijing.  Washington could impose more than 60 billion dollars in tariffs on goods ranging from electronics to clothing, footwear and toys.  "At the same time, we are concerned about the negative impact of corrective actions under section 301 of the Commercial Act that could have on working families in the United States," the letter said.  "Applying any broad-based additional fee as part of a Section 301 action could worsen this inequity and punish American working families with higher prices for basic household products, such as clothing, shoes, electronics and housing goods," he added.  Section 301 could allow Trump to impose unilateral tariffs on China in response to a US government conclusion that the Chinese violate intellectual property rules. The tariffs would not need congressional approval.  The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the letter.  The letter is the latest example of a growing division between the Trump administration and many businessmen for commercial policy. Load-Date: March 19, 2018End of Document

Marco Rubio throws Facebook under the bus for allowing Trump-linked firm to take 50 million users' information in massive data 'breach'Business Insider USMarch 18, 2018 Sunday 11:17 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 718 wordsByline: feedback@businessinsider.com,  (Michal Kranz)Highlight: Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida pointed to Facebook's size as a tech company and lamented its ability to play outside the rules.Body• Sen. Marco Rubio said he was "disturbed" by Facebook allowing Cambridge Analytica to collect the data of millions of unwitting users.• He suggested Facebook hasn't been forthcoming to Congressional investigators, and accused the company of acting like it is above the law.• The data firm is tied to the 2016 campaign of President Donald Trump, and is of interest to investigators in the Russia probe.Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida tore into Facebook on Sunday in response to allegations that the social media company had allowed a data firm that worked for President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign to harvest the data of 50 million users without their knowledge.Rubio told NBC's Chuck Todd that he was "disturbed" by the news, and criticized Facebook for behaving like they are above the law."Their growth has been a lot faster than perhaps their ability to mature institutionally from within on some of these challenges that they're facing," Rubio said on "Meet the Press." "I think another part about it is sometimes these companies grow so fast and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves that they start to think that perhaps they're above sort of the rules that apply to everybody else."On Friday, in response to the news, Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, the firm that had gained access to users' information during the 2016 campaign."Protecting people's information is at the heart of what we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook," a company statement read.But reports from The New York Times and            The Guardian found that Facebook may have been aware of Cambridge Analytica's access as early as in summer of 2016.Win McNamee/Getty ImagesRubio, who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told Todd that the tech company has not been as forthcoming with investigators as it should have been about what they knew when."I think we've learned that the hard way," Rubio said, referring to Facebook's lack of transparency. "Every time that we've spoken to them, it's kind of rolled out as more coming out."Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota demanded Facebook Mark Zuckerberg testify before Congress."This is a major breach that must be investigated. It's clear these platforms can't police themselves," she said on Twitter Saturday.Cambridge Analytica is a British company that was created by right-wing financier and hedge fund manager Robert Mercer, who was also until recently a major donor for the right-wing site Breitbart News. The company specializes in "psychographic" profiling that allows them to paint a picture of online users and then use this information to target them with political campaign ads.In addition to Trump's campaign, Cambridge Analytica was also highly active during the lead-up to Brexit in the UK in 2016, in which they helped the "leave" campaign garner a surprise victory.But the company has been tied to even more controversial operations - they have been implicated in a social media effort by the United Arab Emirates last year to link its rival Qatar to terrorism.The company's operations and ties to Trump are under continued scrutiny by investigators in the Russia probe, according to Vox.Rubio said he was "disturbed" by Facebook's lack of transparency, and the way its platform has been misused to manipulate people."I'm disturbed by that," he said. "I'm disturbed by the fact that Facebook has created filters to help the Chinese government censor. And they're begging to get back into China. There's a lot I'm disturbed about these things."Watch a clip of Rubio's interview below:NOW WATCH: This transgender activist and former Obama White House intern isn't backing down against TrumpSee Also:• Trump-linked firm Cambridge Analytica collected personal information from 50 million Facebook users without permission• Mark Zuckerberg called the idea that Facebook influenced the 2016 election 'crazy' - but the company has long touted its ability to impact politics around the world• Trump says he will wait for 'the facts' on Sergei Skripal poisoning before condemning RussiaSEE ALSO: Facebook and its executives are getting destroyed after botching the handling of a massive data 'breach'DON'T MISS: Trump-linked firm Cambridge Analytica collected personal information from 50 million Facebook users without permissionLoad-Date: February 11, 2019End of Document

U.S. INTERNATIONAL MEDIA'S APPROACH ALIGNS WITH NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGYStates News ServiceMarch 14, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 442 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG):The 2018-2022 Strategic Plan for the Broadcasting Board of Governors will advance America's national interests and work in tandem with the Administration's National Security Strategy, according to BBG Chief Executive Officer and Director John F. Lansing. The strategic plan, entitled Information Matters: Impact and Agility in U.S. International Media, was presented to the Board during its March 14 meeting in Washington, D.C."This plan is a comprehensive roadmap for moving the Agency forward in the next five years, including significantly increasing our audience reach," Lansing told the Board. "While we are an independent agency, we have chosen to align the plan with the Administration's National Security Strategy, and it supports President Trump's management priorities of effectiveness, efficiency, and accountability."The plan also incorporates the five priority initiatives that Lansing has outlined for the Agency: focusing on key issues and audiences, maximizing program delivery agility, enhancing strategic cooperation between networks, improving accountability and impact measurement, and targeting public-private partnerships.At Lansing's invitation, each of the five BBG networks gave examples of how they are operationalizing the plan. Voice of America Director Amanda Bennett debuted a new show called Plugged In With Greta Van Susteren that examines various aspects of United States policy by interviewing policy makers and discussions with opinion shapers. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty President Tom Kent described the network's projects on countering violent extremism in Central Asia and the Balkans, as well as its ongoing coverage of Russia's upcoming election. Office of Cuba Broadcasting Acting Director Andre Mendes presented the latest operational improvements to getting Radio and Television Marti's content and programming on the island. Middle East Broadcasting Networks President Alberto Fernandez previewed two new programs set to launch on Alhurra.Radio Free Asia President Libby Liu discussed the increased use of artificial intelligence and machine learning by the Chinese government to track dissidents, and in particular, China's detention of close relatives of six U.S.-based reporters for RFA's Uyghur Service in apparent retaliation for their coverage of the Xinjiang region. This action against RFA's journalists was among other recent threats to BBG journalists highlighted by the Chairman of the Board, Kenneth Weinstein, as part of his opening remarks.WHEN: 1:00 p.m.,March 14, 2018WHERE: BBG HeadquartersWashington, D.C.Load-Date: March 16, 2018End of Document

Unconventional PedagogyThe Dartmouth: Dartmouth CollegeFebruary 28, 2018 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: MIRROR; Pg. 1Length: 880 wordsByline: Alice ZhangBody"I think people should try to take advantages of courses ... that are kind of project-focused and hands-on" Michael Harteveldt '19, a government and Chinese major, said.Harteveldt has taken Chinese 62.01, "Chinese Calligraphy," which was centered on completing projects and experimental practice in calligraphy."It definitely was a very unique class," he said. "The final projects and the midterm projects were all ... working up to a specific character that you were perfecting. It was a very cool way of assessment."He stated that one of his favorite parts of the class was the hands-on instruction that Asian and Middle Eastern languages and literatures professor Wen Xing provided, which eventually helped Harteveldt place parts of Chinese culture into context during his language study abroad program in Beijing.Another class that incorporates unique teaching methods is Economics 70, "Immersion Experience in Applied Economics and Policy," which Amanda Sload '19 previously took.."The idea was for us to study the transformation of Poland from under communism to a market economy," she said. "We did some general work on transition economies and different kinds of economies. [However], we focused more on Poland itself."Halfway through the term, students in Econ 70 split into groups of four and started research projects about the successes and challenges of the economic transition."To be able to then go to Poland and talk to real people about these issues and to see where they were happening really made things real for us," she said. "I think that our conclusions changed dramatically because seeing the context just really helps you understand."Sload noted the possibility of hearing from conflicting narratives from the people her group talked to."It didn't present necessarily a single picture, because obviously people are different," Sload said. "But it really helped us understand the complexity of what we've been studying and helped us see more of the nuance."Vibhor Khanna '19 is another student who has taken Econ 70. Unlike Sload's class, Khanna's class focused on China's economy. Khanna's class traveled to the Szechuan province of China, where students talked to officials and learned about economics in a communist regime. In addition, he talked to people who had lived through China's Cultural Revolution during the mid- to late-twentieth century and learned more about their experiences."I learned things ... that I definitely wouldn't have learned by reading a textbook," Khanna said.Environmental Studies 11, "Humans and Nature in America," which is currently being taught by professor Terry Osborne, aims to establish a greater understanding of humans' relationship with nature and help students understand their personal relationships with nature.Students evaluate the themes related to humans and nature in America in texts like the journals of Meriwether Lewis and William Clark and novels by award-winning author Toni Morrison. They then apply these concepts into their own experiences in nature during class walks in campus' own College Park. There, students are encouraged to contemplate on their experiences in the thematic context. Previous ENVS 11 classes have required students to write a report on the now-defunct proposal to build residential halls in College Park with these themes and their personal experiences in mind.Jessica Kittelberger '18, who is currently taking ENVS 11, has taken many classes that incorporate experiential learning."For me, I had never gone to the College Park area so there was a spatial aspect as well as getting to know a place on a perceptual level," she said. "I was able to get to know to this place better than any textbook could offer."For Kittelberger, the connection to nature and the deeper levels of analysis and self-reflection she gained from this course was something that was only attained through complete immersion with the material.Computer Science 22, "3D Digital Modeling" is yet another class that requires full engagement with the assignments."[Computer Science professor Lorie Loeb] gives us tutorials on how to use certain tools and what they would be good for, [but] it's up to us to decide what tools to use for our own models and how to use them to create our objects," Aritrika Malakar '21 said. "The class is very hands-on because we mostly work in the lab, modeling ... the class is innovative because we get to design rooms, objects and characters to model and then we have to figure out effective ways to model them using a software program."Malakar said that by being pushed to figure out concepts for herself, she is able to better understand the concepts.The students in these four courses tended to agree that providing a kinesthetic experience improves their understanding of their respective subjects. Not only can it add further dimensions to their education, but it also allows students to internalize and apply their learnings to the world. As Hanlon said, this innovation "will prove an essential part of a liberal arts education.""It is one thing to read an article or listen to a lecture," Kittelberger said. "But actually going to a place and seeing a process, event or actively [learning] in the given environment does so much more cognitively and emotionally."Load-Date: February 28, 2018End of Document

Among those found to have used the service are four NYU Tisch School of the Arts alumni.The Florida-based company, Devumi, sells amplification bots programmed to promote their clients' social media presences by following, retweeting and liking their tweets. The fake profiles are constructed using the names, photos, bios, hometowns and other personal details of real Twitter users.The NYU Tisch alumni who used Devumi's services included "Scandal" actress Katie Lowes; comedian, filmmaker and director John Leguizamo; "The Wire" actress Deirdre Lovejoy and Andrew McCarthy, an American actor known for his roles in 1980s films, such as "Pretty in Pink." According to CNBC, as many as 48 million Twitter accounts may be automated bots. That's about nine to 15 percent of all Twitter accounts.Although there are no explicit laws against the trade Devumi engages in, New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman opened an investigation into the company last Saturday, Jan. 27, citing concerns over fraud. Devumi claims on its website to be based in New York City."Impersonation and deception are illegal under New York [state] law," Schneiderman wrote on Twitter in response to the NYT expose. "We're opening an investigation into Devumi and its apparent sale of bots using stolen identities."Impersonation and deception are illegal under New York law. We're opening an investigation into Devumi and its apparent sale of bots using stolen identities. https://t.co/uvxGOp7soQ- Eric Schneiderman (@AGSchneiderman) January 27, 2018Devumi's founder German Calas has denied allegations that his company sold fake followers, has made over $2 million as of November 2017, providing over 200 million Twitter active followers to its customers according to the NYT investigation.The severity with which the act of buying fake Twitter followers is being treated may come as a surprise to Devumi's users and non-users alike, as many may consider it a victimless crime."Everyone does it," NYU Tisch graduate and actress Deirdre Lovejoy said in an interview with the NYT.The four NYU alumni did not respond to requests for comment on their use of Devumi.However, Twitter is a platform for people with a wide array of views. The number of followers a Twitter user attracts is often seen as a barometer for the popularity of their opinions.Justin Cappos, a professor of Computer Science at the Tandon School of Engineering who studies cybersecurity, sees the danger in the possibility of Twitter users with fringe views buying a high number of Twitter followers."It makes it possible for people with an agenda to push specific messages and make them seem more mainstream," Cappos said. Cappos argues that seeing a large number of retweets or followers can have a psychological effect on the way their message is perceived by the public.According to the NYT investigation, Devumi users include Millie Weaver, a reporter at InfoWars; Jacobin Magazine, a New-York-based socialist publication and China Xinhua News, a Chinese government-run press agency.And it's not just users with fringe views who buy Twitter followers on Devumi. Hilary Rosen, a Democratic political strategist and CNN commentator bought over half a million fake Twitter followers from Devumi, making more than a dozen purchases of followers over the span of two years, according to the NYT investigation.Even those famous for other pursuits may use their Twitter accounts to promote their political views. NYU dropout and Devumi user John Leguizamo frequently expresses his political views against Donald Trump on Twitter with Tweets like this: "Crazy trump is destroying our great country! One department and office and one amendment at a time!"Crazy trump is destroying our great country! One department and office and one amendment at a time! https://t.co/Nmim7Fbgzk- John Leguizamo (@JohnLeguizamo) February 1, 2018Fareeha Mahmood, a CAS freshman studying economics, said she saw reason to tolerate people using Devumi."If their intention is to ... advance a political cause that will help other people then I think it's okay," Mahmood said before quickly qualifying her statement with a pointed question. "Who's to judge whose intention is good and whose intention is bad? It's really messy."A version of this article appeared in the Monday, February 5th print edition.Email Sunanda Gaskins at [email protected]Load-Date: February 5, 2018End of Document

(NYSE: CF), the global leader in nitrogen products manufacturing and distribution, today announced results for its fourth quarter ended December31, 2017.Fourth Quarter Highlights• Net earnings of $465 million, or $1.98 per diluted share, which includes a net income tax benefit of $491million, or $2.09 per diluted share, as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act• Adjusted net loss(1) of $3 million or $0.02 per diluted share(1)• EBITDA(2) of $224 million; adjusted EBITDA(2) of $260 million• Sales volume of approximately 5.3 million tons, five percent higher than previous quarterly record• Reduced long-term debt by $1.1 billion, lowering annualized interest payments by $76 millionFull Year Highlights• Net earnings of $358 million, or $1.53 per diluted share, which includes a net income tax benefit of $491million, or $2.10 per diluted share, as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act• Adjusted net loss(1) of $59 million or $0.25 per diluted share(1)• EBITDA(2) of $856 million; adjusted EBITDA(2) of $969 million• Year-end 12-month rolling average recordable incident rate at lowest level in company's history• Record production volume of 10.3 million tons of gross ammonia• Record sales volumes of approximately 20 million product tonsImpact of U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs ActAs a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the company's fourth quarter 2017 net earnings of $1.98 per diluted share included a $2.09 per share net income tax benefit and for the full year 2017 net earnings of $1.53 per diluted share included a $2.10 per share net income tax benefit. The net income tax benefit is primarily comprised of a $552 million income tax benefit from a revaluation of the company's deferred taxes as a result of the new lower corporate tax rate and a $57 million income tax provision related to the transition tax on deferred foreign earnings. This is a one-time item that affects the comparability of results between periods, and accordingly has been excluded from adjusted net earnings per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA._________________________________________________________________________(1)See reconciliations of adjusted net (loss) earnings and adjusted net (loss) earnings per diluted share to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the tables accompanying this release.(2)EBITDA is defined as net earnings (loss) attributable to common stockholders plus interest expense-net, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. See reconciliations of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the tables accompanying this release.Overview of ResultsCF Industries Holdings, Inc., today announced fourth quarter 2017 net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $465million, or $1.98 per diluted share, and adjusted net loss of $3 million, or $0.02 per diluted share. Fourth quarter 2017 EBITDA was $224 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $260 million. These results compare to fourth quarter 2016 net loss attributable to common stockholders of $320 million, or $1.38 per diluted share; adjusted net loss for the fourth quarter 2016 of $90 million, or $0.39 per diluted share; EBITDA loss of $135 million; and adjusted EBITDA of $133million. Fourth quarter 2017 results include a realized loss on natural gas hedges of $13 million, compared to a realized loss on natural gas hedges of $5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.For the full year 2017, net earnings attributable to common stockholders was $358 million, or $1.53 per diluted share, and adjusted net loss was $59 million, or $0.25 per diluted share. Full year 2017 EBITDA was $856 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $969 million. These results compare to full year 2016 net loss attributable to common stockholders of $277 million, or $1.19 per diluted share; adjusted net earnings for full year 2016 of $109 million, or $0.47 per diluted share; EBITDA of $395 million; and adjusted EBITDA of $858 million. Full year 2017 results include a realized loss on natural gas hedges of $26 million, compared to a realized loss on natural gas hedges of $133million for full year 2016."Outstanding execution by the team in 2017 produced records for safe operations, production and sales volumes," said Tony Will, president and chief executive officer, CF Industries Holdings, Inc. "In addition, we paid down $1.1 billion in debt during the quarter and recently exercised our right to purchase all of the publicly traded common units of Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P. We estimate that full ownership of TNCLP would have added approximately $45 million to EBITDA, including anticipated cost reductions and network optimization benefits. Additionally, we estimate that full ownership of TNCLP and the debt reduction would have resulted in $110 million of additional free cash flow."Manufacturing OperationsCF Industries' manufacturing network continued its focus on safety and operated efficiently during the fourth quarter of 2017. As of December31, 2017, CF Industries' 12-month rolling average recordable incident rate was 0.67 incidents per 200,000 work hours, well below industry averages.Gross ammonia production during the fourth quarter of 2017 was more than 2.6million tons, the second highest volume for a quarter in the company's history.Sales OverviewNet sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased to $1,099million from $867 million in the same period last year due to higher sales volumes across most segments and higher average selling prices across all segments.Total sales volumes for the quarter were significantly higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 as the company's production increased at the Donaldsonville and Port Neal Nitrogen Complexes.Average selling prices for the quarter were higher year-over-year across all segments due largely to a tighter global nitrogen supply and demand balance. Additionally, average ammonia selling prices benefited from the commencement of delivery under a long-term supply agreement.The company's average selling price for ammonia was $285 per ton in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $277 per ton in the fourth quarter of 2016. The average selling price for urea was $244 per ton in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $214 per ton in the fourth quarter of 2016, and the average selling price for UAN was $150 per ton in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $149 per ton in the fourth quarter of 2016.Cost of sales per ton increased 10 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily driven by increased gas consumption to support the higher production and sales volumes and increased 11 percent for the full year 2017 compared to the full year 2016 for the same volume reasons.Controllable cost of sales, defined as non-gas cash costs (maintenance, labor, electricity, other raw materials, transportation and distribution, and other plant costs), which excludes the impact of natural gas, derivatives and depreciation and amortization, decreased 8 percent per ton,(3) in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 2016, and 14 percent per ton,(3) in the full year 2017, as a result of cost reduction initiatives and production efficiencies.In the fourth quarter of 2017, the average cost of natural gas reflected in the company's cost of sales was $3.24 per MMBtu, which includes a realized loss of $0.13 per MMBtu on natural gas hedges totaling $13 million. This compares to the average cost of natural gas in cost of sales of $3.24 per MMBtu for the fourth quarter of 2016, which included a realized loss of $0.06 per MMBtu on natural gas hedges totaling $5 million. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the average price of natural gas at Henry Hub in North America was $2.87 per MMBtu, and the average price of natural gas at the National Balancing Point in the United Kingdom was $6.92 per MMBtu.Additionally, the company recorded an unrealized net mark-to-market gain on natural gas derivatives of $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to an unrealized net mark-to-market gain on natural gas derivatives of $91million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The company did not enter into any additional natural gas derivatives in the fourth quarter of 2017._________________________________________________________________________(3)See reconciliation of controllable cost of sales and controllable cost of sales per ton to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the tables accompanying this release.Market OverviewCF management expects the combination of: a somewhat weaker U.S. dollar; higher energy costs in key producing regions; reduced production in China; higher oil and freight costs; and steady global demand to support nitrogen prices during the first half of 2018 at levels higher than the same period in 2017.The U.S. dollar is expected to remain lower against currencies in key nitrogen producing regions through at least the first half of the year, pushing up the cost of nitrogen fertilizer exports in U.S. dollar terms. From the beginning of July 2017 to the beginning of February 2018, the RMB strengthened against the dollar from approximately 6.8 to 6.3 and the Russian Ruble strengthened against the dollar from approximately 60 to 57.Additionally, energy prices since the middle of 2017 have increased significantly for marginal producers in Eastern Europe and China. From the beginning of July 2017 to the beginning of February 2018, the price of natural gas per MMBtu at TTF in Europe has increased approximately 25 percent and the cost of anthracite coal per metric ton in China has increased 29 percent. Over the same period, the price per MMBtu of natural gas at Henry Hub has increased less than three percent.Ocean freight costs have risen as well, adding cost to globally traded nitrogen. At the beginning of February, ocean freight to ship urea from the Arab Gulf to the Gulf of Mexico was 15 percent per ton higher than the year before and nearly 30 percent per ton higher than at the beginning of July 2017.These factors have accelerated the transformation of China's role in the global urea market. According to official government data, Chinese urea exports have declined approximately 65 percent in two years, from over 13 million metric tons in 2015 to approximately 4.7 million metric tons in 2017. Industry observers expect marginal producers in China to face continued pressures during 2018, not only from higher coal costs and currency impacts, but also from the effect of environmental regulation enforcement. These challenges are likely to further reduce Chinese net urea exports in 2018.India and Brazil will remain key countries for urea demand this year. Published reports and CF analysis suggest that India may require 500,000-1,000,000 metric tons of urea to be imported before the end of March to meet that country's fertilizer needs for 2018. Additionally, Brazil has emerged in recent years as the second largest importer of urea in the world, with imports of approximately 5.4 million metric tons in 2017, 15 percent higher than 2016 and 64 percent higher than 2012. Countries such as Australia, Mexico and Turkey have also significantly increased imports of urea in recent years.Imports of nitrogen will continue to be necessary to meet expected demand in North America in 2018 with the company projecting that approximately 91 million acres of corn will be planted in the United States. For much of 2017, nitrogen prices in the region discouraged imports. Urea barge prices at New Orleans averaged approximately $25 below international parity during the fourth quarter and only rose above international parity for one week in all of 2017. As a result, imports of urea and UAN from July through December declined 37 percent and 24 percent, respectively, compared to the same period in 2016. Given steady demand and higher netbacks available in other regions, nitrogen prices in North America will likely have to rise to attract the imports necessary to meet expected demand.Capital ExpendituresCapital expenditures in 2017 totaled $473 million. Of this amount, approximately $350 million was for new activities in 2017 and the remainder was for activities performed in 2016 but paid for in 2017. As of September 30, 2017, the company had $158 million in costs accrued but unpaid for work completed in 2016 related to capacity expansion projects. At December 31, 2017, these costs are no longer the subject of disputes and the company's capital expenditures for 2017 reflect all payments associated with these formerly disputed costs.Capital expenditures in 2018 for new activity are estimated to be in the range of approximately $400 to $450 million, which takes into account a higher number of plant turnarounds than in 2017.LiquidityAs of December31, 2017, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $835 million on the balance sheet, had no borrowings outstanding under its $750 million revolving credit facility and was in compliance with all applicable covenant requirements under its debt instruments.On December 1, 2017, the company completed the redemption of all of the $800 million outstanding principal amount of its 6.875% Senior Notes due May 2018. Additionally, on December 26, 2017, the company purchased $300 million aggregate principal amount of its 7.125% Senior Notes due 2020 pursuant to a tender offer. As a result, the aggregate principal amount of CF Industries Holdings, Inc.'s outstanding long-term indebtedness was approximately $4.75 billion at the end of 2017, compared to $5.85 billion at the end of 2016. At this level of gross debt, interest expense for 2018 would be approximately $230 million, or $76 million lower than 2017 on an annualized basis.Exercise of Right to Purchase All Publicly Traded Units of Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P.The company announced on February 7, 2018, that its wholly owned subsidiary Terra Nitrogen GP Inc. has elected to exercise its right to purchase all of the publicly traded common units of Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P. on April 2, 2018, for a cash purchase price of $84.033 per unit in accordance with the terms of TNCLP's partnership agreement. The purchase price of all of the publicly traded common units of TNCLP is approximately $390 million. The company intends to fund the purchase with cash on hand. As of the April 2, 2018, purchase date, all rights of the holders of the units will terminate, with the exception of the right to receive payment of the purchase price.CHS Inc. DistributionOn January 31, 2018, the Board of Managers of CF Industries Nitrogen, LLC (CFN) approved a semi-annual distribution payment to CHS Inc. (CHS) of $49 million for the distribution period ended December 31, 2017. The distribution was paid on January 31, 2018.The total distribution to CHS pertaining to 2017 was approximately $108 million.Consolidated ResultsThree months endedYear endedDecember 31,December 31,2017201620172016(dollars in millions, except per share and per MMBtu amounts)Net sales$1,099$867$4,130$3,685Cost of sales9567733,7002,845Gross margin$143$94$430$840Gross margin percentage13.0%10.8%10.4%22.8%Net earnings (loss) attributable to common stockholders$465$(320)$358$(277)Adjusted net (loss) earnings(1)$(3)$(90)$(59)$109Net earnings (loss) per diluted share$1.98$(1.38)$1.53$(1.19)Adjusted net (loss) earnings per diluted share(1)$(0.02)$(0.39)$(0.25)$0.47EBITDA(1)$224$(135)$856$395Adjusted EBITDA(1)$260$133$969$858Tons of product sold (000s)5,2844,68319,95216,957Supplemental data (per MMBtu):Natural gas costs in cost of sales(2)$3.11$3.18$3.33$2.61Realized derivatives loss in cost of sales(3)0.130.060.070.46Cost of natural gas in cost of sales$3.24$3.24$3.40$3.07Average daily market price of natural gas (per MMBtu):Henry Hub$2.87$2.99$2.96$2.48National Balancing Point UK$6.92$5.69$5.80$4.66Unrealized net mark-to-market (gain) loss on natural gas derivatives$(3)$(91)$61$(260)Depreciation and amortization$235$203$883$678Capital expenditures$183$392$473$2,211Production volume by product tons (000s):Ammonia(4)2,6422,32610,2958,307Granular urea1,1229144,4513,368UAN (32%)1,8921,7956,9146,698AN5555532,1271,845_______________________________________________________________________________(1)See reconciliations of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net (loss) earnings and adjusted net (loss) earnings per diluted share to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the tables accompanying this release.(2)Includes the cost of natural gas that is included in cost of sales during the period under the first-in, first-out inventory cost method.(3)Includes realized gains and losses on natural gas derivatives settled during the period.

See "Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures" in this release.Comparison of 2017 to 2016 fourth quarter periods:• Ammonia sales volume increased for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 due to additional production volume from the company's Donaldsonville and Port Neal Nitrogen Complexes and increased demand for fall agricultural applications.• Ammonia average selling prices increased primarily due to the impact of a tighter global nitrogen supply and demand balance. Additionally, ammonia selling prices benefited from the commencement of delivery under a long-term supply agreement.• Ammonia gross margin per ton increased in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 due to the absence of start-up expenses incurred in the fourth quarter of 2016 associated with the new Port Neal ammonia plant, production efficiencies due to increased volumes and higher average selling prices. These were partially offset by a $30 million lower unrealized mark-to-market gain on natural gas derivatives compared to the prior year period and an increase in realized natural gas costs.Granular Urea SegmentCF Industries' granular urea segment produces granular urea, which contains 46 percent nitrogen. Produced from ammonia and carbon dioxide, it has the highest nitrogen content of any of the company's solid nitrogen products.Three months endedYear endedDecember 31,December 31,2017201620172016(dollars in millions, except per ton amounts)Net sales$246$189$971$831Cost of sales188139856584Gross margin$58$50$115$247Gross margin percentage23.6%26.5%11.8%29.7%Sales volume by product tons (000s)1,0088834,3573,597Sales volume by nutrient tons (000s)(1)4634062,0041,654Average selling price per product ton$244$214$223$231Average selling price per nutrient ton(1)531466485502Gross margin per product ton$58$57$26$69Gross margin per nutrient ton(1)12512357149Adjusted gross margin(2):Gross margin$58$50$115$247Depreciation and amortization5937246112Unrealized net mark-to-market (gain) loss on natural gas derivatives(1)(23)16(67)Adjusted gross margin$116$64$377$292Adjusted gross margin as a percent of net sales47.2%33.9%38.8%35.1%_______________________________________________________________________________(1)Nutrient tons represent the tons of nitrogen within the product tons.(2)Adjusted gross margin and adjusted gross margin as a percent of net sales are non-GAAP financial measures.

TOP HUMAN RIGHTS LAWYER STRIPPED OF LICENSE IN CHINA'S GUANGDONGStates News ServiceJanuary 23, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 581 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Authorities in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong have revoked the business license of rights lawyer Sui Muqing after he ignored official warnings not to take on so many politically sensitive cases.Sui, who has defended high-profile activists including Sichuan-based rights activist Huang Qi and Guangdong-based legal advocate Guo Feixiong, told RFA that he had received a visit from two officials from the Guangdong provincial government justice department on Tuesday ."Their names were Chen Wuming and Chen Huaying from the provincial justice department, and they came at around 11.00 a.m. and announced to me that my license was being revoked as a punishment," Sui said."I had already said I wanted a hearing, but they suddenly produced this [document]," he said.Sui said the decision was likely the result of a series of actions on his part, rather than a particular case."This has been a cumulative process, and the [ruling Chinese Communist] Party and government are unhappy with me, because I didn't cut back on the number of human rights cases I represented after my license was renewed in the wake of the July 2015 crackdown," Sui said."I think this is why they hate me so much."He said the decision to terminate his license was likely the result of a series of cases."There are a large number of factors at play, and I think it's just a case of the straw that broke the camel's back," Sui said.An official who answered the phone at the Guangdong provincial government justice department declined to comment when contacted by RFA on Tuesday .Beijing-based rights lawyer Lin Qilei said a large number of rights lawyers had been denied a business license during annual reviews following the July 2015 crackdown, which saw more than 300 lawyers, law firm staff and rights activists detained, questioned, jailed, or placed under surveillance and travel bans along with their families."The government is starting to use the justice departments and the Lawyers' Associations instead of criminal proceedings now, to target the legal profession," Lin said. "They are revoking the licenses of human rights lawyers; this is becoming a trend in all provinces now.""The revoking of licenses is their way of punishing certain human rights lawyers who are very active," he said.Last September, authorities in the eastern province of Shandong revoked the business license of lawyer Zhu Shengwu, to practice after he defended social media user Wang Jiangfeng, who was jailed for two years after he called President Xi Jinping by a forbidden nickname -- "steamed buns" -- in an online post."It is very clear that this sanction imposed on Sui Muqing is a form of persecution, oppression and [political] revenge," Zhu told RFA. "This is definitely a sanction used against human rights lawyers, and likely has to do with the large number of sensitive cases that Sui Muqing has worked on."Fellow Beijing rights lawyer Ding Jiaxi said the revoking of lawyers' license was intended to send a political signal to other rights lawyers."They are warning lawyers that they shouldn't speak out on behalf of prisoners of conscience," Ding said. "Basically, if you want to function as a lawyer in this system, you have to be a tool of the regime; and collude in the persecution of its victims."Reported by Ng Yik-tung and Sing Man for RFA's Cantonese Service, and by Yang Fan for the Mandarin Service.

Dow Jones loses more than 250 points in half session for new concern to a trade warCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 14, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 254 wordsBody The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down more than 250 points on Wednesday as manufacturers continued to suffer from concerns about the impact of the new trade tariffs.  Boeing's 4.5% decline was responsible for about 100 lopset points in the exclusive index, while traders attributed the continued fall to Tuesday's reports that US President Donald Trump could impose tariffs of up to 60 billion of dollars to Chinese imports.  The Trump government is pressing China to reduce its trade surplus with the United States by $ 100 billion, a White House spokeswoman said on Wednesday.  At 15:57 GMT, the Dow Jones lost 256.69 points, or 1.03%, to 24,752.97 units; the S & P 500 index dropped 13.01 points, or 0.49%, to 2,751.47 units; and the Nasdaq composite index dropped 25.46 points, or 0.34%, to 7,485.99 units.  The main manufacturers have been hardest hit by Trump's announcement of import duties on steel and aluminum earlier this month.  This issue overshadowed the report that indicated that China's manufacturing output expanded faster than expected at the beginning of the year, suggesting that the world's second largest economy may be picking up speed.  The third consecutive monthly decline in retail sales in the United States pointed to a slowdown in economic growth, but cooled concerns about the possibility that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at a faster rate in 2018.  Financial stocks were down 0.85%, in line with the decline in yields on US Treasury bonds following weak retail data.  erp Load-Date: March 14, 2018End of Document
